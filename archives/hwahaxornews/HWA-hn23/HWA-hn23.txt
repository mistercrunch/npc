   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same

        distinctive symbol of living in The Most Important Place on
        Earth. But starting Thursday, some of them are going to have
        to adjust to life without 212, when Bell Atlantic begins
        issuing 646 area codes to new phone subscribers in
        Manhattan. The move, necessitated by too many phone numbers,
        is not going down too well, although former New York Mayor
        Ed Koch expects the grousing to stop after an adjustment
        period. Besides, residents of Gotham will still hold on to
        all the other perks that make living there such a joy:

       Dark Modem DOWN For Emergency ACTION
       
       
       OK, two issues: 1) the following message has been sent to a TARGETED
       audience. We have walked a thin line between targeted mailing and spam. If
       we get even one complaint, we will stop. 2) It cannot be confirmed that any
       unusual activity has occurred on the antionline network in the past 24 hours
       *grin* therefore we have taken that statement out of the message.
       
       
       Again, we do NOT advocate spamming, we only want people who might be
       interested in this issue to be aware, so use DISCRETION when sending any
       mail.
       
       
       This is an emergency email message from Dark Modem
       (http://www.darkmodem.org). Yesterday (June 30, 1999), Packet Storm Security
       was taken offline after John Vranesevich sent an email to Harvard University
       about the JP section that was on the site. Some suspect it was really
       jealousy and animosity toward Ken Williams that drove JP to commit this
       offensive act. Packet Storm was in direct competition with antionline and
       essentially blew antionline out of the water in every category. It is this
       author's belief, therefore, that JP was trying to protect his "marketshare"
       (something that Ken Williams would never have done, since he was not in it
       for money).
       
       
       Please show your support by mentioning this topic on your website,
       forwarding this email to "whom it may concern", and sending email in support
       of Ken and PSS to Harvard and antionline.

 AA.A AntiOnline's JP causes the plug to be pulled on PacketStorm by Harvard
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
       June 30th AM a Call from John Vranesevich (aka JP) of AntiOnline to
       Harvard started off an avalanche of events that culminated in the 
       plug being pulled at packetstorm.harvard.edu. Along with personal data
       it was initially reported that the entire site was lost, this may now
       not be the case. Included here are statements from JP, Harvard, Ken 
       Williams and stories from Attrition.org, HNN (http://www.hackernews.com)
       and other sources.... read the sordid story below - Ed
       
      
      
       (At this time it is uncertain wether Ken does or does not have backups of
        his PacketStorm site available to him but some people on the net have 
        taken it upon themselves to begin a new mirror and are calling for people
        that have downloaded from the site to re-upload the files to the following

       Hi,
       
       
       I just got off the phone (6/30/99 PM) with one of the Harvard 
       Network managers.  John Vranesevich, of www.AntiOnline.com, 
       contacted Harvard this morning and threatened to sue them 
       because of the content in the jp/ directory of the Packet 
       Storm Security web site that was located at 
       http://packetstorm.harvard.edu, and before that at 
       http://packetstorm.genocide2600.com (see www.attrition.org 
       for details about this info).  I was told that the situation 
       quickly escalated to the Harvard Office of General Counsel.  
       John Vranesevich claims that I was using the server as a 
       platform to harass and threaten him, his family, and his 
       business.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I ran
       a network security related web site and archive!
       
       The result:  the server and the web site and it's contents
       are permanently offline, I have no access to even retrieve
       anything off of the server, the site known as "Packet Storm 
       Security" is history now.  I was told by Leo Donnelly at 
       Harvard, via phone, that ALL of the content AND the backups 
       made are either destroyed, being destroyed now, or will be 
       before I can do anything to prevent it.  All 4+ GB of files
       in the publicly accessible directories, over 45,000 files 
       collected and archived over the years, are gone.  There was 
       another 4 GB that was composed of research data, customized
       IDS, Linux, Apache software, etc too.
       
       Harvard is facing a lawsuit from JP, I am facing a lawsuit
       from JP, and possibly some sort of legal action from Harvard.
       Harvard seems to be trying to free themselves of any liability, 
       and use me as the fall guy for this whole thing.  All 
       agreements with Harvard in the beginning were verbal (with 
       Jeff Gray, the senior sysadmin), so I've got nothing on paper 
       to back up the truth.  I've got emails, but I don't have the
       money or legal defense to counter Harvard, or anybody else for 
       that matter.
       
       This has turned really ugly, really quickly, and it is very 
       plausible that I will be facing charges involving "hacking" 
       or computer crimes of some sort, because I "never had a 
       Harvard ID, and thus was not authorized to use their
       facilities", and I "compromised their security."  I guess it
       doesn't matter that I was contacted by the Senior Sysadmin at
       Harvard and invited to move my site there.  It doesn't matter 
       that the head of Harvard UIS approved of everything.  It 
       doesn't matter that he placed the box on a subnet of his 
       choosing and called me and gave me the root password and told 
       me I had free rein on the box.  It doesn't matter that 
       Harvard network security was never actually compromised.  
       For the record, Jeff Gray, the Harvard senior sysadmin, has 
       been extremely supportive of my site and work from the 
       beginning, and he deserves ALOT of credit for going out of 
       his way to help keep Packet Storm Security alive and online.  
       In fact, Jeff Gray has provided so much support for "the 
       security community" in general, and is so supportive of 
       security-related research and projects, that he deserves all 
       the credit in the world for his efforts.  I hope Harvard
       gives him the credit he is due, because any network security
       they have is in large part due to his skills, devotion, and 
       diligence.
       
       If that's not enough to annoy me, all of my class work for 
       the class I'm taking at NCSU this summer (CSC499 Independent 
       Research project involving IDS) is/was on that server at 
       Harvard and gone now too.  With 4 weeks left in the semester 
       here at NCSU, I have just lost seven weeks of work and data 
       that cannot be replaced in 4 weeks.  
       
       What bothers me the most is that all of the countless hours I
       put into that web site and the archives, thousands of hours,
       are gone now, for good.
       
       The site was getting over 400,000 hits/day and doing about
       10 GB/day in transfers, so I don't see it coming back online
       even if I do get any of the site content back.
       
       Obviously, I have taken full responsibility for the site
       content and all activities and events associated with that 
       server.  Even though no laws or rules were broken, on my part,
       and to my knowledge, I am now facing possible legal action 
       from both JP and Harvard, and state/federal computer crime 
       charges as well.  
       
       What am I going to do now?  I don't know.  The web site I
       devoted most of my waking hours to is gone.  My chances of
       passing my CSC499 class do not look good, according to the 
       negative comments from my professor.  I'll try to salvage
       the summer's worth of course work anyway if possible and pass.  
       
       Until formal charges are filed, I've still got my job and 
       account here at NCSU.  When NCSU catches wind of this, and 
       I'm sure they will, my account probably will be permanently 
       revoked, and my job and the past three years of school will 
       then be gone too.  Until then, I can be contacted at the email 
       address in the sig below.
       
       Check out the news and history of John Vranesevich and 
       Carolyn Meinel's smear and harassment campaigns that have ruined 
       the careers and lives of many people, mine included. 
       www.attrition.org has all of the details.
       
       Funny how I spent the past few years donating my time, literally
       thousands and thousands of hours, to "the security community", 
       never asking for or making a single penny off the time and work 
       I invested, and have now lost it all because John Vranesevich 
       and a few of his IRC friends are able to make quick phone calls, 
       fabricate absurd stories about criminal activity, libel, threaten 
       to sue Harvard, and I don't even get to plead my case.  I am 
       guilty without even being informed of what was going on.
        
       He has effectively ruined years of my work, my education, my 
       career, my life.  
       
       There are really only four things that I'd like right now:
       
       1. Justice
       2. Truth
       3. The 3 GB of MY data that Harvard has and refuses to turn 
          over to me
       4. A job in the IT/IS/IW industries - the pay doesn't even matter,
          I'm willing to move, I'm willing to put in 60-80 hour weeks.
          Just give me a UNIX or Linux box to work from.
       
       I'll settle for just the job though, and like I said, the pay 
       doesn't matter - I love computers, network security, and systems 
       administration.  If I was not doing it for pay, I'd be doing it 
       for free.
       
       See you at BlackHat and DEFCON.
       
       take it easy,

       Net Thug Shuts Down Largest Free Security Site
       Wed Jun 30 16:36:10 MDT 1999
       ATTRITION Staff
       
       Earlier today, the PacketStorm Security site was abruptly shut down
       with no warning. PacketStorm (packetstorm.harvard.edu)
       was one of the largest and most respected sites catering to security
       professionals worldwide. Boasting an average of 400,000 hits a day,
       pushing out roughly 10 gigs of traffic, the site was a valuable resource 
       to an estimated 10,000 security professionals world wide.
       
       The security resource did not suffer at the hands of hackers or 
       network intruders. Instead, a new kind of malicious criminal found 
       success through a fear that haunts more and more Americans today.
       A single piece of email from John Vranesevich (founder of AntiOnline)
       to the educational institution hosting Packetstorm threatened a lawsuit if 
       the site was not shut down. Harvard said there were "numerous" complaints,
       but provided no additional details.
       
       Like most US institutions, the idea of being dragged to court for any 
       reason is enough to scare them into hasty action. With that mail, 
       Harvard pulled the plug. This decision was no doubt made as an easy 
       alternative to spending time and resources  fighting the claims.
       
       Email from Ken Williams, primary administrator for the site, to Attrition
       staff indicated that not only did Harvard shut down the site, they denied 
       him access to the machine and all information stored on it. The correspondance
       noted the likelihood that all information on the machine, and all
       backups would be destroyed in order to avoid the AntiOnline lawsuit.
       "All of the content and the backups made are either destroyed, being
       destroyed now, or will be before I can do anything to prevent it." said
       PacketStorm founder Ken Williams.
       
       Williams went on to say that he does not fear any fraudulent lawsuit
       Vranesevich could attempt to level at him. The information contained
       on the site regarding Vranesevich was not in violation of any US law
       that he was aware of, and had been there for over a year. Along with
       the security site, months of William's own school work was lost. 
       "I have just lost seven weeks of [class] work and data that cannot be 
       replaced in 4 weeks." Williams said, referring to deadlines on the
       school work.
       
               "What bothers me the most is that all 
                of the countless hours I put into
                that web site and the archives, thousands 
                of hours, are gone now, for good."
                       - Ken Williams, PacketStorm founder
       
       These vague and unfounded legal threats only serve to hurt the security
       community. AntiOnline's mission statement claims they exist "to educate
       the public on computer security related issues." Apparently, this
       mission statement forgot to include such things like "educate the public
       through OUR site only" and "as long as we profit from it".
       
       
       ***************************************************************************
             
       JP has since offered this news:
       http://www.antionline.com/archives/editorials/packetstorm.html
       
       ( Likely suffering major DoS attacks in result of their actions I was unable
         to get thru to the site to read their shit for posting here...they will burn
         in hell for this action - Ed )
       
       
       Ok I cut thru the cruft, here's JP's 'story';
       
       PacketStorm Is Shut Down
       An AntiOnline Editorial
       Thursday , July 01 1999
       
       Apparently for some time now, PacketStorm Security, a popular underground collection of security related tools and information, has been maintaining a vast archive of
       materials about AntiOnline. These materials included entire stories, copies of the weekly mailbag, e-mails, and other materials copyrighted by AntiOnline LLP.
       
       On top of that, and what was far more serious, the site contained dozens and dozens of items which included: e-mails, messages, documents, images, and even public
       surveys. These materials were libelous, and in some cases, were blatant threats against members of my immediate family, myself, and my company.
       
       While I value the right to free speech as much, if not more, than the average American, I do not believe in individuals posting threatening and harassing documents about
       another individual, and their family members. It was for this reason, and no other, that I contacted Harvard University, which was hosting the PacketStorm Website, and
       requested that it be shut down. I did not threaten legal action, but simply directed University Administration to the website, for them to view, and to judge, on their own.
       Below is a copy of that letter:
       
       Greetings:
       
       May I first say that I did my best to see that this letter got sent to the appropriate individuals.  I had some difficulty determining who those individuals may be,
       so if I have made an error, I would greatly appreciate it if you would forward this letter on to the appropriate individual(s).
       
       My name is John Vranesevich, and I am the Founder and General Partner of AntiOnline LLP, a computer security company based outside of Pittsburgh, PA.
       
       Earlier today, one of my colleagues forwarded me the following URL:
       
       http://packetstorm.harvard.edu/jp/
       
       Needless to say, I was shocked and outraged at what I saw.  This page contains a large archive of libelous and, to put it bluntly, sick material.  Everything
       from archives of copyrighted material from our website, to altered pictures of my family, to 'stories' about me which contain images ranging from people
       engaged in homosexual activities, to a nun that appears to be covered in seminal fluid.
       
       I am astounded that an institution as prestigious Harvard would be party to the dissemination of this type of material.  It is my hope that the University
       Administration was unaware of this site, and now that it has been brought to their attention, it is my hope that it will be dealt with promptly.
       
       I have worked to help several educational institutions develop 'Acceptable Use Policies', and if Harvard is similar to them, the above URL would be a clear
       violation of that policy. 
       
       It is my hope that the above mentioned domain will be shut down immediately, and that the individual responsible will be seriously reprimanded.
       
       I hope to hear from you soon about this matter, and what you may have done regarding it.
       
       Yours In CyberSpace,
       John Vranesevich
       Founder, AntiOnline
       
       
       Tonight, Ken Williams, the founder of Packet Storm Security, released a letter to the public. The letter read in part:
       
       Funny how I spent the past few years donating my time, literally thousands of hours, to "the security community", never making even a penny off the time and
       work I invested, and have now lost it all because some asshole named John Vranesevich is able to make a quick phone call, fabricate absurd stories about
       criminal activity and bullshit I never did, and effectively ruin years of work, my education, my career, my life. 
       
       Ken, I know what it's like to dedicate many, many, thankless hours into a project, believe me. But, you did not loose your site because of me, you lost it because of you. I
       could not stand by and watch your site be used as a platform to harass and threaten my family, myself, and the business which I have worked hard to start. While you,
       and others who 'follow you' may criticize me for what I did, I think everyone that's reading this, who has family members that they love, and a career that they enjoy, will
       admit to themselves that if in my shoes, they would have done at least the same. I hold absolutely no grudge towards you as a person, and I hope that you have the best
       of success in all that you do.
       
       Due to the types of threats that I have been receiving, and that sites like PacketStorm have been propagating, local law enforcement agencies were put on alert, and
       began doing extensive extra patrolling of the residence of my family members, my own residence, and the AntiOnline Offices. I realize that the actions that I have taken
       against PacketStorm may greatly increase the immediate threat against my family, myself, and my company; and that the harassment will now only get worse. However,
       I will not allow my family, myself, nor my company to become a victim. I am standing my ground, and will continue AntiOnline's mission of putting an end to malicious
       hackers.
       
       People in this country have the right to say and do whatever they please, unless that is, what they say and do infringes on the rights of another - anonymous.
       
       Yours In CyberSpace,

       ======================= 

       * S T A T E M E N T * 

       As a service to the Internet community, Harvard agreed
       to host a Packet Storm Security Website for
       security-related materials only. Without Harvard's
       knowledge, unrelated content was put on the Harvard
       server, including sexually-related material and personal
       attacks on an individual not affiliated with the University.
       A Harvard administrative site focused on security issues is
       not the forum for this type of material. We are returning
       the content on the site and hope that Packet Storm will
       make its security tools available through its own Website.

       Ken's Rebuttal to the Harvard statement;
       
       Date: 7/1/99 17:58
       Received: 7/1/99 18:01
       From: Ken Williams, jkwilli2@unity.ncsu.edu

       Hi, 

       [The Harvard] statement is incorrect, and even libelous
       itself by implying that I had "sexually related materal" on
       the server. I NEVER did! 

       NOW, I will retain legal counsel. This is outrageous! 
       
       I wouldn't have been surprised to find myself slandered by
       John Vranesevich and AntiOnline, but to have Harvard
       implicitly state that I was serving up "sexually related
       material" to the Internet is absurd, libelous, and legally
       reprehensible. 

       Are you, Harvard, trying to ruin my reputation and career
       now too? 

       It sounds to me like you are fabricating this "sexually

       ZDNN: Harvard caught in hacker crossfire
       Tue, 01 April 1996 18:29:02 GMT

       Harvard University is caught in the middle of an online war between hacking-scene
       follower AntiOnline.com and the hacking community at large.
       
       On Wednesday, the Cambridge, Mass., university removed an independent security 
       Web site, known as Packet Storm, which it had been mirroring on its servers for only 10 days. 
       
       
       The reason: A directory of material hidden in the Web site, and thus on Harvard's servers, that
       had "sexually related material and personal attacks on an individual not affiliated with the 
       University," said Joe Wrinn, director of news and public affairs for Harvard, in a statement 
       released by Harvard on Thursday.

       "We agreed to have a site that had security-related materials only," said Wrinn. "Both parties
        involved were using us in a way that was completely inappropriate."
    
       Ken Williams, a North Carolina State University employee and the Webmaster of Packet Storm, angrily
       refuted the allegations.

       "This statement is incorrect, and even libelous itself by implying that I had 'sexually related 
       material' on the server," he wrote in an e-mail. "I never did!"

        
       According to Williams, the directory -- labeled "/jp" because it was a collection of material 
       satirizing AntiOnline founder and chief John P. Vranesevich -- had a parody of the AntiOnline site. 
 
       But others familiar with the site said that the parody also contained photos of nude women that were 
       intended to be more sarcastic than sexual. Harvard obviously didn't get the joke. Harvard's Wrinn did
       not know specifically what sort of "sexual" content was contained on the site. 


       Harvard in the hot seat
       

       "We are in the middle of this and it's inappropriate," said Harvard's Wrinn, sounding distinctly 
       uncomfortable with the attention that the issue was attracting. Harvard intends to send the complete
       contents of the site back to Williams so that he can post it elsewhere.
       
       No wonder: Packet Storm wasn't just a small-time site -- it had been the place to go for both hackers
       and security experts to get up-to-date security information.

       "Packet Storm was a huge compilation of security tools," said Brian Martin, known as "Jericho," one of
       the Webmasters at hacker news and information site Attrition.org. "It was updated daily with tools. It
       was always there." 

       Among organizations that used and mirrored the site: The Department of Defense and the Federal Bureau of
       Investigation, claimed Webmaster Williams.
       
       'I didn't have an anti-J.P. Temple of Hate'
       
       Yet, Williams had also sided with many others in hacker circles who have been waging a war -- of mainly 
       -- words against AntiOnline's Vranesevich and his latest ally, Caroline Meinel, security researcher and 
       webmaster of The Happy Hacker.

      "I didn't have an anti-J.P. Temple of Hate or anything," said Williams. "But there are companies, 
      organizations, and individuals out there that ;we believe; are black-eyes of the industry."


      So, Williams attached a non-public directory to the Web site that archived parodies and criticisms of 
      AntiOnline's founder. 


      The directory represented a single facet of a complex war of image in the hacker not-so-underground. For the
      most part, AntiOnline and its main foe, Attrition.org, have squared off with conflicting allegations of slander,
      libel and plagiarism. 
      
      ' I am kind of disappointed that an institution like Harvard was so quick to pull the plug just to avoid a 
      potential suit.'
      
      "I can understand a parody -- I have no problem with that," said the 20-year-old Pennsylvania Webmaster, adding 
      that he thought Williams acknowledged that the photos had been put up, but that since they had come from a source
      already online, the Packet Storm Webmaster thought the pictures were fair game.

      Vranesevich's answer? The Webmaster notified Harvard of the hidden directory in a letter to the university's provost
      -- and Harvard quickly took the site down.


      Did Harvard act too quickly?


      B.K. DeLong, a Boston-based computer security consultant, thought Harvard acted too quickly.

      "I am kind of disappointed that an institution like Harvard was so quick to pull the plug just to avoid a potential
       suit," he said. yet Harvard wasn't the only one to act quickly. By late Wednesday night, the Keebler Elves -- the 
       cybergang that claimed responsibility for hacking into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week
        -- defaced another government Web site with the news.


     "Now, because of; JP ... Packetstorm is no more, and never will be again," the site http://www.aao.uc.usbr.gov/ 
      lamented.


      Unnamed hackers also struck at AntiOnline more directly. AntiOnline's site came under a denial-of-service attack -- 
      which floods a particular site with random data -- so severe that its Internet service provider pulled the site for 
      almost 12 hours on Thursday, said Vranesevich.
     
      Ugly threats


      Other attacks were even less friendly. "I have received more death threats in the last 24 hours by phone, than I have 
      in five years," he said.


      Not quite an apology, Vranesevich added that he never intended the entire Packet Storm site to be taken down.


      "I know what it's like to have the university stomp its foot down on you. When I was a student at the University of 
      Pittsburgh, I had my Web site shut down," he said. "But I never threatened anyone."

      In his mind, the contents of "/jp" did.

 03.0 Cable Modem Hijacking from www.hackcanada.com
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Snarfed from PacketStorm Security: http://packetstorm.harvard.edu/
      
      Cable Modem IP Hijacking in Win95/98
       
       The purpose of this is to show you how bad cable modems security is and that 
       even with a win box you can take someone else's IP. You can hijack IP's using 
       a cable modem and it's very simple in any operating system.
       
       Just follow the steps:
       
       1) Choose someone's IP that you wish to have. Make sure the IP is on the same 
       network. Most cable modem providers use DHCP. The fist thing you have to do is 
       find the victims IP. Remember the victims IP has to be in the same network and 
       with the same service provider for this to work.
       
       2) Now this is probably the hardest thing in this file (but it's still easy), 
       you have to wait until the victims computer is off or you can Smurf kill his 
       connection. When you think his computer is off-line just try to ping it to see 
       if you get a response. Do this by going to a DOS prompt and typing ping 
       (victims IP). If you get a response then you have to try harder.
       
       After you get his PC off-line then you go into your network properties and edit 
       the IP settings, but instead of having yours there you put the victims IP, 
       host, and domain.
       
       3) Restart. If you restart and you get an IP conflict this means that the 
       victims computer is on, if you don't get an IP conflict then try to go to your 
       web browser and see if it works. With some cable modem providers you might have 
       to also add the Gateway, Subnet mask (255.255.55.0), Host, DNS search, and 
       Domain.
       
       
       Now you can go. Everything will work until the victims PC is back on. Once it 
       is back online it will take the IP away because it will tell you that you have 
       the wrong Mac addresses.
       
       
       *Linux*
       This is also possible in Linux, but is not the best way. You can change your 
       Mac address to the victims PC and this is more secure and much easier. There 
       are a couple of scripts to change your address, just look around.
       
       
       Warning: Some cable modem service providers will know when you're using the 
       wrong IP, but hey, it might be useful.

 04.0 Exploiting Null Session Weaknesses in NT environment
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Snarfed from PacketStorm Security: http://packetstorm.harvard.edu/
 
 
                     Details About NULL Sessions

     This page is a detailed explanation for programmatically connecting to NT Server NULL Sessions and extracting the name of the true
     administrator account. Even non-programmer Admins should read through this and become familiar with the API's explained in order to
     better understand the NT environment and recognize code that might be used against them.

     The original purpose of NULL sessions is to allow unauthenticated hosts to obtain browse lists from NT servers and participate in MS
     networking. Mostly this is useful for Win95/98/NT hosts who are not domain members, but still need to obtain browsing information. 

     The problem occurs in cases where a NULL session becomes included in the everyone group and now has access to resources to which
     they weren't authenticated, but that the authenticated group had permissions for. Originally, 'everyone' did not mean 'anyone'. You still
     had to log on to be in the everyone group. however, NULL Sessions are the one case where 'everyone' could mean 'anyone'. This is the
     reason MS created the *NEW* Authenticated group. The Authenticated group does not include NULL Sessions and so can never mean
     'anyone' - until someone finds an exploit.

     The following code segments are commented to show exactly what is happening, what API's are being used, and how the true
     administrator name can be identified.

     First - making a  NULL Session connection

     One way to this is by using the Net Use command with an empty password. Programmatically, it looks like this....

     //This function called from dialog that fills listbox with connections

     BOOL EstablishNullSession(CString TargetHost, CNTOHunterDlg* pDlg)
     {
     //Setup for UNICODE 
     char* pTemp = TargetHost.GetBuffer(256);
     WCHAR wszServ[256];
     LPWSTR Server = NULL;

     //Convert to Unicode
     MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, pTemp,
                             strlen(pTemp)+1, wszServ,
                             sizeof(wszServ)/sizeof(wszServ[0]) );

     //Create the IPC$ share connection string we need 
     Server = wszServ;

     LPCWSTR szIpc = L"\\IPC$";
     WCHAR RemoteResource[UNCLEN + 5 + 1]; // UNC len + \IPC$ + NULL
     DWORD dwServNameLen;
     DWORD dwRC;

     HTREEITEM machineRoot, shareRoot, userRoot, adminRoot, attribRoot;

     char sharename[256];
     char remark[256];

     if(Server == NULL || *Server == L'\0')
     {
     SetLastError(ERROR_INVALID_COMPUTERNAME);
     return FALSE;
     }

     dwServNameLen = lstrlenW( Server );

     //Test for various errors in connection string and recover
     if(Server[0] != L'\\' && Server[1] != L'\\')
     {
     // prepend slashes and NULL terminate
     RemoteResource[0] = L'\\';
     RemoteResource[1] = L'\\';
     RemoteResource[2] = L'\0';
     }
     else
     {
     dwServNameLen -= 2; // drop slashes from count
     RemoteResource[0] = L'\0';
     }

     if(dwServNameLen > CNLEN)
     {
     SetLastError(ERROR_INVALID_COMPUTERNAME);
     return FALSE;
     }

     if(lstrcatW(RemoteResource, Server) == NULL) return FALSE;
     if(lstrcatW(RemoteResource, szIpc) == NULL) return FALSE;
     //Start with clean memory
     ZeroMemory(&ui2, sizeof(ui2));
     //Fill in the Win32 network structure we need to use connect API

       -------------
       Release Date:  1999-06-25
       Application:   Cognos PowerPlay Web Edition
       Severity:      Unauthenticated web users can sniff cube data
       Author:        Darin White
       Operating Sys: Microsoft NT Server
       --------------
       
       I. Description
       
       Due to design problems as well as some potential web server
       misconfiguration PowerPlay Web Edition may serve up data cubes
       in a non-secure manner.  Execution of the PowerPlay CGI
       pulls cube data into files in an unprotected temporary
       directory.  Those files are then fed back to frames in the
       browser.  In some cases it is trivial for an unauthenticated
       user to tap into those data files before they are purged.
       Cognos has been contacted but does not regard this as a
       serious exposure (see appendix B below).
       
       The issues are:
       (a) dynamic directory listing
       (b) weak temporary filename algorithm
       (c) ad hoc parameters to the CGI
       
       
       II. Details
       
       Identifying PowerPlay sites is quickly accomplished using AltaVista
       http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?
       pg=q&kl=XX&q=%2Blink%3Appdscgi.exe&search=Search
       (join last two lines) which hits all pages containing a link to the
       PowerPlay CGI ppdscgi.exe on NT.
       
       Normal authentication for protected cubes occurs when a user selects
       a link like:
       <A href="/cgi-bin/ppdscgi.exe?XT=EXAMPLE&LA=en&LO=en">Example</a>
       At this point the user is prompted for a userid and password.
       Beyond this check there seems to be no verification that data
       is being fed out to the browser that requested it and was
       authorized.
       
       (a) dynamic directory listing
       Netscape Enterprise Server 3.5.1 appears to be serving up dynamic
       directory listings by default.  A known PowerPlay site can be hit
       with a request for http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/ which will
       return something like:
       
       /ppwb/Temp/ -
       
          6/25/99  9:17 AM        17904 1ad6t.htm
          6/25/99  9:17 AM        37828 1ad6x.htm
       
       Here we see two temporary files created by one initial cube request.
       The suffix 't' in the first filename denotes the PowerPlay toolbar
       and 'x' denotes the data content.  These files are fed back to the
       browser to populate two frames.  Clicking on the content filename
       will allow any user to browse the current cube view with no
       authentication challenge even if the cube has been password-protected.
       Once into the cube the user may continue to drill for further data.
       
       (b) weak temporary filename algorithm
       Sites that have disabled directory listing may still be vulnerable.
       Many sites using PowerPlay offer a mix of protected and unprotected
       cubes.  Some sites also offer an anonymous user account (let's say
       "guest" for example). The PowerPlay CGI uses a common temporary
       directory for serving all cubes back to the browser.  Using the
       guest account or viewing an unprotected cube a user may right-click
       the content area and select View Frame Info which will display
       the temporary filename.  By repeatedly reloading the initial cube
       view and viewing frame info a list of temporary filenames may be
       generated in order to analyze the filename algorithm.  e.g.
       http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/1eeex.htm
       http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/1f77x.htm
       http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/1fcfx.htm
       http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/1ff6x.htm
       http://www.example.com/ppwb/Temp/2014x.htm
       
       Analysis of the filename progression shows:
       * the last char is 'x' for the data and 't' for the toolbar
       * first n-1 chars are hexadecimal chars only
       * the hexadecimal "numbers" comprising the filename are ascending only
       * the first char is never 0.  e.g. fffx.htm => 1000x.htm
       * simple hexadecimal subtraction on the first n-1 chars of consecutive
       filenames shows a very predictable pattern (see appendix A)
       
       A user may orient themselves in the namespace (the set of all possible
       filenames) by using a guest account or unprotected cube.  Once oriented
       a set of candidate filenames may be generated and requested from
       /ppwb/Temp on the server.  Of course this approach assumes valid
       users are hitting the cubes at the same time.  Once a successful
       hit has been made on a temporary file the user may drill further
       into the data as described in (a) above.
       
       Alternatively a brute force attack on a server could be attempted
       by just submitting requests for all possible filenames.  Of course if
       you could establish some idea of how long the site has been operational
       you might start with 4-char filenames.  A very new site with low traffic
       (if the owner displays a page counter) might be best approached with
       3-char names.  This type of attack would present a beat-the-clock
       situation as the ~65000 requests (for 4-char) scanned for an existing
       file before it was purged from the Temp directory.
       
       (c) ad hoc parameters to the CGI
       A variety of parameters to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/ppdscgi.exe
       provide additional information on the PowerPlay server.
       * ?ABOUT= will return the version of PowerPlay.
       * ?TOC (or no parameter) presents a table of contents list of all
       web-enabled cubes on the server.  Some sites are using static page
       links to hit cubes rather than relying on PowerPlay's generated TOC.
       They may not be aware that all cubes are available.
       * the hidden parm PPWB in the data contents frame details the unaliased
       location of the temporary directory.  e.g.
       INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="PPWB" VALUE="C:/Netscape/SuiteSpot/docs/ppwb">
       
       
       III. Solution
       
       (a) dynamic directory listing
       Turn this feature off on you web server following the directions
       provided by the server vendor.  If you are unable to disable this
       feature you may create an index.html file in the /ppwb/Temp directory
       that will load when a filename has not been specified in the URL.
       
       (b) weak temporary filename algorithm
       This is really on Cognos' plate.  Watch your error logfile for
       a lot of failed requests for /ppwb/Temp/*.htm to at least detect
       an attack.  Removing anonymous cube access may slow an attack.
       
       (c) ad hoc parameters to the CGI
       Just be aware of what is available by altering the parameters.
       Don't assume your cubes are hidden because there is no direct
       link to the table of contents from the web.  Password protect
       your cubes.

       -----------------------------
       Hello Darin,
       
       Thank you for the descriptive analysis of your problem. I understand that
       you have set up anonymous access and therefore you are aware of the security
       risk. I agree that the temp file generation is predictable and would suggest
       logging an enhancement through our web site.
       
       In the interim you have to weigh what is acceptable in terms of security
       knowing that there are other alternatives such as SSL and LDAP. These other
       options will of course offer substantially more protection.
       
       In conclusion your analysis is correct, now it is a factor of weighing your
       security wants and needs.
       
       Regards,

       Subject: VMware Security Alert
       
       "On June 22nd, 1999, VMware, Inc. was notified of a security problem with

            VMware Security Alert
             Date: June 25th, 1999
       
                         
       
       On June 22nd, 1999, VMware, Inc. was notified of a security problem with VMware for Linux 1.0.1. This security hole is
       also present in all previous versions of VMware for Linux. The security hole has been fixed in VMware for Linux 1.0.2
       released today. The security hole allows a buffer overrun attack against VMware for Linux to result in unprivileged root
       access to a machine. An updated version of VMware for Linux which fixes this problem is available now, see below. As
       far as we know, this breach has never been used for malicious purposes, or caused any harm to customer installations.
       VMware, Inc. apologizes for the inconvenience to our users.
        
       
       Vulnerable Systems
       
       The security hole allows an attack to occur during VMware startup, but before a virtual machine is powered on. Guest
       operating systems themselves are unlikely to be affected by these buffer overflow attacks. Systems most vulnerable to
       this attack are multi-user Linux systems that have VMware installed. A malicious user with access to an account on the
       system could exploit the hole. Stand alone single-user machines are not at high risk from this security hole. This hole
       does not allow direct network based 'worm' style attacks against VMware.
       
       This security hole was discovered by Asylum Security, a division of CyberSpace 2000, 
       <http://www.cyberspace2000.com/security/> a professional computer security
       response team.  VMware has taken immediate action in response to this event. VMware for Linux 1.0.2 was made
       available for download on June 25th, 1999 on our web site and mirror sites. The shipment of CD-ROMs has been
       suspended and the inventory discarded. Customers who have purchased VMware for have been notified by electronic mail,
       VMware has also posted security alerts to newsgroups at news.vmware.com.
        
       
       Affected VMware Releases
       
       This security hole is present in VMware for Linux 1.0.1 and all previous  versions, including the beta versions
       (build-106, build-135, build-152) and the experimental version (build-179). VMware recommends that users replace
       beta and experimental versions with VMware for Linux 1.0.2. An updated VMware for Linux experimental release with
       fixes for this security hole will be made available in the near future.
        
       
       How to Close this Security Hole
       
       The security hole can be closed by simply upgrading to VMware for Linux version 1.0.2: 
       
            1.Download VMware for Linux 1.0.2 from one of our mirror sites
            <http://www.vmware.com/download/downloadlinux.html>
           
            2.Untar the distribution.

 08.0 DOD investigating computer 'Mob-like' tactics
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From: Federal Computer Week;http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/fcwhome.htm

      DOD investigating computer 'mob tactics'

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      While a senior adviser to the Defense Department testified before Congress
      this week on threats to national security stemming from the export of powerful
      computer technology, his supervisor allegedly attempted to access and tamper
      with his computer, prompting the immediate launch of a full-scale investigation.

      Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), chairman of the House Government Reform
      Committee, said Jay Davis, director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency,
      informed the committee on June 28 that an investigation was under way into an
      incident involving unauthorized access to the computer belonging to a senior
      strategic trade adviser to the agency.

      According to Burton, the incident took place while Peter Leitner, a longtime
      internal critic of DOD's policy on exporting sensitive computer technologies,
      was testifying on June 24 before the committee regarding security problems
      stemming from that policy. Although no details from the investigation have been
      released yet, Burton claims that the incident is an example of DOD officials
      trying to strong-arm a congressional witness into not cooperating with the
      committee.

      "While Dr. Leitner was telling my committee about the retaliation he suffered
      for bringing his concerns to his superiors and Congress, his supervisor was
      trying to secretly access his computer," Burton said. "This smacks of mob
      tactics. Congress will not stand for this kind of witness intimidation."

      Although DTRA has launched an investigation into the incident, Burton said he
      plans to call upon Defense Secretary William Cohen to ask for "his personal
      involvement" in the case. "I intend to ask a lot of questions of the Defense
      Department officials involved, and I expect to get straight answers," Burton
      said.

      Leitner has criticized the department's policy of easing export controls on
      powerful computer technology that is used to simulate and test the reliability of
      nuclear weapons, claiming that the acquisition of supercomputer technology
      abroad was feeding a new form of Cold War characterized by an arms race for
      "virtual weapons."

 09.0 GSA announces Intrusion Detection Net
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From: Federal Computer Week;http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/fcwhome.htm
      
      JUNE 28, 1999 


      GSA launches intrusion-detection net

      BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)

      The General Services Administration last week
      asked industry for information about emerging security
      technology for detecting unauthorized users on agency
      networks, with the goal of building a government
      intrusion-detection system by the end of next year.

      In building the Federal Intrusion Detection Network
      (Fidnet), GSA hopes to find security tools vendors are
      developing that overcome the weaknesses of existing
      technology. By keeping ahead of the latest technology,
      GSA hopes to leave agency defenses less vulnerable
      to hackers, agency officials said.

      "We want to encourage people to develop new
      technologies that will help us keep neck and neck with
      the perpetrator," said David Jarrell, program manager
      for the GSA portion of Fidnet in the Federal
      Technology Service's Office of Information Security
      and technical director of the Federal Computer
      Incident Response Capability. 

      OIS will look not only to established intrusion-detection vendors but to new
      companies and people that "we haven't even heard of," Jarrell said. 

      "I think there are people out there that are significantly brilliant enough to solve
      this and we hope that this [request for information] will cause them to come
      forward," he said.

      GSA plans to use the vendor-provided information to develop prototypes by the
      first quarter of fiscal 2000, said Tom Burke, GSA's assistant commissioner of
      information security. Down the line, OIS may even pay some of the vendors to
      put together a long-term, real-world demonstration of their capabilities at an
      agency, he said.

      GSA particularly is interested in finding intrusion-detection systems that are
      more capable of detecting attacks as they happen instead of after the fact.

      The problem is that most intrusion-detection solutions work the same way
      anti-virus protection does: They check network-use patterns against a known list
      of intrusion "signatures" and send out alerts when they come across a match.

      But as vendors and users have known for years, this method will not catch
      intrusions that are not on that list. Also, most products just now are advancing to
      the point where they alert administrators at the time an intrusion takes place.

      "We find that many of the off-the-shelf products that are available today are
      really a response to the intrusions, and they are always a step behind the
      intruder," Jarrell said. "We want to look to the future and some artificial
      intelligence that will learn as it goes about the attacks that are being launched." 

      This type of capability would be more than welcome to agencies, especially if
      they are enabled to respond more quickly at the local level, said one senior
      civilian agency official. 

      Others recognized the potential benefits of sharing attack "experience" across
      government.

      "What I would hope this next-generation intrusion detection could bring to us is
      the capability not only to monitor [intrusions] but to put together the information
      in a history for reference," said Sarah Jane League, Defense Department liaison
      at the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office. "It should bring that pattern
      recognition and learn as it goes...so that over time it will have the ability to
      recognize" not only attacks but what could be attacks, she said.

      Vendors have been working on this type of product, sometimes called anomaly
      detection, for some time.

      "ISS has a lot of research efforts in place to advance the intrusion-detection
      market," said Mark Wood, intrusion-detection product manager at Internet
      Security Systems Inc., maker of the Real-Secure intrusion-detection product
      line. "Having a pre-defined list of signatures is nice, but you'd like to detect
      novel attacks, things you don't know about."

      One major problem vendors are struggling with in producing this type of solution
      is the large number of "false positives" -- incorrectly perceived attacks -- that
      are generated when a network is scanned, Wood said. Despite this, a
      commercially viable solution could be available within the next year, he said.

      "It's certainly worthwhile that someone like the GSA is driving this; it's
      absolutely necessary," Wood said. "Perhaps this will help coordinate the industry
      so that they will provide something sooner than they would have."

      The need for this type of solution across government has been underscored by
      the more than 40 federal World Wide Web sites that have been hacked in the
      last two months, including at least six last week. And these attacks are only the
      most noticeable types of intrusions into government networks, according to
      federal experts testifying before Congress last week [see related story, "House
      member suggests regular network security reports"].

      However, in the end, while many would wish otherwise, keeping up with
      attackers instead of one step behind really is the best that anyone can do, Jarrell
      said. "There is no silver bullet; there is no perfect solution when it comes to
      intrusion detection," he said. "As I've said before, if you build a better
      mousetrap, a better mouse will evolve."

 10.0 Nasa servers reportedly hacked
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From http://www.newsbytes.com/pubNews/132718.html
      
      30 Jun 1999, 10:51 AM CST
      By David McGuire, Newsbytes.
      MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, U.S.A., 

      . In what appears to be the third computer attack on
      a government Website this week, crackers may
      have gained unauthorized access to one or more
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
      servers yesterday. 

      "There is some indication that a couple servers at the
      Marshal Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama" were
      attacked earlier this week, a NASA spokesperson told
      Newsbytes today. NASA could not confirm the reports as of
      this writing. 

      The Marshall site was up and running as of 11:00 EDT
      today. 

      While Sunday's hack of the US Army's home page typifies
      the kind of high-profile attack favored by many hacker (more
      accurately known as cracker) groups, the apparent Marshal
      attack and yesterday's crack of National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Norman, Okla.-based
      Storm Prediction Center are more puzzling, Newsbytes
      notes. 

      Marshall is a fairly low-profile NASA center that focuses
      primarily on research in the areas of astronomy, low gravity,
      and space shuttle propulsion. The Storm Prediction Center
      (SPC) provides nationwide weather forecasts. 

      The SPC hack caught NOAA by surprise. "At about three
      AM, some Internet customer called one of our forecasters
      and said 'You better check your Website,'" SPC Director Joe
      Schaefer told Newsbytes yesterday. 

      "We produce weather forecasts for the whole country," he
      said. "We are doing a public good. There is no way I can
      see that we are harming anybody. To come after a site like
      this is strange, to put it mildly." 

      The Army hack was somewhat more typical. At some point
      Sunday night, crackers replaced the Army's home page with
      a page that read "Hello, this Website hack has a purpose.
      The purpose is to settle rumors. Global Hell is alive, Global
      Hell will not die," Lt. Col. Ron Burns of the Army's Director
      for Information Systems Command, Control,
      Communications and Computers (DISC4) unit told
      Newsbytes Monday. 

      Sunday's attack was the first successful crack of the Army's
      main site, located at http://www4.army.mil . 

      The US Senate and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
      have also suffered recent Website attacks. 

      The FBI declined comment on the string of hacker attacks.

 11.0 UK May Force ISPs to Install Taps

      contributed by Weld Pond 
      The British Interception of Communications Act has
      been the target of proposed changes recently. The
      changes would require all communications service
      providers to build in, at their expense, capabilities for
      government agents to be able to listen in to
      communications. This proposal is particularly broad as it
      does not stop at the internet and covers everything
      from pagers to video conferencing to VPNs. Theses new
      requirements have been proposed by the International
      Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar
      (ILETS)an exclusive FBI funded group that meets in
      secret.

      U.K. Wants ISPs To Build In
      Interception
      (06/25/99, 3:40 p.m. ET)
      By Duncan Campbell, TechWeb 

      The British government has become the first in
      Europe to openly propose internationally
      agreed requirements for ISPs to build
      technology into networks that would allow for
      police surveillance. 

      Under proposals for changes to the Interception of
      Communications Act announced by the Home Office this
      week, all communications service providers (CSPs)
      would be required to build interception software or
      hardware into their systems. 

      The law -- if passed -- will apply to all types of new
      communications services, including Internet telephony,
      TV conferencing, paging, and satellite based personal
      communications systems. 

      The International User Requirements have been drawn
      up over the past six years by a group founded by the
      U.S. FBI, called the International Law Enforcement
      Telecommunications Seminar (ILETS), which meets in
      secret. The group excludes representatives from industry
      or civil rights organizations, and has attempted to
      standardize its objectives as an International
      Telecommunication Union requirement. 

      According to this week's "white paper," every type of
      network will be covered, including VPNsoperated
      through the Internet or other TCP/IP systems. The new
      law will also cover interception of business telecom
      services, ranging from basic networks of a few lines
      found within a small office to large networks linking
      offices, in both the public and private sectors, the
      document says. 

      Under the present British Interception of
      Communications Act, only licensed public telecom
      operators have to provide government tapping facilities
      within their networks. However, ISPs must surrender
      any stored communications data they have, including
      e-mail, Web-access records, and service details, if
      served with an order. 

      Home Secretary Jack Straw now proposes all CSPs be
      required to take reasonable steps to ensure their system
      is capable of being intercepted. 

      "This will be an ongoing requirement CSPs will have to
      consider each time they develop their network or
      introduce new services," Straw said. "CSPs will also be
      required to provide reasonable assistance to effect
      warranted intercepts." 

      This will include real-time access to data about their
      subscribers and information about services they have
      used, including logs of telephone calls, e-mail, or website
      accesses. A key part of technical arrangements to be
      made will ensure operators will not be able to know what
      information has been copied from their systems. 

      The British government said the new law would make
      full provision for human-rights legislation, Straw said. 

      But according to Madeleine Colvin of Justice, the
      international human-rights organization and British
      section of the International Commission of Jurists, the
      proposed law would not achieve this. 

      "There are major gaps in what these proposals suggest
      for controlling surveillance methods. For example, how is
      anyone to know if their human rights may have been
      abused if they are never going to be told that their e-mail
      has been intercepted by the government?" he asked.

      U.S. committees approve
      encryption bill 

      by Elinor Mills Abreu 
                                     From...
                                               


      (IDG) -- The U.S. Senate and House
      Commerce Committees Thursday
      approved bills that would liberalize
      encryption export regulations. In
      addition, the Senate committee
      passed bills calling for the promotion
      of digital signatures and filtering
      software to block pornography. 

      The House Security and Freedom
      through Encryption (SAFE) Act
      removes the government restrictions
      on export of strong encryption if a
      comparable encryption product is
      commercially available outside the
      U.S. In addition, the SAFE Act bars
      the government from requiring key
      recovery, whereby the government
      would have access to keys to decode
      encrypted messages for
      law-enforcement purposes.

      The government argues that it needs
      to control the export of strong
      encryption for national security.
      Vendors argue that the restrictions
      hamper their competitiveness on the worldwide market because strong
      encryption is readily available outside the U.S. The government wants vendors
      to develop encryption software that includes a key recovery mechanism. 

      The amendments approved by the House committee would do several things:
      require that a comparable encryption product be available in a country outside
      the U.S. in order for a U.S. company to export similar technology there; bar
      export to the People's Liberation Army or the Communist Military in China;
      allow the Secretary of Commerce to deny the export of encryption products if
      they would be used to harm national security, to sexually exploit children or to
      execute other illegal activities; require the Secretary of Commerce to consult
      with the secretaries of State and Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence
      and the Attorney General when reviewing a product; and subject a person to
      criminal penalties for not providing access to encrypted data if a subpoena
      were served and the person had the capability to decrypt the data. 

      Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain [R-Ariz.]
      proposed a Senate encryption bill that would
      allow for the exportation of encryption of key
      lengths up to 64 bits. In general, companies
      currently must get a license to export
      encryption higher than 56 bits in key length. 

      In addition, the McCain encryption bill would
      allow for the export of stronger "nondefense"
      encryption to "responsible entities" and
      governments in the North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization, the Association of Southeast
      Asian Nations and the Organization for
      Economic Cooperation and Development.
      However, the Secretary of Commerce would
      be allowed to prohibit export of particular
      encryption products to an individual or
      organization in a foreign country. An
      Encryption Export Advisory Board would be
      created to review applications for exemption
      of encryption of over 64 bits, make
      recommendations to the Secretary of
      Commerce and authorize more funding to law
      enforcement and national security agencies to
      "upgrade facilities and intelligence." The bill
      would ask the National Institute of Standards
      and Technology to establish an advanced
      encryption standard by Jan. 1, 2002. 

      "The bill carefully balances our national security and law enforcement
      interests while updating current laws on encryption technology," McCain said
      in a statement. "It is illogical to deny U.S. producers the ability to compete
      globally if similar products are already being offered by foreign companies." 

      On the digital signature front, Sen. Spencer Abraham [R-Mich.] said the
      Millennium Digital Commerce Act he sponsored would "ensure that individuals
      and organizations in different states are held to their agreements and
      obligations even if their respective states have different rules concerning
      electronically signed documents." 

      The Abraham bill would pre-empt state law from denying that digital contracts
      are legal solely because they are in electronic form; establish guidelines for
      international use of electronic signatures that would remove obstacles to
      electronic transactions; and allow the market to determine the type of
      authentication technology used in international commerce. 

      The Senate Commerce Committee also grappled with Internet censorship by
      approving another McCain-sponsored bill. The plan would require schools and
      libraries receiving government universal service discounts for Internet access
      to use filtering technology on computers children access that would screen out
      pornography. 

      Taking up a less controversial bill, the Senate committee also approved a
      measure to tie cellular phone users calling 911 to medical centers, police and
      firefighters for faster response time to accidents and emergencies. The bill
      would expand the coverage areas of wireless telephone service; establish
      parity of protection for the provision or use of wireless 911 service; and
      upgrade 911 systems so they can provide information such as location and
      automatic crash notification data. 

      Alan Davidson, staff counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Center for
      Democracy and Technology, said "it was a mixed day for the Internet on
      Capital Hill." 

      While legislators realize the potential of electronic commerce and favor
      liberalizing encryption export to advance it, they are fearful of what they see
      as the "dark side" of the Internet - content that might be objectionable,
      according to Davidson. 

      Rather than require filtering software in schools and libraries, legislators should
      offer educational institutions the flexibility to choose "acceptable use or
      monitoring policies," he said. 

      "Mandating that every school and library filter access to the Internet is not
      going to be the best way to protect kids," he said. "In addition to the fact that
      the bill has constitutional problems, it mandates one technological approach
      without regard to the more effective ways that local communities are already
      protecting kids." 

      Other committees may review these bills before they go to the floor of the two
      houses for a vote, he said.

      Heathen.A Is at the Gates 

      Keep a lookout: There's a new bug in town.

      by Matthew Nelson, InfoWorld Electric 
      June 25, 1999, 4:50 p.m. PT 

      SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA -- Network Associates'
      Anti-Virus Emergency Response Team is warning
      users about what it terms a "medium risk" virus called
      Heathen.A.

      Heathen.A is a multipartite virus, as it uses two
      classes of files, an .exe portion and a .doc portion, for
      its infection. The virus was originally spread from a
      newsgroup and replicates itself across Microsoft Word
      97 files, but it does not destroy data.

      "It's delivered if someone receives an e-mail with an
      infected Word 97 document, or if they access any
      server file that is infected," says Allison Taylor, product
      marketing manager for corporate antivirus solutions at
      Network Associates. "It doesn't carry a particular
      payload except for dropping a patch into your
      [Windows] 95/98 shell."

      "It runs a modified version of your Windows Explorer
      system and then infects the Word 97 documents,"
      Taylor explains. "So once you've been infected, any
      Word 97 file that you open from then on will also be
      infected."

      The macro drops three system files, heathen.vex,
      heathen.vdl, and heathen.vdo, into a system's
      C:/Windows subdirectory. When the system is
      rebooted, the heathen.vex file is renamed explorer.exe,
      according to AVERT Labs.

      NAI has assigned the Heathen.A virus a medium-risk
      level as it is not engineered to appear to be coming
      from a known user, and because it infects new
      systems only if a user opens an infected Word 97 file.
      Heathen.A does not send itself through e-mail as
      Melissa and Worm.ExploreZip do.

      NAI has issued a virus update to protect against the
      Heathen.A virus at AVERT Labs' Web site.

      BOSTON (BUSINESS WIRE) - Sandstorm Enterprises Inc., an information security tools company, has released the first version
      of TCP.demux, a TCP/IP session reconstruction utility. TCP.demux is the first of a set of tools from Sandstorm Enterprises for
      advanced network monitoring and surveillance.
    
      TCP.demux is designed to make network monitors, such as "tcpdump", "snoop", and "Sniffer Basic" more useful. There are so
      many connections over even a medium-sized network that it is often impossible for even a high-end commercial network analyzer
      to present the traffic in a clear, informative way. TCP.demux takes IP streams captured by network monitors, reassembles them
      into their constituent TCP/IP and UDP sessions, and displays the information in a variety of convenient formats. TCP.demux
      includes sophisticated and powerful analysis tools for quick identification of relevant sessions.
    
      Possible uses of TCP.demux include network security, reverse engineering, and network-based software development. It can be
      used to create profiles of suspicious users and to find information being sent unencrypted over a network. It can also help point out
      weaknesses and vulnerabilities in network applications and design. TCP.demux detects and flags anomalies that may be designed
      to interfere with network monitoring.
    
      TCP.demux generates reports in 19 different text or HTML formats. It runs on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows
      95/98/2000/NT and many varieties of UNIX, including RedHat Linux 5.1, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, BSDI, and Solaris.
      TCP.demux can easily be included in batch files, shell scripts, and other applications in any computer language.
    
      The idea of a TCP session reconstruction tool is not new, but all other such tools have been platform-specific and embedded in
      ponderous application suites. "There have been many tools for winnowing through Internet traffic flows, but almost everything to
      date has been scaled or developed for the workgroup environment," says James VanBokkelen, Sandstorm's President and founder.
      "The Internet has grown enormously in the past few years, and with it the scale of the problems. TCP.demux is the first tool we
      know of designed with the scope of today's problems in mind."
    
      Analyzing network traffic with TCP.demux is time-efficient, and therefore cost-efficient. Because dumpfile analysis is separated
      from the capture process, TCP.demux allows remote monitoring of networks. An engineer at one of Sandstorm's beta sites said,
      after TCP.demux had allowed him to isolate problems on a large congested network in under half an hour, "TCP.demux was the
      quickest way to debug the system. Had the debugging process been long, it would have jeopardized our ability to ship on time."
    
      TCP.demux is being offered at the introductory price of $950. Additional information on TCP.demux can be found at
      http://www.sandstorm.net/tcpdemux.
    
      Sandstorm Enterprises, headquartered in Boston, MA, has been acclaimed for its groundbreaking PhoneSweep telephone scanner,

      Chesterfield youth pleads
      guilty to hacking 

      Friday, June 25, 1999

      BY MARK BOWES
      Times-Dispatch Staff Writer 

      A Chesterfield County youth who authorities said is intelligent but committed a
      foolish act has pleaded guilty to hacking into a Massachusetts Internet
      provider's system, disabling it and causing at least $20,000 in damage. 

      The 16-year-old, whose identity is being withheld because of his age, pleaded
      guilty to computer trespassing Monday in Chesterfield Juvenile 

      and Domestic Relations District Court. The judge continued the matter until
      Aug. 12 so he can decide whether to convict the boy of a felony, as charged,
      or reduce it to a misdemeanor. 

      Through his attorney, the boy agreed the evidence was sufficient to convict
      him, "but contested whether or not it was maliciously done," which is required
      for a felony conviction, said Assistant Chesterfield Commonwealth's Attorney
      Aubrey M. Davis Jr. 

      "I didn't see it as [a malicious] act," Davis said. "I think it was a foolish act by
      an intelligent kid who didn't really realize the significance of what he was
      doing. He's a pretty daggone smart kid." 

      Virginia State Police Special Agent Sal Girgente, who investigated the case
      here, gave a summary of evidence in court on Monday. 

      According to evidence, the boy, using his mother's Internet account, hacked
      into the computer network of ACIS/BICNet, an Internet service 

      provider in Ayer, Mass., in August. State police also believe he succeeded in
      breaking into the computer systems of New Mexico State University and
      Aurora Communications Exchange Ltd., in Ontario, Canada. 

      Investigators believe he may have hacked into the latter two systems to "cover
      his tracks" before breaking into the Internet provider's network. 

      The state police's new High Technology Crimes Unit began investigating the
      case after getting a referral from the FBI's Boston field 

      office. An agent there succeeded in tracking an intruder into the ACIS/

      BICNet system back through a Virginia Internet provider to the boy's home in
      Chester. 

      During an intrusion on Aug. 8, police believe the teen and possibly
      accomplices replaced system files, among other things, created a new account
      and turned off system logging, according to court documents. That caused the
      company's e-mail system to be out of service for 12 hours. 

      Several days later, the intruder again broke into the system and succeeded in
      causing "the entire system to crash," court papers say. The resulting damage,
      police said, topped $20,000. 

      The teen "succeeded in bringing the system to its knees," Girgente said. Three
      FBI traces were successful in leading authorities to the Chesterfield family's
      Internet account. Police believe the boy and other hackers broke into the
      system to play games or create chat rooms.

      Hackers attack Army's main Internet site

      June 28, 1999 
      Web posted at: 7:37 PM EDT (2337 GMT) 

      WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers defaced the Army's main Web
      site in the latest digital attack on a federal system. Pentagon workers noticed it
      early Monday and repaired it. 

      Army spokesman Jim Stueve said administrators believe hackers altered the
      www.army.mil site between 8 p.m. Sunday and 5 a.m. Monday, but no
      internal systems were affected. "There were no security breaches," he said. 

      The altered site announced the attack "has a purpose ... to settle rumors"
      about the demise of the loosely organized hacker group that claimed
      responsibility for the May attack on the White House Web site. 

      Another message hidden within the altered page's computer code urged
      people who saw it to "trust very few people." 

      Stueve said he noticed the defaced page when he arrived for work Monday
      morning. It was replaced by 6 a.m. 

      "I just looked at it and just went on to my favorites (other sites) and blew it off
      because I knew they were going to get to it right away," he said. 

      The attack comes in the wake of several others on prominent government
      Internet sites, including those of the White House, FBI and Senate. Military
      pages have long been favorites of hackers. 

      "They're always the target," said Keith Rhodes, a director in the information
      management division in the General Accounting Office, the investigative
      branch of Congress. "It's almost like a rite of passage. You have to bust a
      (military) site to have any credibility." 

      Just last week, experts told the House Science Committee's technology panel
      that managers at many federal agencies fail to consider computer security
      adequately and have too few employees with sufficient training. 

      Rhodes, who was among those testifying last week, said Monday that the
      Defense Department's computer-security expertise is uneven. 

      "They're the best and the worst in computer security," Rhodes said. "They've
      got some real pros, some of the best in the business. But the DOD is huge ...
      and some of the areas in the Department of Defense don't have very good
      security." 

      Outside security experts said they believed the Army site's attackers used a
      relatively well publicized security loophole in the popular Cold Fusion software
      package. The Army said only that the incident was under investigation. 

      "The community of attackers is getting better at what they do, and a lot of
      their tools are getting automated," Rhodes said. "And a lot of the software
      being sent out is getting worse -- designed for flash with security as an
      afterthought. You put up your Web site, and its gets creamed."

      Huge new electronic `dragnet'
      assailed by privacy advocates
     
                         By ROBERT O'HARROW JR.
                            The Washington Post 
     
      WASHINGTON -- As part of a new and aggressive effort to track down parents
      who owe child support, the federal government has created a vast computerized
      data-monitoring system that includes all individuals with new jobs and the names,
      addresses, Social Security numbers and wages of nearly every working adult in
      the United States.
     
      Government agencies have long gathered personal information for specific
      reasons, such as collecting taxes. But never before have federal officials had the
      legal authority and technological ability to locate so many Americans found to be
      delinquent parents -- or such potential to keep tabs on Americans accused of
      nothing.
     
      The system was established under a little-known part of the law overhauling
      welfare three years ago. It calls for all employers to quickly file reports on every
      person they hire and, quarterly, the wages of every worker. States regularly must
      report all people seeking unemployment benefits and all child-support cases.
     
      Starting next month, the system will reach further. Large banks and other
      financial institutions will be obligated to search for data about delinquent parents
      by name on behalf of the government, providing authorities with details about
      bank accounts, money-market mutual funds and other holdings of those parents.
      State officials, meanwhile, have sharply expanded the use of Social Security
      numbers. Congress ordered the officials to obtain the nine-digit numbers when
      issuing licenses -- such as drivers', doctors' and outdoorsmen's -- in order to
      revoke the licenses of delinquents.
     
      Enforcement officials say the coupling of computer technology with details about
      individuals' employment and financial holdings will give them an unparalleled
      ability to identify and locate parents who owe child support and, when necessary,
      withhold money from their paychecks or freeze their financial assets.
     
      ``They never get away from us anymore. It's just wonderful. . . . What you're
      trying to do in child support is build a box, four walls, around a person,'' said
      Brian Shea, the acting executive director of child-support enforcement in
      Maryland. ``It has in some ways revolutionized this business.''
     
      But privacy experts and civil libertarians say the scope of the effort raises new
      questions about the proper line between aggressive public policy and intrusive
      government snooping. In pursuing an objective that is almost universally
      applauded, the government has also created something that many Americans
      have staunchly opposed: a vast pool of fresh personal information that could be
      used in a variety of ways to monitor their lives.
     
      ``What you have here is a compilation of information that is much better and more
      current than any other data system in the U.S.,'' said Robert Gellman, an
      attorney and privacy specialist in Washington, D.C. ``All of the sudden we're on
      the verge of creating the Holy Grail of data collection, a central file on every
      American.''
     
      Already lawmakers, federal agencies and the White House have considered
      expanding the permitted aims of the system to include pinpointing debtors, such
      as students who default on government loans.
     
      Under the system, every employer must send information about new hires and
      quarterly wages to state child-support agencies. State officials gather the data,
      along with information on unemployment benefits and child-support cases, and
      then ship it to computers run by the Administration for Children and Families.
      ACF officials then use computers to sort and send back to state authorities
      reports about people obligated to pay child support.
     
      Government officials say the system is safe, accurate and discreet. They also
      say it is secure. Because it has, among other safeguards, systems that confirm
      the accuracy of Social Security numbers, officials say it will not intrude into the
      lives of most people.
     
      An examination of the program, however, shows that government officials have
      downplayed or overlooked a variety of privacy and security concerns as they
      worked to meet congressional deadlines.
     
      The computer system that houses much of the data at the Social Security
      Administration ``has known weaknesses in the security of its information
      systems,'' according to a Dec. 31 report by the General Accounting Office. And
      authorities have not studied the frequency of mistakes that might arise from
      incorrect data, even though the system will enable local child-support
      enforcement officials to routinely freeze a parent's assets without an additional
      court hearing.
     
      Few people know about the system, even though it was created through one of
      the signature acts of Congress and the Clinton administration -- the ``Personal
      Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996,'' the law that
      ended the federal guarantee of welfare payments. Much of the congressional
      debate and news coverage at the time focused on the broad policy and political
      implications of the new law.
     
      Officials have not publicized their ability to obtain financial information because
      they do not want to alert delinquents to the ability of enforcement workers to
      seize or freeze financial assets, according to Michael Kharfen, spokesman for the
      federal Administration for Children and Families, which administers the program.
     
      -0-
     
      When welfare reformers on Capitol Hill and the White House approved the system
      in 1996, their aim was to cut down welfare spending by boosting child-support
      payments.
     
      (Begin Optional Trim)
     
      They had in mind people such as Stephanie Dudley and her son, Robert, who live
      in Farmington, Minn. Robert's father had split up with Dudley shortly after the boy
      was born and drifted from place to place. He owed $350 a month in child-support
      payments, but it was hard tracking him down and getting him to pay.
     
      Officials found Robert's father -- and then started withholding money from his
      paycheck -- after a new employer in Pennsylvania reported him to the network. ``I
      literally was living from check to check,'' Dudley said. ``I mean, that money
      literally put shoes on the kids' feet, helped pay the rent.''
     
      Kathy Robins of Tazewell, Va., and her 7-year-old son, Dwight, never received
      court-ordered child support until the system turned up his father in North Carolina.
      Now she gets about $120 a month, money she plans to use to pay for a
      babysitter this summer. ``It'll help,'' she said. ``I mean, it's better than I was
      getting before, which was nothing.''
     
      Child-support advocates contend that fears about privacy are overblown when
      weighed against such successes.
     
      (End Optional Trim)
     
      As of 1997, the latest year for which figures available, more than 7.4 million
      delinquents owed more than $43 billion in past child support. The system has
      helped boost support payments from $12 billion in 1996 to $14.4 billion last year,
      officials said. And in 1997, the burgeoning system helped enforcement programs
      locate more than 1.2 million delinquents.
     
      The system is essentially an electronic dragnet. It collects the names, Social
      Security numbers and other data about every newly hired employee in the nation
      from employers, who also must provide pay reports for most wage-earning adults.
      States ship along the names and other identifying information of people who
      receive state unemployment insurance.
     
      The Administration for Children and Families, a part of the Department of Health
      and Human Services, serves as a sort of clearinghouse that automatically
      matches all of that information against a file of nearly 12 million child support
      cases to locate parents obligated to pay support.
     
      Then the agency provides information about those parents -- no matter whether
      they are behind on payments -- to the appropriate state enforcement workers.
      The idea is to track the parents across state lines.
     
      Supporters of the system note that Congress explicitly restricted access to it.
      Those authorized to use the information include the Social Security
      Administration, which can use the directory of new hires to verify unemployment
      reports; the Treasury Department, which can use it to cross-reference
      tax-deduction claims; and researchers, who gain access only to anonymous
      data.
     
      Next month, financial institutions that operate in multiple states will begin
      comparing a list of more than 3 million known delinquents against their customer
      accounts. Under federal law, the institutions are obligated to return the names,
      Social Security numbers and account details of delinquents they turn up.
     
      The Administration for Children and Families will then forward that financial
      information to the appropriate states. For security reasons, Kharfen said, the
      agency will not mix the financial data with information about new hires, wages
      and the like. Bank account information will be deleted after 90 days.
     
      In a test run this spring, Wells Fargo identified 72,000 customers whom states
      have identified as delinquents. NationsBank found 74,000 alleged delinquents in
      its test.
     
      (Begin Optional Trim)
     
      Civil liberties activists say it would be a mistake to consider the system solely in
      terms of finding bad parents and making them pay up. They worry that the
      network sets a new standard for data surveillance by using computers to
      cross-reference hundreds of millions of personal records about Americans.
     
      Over the past quarter-century, since the Privacy Act was enacted in 1974, the
      federal government has tried to place limits on how its officials could compare
      databases to find or profile people. And in general, the government was supposed
      to limit data collection about people who paid taxes, received a federal benefit,
      served in the military or tangled with the judicial system.
     
      Critics say this new effort leaps beyond those practices by systematically
      creating centralized files about workers, wages and families, and sifting through
      those files to find a relatively small number of suspected deadbeats.
     
      The new registry of child-support cases, for example, now requires the names of
      all parents and children involved, even if they do not receive public assistance or
      ask for help in getting a problem resolved. The registry has information about
      nearly 12 million families.
     
      There is also concern about the government's reliance on private employers and
      financial institutions to watch citizens. A proposal last year to require banks to
      routinely track customer transactions for signs of criminal activity prompted an
      outpouring of protest. Regulators ditched the plan, called Know Your Customer,
      this spring after acknowledging they had misstepped.
     
      Taylor Burke, vice president of Burke & Herbert Bank & Trust Co. in Alexandria,
      Va., said he doesn't believe banks should be asked to watch their customers so
      closely on behalf of the government. ``We're all good citizens. But it doesn't mean
      we spy on our neighbors,'' Burke said. ``It's really scary.''
     
      A review of the swift development of the system has turned up still other
      questions about whether the government paid enough attention to privacy --
      particularly at a time when the issue has become a flash point in public policy
      debates across the country.
     
      As the system was phased in, officials posted federally required notices only in
      the Federal Register. No additional information has been added to W-4 forms that
      people must fill out when taking a new job.
     
      In addition to the issues raised by the GAO about the security of computer
      systems gathering and transmitting personal information, the systems in about a
      dozen states also have not been certified by federal officials as meeting security
      and privacy guidelines.
     
      Officials in OMB and the Administration for Children and Families sought to allay
      fears about mistakes. While acknowledging they have no idea about the likely
      rate of errors because no study was conducted, officials said the program verifies
      the accuracy of any Social Security numbers before sending data along to the
      states.
     
      In addition, officials said, individuals in every state will have an opportunity to
      appeal administrative actions. Virginia, for instance, will give parents up to 10
      days before seizing assets, a state official said.
     
      Critics wonder what might happen to someone who is away on vacation or
      business. ``A Social Security number is not a bullet-proof identifier. There are
      always going to be mistakes,'' said Mary J. Culnan, a business professor at
      Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, who drew an analogy
      to problems with the accuracy of credit reports in the early 1990s.
     
      Finally, the operation appears to be at odds with the Clinton administration's
      recent push to make privacy a priority. Last month, Clinton called on banks and
      other financial institutions to give consumers more control over how their
      information is gathered and used. ``President Clinton believes that consumers
      deserve notice and choice about the use of their personal information,'' said a
      White House memo about the event.
     
      (End Optional Trim)
     
      The assurances of officials do little to assuage the fears of people who worry
      about the potential ills of having a government that closely monitors its citizens.
     
      Such anxieties have been underscored by mistakes child-support enforcement
      workers have made in recent years. Last year, officials in Virginia had to
      apologize to 2,300 parents for misidentifying them as delinquent and announcing
      they would lose their hunting and fishing licenses. Officials attributed the mistake
      to a computer programming error. ``We're not perfect,'' a state official said at the
      time.
     
      California officials also misidentified hundreds of men after it began the federally
      mandated, data-driven crackdown on deadbeats. In some cases, they confused
      men who had similar names.
     
      ``In my estimation, this is going to be nothing more than a huge invasion of
      privacy,'' said James Dean of Oshkosh, Wis., who was unable to get a fishing
      license because he refused to provide his Social Security number.

 18.0 GSM Mobile Security is Cracked 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The A5/1 over-the-air voice privacy algorithm used by
      almost all GSM digital phones is no longer secure. A5/1
      is the algorithm used by GSM phones to encrypt
      communications. It is theorized that software to
      decrypt captured conversations will be available within a
      year. The COMP128 algorithm used to authenticate GSM
      phones for network access, was cracked last year.

      GSM mobile security is cracked
      By DAN TEBBUTT
    
      22jun99
    
      DIGITAL mobile phone users could soon face the threat of
      eavesdropping, following a breakthrough reverse engineering effort in
      the United States. 
    
      Three California researchers say they have cloned the secret
      encryption method used to secure Global System for Mobile (GSM)
      communications. 
    
      Research leader Marc Briceno predicted unscrambling software could
      appear before the end of the year, following academic papers studying
      possible faults in the A5/1 over-the-air voice privacy algorithm. 
    
      This standard is used in nearly all digital mobile phones in Australia. 
    
      Inherent flaws in the security technology suggested special cracking
      hardware devices could unscramble GSM conversations within seconds,
      according to Mr Briceno, director of the US-based Smartcard
      Developers Association. 
    
      A network of personal computers could unlock the encryption method
      within a matter of hours. 
    
      "Mobile users should be worried about this," he said. 
    
      "Calls can be intercepted by a moderately motivated adversary who by
      no means needs to be a cryptography expert. 
    
      "The telecommunications providers' promise that GSM is secure with
      respect to random listeners can certainly no longer be maintained." 
    
      The reverse engineering project would allow greater public scrutiny over
      closely guarded GSM security technologies, he said. 
    
      The reference implementation would allow academic cryptographers to
      probe for deficiencies in A5/1. 
    
      "Once the holes are found, any competent programmer can write an
      implementation to exploit those shortcomings." 
    
      Vodafone technical director Jonathan Withers warned against
      over-stating theoretical problems. 
    
      "Practical attacks are pretty hard," he said. 
    
      But Mr Withers confirmed that GSM security standards were watered
      down after concerns were raised by law enforcement agencies. 
    
      "A5/1 is set at a level that is deemed appropriate and acceptable by
      law enforcement," he said. 
    
      Telstra and Optus representatives declined to comment. 
    
      Australian Communications Authority standards and compliance manager
      Grant Symons defended digital security as adequate for the job. 
    
      "The GSM algorithm has proven its worth for people engaged in
      everyday business and social activities. We're not talking about the
      military here," he said. 
    
      Mr Briceno said the synthesised algorithm was so functionally similar to
      the real A5/1 code that it could complete published GSM encryption
      benchmarks. 
    
      Last year he was part of a University of California, Berkeley, team that
      broke the COMP128 algorithm used to authenticate GSM phones for
      network access  prompting fears of billing fraud on digital mobile
      phones. 
    
      "In a business environment, where people believe their call is secure,
      the cost of eavesdropping could be a lot more than a few dollars on a
      phone bill," Mr Briceno said.

      Forbes;
      
      Is Microsoft a threat to national security?

      IN SEPTEMBER 1997, the USS Yorktown, the Navy's first "smart
      ship," was conducting routine maneuvers off Cape Charles, Va.
      Things were fine until the onboard computer system, powered 
      by Microsoft NT software, crashed, leaving the ship dead in 
      the water for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 

      Communications were knocked out. Weapons systems were down.
      The propulsion system wouldn't restart. If you think rebooting
      your laptop after it freezes is a drag, how would you like to 
      try and reboot an entire battle cruiser? 

      Was it sabotage or an
      electromagnetic pulse? Nothing so
      dramatic: The computer was simply asked to divide by
      zero. 

      Officials were quick to exonerate Microsoft for the
      glitch, claiming it was human error, and the Navy
      continues to install Windows NT servers on all its
      cruisers and destroyers, some 84 ships in all.
      Perhaps Navy brass haven't heard the joke making the
      rounds in military computer circles: What does NT
      stand for? Needs towing. 

      The question is, What would have happened if this had
      occurred in battle? 

      Of course, the Navy should modernize its fleet,
      incorporating the best computer technology this
      nation's geeks can create within the fabric of its ships.
      Should the Navy rely on Microsoft products, which
      have proved to be unstable, unreliable, hard to
      troubleshoot and riddled with security holes? It is
      ironic that as one part of the U.S. government goes
      after Microsoft in court, accusing it of monopolistic
      practices, Microsoft is quietly gaining a monopoly over
      another part. 

      Hackers--and now virus makers--have long delighted in
      taunting the "Satan from Redmond," churning out
      software programs that exploit holes in Microsoft
      products. Some of them have deliciously crude
      names, too, like Back Orifice, a software program
      originally created by a group called The Cult of the
      Dead Cow. Because Back Orifice enables a user to
      control and monitor a Windows operating system over
      a network without being detected, it is on just about
      every good hacker's laptop. It is easy to find--type it
      into almost any search engine and you'll encounter
      lists of sites that offer it as a free download. 

      What is particularly distressing is the emergence of
      the Microsoft mono-technology culture, in which its
      many products are tightly bundled together--Windows
      OS plus Microsoft Excel plus Microsoft Word plus
      Microsoft Outlook E-mail could very well equal big
      trouble. As Microsoft's dominance grows, Microsoft
      users become even more vulnerable. 

      Case in point: In March, the Melissa virus swept
      America, spreading when a user opened an attached
      Microsoft Word file. Upon activation, it looked for
      Outlook--Microsoft's E-mail, newsreader and personal
      information manager--created a message, and sent it
      to the first 50 people listed in the user's address book.
      Thankfully, the virus did not destroy or alter data, or
      trash hard drives, but it did flood networks with E-mail.
      This was not true of "Explore.exe," an Internet worm
      named for the file that launches it. In June,
      Explore.exe erased billions of gigs of information
      around the world. 

      Melissa and Explore.exe received wide coverage in the
      media, but you may not have heard of the most recent
      Microsoft security hole in Microsoft's Internet
      Information Server, which, according to eEye Digital
      Security Team, left approximately 90% of 1.3 million
      Microsoft web servers vulnerable to hack attacks. It
      seems that as soon as Microsoft develops a patch to
      combat a new exploit, someone comes up with a new
      one. By the time you read this column, I wouldn't
      doubt that more holes will be identified and plugged. 

      "No one knows what evil lurks in these 40 million lines
      of Windows NT code," says Rick Forno, author of The
      Art of Information Warfare. "You have to roll the dice
      and take your chances." 

      His solution: Buy a Mac. They are virtually
      unhackable, he says. And he's not kidding. 

      But Forno, who truly believes that Microsoft is a threat
      to our nation's security, has other ideas, too. He
      proposes a kind of software version of the Underwriters
      Laboratory, a not-for-profit product safety testing group
      for electronics that has been around since 1894. It is
      responsible for the "UL-approved" stickers you see on
      lamps, Christmas tree lights and clock radios. 

      As for me, I'd like to change the model by which
      software companies peddle their products. Instead of
      allowing them to license software, which lets them
      dodge responsibility for poor quality, software vendors
      should be held liable for glitches that lead to security
      snafus and crashes. If you bought a car with locks on
      the door that didn't work properly, odds are the
      manufacturer would be held liable. So should software
      makers. 

      In addition, the government, and corporations, could
      lessen the impact of the next round of Melissa viruses
      or Explore.exe worms by relying on more than one
      operating system. The less we depend on one type of
      operating system, the less vulnerable we are. 

      Of course, this runs smack into Bill Gates'
      monopolistic vision: to place Windows on every
      computer, PDA, Navy ship and toaster. But Gates is
      only the richest man in the world, not the only
      software vendor in town. 

      And that's how he should be treated. 

      Do you think heavy reliance on Microsoft products
      threatens our national security? Let me know in my
      forum.

                          Cyberspace Underwriters Laboratories
                                 [2]tan@l0pht.com
                                         
      Cyberspace Underwriters Laboratories - 01/11/1999
      Underwriters Laboratory
      
      Underwriters Laboratories was founded in 1894 by an electrical
      inspector from Boston, William Henry Merrill. In 1893, Chicago
      authorities grew concerned over the public safety due to the
      proliferation of untamed DC circuits and the new, even more dangerous
      technology of AC circuits. These new and little-understood
      technologies threatened our society with frequent fires which caused
      critics to question if the technology could ever be harnessed safely.
      Merrill was called in and setup a one-room laboratory with $350.00 in
      electrical test equipment and published his first report on March 24,
      1894.
      
      Back in Boston, insurance underwriters rejected Merrill's plans for a
      non-biased testing facility for certification of electrical devices.
      Chicago however, embraced the idea. Merrill took advantage of the
      situation in Chicago to get up and running and within months had
      support at the national level.
      
      Today, UL has tested over 12,500 products world-wide and is a
      internationally recognized authority on safety and technology. The UL
      mark of approval has come to provide an earned level of trust between
      customers and manufacturers and safely allowed our society to leverage
      hundreds of inventions that would have otherwise been unfit for public
      use.
      
      While originally targeting inventions which could potentially cause
      physical harm to the user, the UL has expanded into the listing of
      alarm system products as well as alarm system installers. Individual
      products are listed as meeting UL standards and the companies that
      install those products are also listed as qualified to install the
      product as intended. Insurance companies have leveraged the UL's
      scrutiny to properly ascertain their risks.
      
      Cyberspace
      
      Today, technology continues to grow at a rapid pace, perhaps even out
      of control. The commercialization of the Internet has led many
      businesses to offer services out there in what has been called the
      Wild Wild West (WWW). As a result, the public safety is at risk.
      Utilities are bridging control systems to Internet attached
      back-office systems. Banks are offering 'cyber-banking' and merchants
      are collecting information about consumers as they transact their
      business over the Web. Individual privacy and the fiduciary trust
      banks and merchants have established over hundreds of years are open
      to new threats as these activities become more and more prevalent.
      
      Similarly to early electrical inventions, today's computer security
      products may introduce more harm than good when implemented by end
      users. While some of these products do what they claim, most do not.
      The lack of standards and meaningful certification has allowed the
      sale of products that are either intentionally or unintentionally
      snake-oil. While many of the products may solve old problems and
      inadvertently introduce worse ones, some just do not perform as
      advertised at all. For instance, some products have been marketed as
      utilizing the latest and greatest encryption mechanisms when in fact,
      the version they are selling does not utilize any encryption at all.
      
      Just as in the late 1800's, the consumers have little understanding of
      the inventions they are purchasing. They are presented with claims by
      the product's marketers and have no way of proving those claims to be
      true or false. Just as it was back then, this has not stopped the
      large-scale application of these inventions, regardless of public
      safety. In the late 1900's, nobody has stepped up to the plate to
      expand the UL's role into computer security products or to take that
      role as their own. To some extent, groups like Nomad Mobile Research
      Center and L0pht Heavy Industries have acted as modern day Merrill's,
      publishing non-biased findings to this affect.
      
      This is not to say that certification of computer security products
      has not been attempted in the past. ICSA for instance, operates a
      certification program for products. CISSP and other organizations also
      offer certification of information security professionals. These
      organizations however, have failed drastically at providing what the
      UL has provided on a more general 'technology' level. These failures
      could be examined in detail but such an excersise is outside the scope
      of this article.
      
      The bottom line for ICSA is that it does not have the rigorous
      standards that the UL has and its credibility has suffered as a
      result. ICSA fails to see the certification process as ongoing or
      cyclical allowing for products to inherit their 'certification'. As a
      result, it is believed by some that there is a problem in that there
      is a lack of non-biased inspection of software and that money buys
      more certifications than good product design and implementation.
      
      CISSP certifies individuals in the computer security industry. While
      sorting out those who are fluent in the industry jargin and concept,
      the work of CISSP's still lacks accountability in that their
      certification is tied to a test rather than what the UL referrs to as
      a 'field counter-check'. Like most computer certifications however,
      this is simply a test of test-taking skills rather than a test of
      experience and understanding.
      
      Cyber-UL
      
      Product certification needs to be performed on every version of a
      product. Small changes that could ripple through traditional
      technologies causing safety problems are at least ten fold when
      applied to computer software. Many similarities may be drawn between
      the certification of computer security products and the listing of
      alarm systems and components that UL performs today.
      
      UL has a stringent set of tests which are performed on physical
      security systems which seek UL listing. For instance, safes and vaults
      have a number of different labels which indicate their adherence to
      different standards. UL utilizes 'young hotshot' safe-crackers wishing
      to make a name for themselves, to do the actual testing. This way,
      specialists are motivated (by not only fame but by financial
      compensation as well) to validate the claims that the vendors'
      marketing people want to make. The entire safe and vault business
      operates around these ratings to communicate to the customer what it
      is that the product was designed to do. Based on value and risk, a
      customer may choose to spend more or less on higher or lower rated
      labels.
      
      The two major factors which influence the level of rating are time and
      tools. The 'hotshot' safe-crackers are given samples of the product
      and guidelines for their attempts to defeat its security. For
      instance, a TL-30 rating means that the cracker is limited to tools
      not including torches or explosives and is given 30 minutes of actual
      working time to defeat the security. If X6 is appended to the rating,
      the rating applies to not only the door, but the container (the rest
      of the safe). This aligns the vendor's claims to the actual
      performance of the product. Also, if a new version of the safe comes
      out, it does not inherit the old version's listing, it must be
      re-listed.
      
      This addresses a big problem that was sure to arise with safe vendors
      and has definitely risen in the computer security arena. Customers,
      due to human nature, want products to be certified as 'secure'. Just
      as customers like to hear promises of security, vendors love to make
      them. In 1913, UL tested the first 'security devices'. With this
      expansion into security devices, they recognized the need to replace
      the word 'Approved' with the words 'Inspected' or 'Listed'. Due to
      what UL has established with security devices, customers are not
      lulled into a false sense of security and vendors do not make
      outrageous claims. Customers are presented with 'product x is rated at
      rating y' rather than 'its ICSA certified'. Vendors claim to be
      resistant to certain toolsets for certain amounts of time. This is not
      what the computer security field looks like today, but is where it
      needs to go. The manufacturer and consumer must realize that testing
      'security' is not the same as testing 'functionality' and because of
      that, claims need to be adjusted to fit reality. If a door-knob opens
      a door, the door works. If a safe-lock opens when you dial the
      combination, it does not mean the safe works. You can however, perform
      tests on the safe to assure that it operates as advertised within
      certain heat and force constraints.
      
      While listing individual devices as meeting UL standards is useful to
      a security professional or consumer, it is only a small part of the
      picture. Installation and configuration of components is critical to
      the actual effectiveness of the security solution. For this reason,
      installation of alarm systems is another area of influence for the UL.
      This may seem like a daunting task since the number of implementations
      is exponential to the number of products. UL has, with only about
      4,000 employees, listed more than 12,500 products in over 40 countries
      and developed over 600 standards for product safety. The tact taken to
      assure the correct installation of alarm systems has been to list
      alarm installation companies. Systems installed by UL listed companies
      may qualify for a UL issued certificate. The certificate registers the
      customer's alarm system becomes an eligible candidate for 'field
      counter-checks' (spot-audits) which are performed to assure that
      listed installers are not cutting corners. If a system which has
      received a certificate fails the field counter-check, the installer
      could potentially loose their UL listing. The UL has maintained a
      quality program by scaling the number of field counter-checks as
      needed.
      
      Problems with the model
      
      While the UL model for security devices seems to address many of the
      same issues that surround Cyberspace, there are a number of problems
      with deploying the model for computer security devices as it stands.
      
      The first problem is that if a security system is defeated in the
      physical world, it is typically very obvious to those who come into
      work on Monday and see that the money is gone and the safe is in
      pieces. Detection of a cyber intrusion is typically NOT very obvious
      to those who come into work on Monday. Because of this fact,
      safe-crackers have very limited time to crack a vault. Hackers on the
      other hand, have unlimited time to crack a system. Once they get in,
      safe crackers typically REMOVE items which then become 'missing'.
      Hackers typically COPY items unless their motives are political rather
      than financial, leaving the originals and the system intact. For cyber
      intrusions to become less surreptitious, intrusion detection needs to
      mature and become more widely deployed if 'time' is to be a meaningful
      factor in the process.
      
      The commercial model is based around the storage of valuables,
      particularly jewelry and cash. In addition to the (American) UL
      standards (TL-15, TL-30, TRTL-30, TRTL-15/6, TRTL-30/6, TXTL-60),
      there is a German standard (A,B,C1,C2,D 10, D20, E 10) and a
      Scandinavian standard (60-80, 80-100, 100-120, 120-140, 140-160,
      160-180, 180-200, 200-240, 240-280, 280-320, 320-360). All three are
      based on time and tools. Time and tools is an excellent set of
      criteria for rating computer security components in areas such as
      encryption. In America, the various insurance agencies determine what
      rating is required for them to insure a given amount to be stored in
      the safe or vault. In Europe, the Dutch Safe Rating Committee
      publishes a similar standard assigning a range of financial value to
      each rating in each of the three systems.
      
      This does not, however, address liability for storage of information
      such as credit ratings, social security numbers, bank balances, web
      surfing preferences, political affiliations, which is subject not only
      to theft but to alteration or even just surreptitious access. When
      storing sensitive information, a more appropriate place to look for
      examples is to the government. Classified information presents many of
      the same requirements for storage that sensitive information on the
      public or even commercial interests.
      
      To meet the U.S. Government's needs in this area, General Services
      Administration (GSA) has published standards (classes 1-8, black, red,
      green and blue labels) which rate storage containers for everything
      from weapons to information processing systems to filing cabinets.
      They additionally publish information on storage of confidential,
      secret, and top-secret materials in GSA Approved (or Non-GSA Approved)
      containers. This information includes additional requirements for
      alarm systems, restricted building access, guard check points, etc...
      Specifics on GSA classes and labels are seemingly difficult to come
      by. Based on the information I have found in the document library of
      locks.nfsec.navy.mil/document_library/guides however, much of what has
      been worked out by the GSA could potentially serve as a foundation for
      developing similar standards for the storage of information on the
      public.
      
      The U.S. Department of Commerce has commissioned the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to maintain FIPS PUB
      140-1, Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules. The document
      sets forth a standard for specification of cryptographic-based
      security systems protecting unclassified information. It provides for
      product ratings from 1 to 4 with 1 being lame and 4 being k-rad. This
      range is designed to cover a wide range of data sensitivity, from 'low
      value administrative data' to 'million dollar funds transfers' to
      'life protecting data'. The standard is typically utilized for devices
      which protect tokens or encrypt data such as crypto boxes.
      
      While this system may or may not be successful in real life, it
      certainly deserves closer examination in that it represents what may
      be the closest thing that the U.S. Government has to UL for computer
      security products. Under the FIPS 140-1 Testing and Validation model,
      vendors select an accredited FIPS 140-1 testing lab, submit their
      'module' for testing and pay the testing fee. The lab then tests the
      product for conformance to FIPS 140-1 and passes a report on the
      'module' to NIST/CSE for validation. Throughout this process, the lab
      may submit questions for guidance and clarification to NIST/CSE. If
      the report is favorable, a validation certificate is issued by
      NIST/CSE for the 'module'. The certificate is presented to the vendor
      through the lab and the 'module' is added to the published list of
      Validated FIPS 140-1 Modules.
      
      The problem may stem from the difference between UL's roots and those
      of ICSA and CISSP. It certainly manifested itself in the fact that the
      UL is the only one providing non-biased product inspections as well as
      accountability for the quality of the installations out there in the
      field. Requirements for the use of 'listed' intrusion detection
      systems, encryption mechanisms, and companies could on its own make an
      impact if that listing actually meant something. The use of strict
      procedures and specific levels of physical security could be required
      as in the GSA model and this too could help the private sector. This
      has not been the tact taken to date, however.
      
      The second problem is that manufacturers of physical security devices
      are pressured by customers to have a UL listing. This is because
      customers are pressured by insurance underwriters to use products that
      meet UL specifications. In Cyberspace, businesses currently feel that
      the embarrassment and loss of public trust are more costly than the
      actual damage caused by hackers. Citibank has become the most
      well-known example of what happens when computer intrusions are made
      public knowledge. By taking commendable actions and not covering up
      the intrusion, Citibank is now known as the bank that got hacked
      instead of the bank that handled the situation appropriately. Since
      silence seems to be the best policy, cyber merchants choose to 'eat'
      their losses rather than risk the negative publicity. Until these
      losses become intolerable and insurance is necessary, there may be no
      motivation to drive the certification, approval or listing of products
      by UL or any similar organization.
      
      It took UL about 30 years from being subsidized by the insurance
      agencies to being self-supporting off fees paid by manufacturers for
      testing. Merrill was the first full-time employee as a result of this
      change. Insurance underwriters and Consumer Product Safety Commission
      were instrumental in gaining public acceptance of UL work. It was the
      public's safety that was of concern and liability drove companies to
      insure. Insurance underwriters found they were then saddled with the
      problem and addressed it effectively with the UL. Perhaps at some
      point the collection and storage of information on the public will
      carry some sort of liability with it.
      
      A Call for Action
      
      Without a call for action, I would simply be a whiner. At this point,
      you the reader can assist with very little effort. Whether you are a
      vendor, insurance company, end user, or hacker, let me know your
      thoughts on the state of the industry, the state of the UL and/or this
      article's conclusions. As a hacker, is the relationship between the
      hot-shot safe crackers and the UL an attractive one you would be
      interested in? Is the UL listing process for installations sufficient?
      Will it encounter problems unforeseen by this article? As an insurer,
      am I missing part of the picture; are companies actually insuring
      their computer systems and data to mitigate loss or liability? As a
      manufacturer do you foresee problems with the UL model being imposed
      on computer security products? As an end user do you feel that
      computer security is important? Do you feel that the current system
      actually is sufficient? Have you been wanting something better or do
      you feel that you are being slighted by my insinuation that you do not
      fully understand the products you purchase? Any and all feedback on
      this article would be appreciated no matter where it comes from
      (although manufacturer comments will be taken with a grain of salt).
      Forward those comments to tan@l0pht.com. If there is enough feedback,
      I may write a follow up article on this topic. I am considering going
      into detail on each rating system UL, German, Scandinavian, GSA and
      FIPS 140-1, highlighting overlaps with the computer security
      discepline.
      
      Thanks to the UL for providing documentation on the history of the UL
      and directing me to Peter Tallman of the Melville, N.Y. office. Thanks
      to Peter Tallman for clarifying some of the issues surrounding the
      listing of safes and alarm systems and directing me to Beverly
      Borowski whom I hope can assist me in my future research. Also of use
      to date was FED-STD-809, the federal standard for neutralization and
      repair of GSA approved containers as well as a yearly publication by
      the Dutch Safe Rating Committee called 'Recommendations for Insuring
      Money in Safes and Strongrooms'. GSA's web site (www.gsa.gov) provides
      a searchable index of federal standards including FED-STD-809. The
      Dutch Safe Rating Committee is at Stichting Kwaliteitsbeoordeling
      Brandkasten (SKB), P.O. Box 85764, 2508 CL The Hague, The Netherlands
      - Tel. 070-3912008. Additional thanks to the researchers at the L0pht
      for their assistance, particularly to Brian Oblivion for providing
      extensive documentation on FIPS 140-1.

             Security Watch | Stuart McClure and Joel Scambray

      Portals open on security landscape
       
      AS SECURITY GROWS into a major concern for IT shops, a number of online security portals have
      sprouted up. These offer nearly everything you'll need to manage security at your site. A number of
      Web pages have begun in the last couple of months, but the most impressive ones are just now
      opening. We have frequented many in our security travels, and we think that Securityfocus.com, a site
      debuting the week of June 26, looks the most promising for providing comprehensive and one-stop
      security information.
       
      Since we started Security Watch more than a year ago, we've seen our column's name borrowed by a
      number of people. Now you'll have to add Securitywatch.com, in Belgium, to that list
      (www.securitywatch.com). According to its semiveiled Web page, the site will debut July 5 and will
      offer the usual security news, products, trends, jobs, literature, and links. But, like Securityfocus.com,
      Securitywatch.com also promises a vulnerability database. The depth and breadth of its vulnerability
      archive remains to be seen, however, as we have yet to receive an offer to preview this site (surprise,
      surprise).
       
      One of the earliest collections of security resources on the Internet came from SecuriTeam.com. The
      site has been available for more than a few months and offers security news, reviews, exploits, and
      tools. Although its content isn't as complete or as well organized as that of some others, it offers a
      decent set of security resources and timely vulnerabilities that we have frequented and highly
      recommend checking out.
       
      SecurityPortal.com has been around for a number of months and offers a fairly good set of security
      content including a weekly column, security news, discussion forums, services, a research center
      (links and resources), and even an online store. It also offers a centralized location to search for
      computer security jobs at all the major career sites, including Career Builder, Career Mosaic, and
      Monster Board.
       
      SecureZone.com is a relative newcomer and at first glance looks much like a general search engine.
      The site offers a variety of security information and resources, and even allows you to add your URL
      to its site. But unlike Securityfocus.com and Securitywatch.com, SecureZone does not offer its own
      vulnerability database. Also, we experienced delays when using the site; be prepared for a wait. The
      site is run by En Garde Systems (www.engarde.com), the product vendor that offers the nifty security
      software T-Sight and IP-Watcher.
       
      The heavy hitter
       
      Combine the Bugtraq archive (www.geek-girl.com), Packet Storm's exploits and tools
      (www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman), and Hacker News Network's timely news
      (www.hackernews.com), and you'll barely scratch the surface of the content provided on
      Securityfocus.com (www.securityfocus.com). The new Web site should be up this week and will offer
      one of the best collections of security resources available on the Internet. We got a sneak peak at this
      site and were duly impressed.
       
      For starters, Securityfocus. com offers one of the most up-to-date security news sections available.
      Also included on the site are security tools, products, books, an events calendar, and forums. But
      unlike many of its competitors, Securityfocus.com offers a robust -- and free -- vulnerability
      database. The site also lets you query for only the technology that's important to you. For example, if
      you're primarily a Solaris 2.51 shop running Netscape Enterprise Server, you can query only the
      relevant vulnerabilities. You can personalize the entire Web site by selecting the type of news,
      calendar events, products, tools, and vulnerabilities you care about. Securityfocus.com will also
      provide a free applet for your desktop that will warn you as soon as a relevant vulnerability is released.
       
      Securityfocus.com is the brainchild of the original Secure Networks group. The team created the
      Ballista security scanner product (now named CyberCop Scanner from Network Associates) and has
      discovered numerous product vulnerabilities on its own. Aleph One, the moderator and caretaker of
      the Bugtraq mailing list (one of the most widely subscribed computer lists in the world), has added his
      muscle to the site in offering the entire Bugtraq archive as part of the vulnerability database. Also, the
      entire Bugtraq mailing list will be moved to Securityfocus.com so archives can be searched. 
       
      After witnessing the birth of so many security portals on the Internet during the past year, we can't
      help but wonder what's next for the security community. Personally, we wouldn't mind seeing the
      paging service that warns administrators about new vulnerabilities the minute they become public, or
      maybe the downloading of daily security news to your Pilot with AvantGo (www.avantgo.com). In any
      case, the future is definitely bright for security professionals. Check out these portals and let us know
      which ones you'll be visiting at security_watch@infoworld.com.

 21.0 MS Gives Out Pirate Dough

      Microsoft is planning to give away up to $25 million over
      the next five years, or half of it proceeds from its
      antipiracy efforts, toward technology access and

      it will receive aprox $10 million in civil and criminal

      Microsoft Shares Piracy Loot
      Reuters 

      3:00 a.m.  29.Jun.99.PDT
      Microsoft plans to give away half its
      proceeds from efforts to crack down on
      software piracy, or at least US$25 million
      over the next five years, a company
      executive said. 

      Brad Smith, general counsel for worldwide
      sales and support for Microsoft, said the
      software company is seeing a growing
      stream of revenue from settlements and
      criminal penalties assessed against
      counterfeiters. 


       See also: Germany Jails Software Pirate


      "Obviously we rely heavily on law
      enforcement for support," Smith said.
      "Given that support from the public
      sector, we felt it was proper to share
      some of these recoveries with the
      communities that, like the company, are
      suffering from piracy." 

      He said that Microsoft, which had $14.5
      billion in revenues last year, expects at
      least $10 million in civil and criminal
      antipiracy proceeds annually over the
      next five years, although he said the
      company is spending more than that on
      efforts to enforce software laws. 

      Smith said piracy is not necessarily
      growing, but authorities are increasing
      their enforcement in part because many
      large counterfeiting operations are
      connected to organized crime. 

      "The reason we go after it so much is
      because we're cutting off a major source
      of funding for criminal syndicates," said
      Marc Frank, a Westminster, California,
      police sergeant who heads the
      multi-agency Asian Organized Crime Task
      Force. 

      "It's not because we're the Microsoft
      police," he said. "It's because we're
      hitting the organized criminal syndicate
      where it hurts them -- in the
      pocketbook." 

      The task force's efforts culminated this
      year with a raid on a factory in the
      southern California city where officers
      found $2.5 million in manufacturing
      equipment and more than $40 million
      worth of counterfeit Microsoft Windows,
      Office, and other programs. A total of 11
      people have been arrested or indicted in
      connection with the raid, Frank said. 

      Microsoft's donations will go toward
      technology access and education
      projects around the world, Smith said.

      The Home Shopping Network will introduce biometric

      Giving Voice to Net Security
      by Leander Kahney 
      
      3:00 a.m.  29.Jun.99.PDT
      The Home Shopping Network next month
      will be able to automatically identify
      customers on the phone by their voices. 
      
      In the first large-scale deployment of its
      kind, HSN's speech-print service will allow
      frequent shoppers to dispense with
      passwords and personal identification
      numbers, the company said. 
      
      
       See also: Biometric Banking Bides Time
      
      
      Voice recognition is just the first step:
      HSN said it hopes to completely automate
      the ordering process by the end of the
      year. 
      
      Based on technology from Nuance
      Communications, the voiceprint system
      will ask callers for their phone numbers.
      Callers will then be passed on to human
      order-takers to complete the purchase. 
      
      "[Voice-recognition systems] are a lot
      more convenient for the customer and
      can save the company a lot of money,"
      said Steve Ehrlich, Nuance's vice
      president of marketing. 
      
      Automated phone-ordering systems can
      cost 90 percent less than conventional,
      human-operated systems, according to
      Ehrlich, who said Charles Schwab will roll
      out a similar system later this year. 
      
      He said the technology handles a number
      of languages and copes well with regional
      accents and things like bad phone lines
      and stuffy noses. 
      
      In addition to convenience, the
      technology will help HSN build a detailed
      database of its customers, said Bill
      Meisel, editor and publisher of the Speech
      Recognition Update, a monthly
      newsletter. 
      
      Currently, a household is issued a single
      verification number by HSN. 
      
      The voiceprint technology will allow the
      company to identify and collect data on
      individual members in a household, Meisel
      said. 
      
      "These are the kind of subtle advantages
      that make fraud prevention almost a
      secondary consideration," he said. 
      
      However, Meisel said the voiceprint
      system will be more secure than using a
      verification number. 
      
      To crack the system would require a
      wiretap to obtain an accurate recording
      of someone's voice, Meisel said. It should
      not be possible to simply use a tape
      recorder. 
      
      "The process of taping a voice changes
      its acoustic characteristics," he said. "It
      wouldn't work with a tape recorder ...
      practically speaking, it's very difficult [to
      crack the system]." 
      
      Meisel said similar voice-recognition
      systems are in use in prisons, where
      calling rights are a form of prison
      commerce.

     AntiOnline Tracks F0rpaxe 
     Tuesday, June 29, 1999 at 14:00:15
     by John Vranesevich - Founder of AntiOnline 

     AntiOnline investigations into the recent wave of attacks being
     done by a group known as 'F0rpaxe' has led to the discovery of
     the true-life-identity of the group's leader, aka m1crochip.

     F0rpaxe is known to have broken into over 130 servers in the
     past two months, belonging to dozens of different organizations,
     including:

          NASA Goddard Space Flight Center 
          US Navy 
          US Coast Guard 
          US Department of Agriculture

          Georgetown University 
          University of Michigan 
          UC Davis 


     F0rpaxe officially 'Declared War' against the US government
     after the FBI raided several malicious hackers, including
     individuals known to be members of the 'gH' hacking group,
     which is believed to be responsible for attacks against the White
     House's Website. F0rpaxe released a statement earlier this
     month which read in part:

     We think that FBI should explain what a fuck they are doing.
     For the moment we wont destroy the servers we hack but if it
     is necessary we can burn alot of servers.

     M1crochip, along with several other F0rpaxe members, have
     been featured in several publications, including MSNBC and
     Wired News.

     F0rpaxe's latest attack took place yesterday, against servers at
     UCLA.

     AntiOnline was able to gain the name and phone number of
     m1crochip, who lives in the city of Perafita, Portugal, shortly
     after a request for information came in.

      critical services such as email on the same machine so
      when they took down the server to correct the
      defacement their email was also off line creating severe
      disruptions in office work flow.

      Hackers Hit Storm Prediction Web Site
            8:16 p.m. ET (017 GMT) June 29, 1999

      NORMAN, Okla.  Computer hackers vandalized the Web page of the top U.S.
      weather agency's storm prediction center Tuesday in the latest of a rash of attacks
      on government Internet sites, officials said. 
     
      The attack blocked the Internet weather warnings of the Storm Prediction Center,
      an arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), at a time of
      year when powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes can break out across the Plains
      states. 
     
      "If there were severe weather already happening at that time of morning, it could
      have been a problem for a lot of people,'' Dr Joseph Schaeffer, director of the
      Storm Prediction Center, told Reuters. 
     
      Hackers calling themselves the "Keebler Elves'' deleted the Storm Prediction
      Center homepage (www.spc.noaa.gov) and replaced it with their own page
      declaring "Learn to fear the elite''. 
     
      Schaeffer said the same storm forecasts were available elsewhere, including from
      the National Weather Service. 
     
      But he said the blockage was an inconvenience to emergency management
      officials, who are used to quick and easy Internet access to the center's updated
      weather maps and other data. 
     
      The attack was discovered at 3:00 a.m. EDT (0700 GMT) by someone trying to
      find weather data and reported quickly, so storm center technical staffers shut
      down the Web page. 
     
      Repairing the damage and tracing and recording the hacker's steps for potential
      future criminal prosecution would keep the Web site down until late Tuesday,
      officials said. 
     
      The damage also shut down the Web page of NOAA's Severe Storm Laboratory
      (www.ssl.noaa.gov), which is next door to the storm prediction center in Norman,
      Oklahoma. The Internet pages for both centers are run from the same computer,
      which was invaded by the hackers. 
     
      The U.S. Army earlier Tuesday said it had launched a criminal investigation into an
      electronic break-in of its main Internet site, but stressed that hackers did not breach
      military security or operations. 
     
      A hacker group also broke into four U.S. Department of Agriculture Web sites
      over the weekend, the USDA said. 
     
      Military and other government officials have voiced major concern over repeated
      break-ins in the past year by electronic wizards anxious to simply show their
      hacking ability or to actually steal secrets. 
     
      In March, a Pentagon-sponsored study ordered by Congress in 1995 concluded that
      military computer and communications systems were increasingly vulnerable to
      attack by hackers and high-tech enemies.

      Weather Web site hit by intruders
                     By Kathleen Ohlson


      The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
      (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center became the latest Web
      target of hackers when one or more intruders broke into the
      site. 

      Both the site and e-mail for the Storm Prediction Center,
      based in Norman, Okla., were taken down as soon as the
      infiltration was detected, said Tim Tomastik, the NOAA's
      deputy director of public affairs in Washington. Tomastik
      said the attack on the federal weather service forced its
      clients and customers to go to other sites for weather data.
      "It's weather data," he said. "There's no national security
      involved. I have no idea why they would go after it." 

      Officials are still trying to determine what, if any, damage
      was done to the site by the intrusion. So far, they know that
      some "real minor goofing with the text occurred," but
      nothing major, Tomastik said. 

      Yesterday, the U.S. Army Web site was breached (see
      story) and the home page defaced. 

      Tomastik said the NOAA is evaluating its system and
      expects federal authorities to look into what happened. The
      site is expected to be back up later today.

      Coming Soon: Back Orifice 2000
      by Niall McKay 

      3:00 a.m.  30.Jun.99.PDT
      An underground computer security group is poised to release a new version of a
      notorious software program that could allow crackers to watch and listen in on
      Windows-based PC users. 

      The Cult of the Dead Cow said it will release Back Orifice 2000 on 9 July -- at
      the annual Def Con convention in Las Vegas. 

      "This will demonstrate that Microsoft's operating systems are completely
      insecure and a bad choice for consumers and businesses who demand privacy,"
      said Oxblood Ruffian, a former United Nations consultant and current Cult of
      the Dead Cow spokesman.

      Def Con is perhaps the most unusual gathering in the computer security field.
      Hackers, crackers, and self-proclaimed security experts will mingle with media,
      security professionals, federal law enforcement officers, and "script kiddies"
      who deface Web pages with prefab cracking code. 

      Security groups of all stripes use the occasion to release software and show
      off gadgets. But Back Orifice 2000 is perhaps the most anticipated item. 

      Unlike previous versions of the software, Back Orifice 2000 will run on Windows NT
      and feature strong encryption and a modular architecture that the group said
      will allow hackers and other security groups to write plug-ins. 

      The program will be released as open source to encourage further development
      by the security community. 

      Back Orifice, released at last year's Def Con, may allow malicious users to monitor
      and tamper with computers without the permission or knowledge of their owners. 

      The program is classified as a Trojan Horse because crackers need to dupe the
      user into installing an application on their hard disk. Despite this, Oxblood Ruffian
      said that the program is currently installed on up to a half-million PCs
      worldwide. 

      Though that number could not be independently verified, an Australian
      computer security group last November said that 1,400 Australian Internet
      accounts have been compromised by Back Orifice. 

      Back Orifice 2000 also promises to be a great deal more difficult to detect than
      its predecessor because it enables users to configure its port setting. Previously,
      intrusion detection and antivirus programs could detect Back Orifice because it used
      a default port setting of 3113.  (Er that should read 31337 -Ed)

      A Microsoft Windows NT Server security manager said the company is closely
      monitoring Back Orifice development and is working with antivirus and intrusion
      detection software vendors to provide customers with utilities to combat the
      software. 
      
      
      "Trojan Horses are not technological issues but a social engineering problem
      because they rely on the ability of the cracker to trick the user into running an
      application," said Scott Culp.  

      "It's just a fact of computer science that if you run a piece of code on your
      machine you run the risk making your system vulnerable." 

      The solution, according to Culp, is to ensure that users do not install any
      software from untrusted sources and regularly update antivirus and intrusion
      detection programs. 

      Also at the show, independent security consulting firm L0pht Heavy Industries will
      release Anti-Sniffer, a network monitoring tool, and will announce B00te Call, a
      PalmPilot War Dialer. Such programs will automatically dial telephone numbers in
      sequence, looking for modems. 

      Zero-Knowledge Systems is also expected to provide further details about Freedom,
      a network of servers promising total online anonymity. 

      Def Con will also feature some of its legendary sideshow attractions, such as
      the Spot the Fed contest. In this game, conference attendees are invited to point
      out suspicious attendees who may be working for federal law enforcement
      agencies. Winners will be awarded an "I spotted the Fed" T-shirt. 

      Other diversions include a fancy dress ball, Hacker Jeopardy, and the Hacker
      Death Match, a game that enables hackers to take their flame mails out of
      cyberspace and into reality by dressing up in giant inflatable Sumo suits to do
      battle. 

      Well-heeled attendees are invited to a US$100 outing to Cirque du Soleil. 

      Meanwhile, the conference will include sessions on how to detect wiretaps; the
      art and science of enemy profiling; hacking ethics, morality, and patriotism;
      cyber-forensic analysis; and a talk on the practice of hiring hackers as security
      consultants.

      Defense employee faces probe
      over computer incident
  
      WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said today it is investigating an
      attempted computer security breach last week at a defense agency
      responsible for reviewing sensitive technology exports.
  
      An unidentified employee of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is
      under investigation for allegedly seeking unauthorized access to the
      computer system of a coworker, agency spokesman Clem Gaines said.
  
      Gaines said the employee under investigation by the Air Force Office
      of Special Investigations had requested access to the government
      computer used by Peter Leitner, a senior advisor to the defense agency
      on matters involving exports of sensitive technologies. Gaines declined
      to identify the individual.
  
      The individual's request for use of Leitner's computer was denied and
      there was no security breach, Gaines said.
  
      The unauthorized request for access to Leitner's computer was made
      June 24, while Leitner was on Capitol Hill testifying before the House
      Committee on Government Reform, Gaines said.
  
      Leitner has rankled some in the Pentagon by charging that senior
      defense officials have glossed over concerns in the lower ranks that
      U.S. businesses were allowed to sell China and other countries
      technology with military applications.
  
      Gaines, the agency spokesman, said he could not discuss any details of
      the computer security investigation, which was requested Monday by
      the agency's director, Jay Davis.
  
      Pending the outcome of the investigation, the individual has been
      temporarily assigned to other duties, which Gaines did not specify.

      sort of viruses can the world expect to see in the next
      six months or a year?

             New virus spills your beans 

             Virus threatens document security 

             A new strain of computer virus could distribute your
             highly confidential documents all over the Internet. 

             Anti-virus developers are warning that they cannot
             develop an antidote until the virus appears. Far from
             destroying vital files, the virus will make sure everyone
             can see them. 

             The new virus is expected to be a variant of either
             Melissa or the Explore.Zip worm, both of which have
             cost businesses millions in recent weeks. 

             Both Melissa and the Explore.Zip worm rely on people
             opening email attachments. Once into the computer the
             virus sends a message to everyone in the victim's in-box
             and then destroys every file written in Microsoft Word,
             Excel or Powerpoint, among others. 

             New virus on the block 

             One variant has already appeared. PrettyPark replicates
             itself by sending copies to everyone in the victim's
             address book. 

             It waits silently until the victim is on the Internet, then
             sends lists of the victim's user names, password files
             and address lists to Internet Relay Chat channels.
             Anti-virus developers are expecting the next step to be a
             virus which roots around in your files and then posts your
             documents across the Internet. 

             "The virus wouldn't be able to tell which of your
             documents are secret. It might just post your shopping
             list, or it could be a highly sensitive company document.

             "What's more, it would appear as if you sent it," says
             Graham Cluley of Sophos Anti-Virus. 

             Several anti-virus makers already have an answer to
             PrettyPark. But they cannot build a defence against
             future variants until they encounter them. 

             Java and ActiveX - next infection target 

             It is predicted that the next generation of viral infections
             will hit small Webpage programmes called applets,
             written in Java and ActiveX. 

             A recent survey revealed that more than half of
             medium-sized organisations using an intranet had no
             security policy in place to respond to the threat of
             attacks on Java applets. 

             Recent estimates indicate that Melissa, Explore.Zip and
             other malicious attacks have cost US business $7.6bn
             this year alone. The viruses cannot infect Macintosh or
             Unix systems.

      Getting DIRT on the Bad
      Guys

      Here's the ultimate weapon in the war against
      cyber crime. 

      by Tom Spring, PC World 
      June 29, 1999, 12:23 p.m. PT 

      To former detective Frank Jones, "secure network" is
      an oxymoron. The word "delete" isn't in his vocabulary.
      Password-protect your computer and you'll make his
      day. 

      And if you really get on Jones' bad side, he'll take
      complete control of your PC--and your first clue will be
      when you open your door and the boys in overcoats
      start flashing badges at you. 

      If you're among the anonymous thousands of cyber bad
      guys who inhabit the Internet's underbelly, Jones is
      your worst nightmare. 

      The retired New York City detective works on the law
      enforcement sidelines building software tools to help
      the government and police crack down on online
      criminals. 

      And his latest tool is considered the ultimate weapon. 


      Digging up DIRT

      Jones wrote the widely used, but little-known software
      program called DIRT. The program works like a
      telephone wiretap for computers, giving its users the
      ability to monitor and intercept data from any Windows
      PC in the world. 

      DIRT stands for Data Interception by Remote
      Transmission and was originally created by Jones as a
      tool to help snare online child pornographers. But in the
      short time it has been available only to government and
      law enforcement agencies, DIRT is now used to battle
      hacker groups like Cult of the Dead Cow and to trap
      terrorists, drug dealers, money launderers, and spies. 

      "What we do is give law enforcement an additional line
      of defense," says Jones, the president of Codex Data
      Systems. 


      The DIRTy Details 

      The client side version of the DIRT program is less than
      20KB in size and is typically installed on a target PC
      using a Trojan horse program (a set of instructions
      hidden inside a legitimate program). The DIRT program
      is usually sneaked inside an e-mail attachment, a
      macro, or a workable program that a targeted user is
      enticed to download. 

      Once inside a target Windows 95/98/NT computer, it
      gives law enforcement complete control of the system
      without the user's knowledge. 

      It starts off by secretly recording every keystroke the
      user makes. The next time the user goes online, DIRT
      transmits the log for analysis. Jones says government
      agencies have even managed to open encrypted files
      by obtaining password locks. 

      During a recent program demonstration, Jones easily
      uploaded and downloaded files to a DIRT-infected
      computer connected to the Net by a dial-up modem.
      Jones could upload and download files to the PC
      without a hint of activity on the other end. 

      Arresting Developments 

      If you think this sounds like B-grade fiction, it isn't.
      During a recent meeting of high-ranking federal and
      state gumshoes, DIRT received glowing software
      reviews. Many cited long lists of arrests thanks to
      Codex. 

      One police detective said DIRT has become a powerful
      tool in fighting crime online. It aids criminal
      investigations and results in about one arrest each
      month. Most of those arrested were suspected
      pedophiles, he said. 

      The hardest part of using DIRT, say its users, is getting
      owners of targeted computers to download the Trojan
      horse programs. Typically law enforcement tries to
      entice a targeted individual to download a program or a
      compressed file that must be "un-zipped" which
      contains the DIRT bug inside. Because the program is
      not available to the public, DIRT is undetectable using
      virus scanning software, Jones said. 

      "The only way to avoid DIRT is to ignore your e-mail,"
      he says. 


      Fighting Fire With Fire 

      Jones says law enforcement desperately needs these
      tools to turn the tide in its battle against online crime.
      "Law enforcement is outgunned," he says. 

      In an age where hacking horror stories have become
      front-page news, DIRT gives law enforcement an
      effective tool to even the score and catch the bad guy. 

      On one recent occasion DIRT was used to track a
      suspected drug dealer as he zigzagged across the
      country from client to client selling methamphetamines.
      His big mistake, police say, was keeping a client list
      on his laptop and logging into the Net each night to
      stay in touch with business associates and friends. 

      Using DIRT, police tracked his whereabouts each night
      and took notes on who his associates were. The
      alleged drug dealer was eventually arrested as he was
      surfing the Net in a San Jose, California motel room. 


      A Form of Flattery?

      Though DIRT is restricted to military, government, and
      law enforcement agencies, the "Back Orifice" hacker
      tool offers some similar tricks. 

      Jones maintains that its inventor, a member of the
      hacking group Cult of the Dead Cow, attended Codex's
      first public demonstration of DIRT more than a year ago
      and slapped together an "imitation" of DIRT based on
      what he saw. 

      "Close, but no cigar," Jones says. 

      But according to Mike Hudack, editor of
      Aviary-mag.com, an online magazine for hackers,
      there's more to Back Orifice than that. An updated
      version called "Back Orifice 2000" is expected to hit
      the Web in July. 
      
      Big Brotherware? 

      Hudack says the technological Cold War between
      white-hat hackers and black-hat hackers is just
      beginning--and law enforcement needs all the help it
      can get. 

      But others view DIRT as a potential threat to privacy,
      raising serious legal and ethical questions as a means
      of gathering information. 

      To use DIRT law enforcement agencies must first
      obtain a wiretap search warrant. But privacy groups
      maintain that this type of electronic surveillance goes
      far beyond wiretap warrants because DIRT allows
      authorities to invisibly snoop inside a targeted PC's
      entire hard drive --not just monitor electronic
      communications. 

      "Throughout history law enforcement has had a long
      track record of overstepping its bounds when it comes
      to search warrants," says Shari Steele, director of legal
      services for Electronic Freedom Foundation, the privacy
      rights group. 

      Unless appropriate checks and balances are in place,
      Steele says, DIRT can quickly go from being an
      effective crime-fighting tool to a privacy activist's worst
      nightmare. 

      The American Civil Liberties Union takes a harder
      stance. 

      "Clandestine searches like these are the worst kind,"
      says Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU.
      "This is exactly the kind of search the Fourth
      Amendment is designed to protect us from."

      The dark side of
      online shopping
      Trail of fraud leads from
      Amazon.com to Thailand
      By Molly Masland
                      MSNBC

              
       June 24   When Internet investigator Don
       Garlocks bank account was mysteriously cleaned
       out in early June, the last thing he expected was
       that the search for the culprit would take him on a
       shadowy trail through cyberspace. The clues
       began at online retail giant Amazon.com and led to
       a ring of alleged hackers in Bangkok, Thailand.
       Along the way, Garlock picked up crucial lessons
       about the perils of online shopping, even at sites
       that claim to be "100 percent safe."
      
        A CONSULTANT for the Bedford County Sheriffs
        Department in Bedford, Va., Garlock works for Operation
        Blue Ridge Thunder, a program aimed at stopping crimes
        against children on the Internet. Garlock has logged hundreds
        of hours hunting down pedophiles and child pornographers
        online. 
               So when his personal bank account was suddenly
        emptied in early June, Garlock put his online tracking skills to
        the test. But even he was surprised by what he discovered.
               
        FRAUDULENT CHARGES AT AMAZON
               According to Mainstreet Bank Group, Garlocks bank,
        someone had purchased nearly $1,400 worth of merchandise
        at Amazon.com and charged it to his debit card account.
               When the mysterious charges at Amazon.com appeared,
        Garlock immediately suspected fraud and called the online
        retailer of books and music to find out who was responsible.
        But Garlock was astonished to find that Amazon.com would
        not release any information to him about his account. 
               A customer of several years, Garlock had placed modest
        orders in the past, spending a total of $160, and had never
        had an unpleasant shopping experience at the online retailers
        site. But Amazon.com would neither release the name of the
        individual who had purchased the goods using his debit card
        number nor tell Garlock what specific merchandise had been
        bought or where it had been shipped. 
               Amazon.com spokesman Paul Capelli said the company
        makes it a policy to release detailed information about an
        account only to a customers bank, which can then release
        the details to their client. We want to take reasonable steps
        to protect our customers privacy, said Capelli. We need to
        know were dealing with the real customer, not someone
        calling on the phone who could be anyone. 
               As a result, the only information Garlock received
        directly was a hint accidentally leaked over the phone by a
        customer service representative. 
               They let slip the first half of the e-mail address, and
        then they realized what they had done and put me on hold.
        They came back and read me a prepared response to the
        effect that they could not divulge any additional information to
        me, said Garlock.
               
        TRAIL TO THAILAND
               Frustrated, Garlock was determined to proceed with his
        own investigation. While his bank began an official inquiry
        into the case with Amazon.com, Garlock went to work. 
               Using the limited information he had obtained from
        Amazon.com, he uncovered a path of clues leading to a ring
        of alleged computer hackers in Bangkok, Thailand. The first
        part of the e-mail address given to him contained an unusual
        word and turned out to be what is a very common first name
        in that part of the world, he said. 
                Garlock was able to uncover a wealth of personal
        information about the individuals who had used his card.With
        the help of ordinary search engines, he uncovered their home
        addresses, phone numbers and where they attended college.
        Garlock also found that in addition to having multiple e-mail
        addresses and Web sites touting their hacking skills, the
        alleged thieves held legitimate Web development jobs. 
               We know a tremendous amount of personal,
        professional and business-type information on these people
        now from our investigations here in little old Bedford
        County, said Sheriff Michael Brown.
               Eventually Amazon.com released the shipping address
        and fraudulent e-mail address used by the credit card thieves
        to Garlocks bank, but by then the information only confirmed
        the data he had already uncovered. 
               Because the sheriffs office has no jurisdiction in
        Thailand, the department turned the case over to Interpol, the
        international crime investigation agency that works with
        federal law enforcement agencies and national police forces.
        Garlocks case is under review and, according to Brown, will
        most likely be turned over to the FBI, U.S. Customs or the
        Secret Service. 
               
        MORE CASES OF FRAUD 
        From the time
         there has been
         credit cards, there
         has been credit
         card fraud. Bad
         things can happen
         any place and the
         Internet is no
         different. 
         PAUL CAPELLI
         Amazon.com spokesman 
         
               In an e-mail sent to Garlock, Amazon.coms
        investigations department confirmed that the charges made to
        his debit card were indeed the result of unauthorized use.
               Mainstreet Bank Group said an investigations officer at
        Amazon.com admitted that the same group in Thailand had
        set up a number of other stolen credit card numbers for use
        at the retailers site. 
               In a memo obtained by MSNBC, Shirley Schoefield, a
        bank investigations officer at Mainstreet Bank Group, said
        that according to the investigations department at Amazon,
        approximately 20 cards have been set up for use to purchase
        merchandise to be sent to the following shipping address (in
        Thailand). Citing customer privacy restrictions, Schoefield
        refused to comment on the case. 
               Amazon.coms Capelli also refused to comment on the
        case of the 20 fraudulent credit cards, but acknowledged that
        there have been instances of credit card misuse at the site.
        From the time there has been credit cards, there has been
        credit card fraud. Bad things can happen any place, and the
        Internet is no different. Any retailer encounters this
        problem, he said.
               However, he insisted that Amazon.coms security
        system had never been compromised. Currently
        Amazon.com is advertising for positions in its fraud
        investigation department. Under the section employment
        opportunities on its Web site, Amazon.com is looking for a
        fraud detection specialist as well as a fraud detection
        manager. 
               
        DONT USE A DEBIT CARD
               Garlocks situation was made worse by the fact that his
        debit card number was stolen instead of a credit card. If his
        credit card had been used fraudulently, according to federal
        regulations, he could have easily stopped payment on the
        account and would have been held responsible for no more
        than $50. 
               But since his debit card was stolen, he temporarily lost
        everything in his checking account. When a debit card is
        used, the money is automatically removed from the account
        when the order is processed. While the bank is still
        responsible for paying Garlock back, he must wait until the
        official investigation is complete, a process that can take
        weeks and sometimes months. 
               One of the biggest lessons Ive learned from this is, for
        Gods sake, dont use a debit card on the Internet, said
        Garlock. 
               Amazon.com has a policy of fully refunding unauthorized
        charges billed to a customers account and has agreed to pay
        back Garlock any amount billed to his account that is not
        covered by his bank. 

                      
               
        HACKER AND/OR THIEF? 
               While it is clear that Garlocks debit card number was
        stolen and used illegally, what remains unknown is whether
        the thieves first obtained the number by breaking into
        Amazon.coms site, or whether the numbers were obtained
        from another source or even generated randomly. 
               Amazon.coms Capelli said that hackers have never
        broken into the companys site or stolen information on
        individual accounts.
               Our system of storing credit card information has not
        been compromised, nor has it ever been compromised in any
        way. Any claims to this effect are not true  absolutely not
        true, said Capelli. 
               According to Inspector Earl Wismer of the San
        Francisco Police Department, which handles many cases of
        Internet fraud, Its really difficult to pin down where exactly
        a credit card number was acquired. It is common for credit
        card numbers to be fraudulently used on the Web, but were
        not able to determine whether the numbers were obtained
        from the Web or from some other source.
               In addition to stealing credit card numbers the
        old-fashioned way, such as acquiring the number from
        receipts, there are several sites on the Web where hackers,
        or anyone else whos interested, can generate legitimate
        credit card numbers based on algorithms, or mathematical
        formulas, used by banks. The algorithms generate all the
        numbers used by a given bank, but the hacker must then
        systematically try out each number in an effort to find one
        that is in current use and still has an available credit limit. 
               
        CROSS CHECKS NEEDED
               Garlocks case is worrisome because no matter how his
        debit card number was acquired, the user was still able to
        charge a hefty amount of merchandise to a debit card
        account owned by a person living in the Blue Ridge
        Mountains of Virginia and have it shipped to an address in
        Bangkok without any alarm bells going off at Amazon.com. 
               Apparently their order confirmation system that would
        match a card number to a given individual is seriously
        flawed, said Garlock. 
               According to Capelli, the person who fraudulently used
        Garlocks debit card set up a separate account using the card
        number, but did not break into Garlocks existing account. 
               Capelli dismissed the need for a more thorough cross
        check of credit card numbers with existing account
        information adding that it is very common to have more than
        one account per card number. For instance, there are
        husbands and wives with different names who have different
        accounts but use the same card number. Or parents who let
        their children use their credit card number to set up an
        account. 
               As Scambusters, an online consumer advocacy
        organization, points out, the reality is that its actually much
        safer to enter a credit card number on a secure online order
        form than it is to give a credit card to a waiter at a
        restaurant. 
               But there are important security measures to be worked
        out before the process is 100 percent safe, despite what
        many online sites want customers to believe. 
                "There is definitely a problem and I think some
        people in the industry have known that it is a problem. It is
        not one thats going to be fixed easily, said Sheriff Brown.
        Consumers have just got to be careful.

 36.0 Australia Passes Major Net Censorship Law

      Australian Net Censor Law Passes
      by Stewart Taggart 

      8:15 a.m.  30.Jun.99.PDT
      CANBERRA, Australia -- The political leaders of this nation on Wednesday
      passed into law one of the world's most far-reaching online content censorship
      regimes. 

      The rules -- which take effect 1 January, 2000 -- enable Australian government
      regulators to order domestic Internet service providers (ISPs) to take down
      indecent or offensive Web sites housed on their servers, and also require they
      block access to certain domestic or overseas-based content. 


        "We're on fairly new ground here," said Stephen Nugent, special projects
      manager for the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA). "The codes of practice
      envisaged under this legislation are probably more detailed, and cover a
      greater range of matters, than I have seen in any other country." 

      Known as the "Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act", the
      measure was approved by the House of Representatives late Wednesday night,
      according to a staffer in the office of Communications Minister Richard
      Alston. The measure had passed the more contentious Australian Senate on 26 May.

      The new law will institute a movie-like rating system for Internet content. The
      ABA will order ISPs to take down content on their servers rated X (Sexually Explicit)
      or RC (Refused Classification) within 24 hours of being notified. 

      For opponents of online content restrictions, the struggle will now shift to
      cyberspace itself. They believe the Internet simply will prove too large, too
      decentralized, and too fast-moving for regulators anywhere to successfully block
      access to any content for long. 

      Among the defiant is Perth-based online entrepreneur Bernadette Taylor. Known
      to her Web site admirers as a "Virtual Girlfriend," she offers nude photos of
      herself and personalized email communication to paying members. 

      To Taylor, passage of the law merely begins a hide-and-seek game she
      professes little doubt she'll win. With a Web site housed in Dallas, Texas, she
      plans to stay one step ahead of the nation's blocking mechanisms for as long
      as the law lasts. 

      "With a bit of effort the ABA could find (and block) me every day but they'd have
      to spend five to 10 minutes doing it," she says. "In the meantime, I'm compiling a
      mail list which has all the people that want notification of where I am." 

      She believes her Australian-based users will encounter little ongoing difficulty
      accessing her site, either through using encryption software or through proxy
      servers that disguise the source of material. 

      One such proxy server has been set up by South Australian Web site builder and
      e-commerce businessman Mike Russell. By visiting www.whois.com.au, Australian
      Web users will be able to access any site they want without disclosing where
      they're visiting. 

      Since banning proxy servers isn't included in the legislation, Russell says there will
      be little Australian regulators can do. 

      Among other defiant gestures, Russell is calling for a worldwide boycott by Web
      sites of visitors from "gov.au" domains -- recommending all such visitors be
      redirected by webmasters to the home page of Electronic Frontiers Australia, the
      online civil liberties group that spearheaded a failed effort to stop the
      law. 

      In introducing the online content legislation, the center-right government
      of Prime Minister John Howard argued that some controls are needed to limit
      access by children to pornographic content on the Internet, as well as other
      material that could be deemed offensive.Passage of the law comes amid research
      showing Internet use is rising rapidly in Australia. Figures released Wednesday by
      the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed nearly 18 percent of Australia's
      households now have some form of Internet access -- a rise of nearly 50
      percent in one year. Nearly 40 percent of Internet households in Australia now
      access the Internet on a daily basis, the researchers found. 

      To Grant Bayley, a Sydney spokesman for 2600 Australia, an organization of
      technology enthusiasts, the fact that the law comes into force on 1 January, 2000
      provides at least one indication that Australian lawmakers may not have been
      fully cognizant on all the issues involved. 

      "January 1 is not going to be one of the best days in the world to implement this,"
      he said, referring to the long-feared Year 2000 problem in which worldwide
      computers may start acting up due to the millennial date change. 

      "There are going to be much bigger problems around," he said.

      and are considering going on UnderNet next. Watch your backs. With the funding, the FBI has invested in
      much equipment and software for many things, but the main thing it goes toward is _REWARDS_. If you
      provide the FBI with information leading to the prosecution of a hacker you are rewarded $5,000-10,000,
      and they are targeting many young people in groups. Their tactic with young people is to scare them with

       FBI lurking on IRC
       May, 30 1999 - 22:07
       contributed by: BinaryZer0
       >From an unidentified source, I, and others, have been told to keep quiet on
       IRC's EFnet, especially the lagged.org servers. Why? It is possible that the
       FBI received cooperation from lagged.org officials, and the FBI is now
       sniffing the server. It is possible that they are sniffing out words like
       "hack" with a similar type of contraction as "grep". This is due to the
       recent hacks of government sites, and the envolvement of gH members (who
       hang out on EFnet).
       
       Further details will, somehow, be investigated.

      JP offers a public personal insite to his family

      Contributed by mkatona
      Tuesday - March 02, 1999. 05:09PM UTC 

          In an off the wall media report, AntiOnlines owner, JP, reveals personal
      information to the world:

      "It's no secret my Father was a famous actor. And instead of letting the
      rumor mill swallow this down, I would rather tell it like it is.. Yes my
      father was Beaver Cleaver." 

      Immediately after, JP played a Leave it To Beaver midi theme, put on a small
      baseball hat and walked out. When reached by phone JP has this to say, 

      "Yes, AntiOnline is a hackers security site. But so what if my dad was
      Beaver Cleaver. I still have to stop hackers. And please cease with the
      Little Beaver emails. It's annoying and pointless. One of the reasons
      AntiOnline is so successful is because my dad told me to get revenge on
      the world for canceling his show. And that Beaver Cleaver dis-placed
      anger still lingers in me. So you can do anything you want to.. But
      remember, I have Beaver power!" 

      It's not sure if Wally and the rest of the whole gang are open to questions.
      Last seen, Wourd Cleaver was still on AOL perfecting his scrolling skills.
      The FBI has also opened a case against suspected Granny Hacker from
      heck Carolyn Meinel on the grounds of dressing/looking like a crack friend
      and the possibility she is Wallies long lost best friend, Eddy Haskel.
