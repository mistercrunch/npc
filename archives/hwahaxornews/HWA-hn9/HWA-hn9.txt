  Are you running WindowsNT and still under the illusion that it is secure?
                
                
 ``A couple of freelance writers are working on a story for us about
   security auditing and protection. As part of their "research," they 
   decided to see if they  could hack into one of our lab networks. It 
   took them only a few hours to successfully break into our Windows NT
   boxes. And from there, they learned the configuration of our lab 
   networks, the server names and functions, the operating systems we
   run and most of the passwords on the key accounts on our Microsoft
   Windows NT, Novell NetWare and Unix servers, as well as a good many
   of our routers and switches.'' 
                         
                         - From NetworkWeek, Story in section 10.0
 



   Synopsis
   --------

   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

         Intel released a program that allows the user to turn off the serial
         number of their new Pentium III chip, but Zero-Knowledge Systems 
         claims it has developed an exploit which will retrieve the serial

      Lots of mail, not much for sharing here though ... keep the letters coming!

       To start this off I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: I do not consider myself
       a hacker.  I'm more interested in programing than anything else.  Sure, I've toiled a bit,
       but I cannot be considered as one of the El33t.
       
       
       The reason for which I am writing this little article is to try to place a bit of clairity
       on the reasons for hacking / cracking (or at least trying to make sence of them).
       
       
                                                  /*  */
       
       
       Hacking, the original motto was to do no damage, but as time went by and people develloped
       new skills, they decided that the original motto no longer applied to them.  Thus the cracker
       was born.
       
       
       Hacking and Cracking are two different entities.  You can not be both at the same time.  You
       are either one or the other.  (For those of you who consider youselves as hackers or crackers
       but use other peoples' scirpts to hack/crack, you are neither.  Anybody can point and click
       their way along or run a programe which does all the work for you, it doesn't require any talent.)
       
       
       
       There are a few things that I find pointless in what the cracker community is doing:
       
       
       First off:  What the hell is the point of saying a server's security is shit if you don't
              help the server fix it???  What? Hack into it a second time?  (I know there are
               a few groups out there who actually do help the servers they crack. This part
               doesn't concern you.)
       
       
       Second:     Why the hell do people think that they are Eleet when they use a script to
                   determine what systems are vulnerable?  And exploit that vulnerability.
                   Just because you know one or two tricks doesn't make you anything.
       
       
       Third:      & what the hell is the point of writing in Eleet text?  It's all fine and dandy
                   if you can't spell, but please, half the time you sound like you never got a high
                   school education!
       
       
       
       Power can only corrupt.  Crackers who devellope thier skills eventually loose control (though
       this isn't true for everybody) they can't help but feel destructive.  Though there are different
       levels of destructiveness (as I see it):
       
       
       A:  Destroying all information, just for the heck of it.
       B:  Destributing information / programs to ruin a business.
       C:  Defacing information.
       D:  Replacing information, but leaving a back-up copy.
       E:  Destroying all information, for good purposes.
       
       
       The last one (E) does fall into the category of cracking because it still is vandalisment of
       information even though it's for a good purpose (Cracking the KKK server(s) and destroying
       everything would be considered a class E).
       
       
       
       Ok, ok I know...  This did kindof turn out to be a bit differently then what it was supposed
       to be, but still I think I did manage to get a small message accross...

 02.1 Demoniz trashcans his webboard
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Less than a month after the very cool bikkel security site closed down
      demoniz has pulled the plug on his webboard which he left running after
      closing down the main news site. Citing DoS attacks and spam as being
      the #1 reasons, it turns my stomach just to think of this...pulled from
      help net security's site.

      WEBBOARDS
      by deepcase, Monday 8th Mar 1999 on 1:34 pm CET
      Bikkel's Webboard which was first a project for a private webboard with
      user login and password is finally down. In an email i recieved from 
      demoniz he said "The board is offline for good. I gave my best shot, but
      it didn't work. The ingoing Denial of Service attacks on our server, the
      spams and the threats made me so sick that I removed it. I wont provide a
      service for a scene which is being dominated by little kids." Net Security
      will think about setting up a new webboard, but we arent sure about this yet.
 
      As a side note, we've set up a 'webboard' that is published by the beseen 
      company and it has seen no action as of yet, you might want to check it out
      and we can see how well it works (or doesn't as the case may be.) - Ed

      AntiOnline.com Threatens Legal Action
      Contributed by siko
      Thursday - March 04, 1999. 05:52PM GMT

      Following a rash of insults at AntiOnline.com, Founder John Vransisomething
      has threatened legal action against Innerpulse.com. Innerpulse has this
      statement for Mister AntiOnline:

       Talk your shit, grab your gat, call your click. But do not ever threaten
       Innerpulse with legal action unless you want some keys dropped.If you ain't
       ever been to the ghetto, you wouldn't understand the ghetto. You stay the fuck
       out of the ghetto. Don't try to tell me using the term 'antionline.com' is a
       violation of copyright laws. Its a fucking domain name. As for why we throw
       shit all over you name, this is a very good example of why. He went so far as to
       say the letter he sent me could not be reproduced without express written
       permission. Fuck that. You can surf on over to Innerpulse but thats all, just surf
       on by. It would be the biggest bitch move in Internet history to launch a legal
       suit at opposition just because your feelings are hurt. Stop trying to be the
       Microsoft of the underground community. Nothing will be removed. Nothing
       will be discontinued. And I don't care if someone was stupid enough to invest
       60 billion in you. Why don't you go to antihell.com. Punk ass.

       Yeah, I posted it, What's Up Now Monkey? <link> http://innerpulse.com/jp.txt

       "<pre>aka Siko:

       By references in your pages, I am sure that you are aware that
       "AntiOnline" is a service mark in which I, Mr. John Vranesevich, hold
       rights to.  The language used on your page is not only inflammatory, it is
       flat out libelous. That content, combined with references to "AntiOnline"
       is what has led me to write this letter.

       While comedic parody is a protected first amendment right, knowingly
       printing false, libelous information about a company, in the context of it
       being news, so that others may believe it to be fact, is not.  We have
       received several e-mails from individuals questioning whether some of the
       information posted on your page, is factual news, or fictional writing.

       Also, the re-print of trademarks which are the property of another
       company, without written authorization, do not fall under first amendment
       rights.

       By sending you this letter, I am hoping that we can settle this matter
       without me being forced to seek a legal remedy. However, if you are not
       willing to cooperate with my requests, I may very well be forced into
       finding legal recourses, which may include a civil lawsuit.  You will
       receive
       no further communications from me directly.  If the content is not removed
       within 24 hours, this matter will be handed over to my legal council.
       Legal action may be filed shortly there after to recover damages done to
       AntiOnline's trade and reputation.

       A copy of this letter has been sent "blind carbon" to several third party
       individuals, so that it may be established that I have given you
       opportunity to remove the content voluntarily.

       Hi,

       After I saw the e-mail you sent to siko I wanted to give you my idea
       on this issue, as I provide web hosting for Innerpulse.com and
       occasionally work on the website.  Response below.

       redirect official letters to our main administrative NOC at:

       First of all, I think you should be consulting a lawyer about this.  I
       did, and I can tell you that mentionning the name "AntiOnline" in a news
       article is not libelous; as we never even put a link to your website (which
       would have not been legally wrong either).  Is mentionning "Microsoft" in a news
       article libelous? I don't think so.

       We don't want to take responsibility of the stupidity of your website's
       visitors. Tell them to redirect their comments and question to
       contact@innerpulse.com. My personal opinion is that it is quite obvious whether an article is
       true or not; Innerpulse adds a touch of humor to it, that's what makes Innerpulse
       different.

       > Also, the re-print of trademarks which are the property of another

       Ahh I'm beginning to think you are referring to `AntiOnline-O-Rama' from
       the INN features section.  Do you seriously think I would have wasted my
       time recopying AntiOnline's frontpage entirely?

       This may be not in the scope of your technical skills, but that is
       actually a link to a CGI script which simply acts as a proxy - it prints information
       directly from  AntiOnline.com, doing some word search/replaces in the process.  By
       changing the parameter you can do the same with any other website.

       I've been in that situation before, just an advice: don't even think
       about this, this will pass as a violation of free speech.  And by the way, who
       do you want to sue exactly?

       I don't think so, John.

 03.1 The FPSC-IRCD.txt advisory.  
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
                            The FPSC-IRCD.txt advisory.
                            ---------------------------
                            By: syg of the FPSC @3/7/98
                                ircd@FPSC.hemp.net
                               http://FPSC.hemp.net
       
       Program affected:
       IRCD
       
       Versions affected:
       All hybrid and other EFnet IRCD versions.  Probably others.
       
       Problem:
               According to the date of this file, thier is a few bugs in hybrid IRCD
       and  maybe  others.  I've checked DALnet's source and it seems thiers is fixed
       and not affected.  The bug is in match.c of the source code and starts on line
       204  at  'tolowertab[]'.  Note  the  line  that  consists  of  the  following:
       "'t', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '{', '|', '}', '~',".  Then go to line 238
       in match.c to 'touppertab[]'.  Note the line that reads:
       "'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '[', '\\', ']', '^'," and  look at the two
       lines.  If you notice, it takes the '{' char and defines its uppercase char as
       '['  as along with defining '|' to '\', '}' to ']', and '~' to '^'.  What this
       means   is   thier  the  same  characters  in  channel  names  and  nicknames.
               Now  what  can  you  do with this in such a way it would be a problem?
       You  can  spy on channels that consist of any one of those 8 characters below:
       1) {     --Defined as LowerCase [
       2) [     --Defined as UpperCase {
       3) }     --Defined as LowerCase ]
       4) ]     --Defined as UpperCase }
       5) |     --Defined as LowerCase \
       6) \     --Defined as UpperCase |
       7) ~     --Defined as LowerCase ^
       8) ^     --Defined as UpperCase ~
       This problem and mIRC make a dangerous combination.  Lets say a bunch of your
       friends  hang  in  #mIRC]  and  you  run BitchX.  All  you have to do is join
       #mIRC}  and  thier mIRC clients wont see you join the channel which means you
       are  a  ghost  and  therefore  are  invisible.  Another  example  would be...
       two  people  are  in #Love^2 and you ran BitchX.  All you would have to do is
       join  #Love~2  and  they  wont  see  you join, therefore you can spy on thier
       conversation  all night long.  Now if one of the mIRC people happened to type
       "/names #mIRC]"  or  "/names #Love^2"  you would magically pop up in the nick
       list  of  the  channel.  That  is  also the same if someone joins the channel
       after you have joined, you will show up in thier names list therefore it will
       put  you in thier nick list in the channel window.  Be creative and have fun.
       
       
       Logs:
       The "->->->" is me telling you whats going on.
       ->->-> In mIRC I typed /join #[ with the nick mIRC-1
        *** Now talking in #[
       ->->-> No one is in the channel but me in the nick list.

        #[ End of /NAMES list.
        #[ created on Thu Feb 25 14:13:45

        *** Now talking in #{
       ->->-> No one is in the channel but me in the nick list.
       ->->-> Then I looked in my status window and got the join info.

       ->->-> I also can't see mIRC-2 in mIRC-1's nick list.
       ->->-> So basically it's like two different channels when you are in mIRC.
       ->->-> Let's now bring bitchX into play...
       ->->-> In BitchX under the nick BitchX-1 i typed /join #[
        BitchX-1 [test@FPSC.hemp.net] has joined #[

        Channel #[ was created at Thu Feb 25 14:13:45 1999
        BitchX: Join to #[ was synced in 0.391 secs!
       ->->-> Now under mIRC-1's client I saw...
        *** BitchX-1 (test@FPSC.hemp.net) has joined #[
       ->->-> Which I should have because we are both in #[
       ->->-> But on the other hand, under mIRC-2's client( The one in #{ )...
       ->->-> I didn't see BitchX-1 join.
       ->->-> And as you can see, BitchX-1 see's mIRC-2 in the channel #[
       ->->-> Now let me type with all three of them.
       ->->-> Under all three clients I will type thier nick and chan to the channel.
       ->->-> Under BitchX-1's client I saw all three clients talk...
        <mIRC-1> mIRC-1 #[
        <mIRC-2> mIRC-2 #{
        <BitchX-1> BitchX-1 #[
       ->->-> Under mIRC-1's client I saw myself and BitchX-1 type (We are both in #[)
        <mIRC-1> mIRC-1 #[
        <BitchX-1> BitchX-1 #[
       ->->-> Under mIRC-2's client I saw myself type only ( Im in #{ )
        <mIRC-2> mIRC-2 #{
       ->->-> As you can see mIRC-2 is being spy'd on by the BitchX client.
       ->->-> End of logs.
       
       Sollution:
               The fix would be to simply edit /src/match.c of the source code.  DALnet
       seems  to  have  a  nice  match.c at ftp.dal.net in df467.tgz if you EFnet staff
       need  any  ideas.  We all hope to see this fixed in your next release of hybrid.
       
       Final Notes:
               IRCD coders and staff members of all networks and all IRCD versions need
       to  check  your source for this bug and fix it before it gets abused... maybe it
       was  you  in  #^locals^ giving your phone number out to a friend which was being
       spy'd  on  by  another  local enemy.  Other than that, everyone keep up the good
       
       work  and so  long.  Also,  thanks  to  sate  for  helping  me  test  this  out.

 04.0 Pentagon under attack
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      March 7th, 1999
      From http://www.hackernews.com/

      Pentagon investigates Russian cyberattacks

      contributed to HNN by Bronc

      A probe has been launched into recent efforts of crackers attempting to
      access Pentagon computer systems. Pentagon officials are unsure if this
      is a coordinated attack or the work of separate individuals.

      Early indications show that many of the attacks have originated in Russia
      and may have had the assistance of a insider. No classified networks have
      yet been breached. U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre has been
      quoted as saying "It is a major concern." (Ed Note: This is the same John
      Hamre who last year was quoted as saying "This is the most coordinated
      attack we have seen to date" when referring to attacks on government
      systems by three teenagers.)

      United States: Cyberwar?
      Contributed to Innerpulse by siko
      Sunday - March 07, 1999. 06:10PM GMT

      Innerpulse has decided not to join the media inflated 'Cyberwar' reporting
      until today. We have been doing extensive research and have discovered some
      exclusive details.

      We all know the so called 'facts'. Coordinated attacks on certain servers have
      officials at the Pentagon looking for answers, and quickly. What certain people
      forget, is that the man who said this is the most organized attack to date, is also
      the man that said a 16 year old kid named 'Makeveli' had also launched an
      extremely organized attack on government servers. For those who aren't into
      the urban musical subculture, Makeveli most likely came from the popular
      rapper, Tupac's influence. They have stated the attacks are coming from
      Canada and Thailand amongst others. Yet they can not trace any further.
      Sorry, if you can tell the country than you have the IP, and the ability to find the
      source.

      The United States is not at Cyberwar with anyone but the media, who took a
      couple of failed hack attempts and turned it into World War III. Innerpulse has
      conducted various interviews and can now finger the source of this terror. His
      name is John Vranesevich, which traces back to packetz.antionline.com. In an
      effort to get more publicity for breaking a story, he blew up a situation leading
      many respected news outlets into believeing this was actually as blown out of
      proportion as he made it sound. And on top of that, they pick Hamre, the man
      who called an Undernet hacker named 'Makeveli', a serious threat the the
      United States National Security.

      The Pentagon may be experiencing more attacks lately. This is not blown out of
      proportion. But if you take a moment to question the motives of people who
      would attempt to crack into a government server.. Perhaps because it gains you
      recognition and fame as it has done for so many in the past? This is the same
      reason antionline.com gets lots of crack attempts every day, because almost
      everyone in the 'hacker' community wants to be known for breaking the site
      that sold out.

      The United States is not currently involved in a Cyber War, never has been, and
      most likely will not be in any of our reader's lifetimes.

      But, if someone really cracks a Pentagon server and fires a missile at me, boy
      won't I feel silly.

      And a fairly intelligent article with little FUD from ABC news...

      Pentagon Attacks Overblown?
      Hackers Complain Government Computers Over-Sensitive 

      By Michael J. Martinez
      ABCNEWS.com
      March 9  Last week, the Pentagon reported
      that over the last several months its computer
      systems have withstood an unprecedented and
      concerted series of external attacks. 


      U.S.-based hackers might simulate an attack from abroad by routing
      their signals through a series of far-flung servers. (ABCNEWS.com)

      Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre confirmed the
      attacks, calling them a major concern. Pentagon officials
      stated that the electronic infiltrations have come from
      abroad most likely Russia. To Pentagon watchers, and to members of the 
      loosely knit hacker fraternity in the United States, those claims
      sounded familiar. 

      Terrorists or Teens?
      
      Last February, Hamre announced that the Pentagon was undergoing
      the most intense, coordinated cyberattack it had ever seen. Over a 
      two-week period, unknown hackers launched coordinated attacks against
      hundreds of military domains and servers. 
                      
      After weeks of investigation, the culprits were nabbed. They turned 
      out to be an 18-year-old Israeli computer enthusiast with a lot of
      time on his hands, and two teenagers from California who were using 
      readily available software tools downloaded from the Internet to 
      discredit the Pentagons computer security. No hackers claimed credit
      for the latest assaults; there was no bragging in IRC chat rooms or 
      on Web pages, as typically happens after well-publicized computer 
      attacks on government systems. 
                      
      That could mean a number of different things, says Dr. Peter Tippett,
      president of ISCA, Inc., a computer security firm. The attacks arent
      that bad, the person doing it doesnt want to take credit, or the 
      attacks are coming from overseas. The latest assaults could have
      come from foreign governments, terrorist organizations or from the 
      proverbial mischievous teenager. 

      Recon vs. Frontal Assault What exactly constitutes an attack? Hackers
      customarily scan remote computer systems, looking for security holes 
      through which to send or retrieve data. Tools for such scans are 
      readily available for downloading from the Internet. 
                       
       These scanners basically take known holes and hit a server, one after
      another, asking it if these holes are open, says an independent hacker
      known as Bronc Buster. They may or may not be there, but as far as logs
      on systems will show, unless you are an experienced admin and can tell 
      the difference, you are being attacked.

       The Pentagon, however, does not differentiate  between scans, which is
      essentially cyberspace reconnaissance, and full attacks, when a malicious
      system cracker actively attempts to break through security. Tippett 
      points out that scans are useful for later attack, and that determined 
      hackers have found ways to conduct scans without setting off alarms. 
      Most servers have thousands of accounts, and thus thousands of entry
      points. If a hacker takes his time, and only pings a few entry points 
      every so often, he can usually avoid notice. 
           
           In recent congressional testimony, Hamre said Defense Department
      computers are attacked upwards of 60 times per week, with about 10 such
      attacks requiring additional investigation. He did not differentiate 
      between scans or infiltration attempts. 

      From Russia With Love
      
      The theory that the recent attacks came from Russia is also questionable.
      When it comes to the Internet, geography quickly becomes irrelevant. 
      Hacking tools, some of which are readily available online, could allow a
      would-be hacker to fake his own locale information, or channel his attack
      through servers all around the world. I dont know how the Pentagon would
      know where the attacks come from, Tippett says. If you have access to 
      enough servers, its relatively easy to re-route your connection to make 
      it appear youre in Russia, when you could just be down the street. 
           
           Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who chairs the subcommittee of the House 
      Armed Services Committee where Hamre testified, acknowledges that the 
      starting point of the recent computer assaults still in doubt. But he
      contends the new attacks represent a new kind of warfare, in which less
      powerful nations could gain an edge against the United States by hacking
      into and knocking out key computer systems. This appears to be a 
      coordinated effort to break into our computer system, and we not giving
      the problem the kind of visibility it needs, Weldon says. This Y2K thing
      is a piece of cake compare to this. 
           
           OXBlood Ruffin, foreign minister for the hacker group Cult of the 
      Dead Cow, has another view. It smells like someone is looking for increased
      budgets, Ruffin wrote in an e-mail, calling Hamres alarms a typical crying
      game from the military. Hacking Into a Government Computer According to a
      Philadelphia-based hacker who calls himself El Diablo, government computers
      are far too quick to register an attack. El Diablo, affiliated with the
      HologramNation hacker group, should know: he accessed the White House Web 
      server. 
            
            Instead of using a a Web browser, El Diablo accessed the whitehouse.gov
      host address via Telnet. Telnet is a common way for a user to log directly 
      into a server, accessing the servers systems remotely. Once dialed in,
      El Diablo encountered the following warning:  You are about to access a U.S.
      Government computer system. Access to this system is restricted to authorized
      users only. Anyone who accesses this system without authorization, or exceeds
      authorized access, could be subject to a fine or imprisonment, or both, under
      Public Law 98-473.
       
            The message went on to say that the user was being monitored. 
      The computer then asked for a username and  password, at which point El Diablo
      exited. What this seems to say is that I just hacked into the government 
      computers, he says. The hackers [accessing Pentagon computers] could have 
      simply done that, and the government could have blown this waaaaaay out of
       proportion. 
           
            Many people Telnet into their work computers  its not some obscure
      hacker tool. Yet the White House says what El Diablo did is a potential attack. 
      Im sure lots of people Telnet into that server, either to just have a look,
      or they access it by mistake, and thats OK, said White House spokesman Mark
      Kitchens. But that is still considered an attempt at breaching security.

 04.1 Passwords visible in plaintext in Cheyenne's Anti-Virus Agent for Exchange.

       To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
       Subject: Cheyenne InocuLAN for Exchange plain text password still there
       
       
       This dates back to Ron Watkins' post on 12/16/98 regarding the plain text
       account name/password left in the exchverify.log file by the installation of
       Cheyenne's Anti-Virus Agent for Exchange.
       
       Quote from Ron:
       "I was called on Monday by Brian Linton at Computer Associates.  He says
       that the plaintext admin password was put into c:\exchverify.log by earlier
       versions of the Arcserve Exchange client, but that build 57 (the most recent
       version) puts only the length there.  It does not erase that file as new
       installs are done, but rather appends, which is why some folks still had
       that plaintext password even after installing the most recent build."
       
       I am currently testing AV Agent for Exchange and installed what I was told
       was the most recent version (build 64) on a clean NT 4.0/SP4/Exchange 5.5
       server running InocuLAN for NT 4.0 (build 375).  This was a fresh build and
       *not* upgraded from earlier versions of any software.  The exchverify.log
       file is still there and still contains the account name and password in
       clear text - NOT merely the length as stated above.

 04.2 Default passwords in Bay networks switches

               Ok.. so you would think after 3Com $%#& up last year of inserting
               default password into firmware vendors would learn their lesson?
               [See http://geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_2/0340.html for 3com rant]
       
               Hah! Welcome to the world of strings and Bay Networks firmware
               files. I have looked at some bay networks switches and see that
               the following have default password of "NetICs"
       
       BayStack 350T   HW:RevC  FW:V1.01 SW:V1.2.0.10
       BayStack 350T   HW:RevC  FW:V1.01 SW:V2.0.0.15
       
               These however I was not able to find defaults for:
       
       BayStack 350-24T HW:RevA  FW:V1.04 SW:V1.0.0.2
       Bay Networks BayStack 303 Ethernet Switch
       BayStack 28115/ADV Fast Ethernet Switch
       
               If you have firmware images for the above, just
       
       % strings *.img | grep -B5 "Invalid Password"
       
               Something similar to this command might give you the passwd.
               Of course I don't have to tell you about how bad it is when
               someone can control your network infrastructure (switches).
       
               I don't have much experience with Bay hardware (in fact, I have
               none - someone at work just asked me to help them get into a
               switch for which they forgot the password). If someone can
               shed some light on this topic, it would be great.
       
               And yes, I consider this to be a backdoor - wouldn't you call it
               a backdoor if Solaris had default password for root logins?
               How can vendors in 1999 even THINK about something as stupid as
               inserting a default password like this into a switch!?!?
               Granted - I am almost sure Bay didn't have evil intentions for
               the use .. but still. I am speechless.

       The Bay Networks case number for this bug/oversight is: 990310-614
       
       Normally "backdoor" passwords on Bay gear only work through the console.

       This was fixed in version 2.0.3.4 of the BS350 code last November.
       The backdoor is still there for console access, but not for telnet.
       This problem only affected the Baystack 350T and 350F, it did not
       affect the 350-24T or 450.  Also, note that the 350 has always had the
       ability to limit telnet logins to certain source addresses; it is
       recommended that that feature be used.
       
       Software upgrades for the 350 can be found at
       http://support.baynetworks.com under Software.  If you don't
       have a support contract, call (800) 2LANWAN.

      Using VC++, create an ISAPI extension project and call it CRbExtension.
      Replace GetExtensionVersion() and Default() with the code below. Compile it
      to something simple, like rb.dll.
      Place it on your web server and invoke it from your browser like this
      http://your.machine.name/scripts/rb.dll?
      Note: if you are using IE4.0, don't call this from the machine that is
      running the web server otherwise, the next time you log in, IE will recall
      the last URL and you'll reboot again.
      
      The workaround is to NEVER give users (or customers) the ability to use
      ISAPI extensions if you allow them to upload CGIs to customize their home
      page. An .exe on the other hand is much safer (is coded correctly).

      Subject: ISAPI Extension vulnerability allows to execute code as SYSTEM
      
      
      There's a vulnerability in IIS (and other WEB servers executing as SYSTEM)
      that allows to execute an ISAPI extension in the security context of the
      server itself instead of the security context of IUSR_WHATEVER. How is this
      possible: when the server loads an ISAPI extension the first time, it calls
      GetExtensionVersion(). During the call to this function, an attacker can
      execute any code as SYSTEM. This is a problem if you're an ISP doing hosting
      with web servers offering ISAPI support (IIS, Apache 1.3.4, etc. ) because
      any user allowed to place a "CGI" on the server can take over. Of course,
      this problem is not limited to ISPs.

      Typically, filters and extensions fulfill different purposes. For instance,
      you would not implement an complete WEB based application as a filter for
      performance reasons. Filters see all http "traffic" while extensions only
      see the http traffic that is directed to them.
      
      Unless you have written the filter yourself (or someone trusted in your
      organization), you can't know if a filter is 100% secure either.
      
      > installed locally(?) there shouldn't be any general risk. Yes?
      
      This is not that simple. You can remotely install a filter under IIS if you
      can cause the following sequence of events to occur:
      
      1) Place the filter .dll in a location accessible from the web server.
      2) Update the registry to register the new filter.
      3) Cause a reboot of the machine or stop/start IIS.
      
      All of this can be done from the GetExtensionVersion() call mentioned
      earlier.
      
      Finally, you can host a filter *AND* an extension in the same .dll.

      Sure, however the executable that you are going to execute will run in a
      separate address space and if it is spawned by IIS, it will run in the
      security context of IUSR_xxx instead of SYSTEM. This is the *major*
      difference between what you can do with the .dll approach and the .exe
      approach.

       Usage: winfreez sendtoip sendfromip time
       where <sendtoip> is victim host, <sendfromip> is router
       for victim host, <time> is time in seconds to freeze victim.

       I've written small exploit for freeze win9x/nt boxes in LAN.
       Proggy initiates ICMP/Redirect-host messages storm from router
       (use router ip). Windows will receive redirect-host messages
       and change own route table, therefore it will be frozen
       or slowly working during this time.
      
       On victim machine route table changes viewing with:
       ROUTE PRINT
       command in ms-dos box.
      
       Exploit show different result for different system configuration.
      
       System results:
      
       p200/16ram/win95osr2 is slowly execute application
       after 20 seconds of storm.
      
       p233/96ram/nt4-sp4 is slowly working after 30
       seconds of storm.
      
       p2-266/64ram/win95 working slowly and can't normal execute
       application.

 04.5 Unknown Zone: 
      Windows doesn't properly distinguish between intra and internet zones
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Subject: More Internet Explorer zone confusion
      
      Even after the patch described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-016
      (http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms98-016.asp), IE4 still
      has big problems with distinguishing between sites that belong in the
      "Internet Zone" and sites that belong in the "Local Intranet Zone".
      
      MS98-016 dealt with addresses such as http://031713501415/, which
      resolve to Internet hosts but are categorized as being in the "Local
      Intranet Zone".
      
      I've found two cases where the problem still exists.  The first is when
      the user has the "Domain Suffix Search Order" in the TCP/IP DNS settings
      set to include domains such as "com".  In that case, the address
              http://microsoft/
      will retrieve the page at
              http://microsoft.com/
      but it will be considered to be in the "Local Intranet Zone".
      
      The second case occurs when a host has an assigned alias in the hosts
      table (C:\WINDOWS\HOSTS).  A host table entry such as:
              207.46.131.13   hello
      will cause the URL
              http://hello/
      to retrieve the page at http://207.45.131.13/, but (yep, you guess it)
      Internet Explorer still considers it to be in the "Local Intranet Zone".
      
      This has security implications, since settings for the Local Intranet
      Zone may be (and, by default, ARE) less secure than those for the
      Internet Zone.
      
      
      And the funny part?  Microsoft's response when I told them this:

      Hi Jim -
      
      Had a talk with one of the IE developers, and this behavior is correct.
      Here's why: it's impossible to tell from an IP address whether it's internal
      or external.  100.100.100.100, or any other address, could be either
      internal or external, depending on whether you're behind a firewall or not.
      That means that IE has to rely on the URL.  By convention, an URL that does
      not end with a "dot-something" (.com, .edu, .gov, etc) is assumed to be an
      internal site.  I'm told that this is how all web browsers make the
      distinction.  You have to make specific reconfigurations to allow the
      dotless URLs to resolve externally. Thanks,
      
      Secure@Microsoft.Com
      
      --8<---cut here-----------------------------------------
      
      
      "This behavior is correct"?!?!?!  Give me a break.  They obviously
      didn't think so when they released the MS98-016 bulletin.

      The difference between MS98-016 and your examples is simple.  The bulletin
      addressed an issue where an external site could, without your control, fool
      your browser into thinking a remote site was "local intranet".  In your
      examples, the user must choose specific settings to allow the problem to
      occur.  If you are concerned about the problem, simply remove .com, etc.
      >from your DNS suffix search, and don't put nasty hosts in your hosts file.
      
      The zone settings are not meant to be rock-solid security protection.  If
      they pose a risk to you, set all zones to the maximum security.  This was
      all already talked about when the above-mentioned bulletin came out.
      
      In the end, this is not a "bug" in the browser - it's a configuration
      problem.  While worthy of mention, it does not deserve flamage.

      This is insane - and most probably not how it distinguishes domains at all.
      
      Such a system implies that the "dot-something"s are hard-coded into the
      browser! This would be a similar flaw to the original cookie
      specification's one about domains that I announced last year. Consider:
      
       - Country domains. They're not dot-somethings, but under this regime
      anything from somewhere like New Zealand (.nz) would be a "Local Intranet
      Site".
      
       - New TLDs. Internic goes and adds a .web or .store or something that
      didn't exist when the browser was released. I'm sure all the e-commerce
      sites on .store would love their servers being considered "Local Intranet
      Sites"!
      
      If this is how the zones are implemented, then its insane. If not, then
      IE's claim of being able to distinguish intranet sites from internet ones
      is an outright lie and the "feature" should be removed.

      All the comments made are, technically, correct, but Microsoft could have

      * Be paranoid about entries in the hosts file. Arguably, hosts files are
      obsolete, thanks to DNS. (No, I won't make the argument.)
      * Warning dialog boxes for the above, and maybe for anything where the TLD
      is guessed at. (The http://microsoft/ example. Just warn the user that the
      requested site was guessed, give some sane options like `Go there, treat
      it as Internet', `Go there, treat it as local', `Don't go there', and so
      on.)
      * Anything that doesn't resolve to a designated local zone (10.*.*.*, and
      the other reserved addresses) gets the same warning.
      
      Or, just change the default behaviour on all those to treat the site as
      Internet rather than intranet. Probably easier that way, though a bit more
      troublesome for the user, especially when we guess wrong.

      I would agree that these are still issues but there is a difference
      between them and the original problem.
      
      With the original problem any site could redirect you to a site and make
      it look like Local Intranet simply by using the 'http://031713501415/'
      format.
      
      With these two new issues someone must have direct knowledge about your
      machine's configuration or have direct access to your machine in order to
      make a not-quite-too-common configuration change.  If either of these
      situations occurs then the safety level of my browser will quickly become
      the least of my worries.  :)
      
      IMO Microsoft is right in saying that the problems are (marginally)
      different.  Whether or not their method for determining "local intranet"
      is right is a completely different subject.

      This seems to be trivial to resolve - put everything in the internet zone
      unless it matches a list containing the local intranets.  Then do
      reverse-dns
      of everything that's allegedly inside the intranet and make sure everything
      matches up.  It isn't a perfect solution, but it would make it substantially
      harder to fake a remote site as local.  You also get the added benefit of
      not needing to worry about how IE resolves domains/ip addresses.

      And this can occur with my examples as well.  I didn't control it at
      all.

      Just because I added a DNS suffix search order and put hosts into my
      hosts file does not (or, at least, SHOULD not) mean that I am choosing
      "specific settings to allow the problem to occur".  How was I supposed
      to know that simplifying my life by adding a search suffix of ".com" was
      opening me up to a vulnerability?

      No, this is a bug in the browser.  Changing something over at point A
      shouldn't affect my security at point B.

      That's correct.
      I believe that the rule for Intranet zone is simple -- if the name has no
      "." and is less than 15 characters long, then it's Intranet zone. This
      algorithm works with the default configuration of Windows. If you configure
      your machine so that the above assumption is violated, then you'll get a
      mis-classification.
      
      When designing better ways of doing this, keep in mind that the primary tool
      that the browser has to work with is "gethostbyname" -- which, IMO, doesn't
      return enough information about how the name was resolved to be helpful for
      security purposes (even though it garnered some in the process of
      resolution). For example, it doesn't say whether /etc/hosts or LMHOSTS was
      used to resolve the name, or which DNS search suffix was used.

      The assumption:
      [if the name has no "." and is less than 15 characters long, then it's
      Intranet zone]
      
      Simply:
      The name "ls" has no "." and is less than 15 characters, and yet it is a
      valid *Internet* host and should *not* be qualified as "Intranet Zone".

      Is this intranet zone thing _really_ of any value?  Why is there a
      built-in default assumption that something from a "local" server is
      more trustworthy?  Consider the following situations:
      
      1. A customer of your ISP, netmonger.net, is evil.  They have a page
         that links or redirects to http://www/~evil/evil.html, taking
         advantage of the fact that your machine is configured with your
         ISP's domain in the search list.
      
      2. You go to school at RPI.  You have a dorm ethernet connection.
         Your machine is naive.dorm.rpi.edu, and you have dorm.rpi.edu
         in your domain search list.  An evil person gets evil.dorm.rpi.edu,
         and you know the rest.
      
      3. You work at Giganticorp and have access to high-level trade secrets.
         Giganticorp has an intranet where employees can put up their own
         web pages.  An evil employee takes advantage of the default security
         settings to gain access to your secrets, which he sells to the
         competition.
      
      Numbers 1 and 2 ask the question, "Why are we assuming that a
      non-qualified host name implies intranet implies trust?"  Number 3
      asks the question, "Why are we assuming that intranet implies trust?"
      Another question is "How many people who use IE have no intranet?"
      Considering that there are a quantity of tools available to deploy
      IE at your company with preconfigured settings, why not default to
      not having this intranet zone.  If Giganticorp needs to turn down
      the security, they can do so at the same time they're customizing
      the rest of the settings.
      
      I don't personally use Microsoft products, and I am not quite familiar
      with the specific security precautions that are disabled for the
      intranet zone, but if they're enough to cause concern on the Internet,
      the same problems can occur even when the browser isn't malfunctioning
      at all.

      This is of course the correct way to implement an "intranet zone".
      It has, however, one serious drawback: you have to configure it.
      Consumer product manufacturers like Microsoft want their product
      to work as much "out of the box" as possible.
      
      However, IMHO there is no way to implement the concept of "intranet
      zone" reliably without actually telling the browser the exact extent
      of your intranet one way or other. Heuristics like "if there is no
      dot in the hostname then let's assume it is in the intranet" just
      aren't reliable enough to base a security mechanism on.

      It doesn't even work with the default configuration of Windows,
      because the basic assumption that every host with an FQDN in the
      same DNS domain as the client is also in the intranet zone is
      flawed. There are perfectly legitimate configurations where this
      is not the case.

      It is irrelevant how the name was resolved. You need a mechanism
      to specify the intended scope of your intranet unambiguously,
      instead of relying on some unspoken assumption like "for our
      purposes, 'intranet zone' will be taken to mean all hosts which
      happen to have at least one FQDN in the same domain as the
      client".

      Since there is no intranet for most consumers this seems like largely a

      configure it properly.  And businesses should have IT departments whose job it

      Not only legitimate, but increasingly common.  Cable modem customers, for

      customer.ne.mediaone.net.  I assure you that you don't want to treat the entire

      Sniffing Out MS Security Glitch
      by Chris Oakes 

      5:30 p.m.  8.Mar.99.PST
      A security vulnerability that hides unique identifiers in Microsoft 
      Office documents may affect files created by other software 
      applications, according to the programmer who identified the breach. 

      Other Office documents and browser cookies, and possibly even software
      from other companies, can store the unique identity codes, according to 
      Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
      who first reported the security glitch on Sunday. 

      Smith discovered that Excel and Word applications fingerprint files with 
      an identifying number. That number is used by the hardware that connects
      a PC to a local area network. The 32-digit numbers were designed long 
      ago by developers of networking hardware to identify individual machines. 

      "These things are slippery. These [numbers] are floating around -- it's 
      hard to say where they're showing up," said Smith. Microsoft was not 
      available for comment. The identifying number is trapped in the Windows
      registry file as a Globally Unique Identifier, or GUID, and embedded in a
      hidden part of documents created using Office, including Word, Excel, and
      PowerPoint. 

      "I got email for someone mentioning that GUIDs are also put in Web-browser
      cookies. I did a quick scan on my Netscape cookies file and found a number
      of Web sites that were indeed using GUIDs for identification purposes," 
      Smith said. It goes to show the ubiquity of the ID numbers, he said. 
      "Anyone writing applications can use them. [The privacy issue] is an 
      unintended side effect." The unique number can be easily traced to a person
      by searching for the number in documents known to be created by that person,
      according to Smith.
      
      Unknown documents could also be associated with that person using the 
      identification number. "If you're in some really weird office-politics
      situation -- who knows?" he said. He plans to explore whether other   
      Windows applications, such as software for creating Web pages, use the ID
      numbers. He's also interested in the behavior of the company's Outlook email
      software. 

      Smith said users can easily find their own network address, then search their
      hard-disk content for documents containing the ID number to determine
      where it is surreptitiously stored. Users can find the number by selecting
      the Run command under the Windows Start menu and typing winipcfg to launch
      the Windows IP configuration utility. One of the fields appearing in the 
      dialog box contains the user's "network adapter" address. 

      "All I did was have a search utility scan the hard disk for occurrences of 
      the Ethernet address," he said. Smith used one called Grep. "Anyone can do 
      that and see how common it is." 

      Certain types of text editors, known as hexadecimal editors, will reveal the
      invisible code in any file. One example of the editor is HexEdit. Smith made
      a related discovery when he found Microsoft was collecting the identification
      number users entered when registering their new copies of the company's 
      Windows 98 operating system, prompting Microsoft to post an open letter to 
      its customers. 

      It said the company would publish software to remove the ID number from users'
      Windows registry file, a move designed to prevent the behavior from occurring 
      in future documents. The company also said a subsequent update of Windows 98
      would disable the software's registration feature so that the hardware ID would
      not be collected "unless the user checks the option to send hardware information 
      to Microsoft." The company said it also plans to post a software tool on its Web
      site that will allow users to delete hardware-registration information from
      the Windows registry. But in a privacy advisory also issued Monday, a
      privacy-watchdog group demanded that Microsoft go further. 

      "What I think is unprecedented here is that the problem is now on billions of
      documents around the world. The problem remains out there even if Microsoft 
      fixed the applications," said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters. 
      "We demand they publish and publicize free software to protect these files -- 
      and that's not  something Microsoft in its open letter said it would do. 

      "[Users] really don't have an effective means of stopping [the problem] from
      happening short of switching to [another software product like] Corel
      WordPerfect," he said. Smith and privacy advocates worry that Microsoft 
      already has built up a database of registration numbers, although the company
      said it plans to purge its own databases of any hardware-identification
      information that may have been inadvertently gathered without customers' 
      consent. 

      Microsoft said it was confident "that the hardware information is not being 
      stored in our marketing databases, and we are investigating whether it is
      stored in any database at all within Microsoft." Catlett believes an 
      independent auditor should oversee any such effort to purge the data, which
      could have been transferred to backup systems or related databases. 

      "For me, the bottom line is Microsoft is getting information off of people's
      computer [that] they have no business getting." Addressing that issue, he 
      said, "sounds like a patch to me." Catlett is disturbed by this wide-reaching
      impact. Combined with Microsoft's push for required registration, a possibility
      Catlett documented last week, he sees a quagmire for users trying to protect
      themselves. 

      "If Microsoft starts compelling people to register, then its going to take a 
      lot of time for people to disentangle their lives from Microsoft's sticky
      tentacles."

 05.1 TCP Blind Spoofing Exploit Code for Linux kernels 2.0.35< and Discussion
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      -=- receive.c and spoof.c exploit code
      
      Hello,

      Here is some demonstration code for the "Linux Blind TCP Spoofing" problem
      discovered by Network Associates, Inc. If you have trouble compiling this,
      try it with -D_BSD_SOURCE.
      
      1.) receive.c
      
      This simple program creates a TCP socket and waits for a connection.
      After the accept call returnes, it reads 8 bytes from the socket and
      prints them on stdout.
      
      usage: receive listen_port
      
      2.) spoof.c
      
      This one sends a SYN packet, a Null packet (no flags at all) with 8 bytes
      of data and a FIN packet to the target.
      
      usage: spoof source_ip source_port target_ip target_port
      
      Don't forget to disable host source_ip so it cannot send RST's. I've tested
      this on Linux 2.0.30. After the FIN packet is received, the accept call
      returnes and the read call gives the data sent with the Null packet.

      SYNOPSIS
      
      An implementation flaw in the Linux TCP/IP stack allows remote
      attackers
      to forge TCP connections without predicting sequence numbers and pass
      
      data to the application layer before a connection is established.
      
      ======================================================================
      =
      
      VULNERABLE HOSTS
      
      This problem is present in Linux kernels up to and including 2.0.35.
      Any distribution containing a kernel revision less than this is
      vulnerable.
      
      ======================================================================
      =
      
      DETAILS
      
      TCP is a reliable connection-oriented protocol which requires the
      completion of a three way handshake to establish a connection. To
      implement reliable and unduplicated delivery of data, the TCP
      protocol
      uses a sequence based acknowledgment system. During connection
      establishment each host selects an initial sequence number which is
      sent in the first packet of the connection. Each subsequent byte
      transmitted in the TCP connection is assigned a sequence number.
      
      To prevent duplicate or invalid segments from impacting established
      connections TCP utilizes a state based model. In a typical
      client-server application, the client initiates a connection by
      transmitting a TCP segment to a listening server process. This
      causes the state of the process to move from the LISTEN state into
      SYN_RECEIVE if a SYN flag is present. During this state the server
      acknowledges the clients request setting both the SYN and ACK
      flags. To complete the three way handshake the client acknowledges
      the servers response, moving the server from SYN_RECEIVE to
      ESTABLISHED state.
      
      To establish a forged TCP session an attacker must have knowledge
      of or be able to predict the initial sequence number that is selected
      by the server. An implementation flaw in the Linux kernel allows
      data to be delivered to the application layer before the handshake
      has completed.
      
      
      ======================================================================
      =
      
      TECHNICAL DETAILS
      
      The combination of three flaws in the Linux TCP/IP implementation
      contribute to the existence of a security vulnerability. Firstly,
      Linux only verifies the acknowledgment number of incoming segments
      if the ACK flag has been set. Linux also queues data from TCP
      segments without acknowledgment information prior to the
      completion of the three way handshake but after the initial SYN
      has been acknowledged by the server. Finally, Linux passes data to
      the application layer upon the receipt of a packet containing the
      FIN flag regardless of whether a connection has been established.
      Together, these flaws allow an attacker to spoof an arbitrary
      connection and deliver data to an application without the need to
      predict the servers initial sequence number.
      
      According to the standard, there is only one case wherein a correct
      TCP/IP stack can accept data in a packet that does not have the ACK
      flag set --- the initial connection-soliciting SYN packet can
      contain data, but must not have the ACK flag set. In any other case,
      a data packet not bearing the ACK flag should be discarded.
      
      When a TCP segment carries an ACK flag, it must have a correct
      acknowledgement sequence number (which is the sequence number of the
      next byte of data expected from the other side of the connection).
      TCP packets bearing the ACK flag are verified to ensure that their
      acknowledgement numbers are correct.
      
      Vulnerable Linux kernels accept data segments that do not have the
      ACK flag set. Because the ACK flag is not set, the acknowledgement
      sequence number is not verified. This allows an attacker to send
      data over a spoofed connection without knowing the target's current
      (or initial)  sequence number.
      
      Linux does not deliver data received from a TCP connection when the
      connection is in SYN_RECEIVE state. Thus, an attacker cannot
      successfully spoof a TCP transaction to a Linux host without somehow
      completing the TCP handshake. However, an implementation flaw in
      some Linux kernels allows an attacker to bypass the TCP handshake
      entirely, by "prematurely" closing it with a FIN packet.
      
      When a FIN packet is received for a connection in SYN_RECEIVE state,
      Linux behaves as if the connection was in ESTABLISHED state and moves
      
      the connection to CLOSE_WAIT state. In the process of doing this,
      data queued on the connection will be delivered to listening
      applications. If the ACK flag is not set on the FIN segment, the
      target's sequence number is not verified in the segment.
      
      
      ======================================================================
      =
      
      RESOLUTION
      
      It is recommended that kernels below version 2.0.36 be upgraded to
      eliminate this vulnerability.
      
      Updated kernel packages for Red Hat Linux which are not vulnerable to
      this
      problem are available from
      http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/errata.html.
      
      Both Debian and Caldera Linux have been contacted regarding this
      vulnerability although no official response has been received.
      
      The latest stable versions of the Linux kernel are available from
      http://www.kernel.org.

      This also segfaults under Solaris 2.6 and 7 on SPARC.
      
      I'm not sure how exploitable this is, as it is only sgid tty, which isn't a
      huge problem (but could be nonetheless, I suppose).

      Confirmed under Sparc Solaris 2.6.
      
      Although I have no source code to verify this, I would assume the problem
      lies in a sprintf() call (or something similiar) that builds the device to
      open from the tty you specify on the command line.
      
      However, even if this is overflowable into a shell with tty permissions,
      I can see nothing useful coming out of it.
      
      crw--w----   1 dm       tty       24,  0 Mar  9 14:39 pts@0:0
      
      Those are the permissions on the terminal.  The most I can see happening is
      someone writing to my screen when I have messages turned off.

 07.0  New Computer Technology Makes Hacking a Snap - Washington Post
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
       FUD throughout this article on script kiddies, but still a good 
       entertaining read and worthy of your time ... 
       
       http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-03/10/024r-031099-idx.html
 
       New Computer Technology Makes Hacking a Snap

       By Michael E. Ruane
       Washington Post Staff Writer
       Wednesday, March 10, 1999; Page A01 

       Used to be you had to have some know-how to crash a kernel. It would
       take all night to snoop a connection, smash a stack or crack a password.
       You could work forever trying to get to root.
  
       Not any more.
  
       Nowadays, any fresh-faced newbie can download a kiddie script, fire off a
       vulnerability scan and, in no time, come up with a nice, juicy target list.
  
       It's enough to make veteran hackers -- the handful of computer wizards
       who speak a colorful language that once was all their own -- break down
       and cry.
  
       But it's true. Along with the breathtaking advances in computer technology
       has come a vast proliferation of easy, ready-to-use computer hacking
       programs, freely available on the Internet, and a boon to greenhorn
       hackers.
  
       "This is your nephew or your cousin," says Peter Tippett, president of the
       Reston-based International Computer Security Association. "It's a kid who
       says, 'This seems kind of cool. Let me just take this tool and aim it at Ford
       Motor Company.' "
  
       They use programs -- called "exploits," "tools" or "attacks" -- with names
       like "Smurf," "Teardrop" and "John the Ripper."
  
       Some are so-called "denial of service" programs, which sneak or barge in
       and overwhelm a targeted system, shutting it down. Others are
       "vulnerability scanners," which search the Net for specific weaknesses to
       be exploited later. Still others are "penetration" attacks that break in and
       take control.
  
       Some attacks use a "Trojan Horse" -- benign-looking bait with an exploit
       concealed inside. Others "spoof," using a bogus ID. Still others lie in wait
       and spring when an unsuspecting victim pauses to visit.
  
       A few are simply sent out to "sniff the traffic" on the Internet.
  
       There are hundreds of them. So many that some have been given the name
       kiddie scripts, because of their simplicity of use. Those who launch them
       are called, of course, script kiddies. And experts say they may account for
       95 percent of all external computer hacking attacks.
  
       Hacking always seems to have been the purview of the young. Just last
       year, five teenagers hacked into Defense Department computers, and last
       month, a 15-year-old from Vienna was accused of hacking into Clemson
       University's system and of trying to break into NASA's.
  
       Experts believe there are now tens of thousands of hacking-related Web
       sites, and hundreds that approach the subject seriously. The Pentagon,
       traditionally the most assailed hacking target on Earth, announced Friday
       that it is investigating another potent attack -- one of the 80 to 100 it
       undergoes every day.
  
       But in years past, hacking was tedious, demanding work that required
       brains and dedication, and, if successful, was an envied notch in the cyber
       gun. There was hacker esprit. There was a great "signal-to-noise" ratio --
       intelligent talk vs. baloney. And there was the hacker code: Look, but
       don't touch.
  
       No longer.
  
       "It used to be a small circle," says Dr. Mudge, a veteran Boston-area
       hacker who operates a Web site with his sidekicks Kingpin, Brian
       Oblivion, SpaceRogue and others. "Now it's almost mainstream, and like
       anything that goes mainstream you get a lot of good and a lot of bad."
  
       "Now people can hack without having to pay their dues," says Rob Clyde,
       a vice president with the Rockville-based computer security firm, Axent
       Technologies Inc.
  
       "You no longer have to be an expert," he says. "You just have to have time
       and motive. And the motive often times now is vandalism, destruction, just
       blow away stuff, destroy it, make it look bad."
  
       Sometimes it's even worse.
  
       The FBI on Friday released an annual survey that it conducts with the San
       Francisco-based Computer Security Institute, reporting that criminal
       hacking caused $123 million in losses last year, and now posed "a growing
       threat to . . . the rule of law in cyberspace."
  
       Mostly, though, many experts say, the new add-water-and-stir hacking is
       for amateurs. And most of them are still pretty young.
  
       "We're talking 95 percent of hackers are script kiddies," Tippett says.
       "We're talking a million events a month where people run those tools to see
       what happens. Maybe one or two percent of hackers are people who
       know what the tool actually does."
  
       Peter Mell, a computer scientist at the National Institute of Standards and
       Technology, in Gaithersburg, says, "Ten years ago if you wanted to break
       into somebody's system, you would stay up all night long."
  
       "You would manually go to their computer, try a few things, if it didn't
       work you'd go to another computer, try a few things," he says. "Very
       tedious. You'd spend all night doing it."
  
       "Nowadays what somebody does is . . . at 6 o'clock, they download a
       vulnerability scanner and an associated attack. They set the vulnerability
       scanner running. They go out to a party . . . come home 11 at night. And
       their computer has compiled a list for them of 2,000 hosts on the Internet
       which are vulnerable to that attack."
  
       "All they have to do is type the name of the computer that is vulnerable into
       their attack script, and they have complete control of the enemy," he says.
  
       The actual damage done by hackers is uncertain and some experts
       suggested it is overstated by a computer industry eager to sell its services.
       Those experts estimate that 80 percent of hacking comes from within a
       corporation rather than through outside attacks.
  
       Hacking lingo seems filled with military references like "attack" and
       "target." But hacking also has -- along with its own magazines and an
       annual convention -- an idiom all its own.
  
       "Crashing a kernel," for example, refers to breaking down the core of an
       operating system. "Smashing a stack" means taking over a vital part of a
       computer's memory. "Snooping a connection" means breaking into a
       conversation between two other computers. And the ultimate feat, "getting
       to root," or more simply, "getting root," means seizing fundamental control
       of target system.
  
       Mell, 26, a surgeon's son from St. Louis who said his brother taught him to
       program in second grade, has conducted a study of published attacks that
       smash, crash, seize and snoop by monitoring what people request at
       hacker Web sites.
  
       He has named the array of published attacks the Global Attack Toolkit.
       And he has compiled a list of the top 20 recently most popular. He points
       out that most attacks can be defended with so called "patches," but a few
       are almost indefensible.
  
       One of the most popular -- number 2 on his list -- and one that's tough to
       counter is "Smurf."
  
       "It's an attack where you overwhelm an enemy system with a huge number
       of (information) packets . . . and their computer simply can't handle all of
       the packets," he says. "The computer shuts down. If it's a Web site, the
       Web site stops working. If it's the router going into the White House, the
       White House traffic stops flowing."
  
       Number one on his list was a Trojan Horse called "Back Orifice."
  
       In a paper he wrote last year, Mell mentioned one hacker Web site that
       lists 690 scripts, another that has 383 and another that lists 556.
  
       "Together, the exploit script Web sites form an attack tool kit that is
       available to literally everyone in the world," he wrote. "Somewhere on the
       Internet, there exists a host vulnerable to almost every attack, and scanning
       tools are readily available to find that host."
  
       Mell says the attack scripts are posted on hacker Web sites by other
       hackers, by disgruntled systems administrators trying to draw attention,
       and eventually patches, to holes in their systems, and by "white hat"
       hackers seeking to alert the computer security industry to vulnerabilities.
  
       And he believes that posting easy scripts may not be all bad.
  
       "When attacks are posted to the Internet, companies respond, and they fix
       their software very quickly, and they release patches, and there's news
       articles and advisories alerting people that there's this vulnerability," he
       says.
  
       "So by the public posting . . . in a way it makes the world safer, because
       everybody knows what's out there and they're prepared," he says. "If the
       scripts weren't published, intrusion-detection companies wouldn't know
       where to get their data, security companies wouldn't know that their
       applications had holes in them."
  
       "At the same time that these attack scripts make it available for anyone in
       the world with very little intelligence to download and run attacks, it also
       means that security companies are quick on their feet to respond to them."
  
       But computer security firms are not sitting idly by. They have their own
       intrusion detection programs -- some of which are recon missions, if you
       will, that "sniff" the traffic to ambush roving attack scripts.
  
       Mell says there is a "Virtual Suicide" Web site where systems operators
       can request an attack to test security. Visitors can ask to be "crippled,"
       "beheaded" or "vaporized."
  
       Perhaps the most sinister attacks, though, are passive. Apparently small in
       number, Mell says in his report, they "require a target to visit the hacker's
       Web site" before striking. 
  
       Soon, he writes, "the Internet may develop 'bad parts of town.'"

       KOREAN "SUPERHACKER" BUSTED
       by deepcase, Tuesday 9th Mar 1999 on 1:05 pm CET
       Kim, a 15 year old high school student from Korea got busted by the
       police after after 152 people complained about the "super viruses" that
       he distributed by email. Kim told police that he mailed the viruses to
       demonstrate his talents and to find out if anyone could break them. The 
       viruses were so complex that they were virtually impossible to kill. 
       The spokesman said that Kim was known as a computer genius from the 7th
       grade, when he learned to handle the machine code language assembly 3. 
       The spokesman added "Kim is one of just forty to fifty people in Korea 
       with such a talent" . A National Police Officier said that Kim could have
       became a "national treasure" in the information society of the future and
       that he will guide Kim along the legal path of computer work.

       Super Hacker Apprehended 


       A police spokesman announced Friday that officers had apprehended a
       super hacker who turned out to be a fifteen year old high school boy named
       Kim. To date 152 people have filed complaints about the 15 super viruses
       Kim created and e-mailed, but police expect the final figure to be over
       2,000. 

       Kim told police that he mailed the viruses to demonstrate his talents and to
       find out if anyone could develop a 'vaccine' for them. The viruses were so
       complex that they were virtually impossible to kill. The spokesman said that
       Kim was known as a computer genius from the 7th grade, when he learned
       to handle the machine code language 'assembly 3'. one of just forty to fifty
       people in Korea with such a talent. 

       Yang Keun-won, head of the National Police Office's computer crime team
       commented that a virus creator and hacker like Kim could become a
       "national treasure" in the information society of the future. He added that he
       will guide Kim along the legal path of computer work.

       NFR and L0pht to Deliver Best-of-Breed Intrusion Detection
                                                          
       L0pht to use extensive knowledge of attack signatures to expand filter set
       for NFR software
       
       
       01 March 1999 Washington, DC and Boston, MA Network Flight Recorder®
       (Bloomberg Ticker: 9022Z EQUITY) and L0pht Heavy Industries, Inc. today
       announced a strategic relationship that redefines the boundaries for
       cooperation in intrusion detection. In a partnership that combines the
       respected "white-hat" knowledge of attack signatures with the industry
       leading intrusion detection engine, L0pht will create a large set of
       backends for the NFR software. 
       
       
       The backends, or filters, will provide users with real-time alerts for
       various types of intrusions and unwanted activity on their networks,
       including information gathering, denial of service, and network attacks.
       As soon as the NFR system is attached to the network, the new backends
       will begin watching for common and obscure attacks. 
       
       
       New backends, which will be provided to users on a monthly basis, will
       watch for the latest attacks.  Administrators can automatically push the
       new backends to remote NFR systems, without having to upgrade or modify
       any software. Because the backends will be written in N-Code, NFR's
       flexible open-standard traffic analysis specification language, users can
       examine and verify the underlying code, or modify them to match their
       internal security policies. 
       
       
       Commenting on the partnership, Marcus J. Ranum, President and CEO of
       Network Flight Recorder, noted, "L0pht has an amazing depth of information
       about system vulnerabilities, and are the ideal source for cutting edge
       intrusion detection signatures. By adding their 'white-hat' knowledge to
       our existing capabilities, we have an unbeatable combination. Today, NFR
       is the most popular intrusion detection and monitoring system for many of
       our users based on its powerful customizable capabilities &#150; with the
       formation of this partnership we further cement our lead in the industry."
       In a recent user poll, NFR soundly outperformed intrusion detection
       products from Axent (NASDAQ: AXNT), ISS (NASDAQ: ISSX), and Cisco (NASDAQ:
       CSCO). "When real network managers and users rate your product as best,
       that&#146;s satisfying," continues Ranum. "Our product shines where it
       matters the most: solving real problems and securing real networks for
       real network managers." 
       
       
       "Having the ability to handle strange network traffic in a flexible manner
       and the ability to tweak even the lowest level components of the intrusion
       detection engine offers a functionality scope and comfort level that other
       products simply cannot attain," said Dr. Mudge of L0pht Heavy Industries,
       Inc. "In this field the consumer is really purchasing an elevation in
       &#145;peace-of-mind&#146;  about the way their network works. This cannot
       be done on blind faith alone. NFR was the only commercial package capable
       of being used for intrusion detection that released full source code to
       the academic community. Combine this with the network and computer
       security expertise that is found at L0pht and the history that L0pht has
       for being a &#145;consumer watchgroup&#146; &#150; the two companies
       working together on projects was a logical next step." 
       
       
       Availability
       
       
       The L0pht intrusion detection backends will be included in the next
       commercial release of the NFR software, scheduled for availability in
       early second quarter 1999. NFR software can be purchased from certified
       NFR resellers worldwide.

 10.0  A good example of how "Secure" NT really is
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       From Network Computing via Techweb
       
       http://www.techweb.com/se/directlink.cgi?NWC19990308S0022
       
       March 08, 1999, Issue: 1005
       Section: Columnists
 
       With Friends Like These...
       Art Wittmann
 
       A couple of freelance writers are working on a story for us about security
       auditing and protection. As part of their "research," they decided to see if they
       could hack into one of our lab networks. It took them only a few hours to
       successfully break into our Windows NT boxes. And from there, they learned
       the configuration of our lab networks, the server names and functions, the
       operating systems we run and most of the passwords on the key accounts on
       our Microsoft Windows NT, Novell NetWare and Unix servers, as well as a
       good many of our routers and switches.
 
       Our lab is not run as a mission-critical production network-it isn't meant to be
       particularly secure. But we do stay up to date on most service packs and
       patches for the major operating systems. So, unless you've taken a very active
       stance on security for your network, you should be worried.
 
       Reusing Passwords? The hacking expertise of these guys is by no means
       unique. Plenty of people out there can do what they did, and some can do it
       better. While NT has its fair share of vulnerabilities out of the box, there is a
       LAN Manager issue that blows the doors wide open. In summary: NT stores
       password hashes in a format that is hard to crack by brute-force methods,
       and that's a good thing. However, Microsoft has chosen to maintain
       compatibility with LAN Manager's password store, and therefore keeps a
       second hash of passwords. This table isn't so secure. In fact, brute-force
       methods usually can come up with a few passwords in short order.
 
       Within two hours, our hackers had obtained 5,000 of our 5,045 passwords
       by brute-forcing them. A few days and millions of keystrokes later, using
       those same passwords, they owned the entire network. So, do you use the
       same passwords across all platforms?
 
       The problem is exacerbated for smaller shops where a single crew administers
       NT, NetWare, Unix and other systems because they tend to use the same
       administrator password for all systems under the group's management. For
       very obvious reasons, that's a bad idea. Our lab was no exception, and our
       hackers quickly infiltrated our NetWare and Unix servers, as well as our
       Cisco routers.
 
       Instructions for cleaning up this hole in NT are provided in the Microsoft
       Knowledge Base article Q147706. However, doing so may break
       applications that still use the LAN Manager hash table. In particular, if you're
       still using DOS or Windows 3.1, problems are likely. And if you're running
       OS/2 LAN Manager, implementing Microsoft's fix will break compatibility.
 
       From what I've read about this security hole in the writings from the hacker
       community, Service Pack 3 contains a number of security fixes that make it
       harder to crack passwords. These should be implemented, but regardless,
       LANMan compatibility needs to be disabled if you want your NT server to be
       secure.
 
       Expect Little Help From Microsoft Of course, Microsoft doesn't promote the
       fact that a security hole exists or that it can be patched. If you're clever enough
       to know about it and to ask the right questions, the company will provide a fix.
       In my opinion, that's something akin to Ford putting a sticky note on the
       bulletin board outside the CEO's office about a little Pinto gas-tank problem
       and then claiming that the hazard was adequately publicized.
 
       Finally, you'd think that Windows 2000 would be the perfect place for
       Microsoft to rid itself of this problem, wouldn't you? Well, just like me, you'd
       be wrong. It turns out that Microsoft is committed to maintaining LANMan
       compatibility in Windows 2000 out of the box.
 
       The moral of the story is clear: The onus is on you to protect the integrity of
       your systems; Microsoft is not going to go out of its way to help you. You
       must dedicate staff to following the security advisories about all your operating
       systems-simply looking at the vendor's home pages is not enough. A good
       many of the hackers out there publicize the security holes they know about.
       It's my advice that you heed them well.

 11.0 The Black Hat Briefings Security Conference
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                           http://www.blackhat.com/
                           July 7 - 8th, Las Vegas, Nevada
       
       
       Computer Security Conference Announcement Computer Security Conference
       
       
       Description and Overview
       
       
       It's late. You're in the office alone, catching up on some system
       administration tasks.  Behind you, your network servers hum along quietly,
       reliably. Life is good. No one can get to your data or disrupt your WAN. 
       The network is secure. Or is it?
       
       
       While we could create more fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), we would
       rather announce The Black Hat Briefings '99 conference! The Black Hat
       Briefings conference series was created to provide in-depth information
       about current and potential threats against computer systems by the people
       who discover the threats. To do this, we assemble a group of vendor
       neutral security professionals and let them talk candidly about the
       security problems businesses face and the solutions they see to those
       problems.  No gimmicks, just straight talk by people who make it their
       business to explore the ever-changing security space.
       
       
       While many conferences focus on information and network security, only The
       Black Hat Briefings will put your managers, engineers, and software
       programmers face-to-face with today's cutting edge computer security
       experts and "underground" security specialists. New for 1999, there will
       be three tracks of speaking.  The "White Hat" track will inform your CEO
       or CIO with no-nonsense information about what issues to be aware of, and
       what they can ignore.  The two "Black Hat" tracks will provide your
       technical staff with nitty-gritty technical information about current and
       potential threats to your computer systems. 
       
       
       Only the Black Hat Briefings conference will provide your staff with the
       pragmatic tools and knowledge they need to help thwart those lurking in
       the shadows of your fire wall or the depths of your company's WAN. The
       reality is they are out there [back to the FUD]. The choice is yours--you
       can live in fear of them, or you can learn from people like them.
       
       
       Conference Overview
       
       
       Spanning two days with three separate tracks, The Black Hat Briefings will
       focus on the vital security issues facing organizations with large
       Enterprise networks and mixed network operating systems. Topics will
       Include Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Computer Forensics (CF)systems,
       Incident Response, Hostile Mobile Code, vulnerability analysis, secure
       programming techniques, tool selection for creating and effectively
       monitoring your networks, and management issues related to computer
       security.  You will be put face-to-face with the people developing the
       tools used by and against hackers.
       
       
       This year the Black Hat Briefings has grown to include a separate track
       specifically designed for the CEO and CIO. This third track, nick named
       the "White Hat" track, was developed by the National Computer Security
       Center (NCSC) of the National Security Agency. While the other tracks have
       a technology focus, this track is for people who have to manage an
       organization's security posture. What should you look for when hiring an
       outside security consultant? Should you even look outside your
       organization?  What are the potential security threats?  What should you
       do to reduce the risk of losses due to computer security incidents? The
       "White Hat" track will help you answer these questions. 
       
       
       The Black Hat Briefings has developed a reputation for lively and in-depth
       presentations and discussions between "underground" security celebrities,
       vendors, and attendees.  This year you can expect more visual
       demonstrations, more speakers who are authoritative in their fields, and,
       as always, an excellent time. 
       As an added bonus, people who attend The Black Hat Briefings get free
       admission to DEF CON 7.0, the largest Hacker convention in the US, held
       right after Black Hat in Las Vegas. For more information see the DEFCON
       web site at http://www.defcon.org/.

       of rapidly evolving economic processes. The unprecedented
       reliance on computer technology transformed the previous technical
       side- issue "information security'' to a management problem
       requiring decisions of strategic importance. Hence, the targeted
       audience represents decision makers from government, industry,
       commercial, and academic communities. If you are developing
       solutions to problems relating to the protection of your countrys
       information infrastructure or a commercial enterprise, consider
       submitting a paper to the "CQRE - secure networking" conference.
       
       
       We are looking for papers and panel discussions covering:
       .. electronic commerce
       - new business processes
       - secure business transactions
       - online merchandising
       - electronic payment / banking
       - innovative applications
       
       
       .. network security

       .. legal aspects
       - digital signatures acts
       - privacy and anonymity
       - crypto regulation
       - liability

       - risk / disaster management
       - security awareness and training
       - implementation, accreditation, and
          operation of secure systems in a
          government, business, or industry
          environment
       
       
       .. security technology
       - cryptography
       - public key infrastructures

                    Countering Cyber-Terrorism
                      June 22-23
                    Marina del Rey, California
             A workshop sponsored by the Information Sciences Institute
                  of the University of Southern California
       
       
                Call for Participation
       
       
       Recent studies warn of Cyber-Terrorism and the vulnerability of our
       computer systems and infrastructure to attack. These reports identify
       damage that determined, knowledgeable, and well-financed adversaries could
       inflict on commercial, government, and military systems.  Such attacks
       would have severe consequences for the public, and in particular the
       economy, which has become dependant on computers and communications
       infrastructure.
       
       
       The objective of this workshop is to identify things that should be done
       to improve our ability to detect, protect against, contain, neutralize,
       mitigate the effects of, and recover from cyber-terrorist attacks.
       Participants are sought from the computer security, electronic commerce
       and banking, network infrastructure, military, and counter-terrorism
       communities, as well as those with experience of cyber-terrorist attacks.
       Recommendations may suggest research and development or operational
       measures that can be taken.  The workshop is NOT a forum for presentation
       of the latest security systems, protocols or algorithms.  The workshop
       will address the strategies, framework, and infrastructure required to
       combine and incrementally deploy such technologies to counter the
       cyber-terrorist threat.
       
       
       Attendance will be limited to approximately 25 participants.  Participants
       will be selected on the basis of submitted position papers that raise
       issues for the workshop to discuss, identify threats or countermeasures,
       or propose strategies or infrastructure to counter the threat of
       cyber-terrorism. Position papers should be four pages or less in length. 
       Submissions should be sent in e-mail in Word or PDF format, or as ASCII
       text to cyber-terrorism-ws@isi.edu.
       
       
       Please check the web page http://www.isi.edu/cctws for more information,
       including a position paper from the organizers which will be available two
       weeks prior to the submission deadline.
       
       
       Important Dates:
       
       
         Organizer's Paper Available              April  5, 1999

    In the last release we mentioned that www.hackernews.com's server was 
   showing only the directory structure and no site was available also that
   the www.l0pht.com server was not accepting http requests, neither site 
   was indeed hacked they were both merely down for maintenance, but it was
   'reported' here as a possible hack since I didn't have time to confirm or
   deny the report by contacting the admins before the issue went out, hope
   it didn't cause too much of an annoyance to anyone and my apologies to
   both hackernews and the l0pht for any alarmism perceived or imagined
