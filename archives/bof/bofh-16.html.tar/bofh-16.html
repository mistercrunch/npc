<h1>The Bastard Operator from Hell goes Meglomanic - The Sealed Section</h1>

THE WAY IT IS<p>

Recently someone called me from one of the "Out on the Floor Offices",
an ethereal place rumoured to exist only in hyperspace, populated by
mysterious being called Users.<p>

She was quite frantic.She was having trouble running a program through
the computer, and her message was clear enough, although rather ill-
conceived:"MY FILES ARE FULL!"<p>

I furrowed my brow, lit a smoke, and explained to her, "Really now,
Miss Butterman, I don't have time for this." I slowly exhaled the
menthol vapours as I stopped her process, crushing any hope she may
have had of ever again seeing that document she had spent three hours
slaving over.<p>

"I was a typing this REALLY important letter, and it HAS to be ready
in an hour...there's all this stuff on my screen that I didn't type
...it says something about an error, should I read it to you?"<p>

"No point. Just press return."<p>

"oh my, it wants my username. Can I restart that where I left off?"<p>

"Not a chance." I drew another puff and tossed the phone aside. It
occurred to me that if I had to hear one more of those whining
complaint sessions, heads were gonna roll. Where do you people GET
this stuff? I'm going to tell you what's really going on here. Now
LISTEN UP. I'm not going over it a second time:<p>

Computer: The black box that does your work for you. That's all you
need to know.<p>

Response Time: Usually measured in nanoseconds; sometimes measured in
calendar months. The general rule is: Shut up your complaining about
response time.<p>

Hardware: See "Computer." Again, not your concern.<p>

Software: If we want you to know we'll tell you about it, otherwise,
leave us alone<p>

Network: Don't worry about it, we'll take care of it. Use it to send
mail among your half-wit selves, and don't think we won't read it
all. What do you think we do all day? By the way, Butterman... shame
about your mother's pancreas.<p>

Data: The General rule is: Don't use any data files and if you find
any, delete them before before I find out about them. In fact, just
stay off the computer (see "Response Time")<p>

System Crash: Don't ever call the system manager to tell him you think
the compu ter is down. Don't call him to ask him when it will be up
again. The more you bother him, the longer it takes.<p>

Downtime: like I said, don't ask.<p>

Uptime: Don't be ridiculous<p>

Vacation: A time during which I don't have to put up with your
sniveling.Don't try calling. There's no point.<p>

Computer Room: Keep out, you're not invited. Don't knock on the door-
don't even think about it. I broke the phone last time one of you
jerks called me, and I'm not about to replace it. And keep your greasy
fingers off the windows.<p>

My Office: The name says it all...it's mine;stay out.<p>

Your Problems: not my concern.<p>

Deadlines: The general rule is: Deadlines are not acknowledged by me;
they're not my responsibility. Go tell somebody who cares.<p>

Maintenance: a) A Valid reason for shutting down the system at any
time b) Much more important than anything any of you bozos do.  c)
Anything I choose to call maintenance.<p>

Software Upgrades: Far too complex for you to comprehend. If I tell
you I'm upgrading the system, just be quietly thankful. It's for your
own good, even if it does mean extensive downtime during peak hours.<p>

Electronic Mail: I delete it before reading it, so don't bother
sending any to me.<p>

Defaults: We like them just like they are;we chose them for a reason.
Don't mess with them; consider them mandatory.<p>

Error Messages: I'm not interested. I'm going to kill your process
anyway, so keep them to yourself.<p>

Killing your Process: a)Don't ever ask why b)Beyond your control c)No
warnings given d)The highlight of my day e)If you call, it's going to
happen. No exceptions.<p>

Password: I reserve the right to change them without notice at any
time.I choose them, and the more you bother me, the more degrading
yours will be.(Example:BUTTERMAN:SNOTFACE)<p>

Users: a)They slow down the computer b)They waste my time c)A general
nuisance d)Worse than that, actually<p>

Software Modification: You don't know what you want - we'll tell you
what you want.  It stays like it is. Period.<p>

Privileges: I've got them, you don't need them. Enough said.<p>

Priority: Mine is higher than yours, accept it. That's the reason my
games run faster than your lousy accounting package.<p>

Terminals: Before calling me with your terminal problems, consider
this: a)Are you prepared to do without one for weeks?  b)Do you REALLY
want your process killed?  c)Did you just trip over the cord again?
d)Of course you did<p>

Disk Space: I set the quotas, you live with them. If you need more
space, check "Data Files".<p>

Operator: I hired him and I trained him. He does what I tell him to.
Usually armed;always dangerous.<p>

Backups: a)A good idea b)If I gave a sh*t c)Which of course I don't<p>

Lunch: The only time calling my office won't result in the killing of
your process.<p>

Data Security: That's your problem. I'm certainly not going to lose
any sleep over it. My files are locked up tight. I feel secure.<p>

Jiffy: Length of time it takes me to resolve your problem by killing
your process.<p>

Eternity: Length of time it takes me to give a sh*t about any problems
that can't be resolved by killing your process.<p>

Impossible: a)It can't be done (as far as you know) b)I can't be
bothered c)You're starting to annoy me<p>

Inevitable: a)Couldn't have been avoided b)Not my fault (as far as you
know) c)The result of annoying me<p>

Menus: If it's not on the menu, don't ask for it. It's not
available. If it is on the menu, it's probably of no use or it doesn't
work. We're working on it (See "eternity")<p>

Utilities: I find them quite useful, you'll find them quite
inaccessible. Besides, they're not on the menu, are they. What did I
tell you about that?<p>

Nuisance: You<p>

Of course, I reserve the right to add, change, or remove anything from
the above list. I'm not asking you to accept these matters without
question, I'm telling you.<p>

Now that we all know where we stand, I'm sure there'll be no future
problems. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to
keep them to yourself. If you feel the need for more information, I
highly recommend that you ask someone else.<p>

Sincerely--System Manager<p>

P.S.The new disk quota of 30 blocks per user became effective
yesterday. Anyone caught exceeding the quota will lose their accounts
(this means you, Butterman!)<p>
