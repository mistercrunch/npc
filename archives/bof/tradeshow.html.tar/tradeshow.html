<font size=4 color="#ECA4A4"><em><strong>The Bastard goes to the Trade Show</strong></em></font></p>
<hr noshade>
<p>I decide to kill some time by dropping into a Computer Trade show to &quot;sense the new direction of 
the market and Investigate emerging trends&quot;, i.e. I'll spend a shitload of the company's cash on food 
and drink and give a couple of salespeople a hard time they won't forget.</p>
<p>Well, that's how the normal bastard would do it, but not me. I really get remembered. All I need 
now is an acronym.... Hmmm...</p>
<p>I get there and two stalls promptly close when they see me coming, (poor losers), but theres 4 or 5 
newbies that look like easy meat. I centre on a vendor that's trying to push their unix compliance 
with every ISO standard except hygene and start talking 7-figure site upgrades. Ignoring his panting, 
I continue to talk, harping on about our requirement for complance with currently emerging 
standards till he takes the ball and runs with it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah well, you see, we're THE foremost company in compliant systems&quot; (turd) &quot;In fact, our 
projected market share is.... blah blah blah..&quot;</p>
<p>I let him dig his hole nice and deep. He's sure that 2 years at University has prepared him for the 
hardball arena of BIG $ales.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; I cut in &quot;But all this is irrelevant without a Dynamically Allocated Heap and some Transient 
Intuitive Hardware System. Are you D.A.E.H.T.I.H.S compliant?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dynamic Allocation of Extra Heap and the Transient Intuitive Hardware Standard, 
D.A.E.H.T.I.H.S. It's THE most important thing to come out of ISO this DECADE! I guess you 
don't have an implementation path yet then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell you what&quot; he says, smelling a deal &quot;The Regional Manager is on the Showroom floor 
somewhere. I'll track him down and get an answer for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that would be great!&quot; I say, trying to enthuse him and keep him from staring at the acronym 
for too long. &quot;But I'm a bit pressed for time, I've got a flight in...&quot;</p>
<p>He runs off. The Regional Manager is no dummy. They're trained to recognise &quot;SHITHEAD&quot; spelt 
backwards. And upside down. And reverse. And lipread.</p>
<p>One stall down, 4 to go. I troll up to the next..</p>
<p>&quot;Hi there, what form of hardware solution are you looking for?&quot; Mr Smiles says (In other words, 
how can I tuck you for an extra grand)</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't really know. I need a fast and expandable machine that's top of the line but also 
capable of talking to my old luggable laptop.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Smiles likes the words &quot;Fast&quot;, &quot;Top of the Line&quot; and &quot;Expandable&quot;. He runs over to a machine 
surrounded in glitter and advertising and gestures at it. &quot;This is probably what you want then. The 
latest thing. There's only two in the country and luckily we have one here today&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes yes, but will it talk to my laptop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;THIS baby will talk to ANYTHING. What's the interface, ethernet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, a SCSI-1 Interface. My machine pretends to be a disk, ID 3. But lots of machines kill my 
machine's powersupply with inductive transience backflow due to a non-standard SCSI interface...</p>
<p>&gt;DUMMY MODE ONE&lt;</p>
<p>He practically BEGS me to try the new machine out. Which I've been waiting for. I drag out my 
luggable, which is, admittedly, a bit of a beast.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow! That IS old!! And &gt;ungh!&lt;.. quite heavy too. I guess you're quite attached to it?&quot;</p>
<p>I mumble about legacy data, only use it at home, sentimental value and irreplaceable software while 
he plugs it in and starts the host machine.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, let's see what we can see&quot; he says, and presses the power-on switch on my &quot;portable&quot; The 
31 hefty nicad batteries that make up almost the entire inside of my &quot;laptop&quot; pour grunt into a tripling 
inverter which in turn supplies RICH, CHUNKY VOLTS to alternate pins on the &quot;SCSI&quot; bus, 
whilst emitting a dull &quot;uuurk&quot; sound.</p>
<p>&quot;My Laptop!&quot; I cry, reaching for it, just as smoke starts pouring out the back of the display 
machine. Mr Smiles dives for the demo machine weeping, while I exit, in &quot;anguish&quot;....</p>
<p>...resetting the circuit breaker in my machine as I go...</p>
<p>..to the next stall...</p>
<p>&quot;Hi there, you look like someone who needs an upgrade!&quot; the salesman chirps</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't really know. Is any of your stuff capable of talking to my luggable laptop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HELL YES!&quot;</p>
<p>One born every minute.</p>
