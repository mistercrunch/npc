<p>Programming is dull at the moment since the only &quot;bug&quot; in my software is now repaired. (The 
swipe-card door-access machine had some logic &quot;glitch&quot; that unfortunately no-one knew about until 
a particularly annoying Sales Consultant got accidentally locked in the secure area over the holiday 
weekend. The poor guy was a drooling wreck when they found him - apparently the sirens and 
sprinklers were playing up in there too, every 10 minutes. It all goes to show that you can't be too 
careful when stealing an ex-operators car park.</p>
