City info:
Landri is a trading  and fishing city, it has about 200 citizens and is quite rich. It큦 the oldest of the seven cities. Every 1st in a month is market-day. 

There is a big trading link between Landri and Velsen (because it큦 the main route for Velsen to get any goods from the elven or the dwarves)

One of Landri큦 biggest incomes comes from the "way-taxes" collected at the River Mirat. Every ship has to pay a little percentage of its value.

(All seven cities are linked with a net of messengers and transporters, who travel dayly in a clockwise and ant-clockwise route. Each city represents a one-day-stop. Routes are: Landri-Kondor-Sigol-Fistun-Gardon-Palwek-Velsen-Landri and the other way round. A one-day-delivery of a message costs one gold, a two-day costs two gold an so on. Delivery of goods cost special. There is also an emergency-direct-route to Kondor (costs nothing))

gates: are closed at sunset and are opened at sunrise
towers and city wall: Citywall is about 4m high and 2m strong, there is no catwalk on it. The citywall reaches into the lake and the river, so it큦 impossible to enter the city from the harbour-side without getting wet. (Except "walk on water" spells...)
Towers are about 5m high and can be accessed through a staircase. There are shooting slots. Each tower can be used by three men.
