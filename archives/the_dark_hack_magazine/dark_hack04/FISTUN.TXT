City info:
Fistun is a trading city, it has about 450 citizens and is quite rich. Every 20th in a month is market-day. On 09.08. is a carival.

Fistun is the main linkin-point of the Jola-wines, the elven goods from Sigol and the dwarven goods from Gardon. It´s famous for marvellous food (and drinking) and you can alway find adventuring groups in the taverns because of the good possibility of buying equipment combined with the near possibility of adventure in Konynk-forrest.

legend:
1= market place (lively also on non-market days because locals are allowed to trade/entertain there)

Routes are: Fistun-Gardon-Palwek-Velsen-Landri-Kondor-Sigol-Fistun and the other way round. A one-day-delivery of a message costs one gold, a two-day costs two gold an so on.
