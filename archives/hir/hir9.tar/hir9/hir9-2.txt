Book: Novell Netware

Clarke, James David, IV.  " Novell's CNE Study Guide 
	 IntranetWare/Netware 4.11" 
        Novell Press, San Jose 1997

ISBN 0-7645-4512-4

Asmodians Slightly biased Summary: 

Although Jam packed with fruity information on Netware, This book is
poorly orginised.  The incessant "Words of wisdom" and the authors Flaming
ego tend to distract your attention from the actual content.  This book
requires a long attention span, and perhaps some form of Ritalin to fully
digest it.  Im not suprised if this book was in part sponsored by the
midwest pulp association, weighing in at a paltry 1570 pages.

Asmodians Slightly biased Rating: 

If your stuck in the wilderness and need to start a fire, do not have any
qualms about burning this book, you will be missing nothing.. 

Asmodians un-biased Note:
This book is one of the only resources that covers all materals covered
in the CNE/CNA exams.  Thus its a necessary Evil.

Book: Telecom guide.
Green, James Harry.  "The Irwin Handbook of Telecommunications 3rd Ed." 
        Irwin, Chicago 1997 

ISBN 0-7863-0479-0

Summary: 

This book is some what dry, however it is concise and very to the point. 
I found it easy to read, and it was very factual.  It goes into great
detail on the telecommunications industry.  A must read if you want to
feel the telecomunication industry's pain.
