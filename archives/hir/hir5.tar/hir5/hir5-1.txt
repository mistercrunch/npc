Here it is... HiR5!  This was the first HiR to be typed up entirely on UNIX
style systems (Slackware and AIX), Commodore Amigas, and palmtops (Compaq PC 
Companion and HP 300LX) Boy, are we straying away from mainstream or what? 
Despite the fact that Axon still added the finishing touches and put the 
final product together on his palmtop, this was still by far the smoothest 
production run the mag has seen.

HiR is an electronic publication that is written by real hackers and phone
phreaks that have the desire to share information.  We only publish articles
related to hacking and hreaking.  We don't cover viruses, stealing, carding,
or blowing things up.  

As a general rule, we don't do many walk-thru's; occasionally we might, 
but we almost always focus more on explaining a given aspect in enough 
depth to help the reader understand why things happen.  With that 
information, they may learn for themselves and discover many other 
things related to the article.  

 "If you give a man a fish, he will be full for a day.  If you teach 
       him to fish, he will be full for the rest of his days."

You have probably heard that many times.  The same holds true for knowledge.
If you read a little trick, you'll try it, and it will be fun for a while.
It will eventually get old, and you will grow tired of it.  Many things
covered in HiR can be like that if you read it without trying to learn.  We
strongly urge you to look closer at our explanations, so that you can gain
more knowledge than we could ever attempt to convey in any amount of typing.

 "If you give a man a trick, he is content until it grows old.  If you
       help him create his own tricks, he is content for life..."

Corny, but true.

The HiR crew is proud to announce a new member/writer.  Frogman, who has
been one of Axon's acquaintances for almost 4 years, writes his debut arti-
cle on RSA encryption.  He has strong interests in Crypto and cellular.
He's one of the few people who still uses the Amiga (He has a superbly
modified A2000 as his main system.)

A new regular section has been added.  We are going to include a list
of "Informative Resources".  We'll try to include one in every issue.
Basically, this section will contain several URL's, book references,
telnet things, etc that contain useful information (or a good way to
FIND it).  We won't ever place the same ones twice, so you have to
collect 'em all!
