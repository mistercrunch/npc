HiR Newz

We've again changed our distro site URL (back to what it was before).  It
took us a while to find out that over the christmas break, the httpd was
taken down, and replaced with Lotus Notes (Domino) running on port 2500.
the new url is:
     http://students.jccc.net:2500/~axon2017/hir.html
Our mirror site on The Man in Black's server (In New Mexico) is at:
     http://azure.rcn.nmt.edu:2007/HiR/     (HiR is case sensitive)
The mirror runs on port 2007 because of a firewall on almost all ports
0-1024.  2007 is The Man in Black's Fave #, and it's above 1024.

As you all know, Frogman is now writing articles for us!  <CHEER!>
This issue, he wrote an article describing the general theory behind RSA 
Cryptography.  In future articles, he may include some source code with
some very small prime numbers (versus the extremely large ones currently
used in today's technology (also, if he uses like 4 or 5 bit primes, he
can't get in any trouble with the government if it gets overseas.)

Axon's Palmtop is officially his new primary system.  This may sound
strange at first.  He still telnets out to his favorite unix systems
to do a lot of stuff, but he purchased a PCMCIA Compact flash adapter
and an 8 meg compact flash card.  He's found all the toys he really 
needs (including a 186 emulator, with dos 6.22, so he can finally use
pkzip to compress the magazine).  This issue of HiR was weeded of major
spelling errors, gathered up, compressed, and uploaded entirely from
his palmtop (All of Axon's articles were written on it, other members
used anything from palmtops to Amigas to Linux to do their writing.)
