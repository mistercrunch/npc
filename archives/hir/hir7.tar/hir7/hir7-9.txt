                            -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Late Issue...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
HiR 7 was REALLY late this time around, due to a lot of really messed up
stuff.  We're sorry for keeping ya guys on hold for so long.  Axon can't
write as much as he used to be able to, due to more hours, and a job that
actually requires some work (rather than sitting there typing articles on
the job.  =] )  Classes have kicked back in for Frogman and Asmo... But
HiR will still kick out information.  We aren't dead... just overworked.

NEW URL
-=-=-=-
okay, folks... ml.org is broken.  It's *very* broken.  And Axon moved
again.  This time, to his workstation.  the new URL is:

http://axon.jccc.net/hir/

Just in case you couldn't tell, Axon has full control of this server.
It'll also be the place to find homepages of HiR members.  Also, the
articles and software are all available from there via anonymous ftp.
