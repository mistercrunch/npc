		Hackers Information Report Issue Number Ten
				Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hackers Information Report is an electronic magazine that's
distributed free of charge over the Internet and bulletin board systems.
It is produced by a group of real hackers and phone phreaks, and only
discusses ethical hacking and phone phreaking techniques and information.
We never cover steaking, blowing things up, or system cracking directly.
Some of the information that we publish might be able to be used in a
negative fashion, but we provide it to be used in an educational, ethical
manner.   We may publish some "Walk Through" hacks and tricks, but we
really attempt to describe a given system in enough detail for the reader
to gain their own information on the topic, rather than just spoon-feeding
the masses.   Think of it as "Priming the Intellectual Pump".

	HiR #10 Release notes.

	We've really fallen behind.   We aren't dead, nor will we be for
some time.  Due to a very unfortunate turn of events, we've had some major
problems producing good articles and getting them out in any sort of
timely manner.  First, Axon has been moved around to a position of higher
responsibility, as well as taking 10 Credit hours of college classes and
holding down a second job.  This leaves very little time for writing.
Next, he was also asked to remove the HiR Distro site from his place of
employment.  It was thought that the material that was presented may
result in legal problems.  (I really doubt it would have but that's the
breaks.)   We've had a few other website offers, and we're trying to get
the site up as fast as possible.  This involves copying archives and
unpacking them, as well as some other evil stuff.
