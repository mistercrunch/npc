        So many people way too often ask me "how do I hack?" or ask me to
TEACH them how to, as if it was like cooking (add a little this and that and
bake for 2 hours).  Unfortunately, it's far from being easy to "teach" all
the skills that are needed, but over the last few years I've come up with
a list of things that most people don't have, that they either really need,
or would just be good help if they want to be serious about this sport.

  1) A computer
        Let me explain this one.  I survived on an 8088 laptop and 2400bps
        for quite a while.  I wasn't cracking password files with it, but
        I could have my modem software/scanner, and a slow but useful modem
        attached.  Most of you will want something with a little bit more
        power (for games, if nothing else).  Any x86 (386/486/Pentium) based
        system should work, as long as it can run any popular operating
        system.  Ideally, I would suggest having at least a cheaper, old
        laptop that's pcmcia (PC-Card) modem ready, unless you want to find
        a 120v wall outlet in farmer jones' pasture... (I'll discuss lappies
        later)

  2) A modem
        These are very handy.  Pick one, I don't care what kind, no one else
        will either.  Just don't get a ZOOM series and you're good to go.
        Now that I got the two basic things out of the way that make people
        say "DUH!!!  Axon, do you think I'm an idiot?!".  No comment.

  3) A touch of phreaker power
        Most hackers have learned that they have to, at one time or another
        borrow some tricks from another popular cyberculture sport, phreaking.
        My suggestions are to know how to build and use a device called a
        "Gold Box".  It allows you to hack from home, and it's traced to a
        different number.

        for those of you that choose to dabble with a laptop, familiarize your-
        selves with another tool called the "beige box", which allows you to
        directly tap into someone else's phone system and use their line.  If
        a trace is run on you, it's not your number, it's the number of the
        house (corporation etc.) you were using.  Fun, huh?

...and while we are talking about laptops...(a brief tanget by Axon)
When I first got into computers, the modems were strange...one didn't plug
something into a phone line and type commands in.  They placed the actual
handset of the phone onto some rubber cups (that picked up and sent out the
carrier sounds and translated the sounds into characters for the computer).
Recently there has been a popularizing of a device similar to the old acoustic
modems (which were capable of no higher than 1200 bps).  The newer cousin of
the modems-of-old is called an Acoustic Coupler.  It looks like a whacked up
telephone.  On the old modems, you didn't need to find a jack to plug into,
just find a phone, any phone that works.  That's the idea behind the Coupler.
Usually running off 9v Batteries, the "phone cord" from the coupler plugs into
your modems "line" jack, and you simply strap a handset down onto the rubber
cups, and dial.  I recently acquired one of these, and I've gotten speeds up
to 19,200bps with it.  That brings me to #4...
(end of taqngent)

  4) Acoustic coupler
        Just for those of you who might be using a portable computer, palmtop,
        laptop, or some other strange device to hack with.  (I won't explain
        this any further, read above if you haven't already.)

  5) Curiosity and Drive
        Many people who really feel that their destiny is to become a hacker
        just don't have that drive that makes them want to know more.  This is
        important.  You MUST be curious; enough so to keep you hooked on
        hacking.  If you don't have this much, stop reading and go into
        basket weaving or something.

  6) Decent study skills
        No, this doesn't mean you should be a straight "A" student.  School is
        boring and pointless.  I had a 1.6 GPA after i finished High screwl.
        If you can't stand the thought of sitting down and spending lots of
        your time observing, writing, brainstorming, programming, and testing,
        you can forget hacking as well.  Hackers need brains.  (Read the
        article "Preparing the hack" later this issue.)

  7) Other things that help which are not always needed
        Know some programming, I don't care if it's assemlber, C++, Pascal,
        QuickBasic 4.5, or what.  A hacker should be able to at least write
        small programs, but if you insist that coding is not your thing, it's
        not really 100% important.  Also, some Hardware knowledge is good (as
        well as knowing how to use a soldering iron and electrical tape).
        Most of the quality hacking tools available on the net are good.  Try
        things like "ToneLoc" and many others.  Also, if you have a printer
        you should use it.  I have file cabinets FULL of info I've printed
        on operating systems, companies, networks, and other things.  Remember
        those study skills!


Technically, I guess that's all you really need in order to start hacking.
Of course some kewl-ass little toys are good to have, such as a multitester
or Oscilliscope (the oscilliscope's uses for computer hacking are a few and
far between from my experience) and anything else you can use to help you hack
into your mark.  (Remember: A hacker is a survivalist who will use whatever
he can to his advantage)
