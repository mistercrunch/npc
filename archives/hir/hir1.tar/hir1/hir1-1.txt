                         Hacker's Information Report

This is the fisrt issue of HIR.  Hopefully this will be a bi-monthly
publication.  Those of you familiar with such well-known works as the
Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers Tech Journals, Phrack Magazine, and the old
Communications of The New Order Mags might see a stunning resemblance.  The
goals of this magazine are simple: to continue the spread of knowledge that
helps keep information free for those who wish to have it (that means you if
you're reading this)  All articles are completely H/P related.  No death or
destruction; no credit card phraud or stealing things from stores.  This is
HACKING and PHREAKING.  Exploring phone networks, pbx's, data structures, and
contributing to the general spread of...well, Hacker's Intelligence is what
this mag is about.
