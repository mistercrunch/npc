        Hello this is /|smo again <Reader groans,> coming to you live from
nowhere important.  It just occurred to me that in this day and age, more
and more independent computational devices are using infrared transceivers
to communicate with the world.  Infrared is a cheap, effective, short range
communications method.  Many people take advantage of this form of
communication daily.  Only problem is that some times a person, teacher,
instructor or any sort of host in general doesn't want people to engage in
such activities for one reason or another.  So, were going to tell you, the
user out there, how to build a fairly effective Infrared jammer.  Since it is
difficult to name anything within the visual spectrum that hasn't been taken
up at least twice, I have chosen "Infrared.966," as the official designation.
My apologies to any one else who designed an IR.966 Box. 
        The concept and design have nothing to do with me or any design.  The
Blame..err .. honor of the design goes to an "insane/ingenious" instructor at
a certain Unmentionable high school.  The concept is simply this: Infrared
communications ports just blink out messages to each other, and relies heavily
on line of sight.  If a person were to create a false garbage signal to the
two parties, communications would be unintelligable.  The Person did this by
placing the IR units at each corner of the room, effectively covering the
whole area with unusable Bogus IR signals.  The end result of that action
caused enough interference to make IR chatting no longer possible.
        The Teacher Had essentially hooked up Infrared LED's with 9V
batteries.  The LED's were on 24/7 of course, which isn't the most efficient
method, but it was effective.  Axon proposed that we use 555 IC timers
to pulse the LED.  The end result would be an infrared blinking LED.
A person Could tweak the resistance's and get a faster or slower blink rate.
Likewise a person could place in a few Potentiometers(POTS) and add some
functionality to their new device.

 What you will need to obtain:

                 -Mounts & Accessories-
1-     Casing for box..

Try using vi, or even dos EDIT.  To print this article out from dos or
