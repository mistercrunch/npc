                    HIR Release #3, December 1, 1997

        So far, so good.  We've finally made it to HiR 3.  Due to a major
screw up on the server that the main html files were located at, the distro
site has been down.  I really don't know if it will be back up by the time
this issue makes it out.  As usual, there are several outlets for HiR,
including people who post the mag on their pages, mirror sites, people who
spread it around, and some bulletin boards.  For those of you just discovering
HiR, I would recommend tracking down the first two as well.  We seem to be
getting better and better info each time around, but maybe just keep them for
collection's sake.  If you need them that bad and can't find them anywhere
you can email H_I_R@hotmail.com asking for HiR1 and HiR2.

        Furthermore, the major delay in HiR3 has been that Axon's Laptop,
which was the machine responsible for all of the articles, archiving, etc. was
down, due to some stupid 8-pin IC on the motherboard sizzling to it's untimely
death.  Now it only works off battery power, and no way to charge 'em up.

Greetz 2 Asmo, Our newest writer.  Asmodian X, who recently read up on some
previous releases of ours, and decided to help out.  He really didn't have
much choice but to run into HiR, as He is friends with tgsnoop and Axon,
before even realizing they were both HiR writers, editors, etc.  tgsnoop
introduced it to him, and axon was working on an article in class, and, all
of a sudden, Asmo, who was in the same class Axon was in, said "Is that HiR?
I know one of the writers."  His debut article is about his newest (and most
fascinating) toys, a Palmtop computer.  We're just waiting for him to find
out how to hack the main password login screen in windows CE. 

Hackers Information Report is an electronic magazine (E-Zine) that is devoted
to the free flow of information.  We only publish material that has some sort
of learning value to it, and we do not believe in "Cookbook Hacks".  If you
are looking for articles such as "How to bring any unix server to it's knees",
read no further.  (if you want to know how to bring microsoft to its knees,
we MAY be able accomodate your interests...teehee)  Seriousely, we DO walk
the reader through steps, but reading HiR alone will not make you a hacker,
will not give you enough information to pose a serious threat to anyone, and
surely will not make you "3l33t".  We try to write articles for all groups of
people, and try to make it easy to understand.  We do assume quite a bit of
computer literacy, but for the most part, this material can be used as a
primer, or to add to existing intelligence.  You can direct questions to any
one of our writers by writing e-mail to our HiR e-mail address posted above.

We are still looking for any article submissions you may have.  We can never
get too many writers!  We'll also publish any letters you send us.  Send
letters, questions, and article submissions to H_I_R@Hotmail.com.  Send all
complaints to bgates@microsoft.com.  Thanx!
