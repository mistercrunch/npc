  First off I'd just like to mention some of you, you might have read about
this in the last issue of blacklisted!411, and I cover much of the same
information but expanded on it quite a bit, Also my writing won't be very much
of quality now because I'm just struggling to sit down right now, but believe
me the information is worth your while.  A couple weeks ago I picked up a
copy of blacklisted and stumbled upon an article that someone wrote in
about hacking the cops.
        Basically what it said is as follows:

yah know those nifty little 
thingies the cops got in their cars that they use to run license plates on
to find your identity.  And believe me, if a cop has a car he has a laptop
inside, they've got me twice on that when me and a friend took his dad's car
out for a stroll.  Anyhow, if they've got the power, why shouldn't we?
You can run reports for your friends, see whats on their permanent record, 
find out their phone number, name, social security number, and about
anything else there is to know about any given person, if they've got a car.

What the thing is, is a little device you hook up between yer laptop(and i say
laptop for a reason i'll explain later) and your scanner/ham radio. It turns
ordinary data binary or ascii into a terminal node a scanner or ham radio can send
to the destination it is trying to reach.
   Like any other bum I know, I wanted to know more about this device.  It
especially sparked my interest that the nationwide manufacturers of this thing
were local, at a place called:

Kantronics
1202 E. 23rd St.
Lawrence ks,
66046
913-842-7745
fax: 913-842-2031

I gave them a call and they proved helpful, i talked to a guy named Don Rixon,
real nice guy, after asking a few questions about the KPC-3 device I asked if
he could send me a packet of information before purchasing.  Not only did he
give me that, he gave me numbers to several Radio and Electronic stores around
my area and catalogs and magazines that might be useful for beginners.
A few days later I got the information about the device and everything it
works with. They included a packet which included guidelines and help from
remote accessing your TNC(terminal node, what the data is sent onto), the
packet personal mailbox(PBBS), working with a full service BBS to forward
messages (neet stuff), GPS interfacing, the KA-Node networking system, WEFAX
(for KPC-3 and KPC-3 plus), the NEW EMWIN mode, KISS mode (for TCP/IP
operation), and DAMA mode (the European node system mode).   ok..that probably
sounds a little foreign to you now and i'm not going to go into depth about
all of this stuff because some of it takes a little bit of background in the
workings of other protocols and Ham Radio knowledge and such.
******************************************************************************
Note to wise: when i said laptop earlier, i meant it, because when you are
hooked up on ham radio, you can go anywhere you want without being traced (in
our case the same freq the cops use to run license plates, it shouldn't be
hard to find.  But when you broadcast something (enter plate number?) you are
a sitting duck.
******************************************************************************
    All the stuff they gave me was very up to date.  The best thing they sent
me was the information on their software of choice(Host Master II+) for now
I'll list the units manufactured by Kantronics/RFconcepts and how much they
cost before I explain them.

fuck the list goes on and on, ther's another RFC 4-410 a 4-310 and a max amp

Now that I've bored you to death I'll Tell you a lil bout the software pack
they sent me, on Host Master II+ Simultaneous Multi-Mode Terminal Software,
and wOOP it's fer pc's yew juss need DOS 3.1 er higher...

   Hostmaster II+ is used to match wif Kantronics KAM, KPC, or Data Engine.
Multiple windows allow seeral packet connects at the same time, each displayed
on it's own window.

WHen used with KAM, simultaneous operation on HF is also supported in RTTY,
ASCII, G-TOR, AMTOR, pactor, or CW. it also is pretty leet kos it provides
the ability to select non-standard address and interupt vectors for the
serial ports installed in a komputah, allowin use of com3 and 4, while com1
and 2 are used fer other activities.  If you want to learn more about
the KPC-3 or KAM device which i didn't cover as much as I would have liked to
call up Kantronics 913-842-7745...or ask me...muh inet accounts theese days
are unstable so just look for me on
irc as kminor or round 913/816 as tgsnoop/ttysnoop
