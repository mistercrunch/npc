                         Hacker's Information Report
                           I N T R O D U C T I O N

Well the first issue turned out okay, but it was incredibly short.  Thank
goodness I can announce a few new writers! Those of you familiar with such
well-known works as the Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers Tech Journals,
Phrack Magazine, and the old Communications of The New Order Mags might see
a stunning resemblance.  The goals of this magazine are simple: to continue
the spread of knowledge that helps keep information free for those who wish
to have it (that means you if you're reading this)  All articles are
completely H/P related.  No death or destruction; no credit card phraud or
stealing things from stores.  This is HACKING and PHREAKING.  Exploring phone
networks, pbx's, data structures, and contributing to the general spread of,
well, Hacker's Intelligence is what this mag is about.

        The HIR staff is still looking for writers.  If you are interested
        in being listed as one of the writers, e-mail an article to us!
        Remember this is H/P only.  Of course, not all articles will be
        Published, because we are looking for quality text.  I hope we can
        all learn from the boom of text that we saw in the eighties!
