        This is a new section that we are incorporating, starting this issue.
No, Hacker Newz was not in the first issue, but we hope to continue the newz
in furure issues.  Some obvious news with the HiR crew, is the addition of
two new members!  Yes, TG SNooP and Dr. Freeze have jumped in to save Axon
the task of writing the whole thing himself.  <Wild Applause>  However, due
to some problems, such as a now-formatted hard drive, (no thanks to the powers
that be) Dr. Freeze couldn't quite get his articles in, but he's got some
good stuff for HiR 3.  On a much happier note, TG SNooP just got a brand-new
box up and running (replacing his 386, thank god).

Top 10 weird things found in the trash by HiR members since the last issue:

        A List of all vehicles, including price, assigned driver, and VIN
          that are currently owned by one kansas city SWB office.

        Landscaping plans for 2 Bell offices, one in Kansas City, the other,
          somewhere in nevada or something.

        Huge list of pager numbers and PINs for some Southwestern Bell people.

        A lawn sprinkler timer schedule.  

        Estimating Department Quote Schedule

        December 1997 calendar showing the employee review schedule.

        A paper showing 2 different ways to pull a huge concrete slab out
          of the ground, and the price differences ($82,000-95,000 ???)

        Standard Crew pay rates for 1997, various positions.

        A quote sheet for a project called "One Fountain Square".  Got me.

        A moldy burrito (half eaten...or decayed).


WOW!  That's newz!  We found some other mundane things in the garbage as well
but these were just the weird ones.  Check out the HiR Distribution web page
at     students.johnco.cc.ks.us/~axon2017/hir.html    Take a look on Dec. 1st,
the planned release date for HiR 3.  Hopefully the site will have a few links
and extra files just for fun.
