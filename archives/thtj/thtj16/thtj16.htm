Editorial: THTJ Needs You / Microsoft is Scared. By Scud-O, Editor in

<P>THTJ Needs You!<BR>ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 
<P>Recently some of you out there have been saying what thtj needs to add to its 
format. You say, but you do not act. THTJ is not just made by the thtj staff, it 
is a zine made by the people, for the people. If you want to see something added 
to thtj, then work with us on it. Do it. THTJ currently has alot of matterial in 
it, but we have a serious shortage of phreaking articles that are submitted to 
us. While hacking is more popular than even, and hacking material is easy to 
come by, phreaking material is not. THTJ is working to become a medium for 
phreaking information, but we can not do it with out you. We urge you to help 
thtj and the underworld with phreaking materials. 
<P>THTJ also has a seriuos shortage of the following type of articles: 
<UL>
  <LI>NT Articles 
  <LI>Phreaking 
  <LI>UNIX Code 
  <LI>Crypto 
  <LI>VAX/Other OSes </LI></UL>
<P>The thtj staff is currently working to get articles on these subjects, but we 
can not do it alone. Your submissions are critical. Your submissions are *very* 
important to us. You help make this zine run. 
<P>Why write for thtj? Simple, thtj is one of the largest zines out there 
covering hacking, phreaking, coding, crypto, etc. THTJ has recieved worldwide 
coverage, and everyday thtj is reaching more people. Your name will be on 
peoples minds after thtj has included one of your articles. After 2 or more 
articles, you are eligable to be included on the thtj staff and receive some 
goodies from thtj.com, information before anyone else has it, meet the contacts 
and friends out there, and receive copies of thtj issues before anyone else 
does.

<P>Microsoft is Scared<BR>ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 
<P>This month sees the release of Internet Explorer 4.0, and about a million 
lawsuits that followed it. The Justice Department is cracking down on Microsoft 
again, and Sun Microsystems is suing Microsoft for its use of Java. However, all 
this should not be a surprize to anyone. Microsoft has always practiced 
aggressive and unethical trade practices. And they did all this for good reason 
with IE4. Microsoft is scared. 
<P>Why is the world's biggest company scared? They see the end of Microsoft, if 
they do not act right now. The WWW and the internet explosion took Microsoft by 
surprize. Look back 2 years ago, to the release of win95. The Microsoft Network 
was the big thing when win95 first hit the streets. MSN was very similar to AOL, 
everything was a new interface. Well, MS dismissed the WWW as a temporary fad. 
Well, this blew up in MS's face. They quickly released Internet Explorer 1.0 and 
2.0, which were pathetic, when compared to Netscape. Even in verison 2.0 
however, MS was making MS only html tags, and trying to get control of the HTML 
standard. With the new IE 4.0, MS is only expanging this control. MS is trying 
to take over the internet's most popular tool, the www. MS is also modding Java 
for obivous reasons. Java is a *huge* threat to MS. Java means that programs are 
not only platform independent, they are *OS* independent. MS has the control of 
the OS market, and they do not want to lose this. They bought out Web TV for the 
same reason. Web TV &amp; Java == No need for a computer == No need for 
Microsoft. However, if Microsoft gains control of Java and Web TV, they can make 
these work for them, and they can gain even more of the population. 
<P>Microsoft will tell you that they are the innocent big boy that everyone 
picks on, but this is pure bullshit. MS has always, and will always practice 
'aggressive marketing methods'. Example: making IE be included with Win95 or, 
computer companies do not get Win95 for their machines. Example: MSN is on the 
desktop in Win95, Standard. The list goes on. MS is nowhere near innocent, they 
are guilty as sin. Do not feel sorry for them. Hell, do not feel sorry for any 
multi-billion dollar company. 
<P>How can we stop MS from taking over the world? By mailing the President. The 
Vice-President. Your Congressperson. Your Senator. The Press. Anyone! This 
terror *must* stop, other wise we will not have a choice on 'Where we want to go 
today'

<P><STRONG>COCOTS</STRONG><BR>By shamr0ck, Special to thtj<BR>shamr0ck@juno.com 
<P>Introduction.. 
<P>Today I'm going to show you some fun stuff you can do with COCOTs. 
(Customer-Owned Coin-Operated Telephones). COCOTs are payphones owned by 
individuals and private companies. COCOT payphones have been around for many 
years. The reason COCOTs are really hitting the market is because of the money. 
COCOT owners get to keep about 85% of the profits, the rest goes for taxes, and 
trust me thats A LOT. By 1991, there were more than 30,000 COCOTs in the New 
York State alone. Just think of how many are in the rest of the country. Yes, 
it's a very big industry. Some COCOTs out there are served by AOS (Alternate 
Operator Service) companies, such as US Sprint, AT&amp;T and MCI, but they only 
serve them. Most COCOTs don't have their logo on them, although I have seen them 
on some. ALL COCOTs are required to provide a caller with access to the local 
exchange telephone company offering service within the area in which the call 
originates. Callers should be able to reach the long distance company of their 
choice by dialing 10xxx for AT&amp;t, MCI, etc. 
<P>Things to do with a COCOT 
<P>You have to know what your looking for. COCOT payphones do not have any big 
name phone company logos on them. You can usually find them in big hotels, 
inside and outside of restaurants, and a bunch of other places. So you have 
found a COCOT. "Now what the fuck do I do with it?" You get on the phone and 
dial an 800 number and you tell them to fuck off. Then they hang up on you 
(don't call a telco 800 number or some fed office, dumbass). For about five secs 
you will hear a modem type sound. Yeah, thats the 1200bps modem inside the 
COCOT. After you hear that you should hear a dial tone. Now you can dial out 
with out paying a cent. On some COCOTs you have to dial using a radio shack tone 
dialer ($25) because they disable the keypad when there's no money in the 
coffer. "So I did that but it still doesn't want to work. What do I do now?" 
Well if you tryed dialing out using both the keypad and the tone dialer you are 
out of luck. I have seen the new COCOTs around, and they really suck. You can't 
dial out because they deaden the handset. Never give up though, there are still 
a lot of old COCOTs around. 
<P>"Ok, I made a lot of calls using a COCOT. Who pays for it?" 
<P>The owner of the pay phone does..if you really like that COCOT you shouldn't 
think you are 0-day (do not abuse the fraking cocot). If you abuse it you 
will:<BR>1. Get cought.. they do get a phone bill and they do get the numbers 
you called on the bill..they are on the ESS. 2. The payphone will get taken away 
(make calls to france from N.Y. and talk for 10 hours a day; I think you know 
what I'm getting at) 3. Your mom will catch you and slap you around a bit with a 
large trout.. 
<P>Good luck.<BR>-shamr0ck

<P>Phreaking Techniques<BR>By KungFuFox, Executive Editor<BR>kungfufox@thtj.com 
<P>Welcome to the wonderful world of phones! Do you wanna make phonecalls for 
free?! Do you wanna have lotsa fun at the expense of somebody else?! Do you 
wanna have a beigebox or a redbox, but don't even know what they are?! Read on 
k-rad kiddies! 
<P>Lets start off with some basics, the kinda info you need to become a real 
phreak like the big boys! You gotta learn how to get free phonecalls! Lets start 
off with a pretty simple way, with a beigebox! I know you don't know what that 
is, it doesn't matter, I'll tell you how it works! 
<P>Basically you get a phone, and you plug it into somebody else's house instead 
of yours! Don't have a phone? No problem! My poor man's beigebox works just as 
well, and all you need to use it is a rock! Either one from your home or from 
the location of your victim is fine. Get to the victim's place, preferrably at 
night, and find a window to a room you think has a good chance of having a phone 
in it, and chuck the rock at the window. Make sure you're not standing right 
next to the window when you do this, because it's liable to break, granted you 
don't have two broken arms to throw rocks with. If you can find a neighborhood 
filled with deaf people, or a slum where people hear windows breaking regularly, 
this phreaking technique is much more likely to work. 
<P>Ok, now that the window is sufficiently removed, you need to get in there. 
Hopefully you picked a window that wasn't 10 feet off the ground. Climb on in 
there, making sure you don't peel the skin off your body, and look for a phone. 
Though you may be tempted, it isn't a good idea to turn on the lights when you 
start looking for that phone, obviously because turning on the lights is a lot 
more suspicious than breaking a window. Now for the complicated part. 
<P>Once you've located the phone, you have to use a special technique to use it, 
because ma bell designed phones so you can't beige box with them at normal phone 
jacks. Rip the phone out of the wall, so that the plug on the end of the wire 
becomes separated from the wire. Bite off the plastic cover on the wire, and 
you'll see 2 or 4 wires inside it. You'll be dealing with the red and green 
wires. Strip away a couple inches of that colored insulation from those two 
wires. Now your beigehox is prepared for use. The only thing left to do is find 
a place to beige from. 
<P>If this building you used your geolocial key to get into has a basement, 
you'll probably wanna go down there and look around for a plastic box mounted on 
a wall. It'll probably have a phone company insignia on it, most likely a 
generic bell shaped symbol, and a name with the word "bell" in it. Other 
possible names are "uswest", "ameritech", and "nynex". If this plastic box thing 
isn't in the basement, look around outside for it. It'll be on an outside wall 
somewhere around building. 
<P>Once you find it, bash it good with your beigebox until it breaks open. You 
can use your feet and hands if you like. You could even use the rock you removed 
that window with if you can find it. Just make sure you bash the cover off that 
plastic box. Hopefully after all this work you'll be greeted with some screws in 
some strange geometric pattern. Hold the beigebox's handset up to your ear so 
you can hear it if it gets a dailtone, and start touching the red and green 
beigebox wires to different screws. After a few minutes if you don't have a 
dialtone, you're either retarded or the phoneline is disconnected. In the latter 
case, you'll need to goto another building, find another plastic box with a 
phone company insignia on it, and try the same procedure there. If you're just 
retarded, bash yourself in the head with the beigebox. It's probably angry at 
you anyway, for ripping it out of the wall. 
<P>Another good way to make free phonecalls, and become an elite phreak, is to 
redbox. Don't know what a redbox is either? No sweat! I'll tell you how to get 
free calls just like a redbox does, but without the time consuming construction! 

<P>First things first, you need to find a payphone. Any payphone will do, so 
long as it works. Don't believe any of the undercover telco people on irc that 
may tell you redboxes don't work. They do! Once you've found yourself a 
payphone, you need to get to get money to use it. Ha! I didn't mean your own 
money! That wouldn't be free! My first technique is something I'll call begging. 

<P>To beg successfully, you'll need to look shabby. Don't shave if you're old 
enough that shaving matters, and don't comb your hair or whatever it is you 
normally do to it. Also, your worst clothes, slept in the night before your 
first redboxing day, is a good idea. Bring along a disposable cup, you can find 
one on the way if you need to, and go to that payphone. Now, when people walk by 
it, or walk up to use it, they're probably gonna have some change. Just sit 
there looking real pathetic and people are bound to start dropping as few coins 
as they can into your cup. Don't worry, even though they're cheapasses, 
eventually those small donations to your personal charity will add up. Once 
you've got like five bucks, you can start making calls, and they won't have cost 
you any money at all! 
<P>My second technique, which is a much more effective method of obtaining 
funds, is something I like to call mugging. This will take some patience though, 
for you need to find the weakest person possible before attacking. Preferrably 
you should find somebody who wieghs a lot less than you do. Once you've found 
your anonymous donor, you may either knock them down, or simply grab them. 
Weapons such as guns and knives are excellent when implimented properly, to 
terrify your victim into submitting to your demands for money. Once you've 
acquired the funds that you feel are necessary to support your need to make free 
phonecalls, and become a better phreak, you may let them go, and get yourself to 
a phone, to start using that money. 
<P>Ok now that you've acquired a couple tricks of the trade, get your lazy ass 
out there and phreak!

<P><STRONG>POTS</STRONG><BR>Trunks<BR>The Switching System<BR>PBXs (PABXs) 
<P>The Plain Old Telephone System (POTS): 
<P>The main part of the POTS is the actual telephone. The telephone requests 
network access by using a signalling method called loop start. When the 
telephone starts its session it's called "off hook" voltage, indicating the 
voltage being sent from the switch or CO through the 2-wire connection (red and 
green wires). Of course when you don't pick up the receiver the phone is on 
hook. 
<P>When the telephone receives a call the network (switch) gives ring voltage 
out to the telephone (90 VAC over the DC voltage). Then you get those happy 
rings and you pick up the phone. For the phone to dial out you need a type of 
signaling. Before Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF), there was good ol' rotary or 
pulse dialing. DTMF is pretty much the standard these days on most switching 
systems. Pulse Dialing is still used in some areas. 
<P>Another Signaling method is MF or Multi-Frequency. Like DTMF, MF is used on a 
few types of trunks and CCITT signaling. If you know anything about the old Blue 
Boxes, they used the KP, ST, R1-R2 signals, et cetera, which are actually MF 
signaling. 
<P>Now the tricky part is converting speech into electrical signals. For the 
switching system to change your voice into signals, it uses Transmit Loudness 
Objective Rating (TLOR). For you to receive the signals the switch then sends 
out Receive Loudness Objective Rating (RLOR). 
<P>Central Office (CO): 
<P>In many phreaking articles you will see the acronym CO, which of course 
stands for Central Office. The CO is pretty much the center of all the local 
phone networks. It connects you to the rest of the world and all the other 
switches. The CO is a physical facility where all of the networking and routing 
switches are physically held. The trunks are what call the other trunks within 
other COs (where the trunk directs or "routes" your call depends on where you 
are calling to). There is no main purpose of the CO besides housing all of the 
computers, trunks, and line-cards associated with the local network. 
<P>The Switching System: 
<P>The first major independent switching system was Step-by-Step (SxS) 
switching. SxS was run by electro-mechanical switches. It is now a rather 
archaic system but is still used in some places. Dial pulses would be used to 
cause the switches to select switch groups until the full number was dialed. 
Crossbar Switching (XB) was the next electro-mechanical switching system to come 
into play. The XB system was set up much differently than SxS. It used a matrix 
of connectors arranged in a grid to form its connection scheme. 
<P>ESS was the first non-mechanical switching system. It provided many more 
features than the basic calling system of SxS. ESS could handle both pulse 
dialing and DTMF signaling. The main ESS, which used the 1A processor, was 
easily upgradable to 1ESS. The processor also controlled 4ESS, allowed it to be 
easily upgraded, and ran in real time. 5ESS is almost the "industry standard 
switch" of today, and is far superior to Nortel's DMS switches. The 5ESS is 
manufactured by AT&amp;T and is used by almost every RBOC (Regional Bell 
Operating Company). The 5ESS's are almost entirely unix based, though it is very 
different from the unix systems you or I run. It has many more features and is 
set up by AT&amp;T for their routing and channeling. 
<P>Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs): 
<P>The PBX is almost like a miniature switch. It controls a small area like a 
business or a school phone system. The point of a PBX system is for companies to 
use as few telephone lines as necessary to get the most out of their 
telecommunications budgets. If you have 100 people and 100 phones, the fact is 
not all 100 people are going to be using the fones at the same exact time. PBX 
systems provide switching of in-house calls, and "pool" the outside lines. 
<P>There are many functionalities of the PBX, such as paging systems and voice 
mail boxes (VMBs). There are many neat things a phreaker can do to with a PBX. 
Some PBXs are set up so that someone can call in and they will get an automatic 
dial tone. After that they enter a code and the user is allowed to dial out, 
with the call being billed to the company that owns the PBX. Of course this can 
be abused, along with the VMB. 
<P>PBX networking can be very complex. I will only cover one type of Switched 
Services Network (SSN). An Electronic Tandem Network happens to be what my 
private school phone system uses. It's set up in the manner that all lines 
(extensions) have a three digit address. Automatic routing can take place within 
the private network. This SSN is setup on a privatly owned trunk so that the 
company or school can set it up however they would like. 
<P>Trunk Signaling: 
<P>Due to time constraints I can only talk about one type of trunk signaling, 
the Single Frequency (SF). SF signaling is used on all 4 wire analog systems. SF 
is a type of 'inband' signaling scheme where all information is transmitted in 
the voice band. SF uses 2600hz and 2280hz signals to transmit data. When the 
trunk is in an on-hook state the 2600hz or 2280hz tone is used to connect to the 
remote site. When the trunk is in an off-hook state the 2600hz or 2280hz tone is 
dropped. SF units can pass dial pulse address signaling at speeds from 8 to 12 
(pulses per second) PPS with 56 to 69 percent break.<BR>*2280hz is only used in 
British Telecom's trunks. 
<P>This concludes my article on the basics of the telefone system. If you see

Firewalls<BR>by Onyx 
<P>Part1 <PRE>        I am writing this article to basically confirm and dispell ideas
           about firewalls. The first section is for people who just want the
           jist of what a firewall is the second section is more technical Most
           people ,espescially hackers, consider firewalls a very big threat and
           make them to be something they are not. First lets define one in the
           simplest terms. A firewall is a computer sitting between your network
           and the Internet that runs special software to keep people out. That's
           it in the simplest terms. Firewalls can be configured in several ways
           and doesn't have to be on a seperate computer that only runs the
           firewalls software. Lot's of times a so called "poor man's firewall"
           can be configured by using a computer that is also used for other
           applications. Most of the time a firewall setup looks something like
           this (forgive the crude drawing)

                                                         &gt;
Network-------Web Server----Firewall&gt;----Internet or
                                                         &gt;

                                  &gt;
Network-------Firewall&gt;-----Webserver----Internet
                                  &gt;

        In the first example everything is behind the firewall, thus
           theoretically your network and web server are behind the firewall. In
           the second example your web server is vulnerable to attack, but even
           if you manage to breach the web server's security to get to the
           Network you still need to get past the firewall. The second
           configuration I consider more safe although others will argue
           differently (it is sometimes referred to as the "sacrificial lamb"
           configuration because you are "sacrificing" your web server).

        Getting back to what a firewall does. A firewall is designed to block
           access to certain things. Most of the time this is based on domain,
           which leads to one insecurity which I will get to later. As an example
           lets use the site, secure.com. Say secure.com decides to setup a
           firewall that denies access to port 23 (telnet) to everyone except to
           those who are apart of a certain domain. Now most of the time
           companys are too cheap and don't want to pay for expensive firewall's.
           So to get access the easiest way is to ping the firewall so it gets
           too lagged to check who you are and just drops to the desired service.
           This ONLY works for cheap firewalls. Some sites who know nothing of
           computer security and assume someone trying to break into their site
           know virtually nothing also (idiots) have tried to setup stupid "fake"
           firewalls. I ran into a site which will remain anonymous that to ,
           deter hacking attempts, said on the login screen that this was
           something something firewall blah blah blah. Well anyway it        wasn't a firewall and they were just trying to scare people into
           thinking it was so hackers would leave their site alone...didn't work
           for me =) So trying not to get to technical here, a firewall that
           checks access to a service through domains can be spoofed. If you
           would like to know about spoofing their are plenty of articles out
           there for you to read.
</PRE>
<P>Section 2 
<P>People who are interested in more technical details read on: <PRE>        This will be a more in-depth description of a firewall. People throw
           the word firewall around a lot and don't know exactly what constitutes
           one and what kinds their are. Most firewalls are screening routers.
           They provide packet filtering and work with the lower level of the
           network protocol stack. Another type is known as a proxy server
           gateway (I know it sounds imposing). They preform basic proxy
           services for external networks for internal users. These actually
           look at the data INSIDE packets. And finally the third type uses what
           is known as a stateful inspection technique. Firewalls are most often
           built ontop of routers and routers intern are used with gateways
           offering high-end protection. Here is another crappy diagram which
           depicts a screening router NOT a proxy server!
</PRE><PRE>                                |
Internet-----------&gt;|----------       |
          &lt;------------|----------User   |=Screening Router
                                                        |

        A proxy server looks SIMILAR, but not EXACTLY the same. Instead of
           just some simple uncomplicated software proxy servers are actual
           computer(s) that run ONLY special proxy software.

        Another thing I would like to point out about firewalls are that they
           are basically a newly *implemented* technology. The technology ,
           however, has been around for a while. Since the implimentation of the
           TCP/IP protocol. All that was required to develop them was some smart
           thinking. One of the recent developments was allowing video and audio
           conferences through firewalls. Before to allow this people had to
           setup the firewall so that it didn't utilize it's full potential for
           protection. When a person decides that they want a firewall they have
           to decide what services they want to offer. I know this will sound
           stupid, but u CAN setup finger to work through a firewall. Now I
           don't know exactly why you would want this except if you wanted your
           users and every other person on the net to know who is currently
           logged onto your network. Some of the services you can use through a
           firewall are:

                                 Telnet
                                 FTP
                                 HTTP
                                 Finger (sigh)

</PRE>
<P>Their is one more. X. Now I know those of you who are familiar with X 
security will be plotting in your evil little minds now (hehehe). Well anyway if 
you aren't familiar with X what you should at the very least know is that it is 
very insecure. One of the major problems with it is that users can monitor your 
keystrokes. In some instances you can ,over a telnet proxy, start a virutal x 
server.

X?<BR>By ³ntertia, Special to thtj<BR>inertia@webzone.net 
<P>In general, when one thinks of an operating system that has a graphical user 
interface, one thinks Microsoft Windows, not the X Windows System. This person 
is missing out. Here, I will attempt to explain X and it's counterparts, such as 
the XFree86 Project... along with with many examples of why X is better than 
everything else. My technical experience is limited to Linux, so XFree86 and how 
to successfully implement it on your OS will be the bulk of this article. 
<P>So what exactly is "XFree86?" XFree86 is the focus of the XFree86 project, 
developed to provide a GUI for Linux, OpenBSD, and OS2, among many others. X 
along with a good window manager (a window manager provides the GUI and sets the 
level of configuration for your environment, along with providing you a means of 
control) makes Windows 95 look like total crap. X has yet to reach the level of 
user-friendliness that Windows has, but hell, we're talking about Linux here, 
not DOS. When you get familiar with X then that Win95 partition is outta here. 
;] Enough background and opinions, let's take it to another level, shall we? 
<P>So now that you know about X... it's time to pay attention to where it lies 
in your HDD. (From now on we're talkin Linux only, X11R6, the current version) X 
is drawn from /usr/X11R6 to make it simple, this is where X and all of it's 
accessories, games, etc. are located. This makes X easily accessible, since it's 
not thrown into other directories, e.g. /usr/X11R6/bin instead of /bin. Now that 
the general location has been determined, you might wonder which files are 
important or which files do what on your system. Keep reading. 
<P>X, like anything else, has proprietary commands, that cannot be successfully 
executed without an X display open. If you are new to linux, at the shell prompt 
type startx to begin an X session, or if you prefer an X login prompt to skip 
over multiuser mode completely then edit the initial runlevel to 5 in 
/etc/inittab. To change video card settings etc, run the command Xconfigurator 
in a shell or in X itself. Sorry if the instructions are vague but the intention 
of this is not to show you how to run X, but to explain in an understandable 
manner the unique attributes and advantages of the system and provide general 
information on how to<BR>better understand how it works. You cannot, of course, 
open Netscape while inside a shell... you can inside of an Xterm in X (an Xterm 
is simply a shell emulator that is run through X) but otherwise it is 
impossible. Naturally, these proprietary commands are all GUI programs, but many 
are very powerful. Now is the time that I could go into the people who say they 
hate Windows because it's the cool thing to say, haha, but I at least have valid 
reasons for picking X over Windows any day. Don't be stupid and think that just 
because you are provided a GUI, the program is weak, because, well, you would be 
wrong. For example, there is an XFree86 driven kernel hacker, Xconfig. If you 
run X, next time you recompile your kernel type make xconfig instead of make 
config. The organization of the XFree86 system and it's identifying commands 
have been mentioned, now we will look at how it comes together. 
<P>Upon startup, the .xinitrc file is read. Here is my .xinitrc:

<P># Start up a window manager - only one of these lines should be # 
un-commented.<BR>afterstep<BR>#fvwm<BR>#fvwm95-2 
<P><STRONG>EOF</STRONG> 
<P>The file in itself keeps things nice and simple... as you can see, it sets 
the paths to a couple of other initialization files, reads them (.Xmodmap and 
.Xresources), provides you with an option to let others access X on your 
computer, and then looks for a window manager to start up with. Along with these 
initial functions, the window managers have their own initialization files to be 
read. To go into that would be overkill at this point. The system has been 
configured and all ready to start up... but what happens when it is not 
successfully run? Next we will go into common, even frequent, errors that you 
will most likely face at some point in time. 
<P>One of the simplest problems to overcome is an improper video card or 
color/resolution specification. This can be fixed by running Xconfigurator or 
simply passing arguments to the command line, such as startx -- -bpp 24, which 
will start X in 24 bit color mode, replace 24 with 8, 16, etc. to meet your own 
needs. Invalid settings have, personally, caused 90% of the problems that I have 
with X. A common error message for this is "server is already running, blah blah 
blah." Another error is "unable to access security policy etc." That, I have 
heard, is a bogus message in some versions of X11R6, and can be fixed most 
easily through re-installation, if you can call that easy maintenance. 
<P>In conclusion, X is a durable, and surprisingly enough, easy to use system. 
The level of control you have over is amazing to the typical Windows user, and 
is well worth the time to check out. I would like to go into higher detail, but 
I don't really have the time to write such a large document at once that would 
include color tables, a little source, and VERY cool feature, hosting X 
applications to a remote user. If you have any suggestions to a good 
continuation to this article feel free to email me. Peace...

Windows File Sharing Basics<BR>By Chameleon, Special to 
thtj<BR>Chameleon@intercore.com.ar 
<P>Now to you nt gurus this is all very basic but since most of you are unix 
hackers you probably dont know shit about windows. It is a must to start 
learning windows now. NT is getting big. More and more each day people are 
starting to use it. Yes I agree I hate NT and love a good ol unix box but we 
must keep up with technology. NT is widely used even by places like the 
Pentagon. (*caugh*it was easy to hack*caught*) Ok class lets start... 
<P>Say you have an IP address that you want to try and get access to you would 
do this 
<P>Example for IP address: 194.8.235.73<BR>Note: Use IP addresses because the 
name address sometimes wont work and the IP will so use IP addresses.

|Note: this will list the remote hosts name. The name is set in the | |control 
pannel/networking/indentification/computername. | 
<HR>

<P>Now that you have the computer name you need to tell windows the IP that maps 
to that computer name. So to do this you need to edit c:\windows\lmhosts open it 
in notepad or whatever. It will look like this... 
<P>127.0.0.1 localhost 
<P>you want to add the ip 194.8.235.73 and then press tab and enter the computer 
name. so the new hosts file will look like this. 
<P>127.0.0.1 localhost<BR><STRONG>194.8.235.73 MAILGATE</STRONG> 
<P>This sets up a computer name mapping to the IP address of the computer to try 
and get into its filesharing. Save this and then click your Start Button then 
goto find, then computer, then enter the computer name and it will connect to 
that computer name that you added into the hosts file. It should show the 
computer as being found. Double click it and then if your lucky it wont have a 
password but if you arent you will be prompted for a password which you will 
have to try and guess or use a brute force cracking program. 
<P>Hope this was a little help. If not at least you know how to use windows file 
sharing... 
<P>Anyone good at codeing in windows? Wana code a brute force hacking program 
for windows file sharing? E-Mail me.

<P>Ú--ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿<BR>: I. Introduction 
³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>Computers are insecure things. You and I both know that. And, In 1969 so did 
the fine people at Bell Labs, who coded UNIX. Thus, UNIX needs to be able to 
authenticate you before it can let you proceed. When you log into any system, 
you enter a user name and password. These two things are used to see if you are 
who you say you are. However, these are not the only ways that you can be 
authenticated, and passwords can be stored in other ways than just the good old 
/etc/passwd file. Before PAM, if you were to adopt a system of authenication, 
you would have to recompile every single one of your programs to support the 
authenication. Hence, may sysadmins did not use alternate methods of 
authenication, and that is why it is so easy for you and I to get into systems. 
<P>Enter PAM. PAM stands for 'Pluggable Authenication Modules' , and it is a way 
of allowing a sysadmin to set up authenication on programs and services on their 
system with out having to recompile everything. With PAM, you are able to edit a 
configuration file, and easily control the module. The idea behind PAM was 
created by both Vipin Samar and Roland J. Schemers, who released their ideas in 
DCE-RFC-86.0 (rfc86.0.txt, see References on where to get a copy of it) in 
October 1995. Both Samar and Schemers worked for Sun Microsystems, but to date, 
the only UNIX version that really supports PAM is Linux, and in particular Red 
Hat linux, who has used PAM since Red Hat 3.0.4. In Solaris 2.5 PAM was 
partically implemented, and in Solaris 2.6, it is expected to be fully 
functional. 
<P>If you are running a version of Rad Hat after 3.0.4, then you have been using 
PAM and may not have known about it, since Red Hat's RPM package manager 
automatically handles the changes to PAM if a package you install requires it. 
<P>Ú--ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿<BR>: II. Modules 
³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>There are 4 types of modules defined in the PAM standard. <PRE>           auth: provide the actual authenication (ie. asking for and checking a
                    password, and setting 'credentials' like groups, or creating a
                    kerberos 'ticket')

        account: check to see if authenication is allowed, the account has not
                    expired or been deleted, the user is allowed to log in, etc.
</PRE>
<P>password: used to set passwords <PRE>        session: used once a user has successfully been authenicated to make it
                    possible to actually use there account, and mount their home
                    directory, or mail their mail available, etc.
</PRE>
<P>Modules are made to be 'stacked' so that multiple modules can be used. For 
example, rlogin normally makes use of at least 2 authenication methods: it 
firsts used rhosts authenication, and if is succeeds, the connection is opened, 
if not, standard password authenication is done. 
<P>New modules can be added at any time, and PAM aware applications can be then 
made to use them. For example, if you use a one-time-password system for 
something, then you can easily make a module to support it, since documentation 
for writing modules are included with the system, and PAM aware programs can use 
the new module and use the one-time-password system without recompiling or 
modifing in anyway. 
<P>Here is a list of the modules that people are using/developing for use with 
Linux-PAM: 
<P>The point of having modules is that you can just plug them in(!) In other 
words, they do not need to be compiled with the Linux-PAM library to work. Here

³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>A quick note about services. Each program that uses PAM defines its own 
service name. The login program defines the service type login, ftpd defines the 
service type ftp, and so on. In general, the service type is the name of the 
program used to _access_ the service, not the program used to _provide_ the 
service. (The ftpd being defined as ftp is an example.) 
<P>Ú--ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿<BR>: IV. Configuration Files 
³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>The directory /etc/pam.d is used to configure all PAM applictions. Earlier 
PAM versions used to use /etc/pam.conf, but that file is now only read if no 
/etc/pam.d/ entry is found. Each application (service) has its own file. A file 
might look a little something like this: 
<P>( this is tghe file for the basic login 'service' ) 
<STRONG>#%PAM-1.0</STRONG> <PRE> #Module Type   Control Flag  Module Path               Options
 #-----------   ------------  -----------               -------

 auth           required  /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
 account        required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
 password       required  /lib/security/pam_cracklib.so
 password       required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so   shadow nullok use_authok
 session        required  /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
</PRE>
<P>The first 3 lines, are of course a comment. The next 3 lines stack up 3 
modules for use to login authorization. The first line makes sure that if the 
user is trying to log in as root, the tty they are logging in is listed in 
/etc/securetty, if the file does exist. The second line causes the user to be 
asked for a password and to then check the password. The third line then looks 
to see if the file /etc/nologin exists, and if it does, displays the contents of 
the file, and then boots off the user if it is not root. 
<P>Note that all three of these modules are checked, _even if the first module 
fails_. This was built in as a security precaution. If a user (read: hacker) 
knew why the authenication failed, then they might be able to figure out how to 
get around the problem and break the authenication easily. If you want to change 
this, you can change 'required' to 'requisite', since if a requisite module 
fails, PAM immediately and does not call the other modules. 
<P>The line after that (line 7) checks and causes any necessary accouting to be 
done. (i.e. if shadow passwords have been enabled, the pam_pwdb.so module would 
check to see if the account has expired, of if the user's password has expired 
and needs to be changed.) 
<P>Line 8 then specifies that if the login changes the users password, it should 
use pam_pwdb.so to do it. This will only occur if the auth module determines 
that the password needs to be changed, for example, if the shadow password has 
expired. 
<P>The last line then goes on to specify that pam_pwdb.so should be used to 
manage the session. Currently, that module does not do anything, but it could be 
replaced, or supplemented by stacking a module or two. 
<P>Note that the order of the lines matters. While it may not matter for the 
order of the required modules, it matters for the other control flags available 
for use. sufficent and requisite cause order to be important, as does optional, 
which is a flag that is rarely used. For an example of this, turn to your rlogin 
auth configuration, which should look something like: 
<P>auth required /lib/security/pam_securetty.so auth sufficent 
/lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so <PRE> auth   required     /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
 auth   required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so
</PRE>
<P>Now, this file looks almost like the login entry, the extra line and the 
sufficent make the order of the modules important. 
<P>First off, pam_securetty.so keeps root from loging in on insecure terminals, 
which quite effectively prevents rhost root logins. If you wish to allow them 
you can simply remove that line. 
<P>Second, if pam_rhosts_auth.so authenticates the user, then PAM skips the 
password checking, otherwise if it fails, then the failed authentication is 
ignored. If pam_rhosts_auth.so fails to authenicate the user, then pam_pwdb.so 
is used to do normal password authentication. 
<P>Finally, pam_nologin.so checks /etc/nologin. 
<P>Note that if you do not want to prompt for a password if the securetty checks 
fail, then you can modify pam_securetty.so from required to requisite.

³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>A quick note for Red Hat users, if you wish to use PAM and shadow passwords, 
you are in luck. pam_pwdb.so can support shadow passwords. To convert your 
system for shadow passwords, use the following commands: <PRE>                         cd /etc
                         pwconv5
                         chmod 600 passwd- shadow-
</PRE>
<P>pam_pwdb.so will automatically detect that you have implemented shadow 
passwords, and it will make all the adjustments necessary.

³<BR>EÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ 
<P>The core components of the PAM framework are the authentication library API 
front end and the authentication mechanism-specific modules back end, connected 
through the Service Provider Interface. Applications write to the PAM API, while 
the authentication-system providers write to the PAM SPI and supply the back end 
modules that are independent of the application. <PRE>                   ftp     telnet   login        &lt;--  Applications

                                    Basic PAM Architecture
</PRE>
<P>The figure above illustrates the relationship between the application, the 
PAM library, and the authentication modules. Three application (login, telnet 
and ftp) are shown which use the PAM authentication interfaces. When an 
application makes a call to the PAM API, it loads the appropriate authentication 
module as determined by the configuration file, /etc/pam.d/, unless this is not 
found, then pam.conf is used. The request is forwarded to the underlying 
authentication module (for example, UNIX password, Kerberos, etc.) to perform 
the specified operation. The PAM layer then returns the response from the 
authentication module to the application. 
<P>PAM unifies system authentication and access control for the system, and 
allows plugging of associated authentication modules through well defined 
interfaces. The plugging can be defined through various means, one of which uses 
a configuration file, as shown in Section IV. Each of the system applications, 
the file specifies the authentication module that should be loaded.

<P>The following should give you an basic description of the various interfaces 
of PAM. Since the goal here is just for you to get a working knowledge about the 
PAM interfaces, not all flags and options have been fully defined and explained. 

<P>ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ<BR>Framework Layer APIs<BR>ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ <PRE>                  int

                  );
</PRE>
<P>pam_start() is called to initiate an authentication transaction. pam_start() 
takes as arguments the name of the service, the name of the user to be 
authenticated, the address of the conversation structure. pamh is later used as 
a handle for subsequent calls to the PAM library. 
<P>The PAM modules do not communicate directly with the user; instead they rely 
on the application to perform all such interaction. The application needs to 
provide the conversation functions, conv(), and associated application data 
pointers through a pam_conv structure when it initiates an authentication 
transaction. The module uses the conv() function to prompt the user for data, 
display error messages, or text information. <PRE>                  int
                  pam_end(

                  );
</PRE>
<P>pam_end() is called to terminate the PAM transaction as specified by pamh, 
and to free any storage area allocated by the PAM modules with pam_set_item(). <PRE>                  int
                  pam_set_item(

                         void **item);
</PRE>
<P>pam_get_item() and pam_set_item() allow the parameters specified in the 
initial call to pam_start() to be read and updated. This is useful when a 
particular parameter is not available when pam_start() is called or must be 
modified after the initial call to pam_start(). pam_set_item() is passed a 
pointer to the object, item, and its type, item_type. pam_get_item() is passed 
the address of the pointer, item, which is assigned the address of the requested 
object.

<P>VPN's short for Virtual Private Networks are secure networks that implement 
encryption to communicate between two users. It allows private communication 
over virtual WANs or LANs. The VPN can also be implemented in X.25 networks. 
VPN's also provide secure data transmission with Tunneling Protocol through the 
Internet. With standard networks, a sniffer can easily overcome security. In a 
VPN , there are thre eimplementations used. 
<OL>
  <LI>Encryption - use of algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data transfer. 
  <LI>Authentication - confirmation of users identity on the network (use public 
  key authentication to confirm users connection) also sometimes use of login 
  and password , which is vunerable to crackers. 
  <LI>Data Integrity - hash used , differnet hashes used : Message Digest (MD5) 
  , Secure Hash Algorithm1 (SHA-1). The MD5 Hash generates 128-bit keys. The 
  SHA-1 Hash generates 160-bit keys.

LiteSpan 2000<BR>by XiLiCoN, Special to thtj <PRE>        A Litespan 2000 unit is a Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) based
           Optical Loop Carrier (OLC) system. It provides 4 system functions.
           Those systems are as follows:
</PRE>
<P>DLC) Digital Loop Carrier: Provides 2,016 DS0s of bandwidth for delivery of 
<P>services such as data, coin, or dial tone. 
<P>DCS) Digital Cross Connect System: Takes apart DS1 signals into DS0, <PRE>        rearranges them and puts them back into DS1 signals. This is know as
        1-0-1 cross-connect.
</PRE>
<P>SONET) Fiber transport system: Uses lightwave technology and SONET protocol 
to 
<P>transport signals between lightspan terminals. 
<P>MUX) Mulitplexer: Takes multiple low speed signals(DS0s, DS1s) and 
interleaves 
<P>them to form a single high speed data stream at SONET bit rates.

           integrity. These security levels controls who can access the system
           and what the authorized user is allowed to do in the system.
</PRE>
<UL>
  <LI>Each authorized user is assigned a set of privileges that determine the 
  actions allowed to the user. 
  <LI>The Litespan maintains an internal list of authorized user IDs, passwords, 
  and user privileges. 
  <LI>There are up to 20 users possible. </LI></UL><PRE>        Now to access security.you will be prompted for a User Id and a
           Password at a terminal that looks much like this:

<P>User Id:<BR>Password: <PRE>        Now for the ball busting part. If you repeat the login procedure
           incorrectly 5 times you will be locked out of the system. Also the
           user id's can be up to 20 character, number or letter with both upper
           and lower case. Same with the password. The litespan has a sysadmin
           like in a unix system, but the litespan admin usually has a long
           beard and a smug expression. But it is possible that a dumb sysadmin
           will leave in the default logins/passwords. Those are as follows:
</PRE>
<P>User Id: optlink<BR>Password: optlink 
<P>and.. 
<P>User Id: sysadmin<BR>Password: sysadmin <PRE>        Well that gives you a look at System Security from the outside, Look
           at part 3 if you were able to get in. It gives a run down on User
           Privileges.

           User Privleges. Well user privileges are important, the sysadmin
           maintains a file in the system that gives different users different
           privileges. The user privileges file will be setup somewhat like this:
</PRE>
<P>User Id Password CP M M0 M1 N NR P PR P0 P1 S T 
<P>User1 ***** x x x x x x 
<P>User2 ***** x x x x x x <PRE>        That is a basic layout. The CP, M, M0 ect. are privileges. The X's
           are basically checks allowing a certain user to perform a certain act
           in the system. The Different Privileges are as follows:
</PRE>
<P>CP = Allows someone to change the user id, password or privileges of any user 

<P>on the system. This is one of the sysadmins privileges for the most part. 
<P>M0 = Maintenance privlege (DS0 only) 
<P>M1 = Maintenance privlege (DS1 only) 
<P>MR = Maintenace READ ONLY privlege 
<P>N = Network Administrative privlege; Allows backup and restore of database 
<P>NR = Network Administrative READ ONLY privlege; Allows access to network 
<P>information 
<P>P = Provisioning privlege; Necessary to make changes from the provisioning

<P>P0 = Provisioning privlege (DS0 only) 
<P>P1 = Provisioning privlege (DS1 only) 
<P>PR = Provisioning READ ONLY privilege 
<P>S = System Administrative privlege; Necessary to make changes from the

<P>Spammers beware: Usenet2 not for you<BR>Network World, September 22, 1997 
<P>A new, spam-free version of the Internet-based bulletin board system Usenet 
is being developed. Called Usenet2 or U2, the network will use monitoring 
software and a strict set of community rules to create a spam-free environment. 
Spam refers to unwanted mass postings to Usenet discussion groups. According to 
some estimates, 80% of the messages now posted on Usenet are spam or spam 
"cancels," which are messages that try to delete spam from servers. Several 
Internet service providers have agreed to support Usenet2, including ZippoDot 
Com and PANIX. Usenet2 will use monitoring software called Net-Monitor which can 
filter out binary posts and any post that is being sent to more than 3 
newsgroups. Systems that agree to carry Usenet2 must also obey a strict set of 
rules including real return e-mail addresses on postings. If a system breaks the 
rules, it can have its Usenet2 feed disconnected.

<P>S/MIME Cracked by a Screensaver<BR>by Simson Garfinkel 
<P>26.Sep.97.PDT -- Cracking encrypted email just got much easier - as long as 
the message was encrypted with Netscape Navigator or Microsoft's Outlook 
Express. 
<P>Bruce Schneier, a cryptography consultant based in Minnesota, has created a 
Windows 95 screensaver that cracks encrypted email messages on computers that 
are otherwise unused. "On average, it takes 35 days on a 166 MHz Pentium," said 
Schneier, who is also the author of the book Applied Cryptography. 
<P>The real power of Schneier's program is that it's designed to work on 
multiple machines in parallel over a local-area network. Got an office with a 
dozen machines? You can crack a message in a little less than three days. Got a 
thousand? Your wait will be just 50 minutes. The program, which began as a 
screensaver that searched for large prime numbers, will be made available on 
Schneier's Web site today. 
<P>The program will only crack messages encrypted with RSA Data Security's 
S/MIME mail encryption standard, and at that, only messages that are encrypted 
with a 40-bit key. But that's exactly the encryption that's being offered today 
by the most commonly used versions of Netscape Messenger and Microsoft Outlook 
Express. 
<P>"What really pisses me off is that [these products] are being marketed as 
secure," said Schneier. "The products don't say that they use 40-bit encryption 
- be careful. They say this is security." 
<P>The S/MIME standard implemented by Netscape and Microsoft does provide for 
higher-level security by using different encryption algorithms. But Schneier 
maintains that messages encrypted with these stronger algorithms cannot be 
exchanged between the two vendors' products. "The S/MIME security standard is 
really hard to work with," said Schneier. "None of [the products] interoperate 
at any level other than 40-bit RC2." 
<P>Schneier says he's releasing his program to demonstrate the fundamental 
vulnerabilities in the S/MIME standard. But S/MIME's maker disagrees, saying 
there is no problem using longer keys. 
<P>"Bruce is mistaken," said Scott Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA 
Data Security, the co-author of the S/MIME specification. "We have mail messages 
on file in our interoperability test lab which demonstrate interpretability 
between Outlook Express and Netscape's Messenger using triple-DES," which has a 
168-bit key.

<P>Webmaster Lets Sites Hack Themselves<BR>by Mike Tanner 
<P>25.Sep.97.PDT -- When A.H.S. Boy secured the domain graphics.com this month 
for a nonprofit Web resource for graphic designers he was building, it seemed 
like a real coup for his nascent site. That is, until the address started 
logging thousands of hits while it still consisted merely of an "under 
construction" marker page. It soon became apparent that the flood of links was 
caused by a browser quirk that caused certain kinds of badly-coded graphics URLs 
to link to his domain. Boy seized upon the serendipitous glitch as an 
opportunity to passively hack those sites that erroneously linked to his, 
loading them with banners featuring subversive slogans. 
<P>For the past several weeks, therefore, unwary visitors to sites, including 
those for such corporate and political powers as Packard Bell, Corel, and the 
government of Hong Kong, have been confronted with graphics telling them, "You 
are only a resource for profit" or, "Revolution is the most beautiful word." 
<P>"Of course returning these very subversive graphics that some of these sites 
are getting, probably won't make the owners of these sites very happy," says 
Boy, who runs sites for a situationist organization, an Austrian arts group, a 
bookstore, and his own shareware business off the same server. To show there's 
no ill-will intended, however, he puts the URL to his site on all the banners, 
and offers a page explaining how to fix the broken links. 
<P>Since many webmasters put their graphics files in a folder labeled 
"graphics," the "hack" takes advantage of intelligent browsers' default tendency 
to interpret "graphics" in badly-coded links as "www.graphics.com." The problem 
is exacerbated when visitors to a site mistype its URL with a question mark 
instead of a slash. Boy says that almost half of his server's current traffic of 
1,500 daily hits are from these errors. 
<P>When this plethora of hits began showing up on his site, Boy simply adapted a 
randomized error-page system he had designed for avoiding static 404 messages on 
his own site. Now when graphics.com gets a graphics request, a CGI script 
randomly serves up one of 11 slogans. 
<P>Netscape spokesman Christopher Hoover says this is the first time his company 
has heard of this kind of problem associated with their browser's ability "for 
resolving these kinds of conflicts" by adding .com to links - a feature which 
generally provides a useful coding shortcut. He says it's a quirk that's due to 
the near ubiquity of "graphics" as the name for the folder holding a Web site's 
art files, and that there's unlikely to be another domain name of similar 
vulnerability. 
<P>Despite Boy's efforts to help sites remedy the underlying code problems, his 
prank has provoked a number of mystified and angry messages from surfers and 
site administrators. One "irate webmaster" from a computer reseller's site even 
threatened to alert the FBI's computer security division, but so far no legal 
actions have been taken. And Boy isn't particularly worried that they will be, 
since he never touches anybody else's site. "Their servers are hacking mine," he 
says. "I'm just controlling it."

<P>High-Tech Burglar Alarms Expose Intruders 09/18/97<BR>By Rutrell Yasin, 
InternetWeek 
<P>If you're not thinking about installing "burglar alarms" on your network, 
chances are you will soon. 
<P>An emerging class of high-tech intrusion detection systems -- also known as 
burglar alarms -- promises to alert IT administrators when their network 
security is breached by unauthorized intruders. 
<P>Security companies such as Axent Technologies, Internet Security Systems, 
Intrusion Detection, and the WheelGroup are shipping tools that give 
corporations a layer of defense that goes beyond the firewall. Network General 
earlier this month became the first networking vendor to enter the fray with 
CyberCop, a tool that monitors networks for external and internal attacks. 
<P>"Firewalls are very important. They can be very effective, but they can't do 
everything. They can be circumvented," said Richard Power, director of research 
and publications at the Computer Security Institute, in San Francisco. 
<P>Firewalls protect gateways to the network, but in today's complex Web of 
private networks, intranets and extranets, the Internet is not the only entrance 
to the network, Powers said. 
<P>Firewalls are usually placed in front of Internet access links, wide-area 
links, and dial-in servers to monitor the protocols and services that flow in 
and out of a network. But they cannot tell when security has been breached, and 
they tend to slow network performance when they are deployed in internal 
networks. 
<P>Working In Perfect Harmony 
<P>Intrusion-detection systems complement firewalls by monitoring the network 
and performing real-time capture and analysis of packet headers and content 
data. 
<P>Using sophisticated algorithms to recognize attacks, intrusion-detection 
systems can send alerts to administrators to warn them of possible break-ins. 
Some products can even stop intruders from breaking into the network. 
<P>In the past, intrusion detection was a very labor-intensive, manual task, 
said Jude O'Reilley, a research analyst at Gartner Group's network division, in 
Stamford, Conn. "However, there's been a leap in sophistication over the past 18 
months," and a wider range of automated tools is hitting the market, he said. 
<P>Network General's intrusion-detection system draws on the company's 
experience in delivering packet-level analysis systems -- such as the popular 
Sniffer analyzer -- to provide a network-based security system, according to 
Katherine Stolz, product manager for Internet security systems at Network 
General, in Menlo Park, Calif. 
<P>CyberCop uses algorithms from the San Antonio-based WheelGroup and consists 
of sensors, a management server, and a Java-compliant browser. Sensors capture 
data packets and analyze them for suspicious behavior. Data packets are saved in 
an "Evidence Trace File" to record attackers' footprints as they move around the 
network. 
<P>Sensors pass off events to the management server, which sends alarms via 
E-mail, pager, or SNMP traps, alerting security administrators to take action. 
CyberCop's closest competitor is Internet Security Systems' RealSecure software, 
which includes an attack recognition engine that ferrets out suspicious 
behavior. "The trickiest part is understanding attacks," said Patrick Taylor, 
vice president of marketing at Atlanta-based ISS. 
<P>RealSecure -- which has received good reviews for the breadth and range of 
attacks it can discover -- brings a more server-based approach to intrusion 
detection. "Depending on the network topology, having a box on a network segment 
doesn't work for everyone. Some users need to monitor the activity of servers," 
Taylor said. 
<P>ISS' strategy is to sell its technology to other vendors. During the next six 
to 12 months, RealSecure will be embedded in many of the leading firewalls, 
switches, and servers, he said. 
<P>Not The End-All 
<P>Intrusion-detection systems hold a great deal of promise for security 
administrators, but like firewalls, they do not solve all security problems, 
CSI's Powers cautioned. At this stage, "intrusion-detection systems detect only 
what they know to look for," he said. In the future, vendors will offer tools 
with expert systems capabilities that can detect suspicious behavior, he said. 
<P>Intrusion-detection tools are aimed at vertical markets such as financial, 
telecommunications, government, and military organizations. 
<P>To be successful in the mainstream market, the tools will have to be 
inexpensive, easy to use, and able to support intranet applications and popular 
workstation platforms such as Windows NT, Gartner's O'Reilley said. 
<P>Firewall vendors -- which are now offering aggressively priced, plug-and-play 
systems -- can serve as a good model for aspiring intrusion-detection vendors, 
O'Reilley said. Intrusion-detection tools can cost anywhere from $40,000 to 
$50,000, but prices are likely to drop during the next 18 months, he said.

<P>WorldCom Bid Threatens BT-MCI Merger<BR>By Douglas Hayward, TechWire 
<P>LONDON -- MCI's mega merger with British Telecom could be abandoned, 
following a counterbid for the U.S. long distance carrier by WorldCom. 
<P>The aggressive and acquisitive WorldCom offered MCI shareholders $41.50 a 
share Wednesday morning, more than the equivalent of $34 a share BT proposes to 
pay. The bid values MCI at $30 billion -- 41 percent more than the company's $21 
billion price tag at close of markets Tuesday, WorldCom said in a statement 
Wednesday. 
<P>The combined group, which would be 25 percent owned by MCI's current 
shareholders, would have revenues of some $30 billion, WorldCom added. 
<P>BT shares were up 9 percent at midday Wednesday on news of the bid, which 
could net BT a healthy profit on its 20 percent stake in MCI. BT had no comment 
to make on the bid early Wednesday afternoon. 
<P>WorldCom has acquired 40 companies in the past five years, including Internet 
carrier MFS. Acquiring MCI will boost the combined group's earnings by up to 22 
percent and cut its costs by $2.5 billion in the first year after the deal 
closes, WorldCom said. 
<P>WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers attempted to boost his company's 
chances by saying that joining WorldCom made better business sense for MCI than 
being snatched up by BT. The deal would result in savings for the combined group 
of roughly $5 billion in the fifth year of the new group's existence, he added. 
<P>"While MCI and British Telecom are both great companies, the fit between them 
just doesn't work without sufficient local network assets in place," said Ebbers 
in a letter to MCI chairman Bert Roberts. Because WorldCom has those assets in 
place, far greater synergies than BT can offer are possible, he said. "It is 
clearly a superior fit and, as a result, a superior offer," Ebbers said. 
<P>WorldCom is trying to exploit the fact that BT was recently forced to lower 
its bid for MCI, after the American carrier disclosed it was losing more money 
than it had previously thought in its attempt to break into the local phone 
market in North America. 
<P>Ebbers also appealed to MCI's sense of patriotism. "Our two companies are the 
paradigm for the American entrepreneurial spirit," he said. "We have both forged 
significant in roads into industries long dominated by giants, and have been 
among the first to offer consumers a choice of providers for local, long 
distance, data, and other services." 
<P>Although BT shares rose dramatically Wednesday morning, the euphoria in 
London could be short-lived. If the bid succeeds, it could destroy BT's 
international strategy, which is heavily dependent on its alliance with MCI, 
particularly in Latin America. 
<P>Concert, the international joint venture of BT and MCI, has secured several 
major customer contracts and alliances with leading telephone operators 
including Telefonica de Espana and Portugal Telecom. Those contracts are at risk 
if the WorldCom bid succeeds.

<P>U.S. cell phone industry battles service thieves October 1, 1997<BR>By Brad 
Liston 
<P>ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuter) - Thousands of cellular telephone users have had the 
unfortunate experience of opening their monthly bills and finding hundreds of 
dollars in charges for calls they did not make. 
<P>The good news for them is that such fraud is way down, according to delegates 
to a conference of the U.S. wireless telephone industry Wednesday. 
<P>But the bad news is that wireless thieves are getting more sophisticated. 
<P>"The criminal customer will never go away," warned Roseanna DeMaria, vice 
president for business security at AT&amp;T Corp. Wireless Services. "He'll just 
engage in some very creative R&amp;D." 
<P>At the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association's Fraud '97 
conference, industry leaders said the theft of wireless services in 1996 had 
dropped to 3 percent of annual revenues. 
<P>In the early 1990s, that number was 6 percent. 
<P>There currently are about 50 million wireless customers in the United States. 

<P>Before 1995, stealing a cell phone signal was a simple as standing outside a 
shopping mall in an area with heavy cellular traffic and picking up a signal 
that could be reprogrammed into another phone to make it look as if its calls 
were coming from a legitimate account. 
<P>New technologies are making that more difficult, said Thomas McClure, the 
association's director of fraud managment. 
<P>For example, wireless service providers can now match an electronic serial 
number unique to a digital wireless phone with another identification number 
unique to each account in a system similar to the military's "friend and foe" 
technology. If someone uses an account on an unauthorized phone, he trips a 
computer that alerts the service provider. 
<P>Thanks to that technology, called radio frequency fingerprinting, cellular 
thieves who could once promise service for 30 days before phone companies caught 
on now can promise only about three days. 
<P>For older analog phones, the industry is becoming more adept at spotting 
changes in customer patterns. "If your account suddenly shows, say, three calls 
a day to Bangladesh, then a computer will recognize that, and someone will 
contact you to confirm the calls," McClure said. 
<P>Law enforcement sources say the ranks of cellular thieves include the usual 
suspects -- drug smugglers, organized crime figures and criminal fugitives, 
among others. 
<P>"The professional criminal is clearly going after our service," McClure said. 
"He wants to become the invisible man." 
<P>So where do criminals, whose expertise may lie more along the line of cutting 
cocaine or breaking thumbs, find people sharp enough to steal cutting-edge 
technology? 
<P>"They recruit it," Jeff Nelson, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association, said. "We're up against some of the best minds in the 
nation."

<P>Junk Mail Giant Cyber Promotions Is Back Online By Bill Pietrucha 
<P>WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1997 OCT 3 (NB) -- Cyber Promotions Inc., the online 
junk mail giant, has been reconnected to Internet service provider Apex Global 
Internet Services (AGIS). 
<P>"We just went back up in the past hour," a Cyber Promotions spokesperson told 
Newsbytes. "We're not fully functional yet, but we are back online." 
<P>Earlier today, Cyber Promotion still was not reconnected to AGIS, despite a 
ruling last Tuesday that AGIS must reconnect Cyber Promotions until October 16. 
Earlier this week, Cyber Promotions also posted a $12,500 bond ordered by Judge 
Anita Brody of the US District Court in Philadelphia to pay for any possible 
damage to AGIS' network caused by "anti-spam" spam attacks against both Cyber 
Promotions and AGIS for providing service to Cyber Promotions. 
<P>This past Tuesday, Judge Brody granted Dresher, Pennsylvania- based Cyber 
Promotions a temporary preliminary injunction, forcing AGIS to reconnect the 
bulk e-mail provider to their service. Brody's ruling said that the contract 
between AGIS and Cyber Promotions requires AGIS to issue a 30 day notice before 
terminating service. 
<P>"We obviously are not pleased with the court's ruling," AGIS CEO Phillip 
Lawlor said after the ruling. "We are not happy with the court's decision, but 
we must abide by it." 
<P>Lawlor, who said he regretted ever taking Cyber Promotions on as a client, 
said Cyber Promotions told the court it is looking for other Internet Service 
Providers to handle the junk mail account. 
<P>Lawlor also left the door open for Cyber Promotions, saying AGIS "is looking 
at all options" regarding October 17, the date AGIS can again disconnect Cyber 
Promotions. 
<P>"We'll decide between now and that time what is the best course of action to 
take," Lawlor said. 
<P>AGIS counsel Philip Katauskas, however, said, "our actions to date say we 
don't want them on our network." 
<P>In late September, the Dearborn, Michigan-based AGIS, the nation's fourth 
largest carrier of Internet traffic, disconnected several unsolicited, bulk 
e-mailers, including Cyber Promotions Inc., "for security reasons." 
<P>"The attacks were of a nature which not only threatened portions of our 
global, public network, but other parts of the Internet as well," Lawlor said. 
"Our engineers simply followed AGIS standard security procedures in shutting 
their service down." 
<P>Reacting to the shut-off of service, Cyber Promotions filed suit against AGIS 
in US District Court in Philadelphia for allegedly breaking its distribution 
contract. US District Court Judge Brody, citing the breach of contract by AGIS 
for shutting down Cyber Promotions' connection without warning, said in her 
ruling that "the fact that Cyber is an unpopular citizen of the Internet does 
not mean that Cyber is not entitled to have its contracts enforced in a court of 
law or that Cyber is not entitled to such injunctive relief as any similarly 
situated business."

<P>Electric Outlets Could Be Link To the Internet By Gautam Naik<BR>The Wall 
Street Journal<BR>10/07/97 
<P>LONDON -- Engineers claim to have developed a breakthrough technology that 
would let homeowners make phone calls and access the Internet at high speeds via 
the electric outlets in their walls. 
<P>If the technology developed by United Utilities PLC and Northern Telecom Ltd. 
proves commercially viable, it could transform power lines around the world into 
major conduits on the information superhighway. Because electricity flows into 
virtually every home and office the new technology could give power companies 
easy entree into the phone and Internet access businesses, thus posing a serious 
threat to current providers of those services. 
<P>Both United Utilities, a power company, and Northern Telecom, a Canadian 
maker of telecom gear, confirmed that their system was "ready for the mass 
market," but declined to reveal details until a news conference scheduled for 
tomorrow. A Northern Telecom spokesman also declined to elaborate. 
<P>While the technology must still be proven on a large scale, the two companies 
have tested telephone service over power lines in about 20 U.K. households over 
the last 12 months -- with positive results, according to Alistair Henderson, 
chief of technology at Energis PLC, the telecom unit of National Grid Group PLC, 
which owns and operates the electricity-transmission system in England and 
Wales. Energis, one of several power companies that has secretly worked with 
United Utilities on the "power line telephony" project, hopes to use the system 
to offer data services to its own business customers. 
<P>"It's very good news for utilities, indeed," says Mr. Henderson. "Everybody 
has an electricity line to their homes, and every business has electric supply. 
"At long last, the local monopoly of the incumbent telecom operators is about to 
be demolished." 
<P>But some questions remain. Although United Utilities' initial tests have been 
successful, technical and safety wrinkles have to be ironed out. There's also 
likely to be intensifying competition from a host of other wanna-be phone and 
Internet service providers, including cable companies and outfits that use 
wireless technology to provide high-speed access. And for the new system to be 
commercially feasible, a power utility would have to sign up 40% or more of 
homes and offices in a particular neighborhood, Mr. Henderson says. 
<P>This could prove a difficult task as existing telecommunications players have 
proven to be adept at making life hard for new entrants. The Baby Bells in the 
U.S., for example, have largely thwarted efforts by AT&amp;T Corp. and MCI 
Communications Corp. to enter the local telephone business. 
<P>In recent years electric utilities in the U.S. and Europe have been trying to 
enter the telecom fray by the more conventional method of stringing fiber-optic 
cables along power lines. But so far they've had limited success. As a result, 
utilities have waited for exactly this kind of breakthrough to make a big splash 
in the telecom wars. 
<P>While electric lines have been used before to zap tiny amounts of data 
between computers, their capacity has always been limited, making commercial 
applications unfeasible. Now United Utilities' telecom arm, Norweb 
Communications, has found a way to transmit data at a speed of more than 384 
kilobits per second over regular electricity lines -- more than 10 times the 
speed of Internet modems used by most households with regular telephone lines. 
<P>The advantage of the latest system -- which uses cellular phone technology to 
transmit signals along electric wires -- is that utilities needn't spend vast 
amounts of to build new telecom infrastructure, since existing power lines can 
simultaneously transmit both electricity, and a phone call, say. Electricity 
doesn't interfere with the phone transmission for the same reason that a radio 
broadcast doesn't interfere with a simultaneous TV broadcast: the frequencies 
are very different. "Utilities won't have to touch the wires underground," notes 
Mr. Henderson. 
<P>Of course, there will be some cost to utilities that want to commercialize 
the new technology and enter the telecom business. Utilities will have to 
install a device in each residence or office to separate the electricity and 
phone transmissions. From the device, one line will deliver the telephone and 
Internet link, while the other will deliver electricity. In the case of the two 
companies' test, Northern Telecom is believed to have built the box that 
separates the power and data transmissions.

<P>Coming Soon: Net Access Through Power Lines October 8, 1997<BR>By Reuters 
<P>"Canada's Northern Telecom (Nortel) and Britain's Norweb Communications today 
unveiled new technology allowing reliable, low-cost, high-speed access to the 
Internet through the domestic electricity supply. 
<P>In a move heralding the first competition between electricity companies and 
telecommunications carriers, the two groups said their patented technology would 
allow power firms to convert their infrastructures into information access 
networks. 
<P>Having reduced electrical interference on power lines, the companies said 
they could shunt data -- and possibly voice -- over power lines into the home at 
up to 1MB per second. 
<P>This is up to ten times faster than ISDN, the fastest currently available 
speed for domestic computer users. Although it is slower than rival ADSL 
technology being developed by British Telecommunications, which upgrades copper 
wires, Norweb and Nortel's technology is much cheaper for operators to install. 
<P>All consumers need is the equipment developed by Nortel and Norweb -- an 
extra card for personal computers, some software to handle subscription, 
security, and authentication services, and a small box that is installed next to 
the electricity meter. 
<P>This will send and receive data and is in turn linked to a personal computer 
through an ordinary coaxial cable. Peter Dudley, vice president of Nortel, said 
the groups had an "absolutely spectacular" amount of interest from electricity 
companies in Britain and abroad that are keen to offer the service to consumers. 

<P>"The race is on to be first," he told Reuters. Prices will be set by 
electricity companies that offer the service. But consumers currently spend an 
average of 20 to 30 pounds ($48.60) per month for Internet access -- and the new 
service offers permanent access without telephone costs. 
<P>"Assuming they continue to spend at that rate, it is not unreasonable to 
assume that is the kind of tariffing that may be submitted," Dudley said. 
<P>The Canadian telecoms equipment maker, and Norweb, part of England's 
multiutility United Utilities, said their technology was fast enough for most 
future domestic or small office applications and was cost effective enough to 
allow operators returns on investments. "As one of the first practical, low cost 
answers to the problem of high speed access to the Internet, this technology 
will unleash the next wave of growth," Dudley said. 
<P>The two companies have developed a "specialized signaling scheme" that allows 
them to carry data traffic between local power substations and homes, 
effectively turning the electricity supply into a communications network. Each 
substation is then linked by fiber-optic circuits to a central switch -- and 
from there into the worldwide computer network. 
<P>After 18 months of refining and upgrading a prototype and promising "oodles 
of bandwidth," the companies said they planned to market the technology in 
Europe and the Asia Pacific region. "We are ready to ship in volume," said Ian 
Vance, vice president and chief scientist at Nortel Europe. 
<P>Banking on high growth and good economic returns, Norweb hopes to attract 
around 200 customers in a marketing pilot in northwestern England in the second 
quarter of 1998 before rolling out the service."

<P>GTE Makes $28B Cash Offer For MCI<BR>By Kora McNaughton, TechInvestor 
<P>GTE made a $28 billion, all-cash bid Wednesday to acquire MCI, bringing to 
three the number of suitors pursuing the long-distance carrier. 
<P>The latest offer, which values MCI stock at $40 a share, follows WorldCom's 
$30 billion bid, made two weeks ago. The proposed stock deal from Jackson, 
Miss.-based WorldCom would give MCI shareholders $41.50 per share. 
<P>The first suitor, British Telecom, needed only final shareholder approval for 
its $23 billion marriage to MCI when WorldCom made its higher bid. 
<P>But now GTE is in the game. CEO Charles Lee offered MCI Chairman Bert Roberts 
the chairmanship of the merged company, which would be headquartered in 
Washington, D.C., where MCI is located. 
<P>Lee said his company would also consider a cash and stock deal rather than an 
all-cash acquisition. 
<P>In a letter to Roberts, Lee said a merger would create a company with more 
than $40 billion in annual revenue, more than 21 million local and 24 million 
long-distance lines, and 5 million wireless customers. 
<P>In addition, Lee continued, it would result in more efficient operations and 
new revenue opportunities. "No two companies in the industry today are more 
complemenetary or better situated to expand the availability and breadth of 
bundled service offerings to local, national and international customers," the 
letter read. 
<P>GTE also said it is willing to negotiate a continued relationship with 
British Telecom if its offer is accepted. 
<P>MCI said its board "will meet shortly to review all issues and options with 
respect to the GTE proposal and the unsolicited proposal received from WorldCom, 
in the context of the company's strategic merger agreement with BT." 
<P>But the BT deal isn't likely to happen, analysts said. 
<P>"MCI is in play now," said Steve Shook, an analyst with Interstate/Johnson 
Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "This is just one more nail in the coffin for BT." 
<P>British Telecom had planned to pay about $23 billion, a price that was 
reduced after MCI revealed last summer that it would incur hundreds of millions 
of dollars in losses trying to enter the local phone market this year. 
<P>The prospect of another uninvited guest at the MCI bidding party sent shares 
of MCI, British Telecom, WorldCom, and GTE in opposite directions Wednesday. 
<P>Trading of MCI and GTE shares was suspended around 1:00 p.m., but MCI [MCIC] 
shares resumed trading an hour later and closed up 1 9/16 to 36 7/8. GTE [GTE] 
was up 2 3/16 at 48 before the suspension of trading. 
<P>Shares of British Telecom [BTY], which owns a 20 percent stake in MCI, 
climbed 2 11/16 to 75, while WorldCom [WCOM] fell 1 5/16 to 35 7/16. 
<P>MCI's board had been considering WorldCom's offer but had not yet made a 
decision about whether to abandon the BT deal. Shareholder approval is still 
needed for any merger, whether it is with BT, WorldCom, or GTE. 
<P>Shook said the WorldCom offer remains the best of the bunch. 
<P>Although GTE's offer is all cash, "it's not like you're getting a junky stock 
with WorldCom," he said. "You're getting really good currency. WorldCom has 
always delivered on what they said." 
<P>But if the prospect of a merged WorldCom-MCI was more appetizing to analysts 
than the BT deal, the advantages over GTE's proposal are not so clear. 
<P>BT has no presence in the U.S. local phone market, which MCI has been trying, 
with little success, to penetrate. WorldCom has a limited local business, while 
GTE already provides local service in 29 states. 
<P>GTE is also a contender in the race to provide one-stop shopping for 
communications services, including local and long-distance calling as well as 
data services such as Internet access. Last May, GTE bought Internet access 
provider BBN, and it has a strategic alliance with Cisco to develop enhanced 
data and Internet services. 
<P>Earlier Wednesday, GTE reported third quarter profits of $756 million, or 79 
cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates of 77 cents per share, as reported 
by First Call. 
<P>During the quarter, consolidated revenue was up 11 percent to $5.94 billion, 
compared to $5.34 billion in the third quarter last year. The 11 percent jump 
includes $127 million from GTE's acquisition of BBN. 
<P>Excluding the $127 million of new revenue related to BBN, sales grew 8.8 
percent. 
<P>"These results illustrate our success in positioning GTE for the future," 
said GTE CEO Charles Lee. "The BBN acquisition, completed during the quarter, 
represents the cornerstone of GTE's strategy to become a dominant player in the 
data market."

<P>GeoCities Sites Blocked In South Korea 10/22/97<BR>By John Borland, Net 
Insider 
<P>In the second such instance of international censorship leveled at the 
company this year, all sites on the sprawling GeoCites network of Websites have 
been blocked in South Korea. 
<P>Company officials confirmed Wednesday that the South Korean government asked 
the agency that handles network traffic in that country to block access to all 
GeoCities sites by South Korean citizens. The request came in reaction to a 
single pro-North Korean site on the GeoCities network. 
<P>"Unfortunately they are blocking access to over a million sites," said 
GeoCities spokesman Bennett Kleinberg, of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide. 
"GeoCities has issued a letter to the Consulate General Easking that they look 
into the situation." 
<P>The company first learned of the blockage on Oct. 12, through an E-mail from 
a user, Kleinberg said. After examining the offending page, the company 
determined that it did not violate the contract that all GeoCities 
"homesteaders" must sign, and decided to let it remain online. 
<P>The page, sponsored by a group calling itself the Australian Association for 
the Study of the Juche Idea, praises North Korean philosophy and leadership. 
Juche, it says, is an concept developed by late North Korean President Kim Il 
Sung focusing on self-reliance and national independence. 
<P>Korean officials at the country's San Francisco Consulate said they did not 
have enough knowledge of the situation to comment. 
<P>The action is the second time this year that GeoCities sites have been 
unavailable to an entire country of users. In June, the Malaysian government 
asked the country's single Internet service provider to block access to 
GeoCities, again because of a single site that was critical of the government. 
In that case, however, GeoCities determined that the site's calls for 
"insurrection and revolution" had violated the service's terms of agreement, and 
quickly took it offline. 
<P>"We reserve the right to pull any site at any time" that has violated the 
service's contract, Kleinberg said. "But at this point the determination has 
been made that [the pro-North Korean site] hasn't done that." 
<P>The action was not unexpected coming from the current South Korean 
leadership, said Stanton McCandlish, program director at the Electronic Freedom 
Foundation. The government has repeatedly shut down South Korean Websites 
disseminating pro-North Korean information, he said. 
<P>"They [South Korean Leadership] are used to being able to unilaterally ban 
things," McCandlish said. "The Internet is not a medium that can be effectively 
censored. It's a hard lesson for them to learn." 
<P>As of Wednesday, GeoCities had not heard back from the Korean government, 
Kleinberg said, but hoped to resolve the situation though normal trade and 
diplomatic channels.
