Editorial:
        by Scud-O
Well HBS is reallt taking off again. After not seeing Pinky for a while and
Rotten & Sid's move I was worried that HBS would die. But |\|\cFill and
Keystroke (who are VERY cool people) have joined up! They each did an article
for this issue and next month we will have info sheets on them.
        Also coming soon is a redesigned HBS web site! The graphics are
 almost done, the 403 Forbideen club is being worked on,  the members pages
 will be created, and the links page will be up! Look for both Frames and non
 frames pages and maybe some Java & JavaScript! I may be moving to L0pht soon
 so then we will have CGI too!
        In other news HBS is now into commercial & private Web Development!
So if you need any web stuff done cheaply we will do it! (we have super low
rates!) Check out our web page for more info up soon including the rates!
        Now on to the bickering:
This has been a CRAZY month! new HBS memebers, me running my schools network,
coming in on weekends to work on it more! it TOO much! so that is why this
issue has been cut down in size and why next issue isn't coming out until the
15th of December! If you want to complain.. #$^%$@# you! It takes a HELL of a
LOT of work to run a web site, run a network, connect that network to inet,
and edit this magizine as well as write it up! so help by writting articles
for me!!!

The Dumper:
        by Scud-O
This is a HEX Dump utility I wrote which can really help you in virus writing
It is VERY simple but it works.. if you want more of a Dumper go find one..
they are out there.. ALSO: if you fix this Dumper send me a copy of the fix
and the source, I'll put it in a future issue! Below is the C source... its
about 8563 bytes the assembly version was only 1294 bytes but it was too much
typing to finish for this issue (ASM: 436 C:77 Winner:C!)

              hex and ASCII on the standard output device.

    Usage:   C>DUMP unit:path\filename.ext

Virus Challenge:
        by Scud-O / 40Hex
        Okay people this article was originally in 40Hex Issue 1. This
        is reprinted because It gives you a challenge to inprove this virus
        so go a head and work on it! It will greatly help your virus writing
        skills. 
                          - VIRUS SPOTLIGHT -


     The first virus I would like to spotlight is the Tiny virus, lets see
what our good friend Patti Hoffman (bitch) has written about it.

 Name:        Tiny
 Aliases:     163 COM Virus, Tiny 163 Virus, Kennedy-163
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth
 Origin:      Denmark
 Eff Length:  163 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC, F-Prot 1.12+, NAV, IBM Scan 2.00+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot 1.12+, or Delete infected
files
 General Comments:
       The 163 COM Virus, or Tiny Virus, was isolated by Fridrik Skulason
       of Iceland in June 1990.  This virus is a non-resident generic
       .COM file infector, and it will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a file infected with the 163 COM Virus is executed,
       the virus will attempt to infect the first .COM file in the
       current directory.  On bootable diskettes, this file will normally
       be COMMAND.COM.  After the first .COM file is infected,each time
       an infected program is executed another .COM file will attempt to
       be infected.  Files are infected only if their original length is
       greater than approximately 1K bytes.

       Infected .COM files will increase in length by 163 bytes, and have
       date/time stamps in the directory changed to the date/time the
       infection occurred.  Infected files will also always end with this
       hex string: '2A2E434F4D00'.

       This virus currently does nothing but replicate, and is the
       smallest MS-DOS virus known as of its isolation date.

       The Tiny Virus may or may not be related to the Tiny Family.
       ^like she'd know the difference!

OK, Theres the run down on the smallest MS-DOS virus known to man.  As for
it being detected by SCAN we'll see about that.

Here is a dissasembly of the virus, It can be assembled under Turbo Assembler
or MASM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its good to start off with a simple example like this.  As you can see
what the virus does is use the DOS 4Eh function to find the firsy COM file
in the directory.  If no files are found the program exits.  If a file is
found it compares the virus id string (the virus jump instruction) to the
first two bytes of the COM file.  If they match the program terminates.
If they don't match the virus will infect the file.  Using two key MS-DOS
functions to infect.

The first -

INT 21h Function 42h
SET FILE POINTER

AH   =   42h
AL   =   method code
BX   =   file handle
CX   =   most significant half to offset
DX   =   least "                       "

If there is an error in executing this function the carry flag will be set,
and AX will contian the error code.  If no error is encountered

DX   =   most significant half of file pointer
AX   =   least "                             "


The second (and most) important function used by any virus is


INT 21h Function 40h
WRITE TO FILE OR DEVICE

AH    =   40h
BX    =   handle
CX    =   number of bytes to write
DS:DX =   segment of buffer

Returns

AX    =   bytes transferred

on error

AX    =  Error Code and flag is set.


An example of Function 40h is ----

     int     21h                      ;

The Burrito Virus:  by Scud-O
        This is a joke virus just like the Cookie virus. It says that it
wants a burrito, if you type 'burrito' it exits. Type 'breakfast burrito'
and the virus deletes itself. type 'taco bell burrito' and the virus kills
a random file (EXE). Actually this virus isn't really a true virus, as it
doesnt spread (hmm.. maybe for version 2... ) anyway I wrote this is PASCAL
basically because I was bored in PASCAL class. I'm going to port this to ASM
as soon as i find the time... (hey im a busy guy alright?!?!) currently this
file is like 4000 or so bytes (give or take..)
PLEASE NOTE: This is a VERY early version of the virus! The final is lost
somewhere on my network at school... I will hopefully find it for next issue!
Challenge: get this porgram to work fully! I will give a prize to whoever
fixes it first!

ANI Spoofing by Keystroke
(this was first published in PLA issue 41. (thats why he's the mad little
PLA (Phone Losers of America) Insider!!))

Dear PLA:
I've found a new way to block 800 ANI. It is called Net2Phone and allows 
people to place calls using a piece software which connects to IDT's (the
company offering Net2Phone) servers and routes the call from their fones in 
New Jersey to wherever you want to call.

Here is how they describe it, "Net2Phone enables Internet users with sound
equipped PCs to initiate calls from their computers and transmit them over the 
Internet to IDT's phone switches. The switches then convert the signal from 
the 'packet switch network' Internet environment to the 'circuit switch 
network' telephone environment. And then  to its' final destination - any 
ordinary telephone. The result is real-time uninterrupted voice communication
between the two calling parties."

This service is offered for free on 800 and 888 numbers. If you want to call 
regular numbers it cost's extra. Unfortunately, after you call the number, you 
cannot send tones and it is too staticky to use a tone dialer. Grab a copy at 
http://www.net2phone.com.

        TV ad for the Scud line and there is a little gun that talks and
        his name is Scud-O. There was a cool theme song it was:
                "Get your spite in a bag,
                get your bile piled up,
                its the best damn vengance you've ever had!"
