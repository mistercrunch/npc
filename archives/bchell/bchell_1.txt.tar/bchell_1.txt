Making a biege box, using a screw driver, and dialing a phone.
By Doktor Che

PART ONE: MAKING A BIEGE BOX

The biege box  (aka Acrylic Box aka Ditto Box aka Razz Box aka Aerobox aka Dayglo Box aka Beagan 
Box aka Modu Box aka Aquamarine Box aka DLOC Box aka Bud Box aka Lineman's Handset)
is the easiest box to make. (Except for the Busy "box". Ooh..a wire and two alligator clips..ph33r 
my $ki11s!!!...) The are about a billion files describing how to make one.
This is number one billion and one. The biege box is used to make free phone calls, prank, etc. 
You plug it in the a box on the side of someone's house/commercial buildings etc.
This is explained in detail in issue 2 

You need:
	 A handset phone. (From the Salvation Army) 
	Two alligator clips. (Insulated!!!!!!!!!!)
	A modular plug. (Like a wall jack)
	Electrical tape. (Red and green to be a pro)
	Soldering iron and solder. (For a pro job)
	Wire Cutters/Strippers

You could just cut up yer phone, tape alligator clips on the red and green wires and be done with it. 
But don't. Go for quality.

SELECTING THE PHONE:

Make regular trips to the Salvation Army. 
Look for a handset phone with the following qualities:

	A Memory dial feature (For ANI. But be careful. The memory/redial can be used against you)
	A ringer "off" switch   
	Easy access to the innards for adding mute switches, etc.
	
Find an appropriate phone. Make any modifications you wish, like a mute switch (not button.)
Paint it, put some cool stickers on it, whatever. Or don't. See if I care.

Get yerself a modular jack. These can be found on the bottom of the phone cradle. (The part that plugs 
in to the wall.) Remove it. Cut off the yellow and black wires. Strip the green and red wires. Attach the 
alligator clips. Solder. Wrap the connection with  electrical tape. Put the insulators on your clips.
Plug your phone in to your newly made jack.

Better yet, get an inline coupler and a short piece of cord with spade terminals on the end. (Check out Wal-mart)
Cut the terminals, strip a small section of the wire, solder yer clips on the cord. Done.
Plug the phone in to one end of the coupler, the cord in to other.

Whoopee. You now have a biege box.

SOME HINTS AND TIPS:
The beige box is the same as any othe phone in the house. If someone picks up, quickly disconnect 
and leave. Of course if you have a mute switch....
Don't call any number that can be traced to you. 
Don't wreck anything. BCTel gets suspicious when their equipment is damaged.
	 
PART TWO: USING A SCREWDRIVER

A screwdriver can be one of two things. 
It can be:
	A) A drink made with vodka and orange juice, or
	B) a metal thing for fucking with screws

This file is concerned with latter. To use this type of screwdriver, grasp si in one hand. Force the metal 
end into a screw. Turn the screwdriver. Continue until the screw comes loose. 

PART THREE: DIALING A PHONE 

To dial a phone locate the handset and keypad. They may be separate  (desktop phone) or it may be a 
singular unit. (Slimline) To use a desktop phone, lift the handle and place against your ear. You should 
hear a buzzing.This known as "DIAL TONE."  Locate the keypad. It consists of 12 buttons with numbers 
and letters on them.Dial the number of the person you wish to speak to. For assistance, dial 666 and a 
BCHell operator will be happy to help you. 
On a slimline phone the keypad will be on the receiver. Reverse the above instructions. 

	!!!!FOR ADVANCED TELEPHONE USERS ONLY!!!!
  
Once you have mastered the art of dialing phones, you can begin a successful music career.
The telephone keypad is a musical instrument. Confused? Dial  3212 333 222 123 3212 333 3 22 321.
You just played "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (Sort of) Now you are a Rock Star!!

The M4d b33r buffer overflow exploit. 
by Doktor Che

This is a particualry power exploit, and requires no knowledge of C, C++, or any programming 
whatsoever.In fact you don't even a need a computer.

This exploit takes advantage of  weaknesses in the human stomach and liver. No patch is currntly 
available. The results vary from person to person, but it usually cause vomiting, nausea, sensitvity
to light/sound, for up to 3 days.

The attack consists of drinking large amounts of beer within a short period of time. Three to five
cases should suffice, but YMWV. 

Go ahead. Try it.
