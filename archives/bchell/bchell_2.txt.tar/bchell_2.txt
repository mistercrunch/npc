Usering yer biegebox
by Doktor Che

Note: This guide assumess that the reader can:
A)Make a beigebox,
B)Use a screwdriver,
C)Dial a phone.
If you cannot do the above things, please read article in issue one, entitled
Making a beigebox, using a screwdriver, and dialing a phone.

Ok, so you've managed to ruin a perfectly good phone. What should you do with it?
Well buddy, if you don't know, I ain't gonna tell you ;)
But I can tell you *how* to do it.
Almost every house I've been to has a different kind of box.
They are described (sort of) as follows.
   
First, there are the little grey, sometimes tan, sometimes painted to match the
colour of the house. When you open it (sometimes you pull it up and it swings open,
sometimes you actually slide it off.)

Next there are the bigger versions of the same, which are about the size of a paperback.
Big or small, they'll say things like "Network Interface Device", "Telephone Network Interface", 
"For Telco Use Only", sometimes even "Western Electric". As long as it doesn't say Shaw Cable,
it's most likely a  phone box.

Now, when you open this mofo up, you see some metal terminals. Clip your red beigebox wire on
the top right terminal, and your green on the left. You should get a dial tone. Sometimes (I
don't know why) the wires are reversed. Just switch everything around and you'll be fine.

Sometimes you'll find a large grey or tan box that says "BCTel" in raised letters.
These require effort, but can be fun. The require a number two screwdriver to open them and
are occaisonally "locked" with a fancy ass screw. To open it, you need an allan key with a
hole in the center. Or you can just cut the motherfucker open. Paging Mr Roboto....

At any rate, open this bad boy up and you'll find the standard terminals *AND* modular plugs.
This makes for a better connection. Usually you'll find multiple lines as well. <g>
To use to the modular plugs, you have to push in and pull down on the plastic covers.
Its harder to explain than do, check it out and you'll see what I mean.

A stupid prank call
by Doktor Che

This is a transcript of a stupid prank call Mister Roboto made. It was hilarious at 3 am
Note: We called 1-800-257-1234, which is a clearing house for all sorts of useless crap.

Gay Operator: Hello?
Mister Roboto: Um, yeah..I'd like to buy some cocaine
GO: I'm sorry, we don't have that product...good-
MR: No, wait. It wasn't really cocaine, it was just called that.
GO: We don't show any products like that. 
MR: It was C something, anyway.
GO: Do you remeber what it was? 
MR: I believe it was some kind of white powder.
GO: We don't show any products like that.  Sorry.
MR: Yeah, 'bye

Like I said, it was hilarious at three in the morning.
