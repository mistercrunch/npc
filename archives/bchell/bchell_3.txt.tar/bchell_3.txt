If you're stupid enough to do this shit and get caught, its your own fault.
No one involved with this magazine have ever done any of it.
If you blame us for making you do it, the cops will probably laugh at you.
We told you not to.

Welcome to the arts and crafts issue of BCHell! We're just cranking them out, 
aren't we? I'm holding off on Datapac until I complete my NUA scan and 
assemble a semi intelligent article. 
Hopefully our new layout will make us suck less.

The Mustard Box
By Doktor Che 

The mustard box is the coolest of all phreaking boxes. It's not some bullshit 
"box" like the busy box,or the re-route-someone's-phone-line-box. No sir, it 
actually works. It's purpose, and this is of great importance to phreaks the
 world over, is to make your phone tasty. Construction is simple, so it's a 
good box to learn with.

You'll need:
A jar of Dijon mustard. (Or your favorite kind of mustard)
A knife, spoon, fork, or flat piece of wood.
A fone.

Open the mustard jar. This is accomplished by twistin the cap off. Next, 
insert the knife into the jar and get it nice and mustardy.
Remove the knife, and spread the mustard on your phone. Enjoy.

Additionally, you can smear mustard on a box.

WARNING:
Don't try this with payphones. You'll probably get very sick.

Hacking away from home
By Doktor Che

Hack from your house for any amount of time and you'll get caught. On X.25 
(Datapac, Sprintnet, etc.) it's a matter of tracing your phone call. On the 
Internet (The magic of TCP/IP, but you knew that.) it's even easier. So what 
are we to do? Well, you've all seen "Hackers", so get out yer trusty laptop 
and get ready.

WE'LL NEED:
----------------------
A laptop (or PalmPilot, etc. I've heard it's possible with those fancy ass 
scientific calulators, but you'd need to some software/hardware hacking)
An acoustic coupler
A battery/power supply
A good spot
A plan
Maybe a thermos of coffee or something
A friend is always good to have (For beer runs, lookout, whatever) 

GETTING THE EQUIPMENT:
-----------------------------------------------
So not everyone can run out and buy a brand new, 400 Jigahertz, ultra-leeto 
laptop.You don't need one. You need a floppy drive, *maybe* a hard drive 
(I recommend it), a modem of respectable speed (I've never had a problem 
with 2400 baud), and a battery, and even that isn't really nessecary if you're 
hacking from a hotel.

And I don't care how fucking 'leet you are, you need a working display, backlit 
preferred.

Check the Salvation Army, Garage sales, anywhere you can think of.
As long as it works and is portable, any laptop will do. 

As for software, you need a terminal proggie and, uh, DOS 5.0. Sure. EDIT rules.

FINDING A GOOD SPOT:
-----------------------------------------
Sorry, but there's no way in hell I'm going be freezing my ass off at four in the 
morning, hacking off the side of someone's house. I'll stick to payphones. 

However, if you live in a dorm or apartment building, the TNI is often inside. 
Open up that mofo and choose one of the many, many lines. (Pull an ANI to 
be sure it's not yours!) 
It's probably located in some out of the way spot, so bring a friend, 
a couple folding chairs, maybe few issues of 2600, and have a hackfest. 
With any luck, you'll find a socket and save your battery power. 
Indoors is always safer than outdoors, especially if its your own building =) 

Phonebooths are pretty straight forward. Bring yer lappie/w battery and coupler. 
Attach the coupler, turn on the 'puter, fire up the comms program, 
dial the number, and hack away. Using this method I'll stick to 800/888/877 
numbers, or maybe a local dialup. LD calls are too much hassle unless 
you've got a (stolen) calling card.

Hotels lobbies (and airports) are the best. You'll most likely find a socket near 
the phones, saving battery power. You might run into a Vista Desktop phone 
with the RJ-11 jack, giving you a better connection than with your coupler. 
Comfy chairs are in abundant supply. Your friend can run and get snacks 
and coffee, and maybe a souvenier keychain. You're nice and warm in the winter. 
It's full of businessmen, so no one will notice a jerk with a laptop. Your chance
 of being jacked/urinated on by winos decreases significantly.

A PLAN:
-------------
Unless you're wardialing, have dial-up already selected. Make a list of 
default/likely passwords and check them off as you go through them. This is a 
little risky, but hacking always is.
Call it up a few times from home to see what it looks like. If it's on Datapac, 
you can do this safely,but I don't imagine it being a problem with a direct dial-up.

Note: Wardialing won't work with Nortel Milleniums, as the handset is muted. 
Hand dial only kids. 

A THERMOS OF COFFEE:
-----------------------------------------
Pour a thermos-full of boiling water over two rounded tablespoons of ground coffee.
Let it steep for five minutes. Strain back into the thermos. Enjoy.

A FRIEND:
----------------- 
Sorry, you'll have to make your own freinds.

Model Rocket Fun
By Doktor Che

Have you ever wanted to operate your own space agency, just like NASA, 
but couldn't come up with the cash to get started? Or maybe you want to 
re-enact the Gulf War with your asshole neighbors.
Well, now you can. And won't cost much.

You'll need:
Model Rocket Engines ($7.95)*
A Paper Tube (asswipe, f'rinstance)
OR
Stiff Paper (A cereal box maybe?)
Masking Tape
A Nine Volt Battery
Toilet Paper
Something For A Nosecone
Something For An Engine Block
(More on these two later) 

Glow-in-the-dark Green Paint (Optional-If you want the Gulf War effect.)
 

*We used size C =)

Construction:

These mofos are pretty simple to build. Cut your tube (or roll the paper) 
so it's just a little larger than the engine. It should be able to slide in and out 
easily, but it can't be too tight or too loose.
Tape your body together so it holds it's shape. Got it? All right, then. 
Now, if you're using toilet paper tubes, you'll need to attach two, one on top of 
the other, and tape the seam. 

The engine block prevents the engine from shooting through the top of you rocket.  
If you're attaching two tubes together, make the bottom of the top section smaller 
than the engine and reinforce it with tape. Otherwise, jam something solid about 
an inch above the engine. Rolled up aluminium can works very well. 

The wadding goes in between the engine block and nose cone. Use some toilet paper. 
Remember: If it's too loose, the engine will shoot straight throught the top and 
your rocket will suck.
If the wadding's too tight your rocket will explode. Hmmm.... 

The nose cone can be pretty much anything that will fit. I attatched mine with 
a piece of string taped to the nose and the body. This was to allow it to become 
detached during the final stage of the rocket's flight and not be lost. 
We've made rockets with nose cones that didn't come off but they 
never came back =(

I've included a crappy drawing to help you.
