If you're stupid enough to do this shit and get caught, its your own fault.
No one involved with this magazine have ever done any of it.
If you blame us for making you do it, the cops will probably laugh at you.
We told you not to.

Urban Exploration:
The Art of Going Where You're Not Supposed To.
by DoktorChe

What is urban exploration? Well, if you couldn't tell from the title,
you're an idiot. Urban exploration takes many forms: exploring
abandoned buildings, underground tunnels, institutions like hospitals
or schools, government buildings, hotels...

Well, now I'm rambling. Anyway, you get the picture.
Since I'm a wuss who doesn't want to step in something icky, I'll avoid
tunnels and abandoned buildings.

SCHOOLS:

Elementary schools are out. They're too small, there's nothing of any
interest, and trust me, you won't blend in.
High Schools are 50/50. If its too small, the staff will notice you
pretty quick. A bigger school might yield more opportunity, but I'd
rather avoid them altogether.

If you're hell-bent on exploring a school, colleges are your best bet.
The population is bigger, so you can hide in plain sight

HOTELS!
HOSPITALS!
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS!

The Art of Brain Washing
 by slave


This a guide to reprogramming people to change their beleifs and maybe
even worship you. I know more people should be worshipping me. Anyways
results depend on the person, time spent, and how good you were, so they
really vary. Oh well.

I am assuming you have bagged your victim and you wanna make him a soilder
in some army of satan or something. You will want to throw him in a cell
that is sound proof, underground (no light), and is very dull looking
(concrete walls, painted grey, etc), that wasy their senses will be dulled.

To start off make sure that they sleep irregular hours so they lose track
of time. Morale should be lowered. Limit food, water, tobbaco intake. If
the victim is additicted to anything (cigarettes, drugs) limit just right so
that they will beg you to have it but they don't get any satisfaction from
giving it up.

Before your victim will be allowed to get any food, water, drugs, sex, make
them do some tasks. At first make it pointless tasks, like killing 100 bugs or
scraping the rust of a pan with a nail. Do this until they start doing it
right away and no refusal and graudually move it up doing stuph aganist
their religion, political beliefs, etc and do stuph that are your beliefs, if
they continue to disobey, even with no food start using torture method.

When your torturing your victim you want no shit, just pure pain. I mean
nipple pulling and testicle clamps. (If you can take the pain you are about
to inflict.) If you don't use methods like this, then don't use them all
the time or else you might start taking the pain. And if you do it just
enough the fear of having the pain is about bad enough.

After using all of these methods you are on your way to having a new cult cohort. 
(You can alway use another person to worship you) 
When brain washing someone it really varies on the person, but on the average
person this might break them, with time.
