  Programs for nothing
  --------------------

    I want my
    I want my
    I want my FTP
 
    Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
    You get the files from the FTP
    That ain't programming, that's the way you do it
    Programs for nothing and the code is free
    Now that ain't programming, that's the way you do it
    Let me tell you those guys aren't pissed
    Maybe break a nail on your little finger,
    Maybe get some numbness in your wrist
 
    We've got to install operating systems
    Custom software delivery
    We've got to move these manual pages
    RTFM those RFCs  
   
    See the little user with his gifs and the jpegs
    Yeah buddy he's got root
    That little user got his own workstation
    That little user got his own disk to boot

    I should've learned to run xarchie
    I should've learned to play them games
    Look at that mama, her gif is sticking in the monitor
    Man we could have some fun
    And he's up there, what's that?  Orgasm noises?
    Playing sound files like a grade-school geek
    That ain't programming that's the way you do it
    Get your programs for nothing get your code for free
