How to get free calls from a payphone, without pissing about with tone
generators, redboxen and such like. The best thing about this is that
you don't need to ring operators, so they can't trace you. In fact, the
only way people know what's going on is if they compare the phone bill
for the box with the amount of money in the tray, hardly likely that a
BT employee will be able (or bothered) to add-up anyway.

Ok, first, you need a shit old phone. Cut the lead connecting the phone
to the phone jack. Get some crocodile clips and connect them to the
red/blue wires, or the yellow/black wires, depending on the age of your
phone. Don't worry if none of your wires are those colours, just
because YOU'VE GOT A FREAK PHONE THAT'S CRAP AND NO-ONE'S EVER HEARD OF
AND IS SHIT, doesn't mean you can't get free calls from it ;) If you
have got a freak phone, experiment by connecting each wire back up to
the original (before you cut it), and see which 2 wires give you a
dialtone. Attach the croc. clips to those. Right, you now have a beige
box, or linesman's handset. I call mine a glasses box, because I
dismantled my phone and put it into a much smaller container, a glasses
case, to prevent prying eyes wondering what I'm doing with a separate
phone in a phone box. You might want to disguise yours too, if you're
planning to use a phonebox in urban areas (not recommended).

Next, you need to go outside <SHOCK, HORROR, SUNLIGHT, NO COMPUTER!>
and hunt for the right kind of phone box. Don't even think about going
anywhere near the new glass phone boxes, because you've no chance, AND
they're always in highly public areas, so you're a prick if you plan to
use them :) You're looking for an OLD red payphone. Found one? go
inside, and look at the floor underneath the money box. You see a big
metal triangle on the wall of the box, with a metal tube going up to
the phone. Get a hammer and wrench this casing tube off. You'll now
have a wire. Pull this out from around the back of the money box.
Eventually, this cable will meet with a white phone line. They'll be
connected by two wires, (if there are lots, you want the blue and
orange ones). Strip the wires back partially (about 1/2 a centimetre)
and attach your crocodile clips from YOUR phone to them. Check that you
have a dialtone, and BINGO! Free calls, paid for by BT. When you're
done, tuck the wires back where they were, so people don't think it's
been tampered with. Oh, one last thing, NEVER call home unless it's an
emergency, and ALWAYS dial 141 before all calls, that stops Big Brother
from tracing you.

Welcome. Are you pissed off with paying for calls? Me too. Are you
pissed off with shit blueboxing files? Me too. That's why I've written
this text. The basic structure of a blueboxing file goes:

                       Here is how to bluebox
                   Here are the tones you'll need
                          Go get Bluebeep
                          Find a C5 line
                            EXPERIMENT

The one that really pissed me off was the last one. Experiment.
Frankly, I don't want to. I want to be able to bluebox straight away,
no questions asked. I imagine that's how you feel, so I'll teach you.

First, what is blueboxing?

Blueboxing is possibly the most commonly used skill in the phreaking
community. Or at least, it was. Don't worry, it's not extinct, that's
bullshit. It started in the US (quelle suprise?), when phreaks got
tired of paying for calls. They found out that if they sent 2600hz
down the phone line to a local number they'd already dialed, they
could dial any number they want in the world, all for the cost of a
local call. It used to work here, but no longer. Which, in a way is a
good thing, because now it means we don't have to pay the local call
either, it's all free. Basically, the 2600hz tone told the fone company
'This person's hung up, stop charging them'. And from there, the phreak
could call anywhere. It's called blueboxing because there used to be a
little box that made the tones needed, and funnily enough, it was blue.
Anyway, in the UK it's a little more complicated.

What do I need to bluebox?

The program found at hackuk.8m.com, S|ain's UK tone Emulator.
A soundcard. A phone near your soundcard. A C5 number.

A what number?

A C5 number, it's an undeveloped phone line that still thinks certain
tones mean the caller has hung up. They are usually 0800 890 ***, and
they connect to various poor countries. I know of two that are
currently useable, the first being one I can't get to work, Uraguay
direct, and the second, the one I use, Bolivia Direct (0800 890 059).
If it packs up, just go to the back of your phonebook and you'll find
more there. You'll know they're C5, as there'll be a high-pitched CHEEP
CHEEP when the other end picks up. Bolivia is especially good, as it is
automated, so no operators will get pissed off with you, trace you,
send you to prison and get your parents/guardians (see how Politically
Correct I am?) pissed with you so they disown you. Which they can do,
by the way, in case you're thinking of calling Bolivia direct without
dialing 141 first. Not that that'll save you anyway. 

I'm sorted, now what?

Dial the number, wait about 5 secs, and you'll hear a cheep cheep,
followed by some Bolivian speaking to you (It's automated, don't worry,
they won't laugh at you when they realise you've failed miserably and
start bleeping at them). That step's to make sure you know what your
dialing, and that you've dialed it right. Hang up.

Ok...and now?

Open S|ain's program. Click on Blue Box. Ignore what's written on the
buttons, it's wrong. Press all the buttons to make sure they're
working. Keep this program open.

Right, get on with it, I want free calls! FUCKING WAIT. Pick up your
phone and call Bolivia (0800 890 059). Put your phone next to the
speaker from which your tones flow out. Press the button (on the
program) marked '2400/2400 mix'. Now press '2400 hz'. Hold the phone to
your ear. If you hear a long bleep, you've fucked up, you've got to
press 2400 hz really quickly. If you hear nothing, good. Put the phone
back to the speaker, and press KP now dial the number you want to call
(inc. country and area code). Press ST. You're there, the call's being
connected.

A basic summary of what to press

0800 890 059--> 2400/2400 mix--> 2400 hz--> KP--> Country Code--> Area Code--> Number--> ST

Ok, redboxing. This takes more guts than blueboxing, but not much, you
just need social engineering skills (the ability to persuade someone to
give you what you want). For more info about social engineering, just
ask Mister-X ;) Right, first, what do you need?

Things you'll need:

              S|ain's UK box emulator at hackuk.8m.com
                 A tape recorder (dictaphone ideal)
                            A walkman
                 A small (walkman headphone) speaker
                           A phone box

OK, set up your dictaphone or tape recorder to record from your PC onto
either. The recording MUST be clear, but I'll leave that to you. Load
up S|ain's UK box emulator. Click on Redbox. Start recording on your
tape player/dictaphone. Click on the 50p button. Wait 2 seconds, then
click on 50p again. Repeat this until you've got enough for the call
you want to make. But the tape in you walkman, and plug in the speaker.

Go down to your local telephone box. 

Next step, dealing with the operator. Putting money into a phone box
creates tones. The only way an operator knows you've put in money is if
they hear these tones. These tones are the ones you've just recorded :)
Decide where you want to call. First, dial 155 to report a fault to the
operator. Say that you can't call a number, because the (whatever)
button is broken. Operator will ask you to insert money. Here, you play
the tones back to them. They'll then connect you. You now have free
calls!

Bad things to do:

Decide you're calling 0891 33 99 55 and tell them the '7' button's
broken. Be rude to them. Be mouthy. Tell them what to do, they're an
operator, it's their job, if you tell them what to do, they won't.

Bye and stuff:
