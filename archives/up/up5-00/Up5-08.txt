<*> Introduction

[Overview]

 Subscriber Units are Customer Line Interfaces, this is where two or
 more phone lines intersect, they are multiplexers which connect up to
 the local switching hub. They are sometimes installed in houses where
 a second phone is placed. Or you may have seen boxes on telephone
 poles where about fifty or more of the phone lines in a neighbourhood
 all join up. The reason for this is convenience, the lineman might
 need all the local lines in one fixed place at his disposal, and you
 probably thought all those commercials on television claiming
 convenience was just some slick telco advertising campaign.

 Ok, I'm not going to bore you with a list of the some telco acronyoms
 and seeing as they are mostly country specific and usually corporate
 speak it would be dull and useless to most people. I'm just going to
 talk a little subscriber units in no great detail. They are largely
 experimented with by the phreaking community due to their high level
 of accessibility, they are outside which makes the possibilities
 endless. For more information head down to the back of your local
 telco yard with a balaclava and backpack or search in your local
 library under telecommunications.

<*> General Information

[Overview]

 Boxes located on the sides of roads to deal with all the lines in that
 area, some subscriber units are full of hundreds of wires for that
 area whereas others can be much smaller. I would recommend having a
 look inside one of these as they are totally full of wires but don't
 get caught opening one of these as you might be arrested! If you open
 one of these subscriber units you can beige box off it, good fun if
 the unit has hundreds of lines in it as you can easily seize lot of
 peoples phone lines and hook up to your laptop. Alternatively, many
 have operator test sockets which you can simply plug your phone cord
 into. All the residential phone lines join into them and are connected
 by fibre optic cables to the local switching exchange.

   _____________
  /  __     __  \  This is a very rough diagram, especially considering
  | °__°   °__° |  that subscriber units can be big or small, black or
  | °__°   °__° |  green, whatever. It all depends on what country you
  | °__°   °__° |  live in, but aesthetic details such as size and
  | °__°   °__° |  colour are not important, what matters is the phone
  | °__°   °__° |  lines inside. The diagram to the left shows a very
  | °__°   °__° |  general example with seven ring and tip pairs on
  | °  °   °  ° |  either side. There are many different kinds of
  \__\\-----//__/  copper pairs each with their own colour coding, but
       |   |       that goes beyond the scope of this file. This ascii
       |   |       diagram is best viewed in the Fixedsys font.

<*> Country Interfaces

[Overview]

 Customer Line Interfaces vary from country to country, size and shape,
 colour and context, many different types and styles. This section is a
 meant as a resource for looking up information on subscriber units in
 a small handful of countries.

[United States]

 A subscriber unit in this country is officially referred to as
 Telephone Line Interfaces but more loosely called BellCans. In most
 states they are small green boxes usually going down into the ground.
 These Junction Boxes (as they are also sometimes called) can be black
 or green depending on which telco administrates them e.g. Bell, GTE,
 MCI, AT&T etc.

[United Kingdom]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a Cable Access Box (CAB)
 and they are generally big green boxes with the majority fixed by pole
 installation. The newer standard BT models have sockets where the
 phone is plugged into. They are also known as PCPs.

[Spain]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a Telefonica Rectángulo De
 Ensambladura. That roughly translates as Telefonica Junction Box, it
 is worth noting that Telefonica are the telco that hold the monopoly
 on the Spainish telecommunications market. 

[Ireland]

 A subscriber unit in this country is called a RBM. I'm not sure what
 that stands for but it is a foreign acrynom as Telecom Eireann's RBM
 supplier is Tadiran Communications, a company based in Israel. They
 are small black boxes found on poles etc. They are never buried
 underground. The most common models come in two and four copper pair
 units.

<*> Manual Installation

[Overview]

 Below the overview is instructions for installing a subscriber unit.
 Ok, so maybe most phreaks won't care, but going with the philosophy
 that all knowledge is power I'm going to include it anyway. It is an
 extract from a manual that was given to me along with some other
 interesting items by a friendly lineman. It is supposed to be info
 reserved for telco employees. The official title is Installation
 Instructions For The RBM 2 Subscribers Unit. This particular unit is
 only compatible with European phone systems as far as I know.

[Unpacking]

 1. Open the plastic bag.
 2. Open the RBM housing cover by unscrewing the two slotted screws.

[Wall Installation]

 1. Select an appropriate location on a vertical smooth surface for the
    Subscriber Unit.
 2. Attach the RBM box, using the enclosed screws.

[Pole Installation]

 1. Secure the RBM box to a pole with a flexible strap (not supplied).
 2. Thread the strap through the pair of holes provided on the upper
    and lower parts of the unit and fasten around the pole.

[Wiring]

 1. To insert wires into the box - cut grommet bosses located on the
    front cover and route the wires through.
 2. Strip away approximately 8mm. of wire insulation.
 3. Pull out the connector from its housing.
 4. Insert the wires into the connector (see diagrams), using the
    plastic lever (the plastic lever can be use for all 11 positions).
 5. Replace the connector into its housing.
 6. Close the front cover.

[Inspection]

 1. If the DLX unit is operated and connected to the digital line,
    verify that the green SYNC light is on. This indicates that the RBM
    2 Subscribers Unit is synchronised with the DLX. Note: The light
    will begin to glow within 60 seconds of connector insertion.
 2. If the subscriber lines are connected to the exchange, connect a
    telephone set in parallel with the subscriber connections and
    carry out operational test.
