<*> Hi all. We presume if you are reading this section you simply have
nothing better to do (well naturally). If you are uneducated in the
inner workings of Underground Periodical maybe you'll need a short
explanation... this is that special time when we sift through the
letters that find their way to our email account. The letters page is
very short this month (shame on you). We want to hear from you no
matter what it is you want to talk about. If you just want to drop by a
mail to say hello we will gladly appreciate it. The ascii logo for
this issue was designed by Force, much thanks go to him.

Hello,

Security Search is implementing web site voting. This will allow
visitors to cast their vote for the "Top 50" security web sites.

All you need to do is place the following html code into your web
pages. When a user clicks on the graphic they will register a vote for
your site. 

<A
HREF="http://www.securitysearch.net/cgi-bin/search/vote.cgi?ID=ABC123">
<IMG SRC="http://www.securitysearch.net/search/images/top50.gif"
BORDER="0" alt="The Security Search Engine"></A>

You must replace ABC123 with your ID number. You were sent this ID
number in an e-mail message when your site was submitted to Security
Search. It's the same ID number as the one you enter to change your web
site entry. If you do not remember your ID number then please contact
us and we will e-mail it to you. 

You can obtain a list of the Top 50 sites by clicking on "Top 50" from
any menu.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us.

Well, well, well, thanks for sending us your 'letter'. Do we detect an
unsolicited email? Come on people, we want real letters, from readers,
not spam from the infamous Top 50 which is crap and notorious for
listing sites which deal in pirated software. If anybody wants to leech
the code and become a 'famous' security site, feel free.

Sure thing, you've been added to the subscription list. Remember all, a
blank message sent to upzine-subscribe@egroups.com does the trick quite
nicely indeed. By the way, we blanked out this guy's phone number as
he probably doesn't need prank calls from random people.

Subject: Problems accessing site 

Hi,

I was trying to download the back issues from your site, but I kept
getting a 403 Forbidden Access error message.

Any chance of you emailing them to me?

TIA

We replied to Richard with the complete list of places to download back
issues and discovered he had fallen victim to the old upzine.8m.com
web site. If anyone has any problems accessing the four current
distribution sites or the files hosted on them, please e-mail us as
soon as possible.

Hey, hey, HEYYY!!!

okay well I hevent mailed ya in fucken YEEERS but, hey, I'm a lazy
bollox, what can I do about it!! :)

well, cybie boy, i must give you credit. From reading you upzine, I
wasnt too sure that you were making a right decision, and I even
doubted your ability to produce a completely technically correct
article. But the articles have been getting better, and I can see that
you really do research some of stuff you've written. Your upzine
certainly seems to be on the up & up, and I've been even considering
helping out a bit with it, maybe an issue or 2 down the road :)

Ok well I'm working now for the summer. upgrading a personnel package
from 16 bit to 32. Tis pretty hard work, and thats what I like about
it. I could give you funny stories about the business, but they're
stories for another day :)

anyway, I gotta send this mail now,
seeya, and g'luck with the upzine

Yes, I think that mail sums up the philosophy carried by Up staff. Our
original motto "We're on the Up and Up" was not chosen by total
coincidence, when we compiled our first two issues we knew that we
were capable of so much more. This was complicated by real life stuff.
In fact getting out this issue was a big struggle, notice how people
all over over the world, particularly in America and the United Kingdom
have been doing exams recently? Any help GPF#2 has to offer would be
gladly appreciated. In fact, any help anybody has to offer whether they
already know staff members or not is so very welcome.

We aim to please. It is comforting to know you prefer our particular
content as opposed to various competitors. We don't seem to receive
much submissions of articles focusing on political views or UFO
sightings but we do consider every single thing sent to us no matter
how strange, sick, evil etc.

having the upzine email address he never sent another email!
