Howdyz!

First of all let me tell you that English isn't my native language, so
if you find a few spelling errors learn to live with it.

Ok, so you want to keep the FBI/Secret Service/police/mom and dad/ISP
/little brother/dog off your back, something that sounds harder than it
is (except for the mom and dad/little brother/dog, which, if you
haven't noticed yet, won't be in this guide anyway). This file is
mainly going to concentrate on WinGates and proxies and shit. I know
it's basic but this is a newbie text after all.

If you plan on doing some hacking never use daddy's account, if
something goes wrong his ISP will cut off his account, making him
very pissed off, he'll probably never let you near his (or your own)
computer ever again. Better use a stolen account. I've read texts 
that suggested setting up an ISP account under a false name and paying
for it in cash, these texts are kinda old but I doubt ISP's accepted
cash in '93 and i'm sure they don't do it now. Dialing into your stolen
account from your own phone line isn't the safest thing to do either,
but sometimes you don't have a choice.

Your best bet is bouncing off a few WinGates too, along with a stolen
account. First some background info on WinGates...

WinGate is a program for Windows used to let several computers on a
LAN (Local Area Network, but if you didn't know that, stop reading)
connect to the internet with only one modem, the computer that has
WinGate installed will act as a gateway. But WinGate wouldn't be that
interesting for us if it wouldn't have some strange flaws and
defaults. The most important one is, as a default it opens port 23
(standard telnet port) and lets others connect to it. If you connect to
a WinGate you can use it to connect to another computer, the other
computer's logs will show the IP address of the WinGate, not yours. But
there's another interesting one, as a default WinGate doesn't log any
connections it gets.

Of course you don't have to go with the defaults but it is a Windows
application, most people install it with the default Windows way. Next,
finish and just go with the defaults, leaving everything open. WinGates
aren't that hard to find, there are several programs around the
internet that scan for them. But that takes up a lot of time,
especially when you don't know where to look. You may know about cable
modems and their high bandwidth, a lot of people want to share this
bandwidth, they're the ones that use WinGate a lot. If you find an ISP
that offers cable modem accounts you can scan their IP range. You can
also do it by hand, but that's not a viable option, that's like walking
to the the other side of the country when you have a train ticket.

A lot of people that use WinGates like to chat on IRC, a lot of IRC
servers have this thing against WinGate and g-line them (a g-line is
when a certain IP address gets banned from an IRC server). /stats g
will show all the IP's that are g-lined, when it says "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
insecure WinGate rejected" you found yourself a WinGate. Before you use
it for a hack you'd better see if it works (note that when you try 
it out it may work, but people sometimes turn their computers off or
close their connection with the internet, don't ask me why, also some 
ISP's give out dynamic IP addresses, which change everytime someone
logs into their account there). Telnet to that IP address, when you
are greeted by the infamous "WinGate>" prompt you've found what you're
looking for. But one isn't enough, you'll need more if you want to
stay out of shit. Was there only one insecure WinGate in the list? Try
some of the "Automatically banned for excessive connections". They
could be WinGates too.

Keep in mind that some WinGates do log any connections so it's best to
use more then one, I always use 5 to 10 myself. But sometimes all 10 of
them log, but as long as you don't do any damage they won't track you
through 10 WinGates, it'll cost too much. They'll just close whatever
hole you used, change all passwords and go on with life.

To bounce from one WinGate to another just type the other computer's
hostname or IP address (whether it's another WinGate or the target).
WinGates can also be used to remain anonymous on IRC (remember that
the WinGates you found by giving the  "/stats g" command won't work on
the server you found them). Connect to the WinGate's port 23 from your
IRC client (/server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 23) then connect to your favourite
IRC server by typing /raw diemen.nl.eu.undernet.org (or whatever server
you want). It will want a nickname, type /raw nick <nick> Give your
username and your IRC name by typing /raw user AlphaVers 0 0
:AlphaVersion (replace AlphaVers and AlphaVersion with whatever name
you want to use). On some clients you may need to use /quote instead of
/raw.

Have you ever noticed how e-mails send along your IP address in the
header? If you telnet to a WinGate and bounce a little you can change
that. From a WinGate type mail.whatever.com 25 (replace
mail.whatever.com with a genuine server running SMTP protocol of
course, 25 is the standard port for the SMTP daemon). For more info on
forging mail and sending it through telnet please read The Mob Boss's
article, "The Wonderful and Evil World Of E-mail" at
