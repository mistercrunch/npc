With the release of this file I am in no way stating that I am an
expert in the radio field but read on if you think it is something that
might interest you...

We all by now know that the digital television phase has suddenly taken
over the standard analogue television set's job of giving you you
a standard cable operated amount of channels and turning it into a
multi functional 1000+ channel high quality receiver. Well the second
phase of this digital takeover is now on its way to now give you the
same operation accept this time its on your car radio.

It's called Digital Audio Broadcasting and it's the most fundamental
advance in radio since FM. Now, for the first time, you can tune into
pure CD quality sound over the airwaves. Without interference, fading
or distortion. With more stations and services to choose from. And text
pictures and graphics can be sent to support audio programmes. DAB is
compatible with other digital services, such as the internet. All of
this, in-car. Created in 1987 by a European consortium, DAB (also known
as Eureka 147) is the only system in the world to receive International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) recognition as a world-wide standard,
and the word is spreading fast. DAB services will soon be available
throughout most of the EU. At least 100,000,000 people are already
within reach of DAB transmissions.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

With DAB, the audio signal from each programme is converted into a
stream of digital data bits. This digital data is combined by a
multiplexing technology known as COFDM into one Ensemble - an Ensemble
consists of up to eight principal programmes, as well as additional
programme related data and data for use with ancillary data services.
COFDM spreads the data stream over the time and frequncy spectrum,
eliminating the effects of radio interference. This gives continuous CD
quality sound for uninterrupted listening pleasure. COFDM also enables
the creation of Single Frequency Network (SFN). This allows the
broadcaster to build a network of transmitters, each of which use the
same frequencies. This eliminates the need for retuning, and adds to
the convenience of the DAB service.

                 Different ensembles often don't share
            <-----  services. Manually retuning to  ----->
                a different ensemble can take some time

Sevices can share informatiuon, i.e. traffic, weather announcements
etc. Retuning is instantaneous.

MULTIPLEXING:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Multiplexing, in terms of digital broadcasting, is the process of
interweaving two or more lower-speed data streams into a single high
speed radio frequency channel, or Ensemble. DAB offers the possibility
of Dynamic Multiplex Reconfiguration. This means that the Ensemble
contents can be adjusted according to the requirements at any time,
allowing a different choice of programmes and services at different
times. For example, the broadcaster can choose to simultaneously cover
a football game and a tennis match, instead of only offering one sports
programme (See Diagram). Broadcasters now have more flexibility in
programming and the listener has more choice. The Ensemble may also
contain Programme Associated Data (PAD), Programme Type (PTY)
information, Dynamic Label Segment (DLS-DAB Text), Language information
and Announcement support information.
