                       :..::..Introduction.::..:

<*> Underground Periodical, read by the FBI, feared and revered by the
masses. Another month goes by and many more people have helped out as
usual :). Another distributor climbs aboard, thanks tGb, if you want to
be like him then get uploading right now. Well, I'm finally started
to get recognised by people on IRC, lots of people talk just to say
hello, point out minor mistakes in articles or tell me their ideas,
all of which are much appreciated. 

<*> Well, we received many applications for the role of Webmaster, all
were impressive, but a friend convinced me that it would be better to
stay independent. We gave the site a minor overhaul, its a little bit
more slick but still needs work. So now we all help out with the site,
expect more changes and additions over the coming months. We'd still
like suggestions for ways to improve the site. Keep sending those
helpful emails.

<*> We'd like to thank any and all people who submitted to issue five
or contributed in any way. They are the people who go out of their way
to help others. Without continued support from the underground
community we won't be able to keep on going. It's your magazine, so
help it out a little. Anyway, on with this issue...
