<*>              Getting Free Dial-Ups From Free CDs
                +-----------------------------------+

INTRO
-----

Most ISPs are freely willing to send you their sign-up CDs in the post
or they've got their files on cover CDs freely available from your
newsagents. The other similarity that most ISPs have is that they
distribute Internet Explorer to their customers as the default browser.
To do this easily they use IEAK (Internet Explorer Admin Kit) which is
freely available from the Microsoft site and is used to produce full
installation packages for ISPs.

Right, enough of the background...

IE4
---

The installations are often in their own directory called IE4 or
similar and are normally made up of a bunch of .CAB (Microsoft's
compressed files) and a few other executables. If you can't see these
in your IE4 directory then make sure you've got the latest version of
WinZip and right click on executable file in the directory that looks
like IE4, if you're lucky then it will have an "Open with WinZip"
option which allows you to open the installations file's built in files
and extract them without installing them. If you still can't find the
IE4 install files then you're in the wrong directory or your ISP's got
wise, but this is rare and they're normally easy to find.

In these install files is at least one .isp file which is normally
called setup.isp (although the name isn't set, make sure you're not
hiding the extensions and use explorer to look for the file). Once
you've found the file hold down shift and right click the file then
choose the "Open With..." option followed by Notepad (Or you're fav.
text viewer!) This .isp file hold all of the information that IE4
install uses to dial into your ISP and sign you up a new account, to
dial into an ISP you need a username and password of course, but
you've not been assigned one yet since you're not a member of your ISP,
so instead IE4 dials into a signup account while IE4 arranges to give
you your password. The user name and password can be found in this .isp
file along with the phone number of your ISPs reg-server.

Depending on how well your ISP's set up there server will depend on
what you can access through this dial-in account, normally it's just a
single URL or server which has the registration process on but if you
strike lucky you'll find an ISP who's security is lame and allows you
to have full internet access through the account, providing you with an
anon, free account. If the ISPs get annoyed and change their password
then simply re-apply for a sign-up CD and pull the password off again!
I can't see there being any change in the IE5 distribution so it looks
like this problem is around to stay :-)

IE3
---

After trawling through zip files it looks like the same trick can be
done with IE3, but from my test install you're gonna need something
which can open install.exe files, like WinZip. The general method is
pretty similar, I played with the netcom install files and here's what
I found, first extract the files from msie30uk.exe or whatever the IE3
install file is. From here you need to open the iexplore.cab file and
extract the contents, these include the set-up info.

The test install had a phone.icw file which held the numbers for the
local dial-ups it also contained pointers to .dun files depending on
the location, opening these up in notepad revealed that these looked
similar to IE4's .isp files containing user and pass info, simply match
these up with the number in phone.icw and happy surfing!

PROBLEMS
--------

The only problem that I've come across while using this method is with
the InfoTrade ISP (Run by Mitsubishi and has numeric user-names, Urgh!)
I sifted through the .isp file, but I couldn't find the username/pass
anywhere, I dialed in through HyperTerminal and sure enough it wanted a
login, but alas there wasn't one anywhere, when I ran the .isp file it
also prompted me for a username/pass, looking through the documentation
it appears that each new subscriber is given a user name and pass to
sign on with that then becomes their permanent account, no why haven't
the rest of the ISP's done this? Simply because they don't treat you as
a number but more of a person so unless you pre-arrange the username
this can't be done, it just goes to show how much difference it takes
to prevent this hole from coming to light!
