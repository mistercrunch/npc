<*> My expertise in the cellphone area is not by any means excellent
and I am not for one moment saying it is but I do insist that if you
have a mobile lying around the house that you should do as much damage
as possible and that includes becoming a maniac so far as creating
explosions and causing plane crashes so have fun.

Just some of the best fun can be done right in front of your house even
in places that you thought where 100% free of danger, because now you
have just interupted them in a way they will not forget. In an auto-
mobile you can fuck it up by turning on the moblie phone and causing
your anti-skid breaks, your speed control and your fuel injection to
become dead as if they never ever powered up. On an aircraft you also
interfere with it's much needed resources and causing the plane to go a
couple of thousand degrees off course by interfering with the
navigation system. It would also be fun when an area tells you to "turn
off two-way radio" and to ignore it, causing major damage as you ignite
a shitload of chemicals KA-BOOM!

Of course i'm by no means saying you should go out and do this as if
you do it would be your own choice. What i am saying is by doing this
you are putting a lot of lives at risk so just don't do something
you're going to regret in later years when your being fucked up the ass
by your cellmate.

Here's a quick guide to most phones O/S but as always i have based this
on my phone and some others may vary in their own ways, This I based on
the NEC p800 and some features may not work in different countries.

The screen would look like this:

on your phone you can go out and buy one so that they do work.
