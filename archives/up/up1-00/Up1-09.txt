<*> This is the part of the e-zine where we respond to e-mails and
questions and stuff. Most of the mail we have recieved so far is in
response to newsgroup posts and from people who have seen the website.
The original mail headers have been left in as we aren't going to
protect people who send us lame messages. Keep those intelligent
e-mails flowing in. Everybody likes a bit of encouragement. The e-mails
are indexed in order of the date they were recieved.

I have written some stuff , and if I send them to you , whats in it for
me ?
Information wants to be free , I know . I might send you my article on
hacking win9* (from the outside and the inside) but it's kind of a file
for
beginners . Tell me if you want it .

Let's just get this straight... You want some sort of prize because you
might send us your article on hacking Windows for beginners. How about
instead you never e-mail us again. Nobody else asked for something. Why
should you feel special. You should help spread knowledge. You really
are NoPhun, just some boring dude on the net.

That is a reply we got from a newsgroup post. We'd like to thank fORCE
again as he took it upon himself to design the logo without previously
knowing us. You can d/load FAiTH e-zine at http://darkcyde.8m.com/faith

Please don't send us URLs of places where we can illegitimately steal
other people's text files. The articles must be submitted by the author
or else it defeats the whole purpose. If you want to help us out you
should write us an article.

Maybe if you didn't bug us with your pointless and stupid e-mails we'd
be able to get some work done!

There are no secret codes in the mIRC client that give you ops. Did you
get confused with Quake when you asked for cheats? Turn off your
computer and go do something in real life for a change.

I dont know much in the way of hacking, but I know quite a lot

Ok. We would be very interested in an IRC file as it would show that we
go beyond just hacking files. You can reach me on Dalnet IRC network:

I'm interested in helping you out and contributing to your e-zine. 
However,
since I publish a catalog and we are in print, I'm short on time at the
moment. Hell, I still have the web site to finish.  If you have any
guidlines that need followed, let me know.

or

The only guidelines you need follow are no pornography or warez. We are
also aiming this at the global community so try not to limit the file
to just America or just the AOL network. Hope your catalog works out.
