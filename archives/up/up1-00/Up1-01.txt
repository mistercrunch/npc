                       :..::..Introduction.::..:

<*> Welcome to the first and thus foremost issue of Underground
Periodical. The staff has been planning this e-zine for 2 whole months
so we hope everyone thinks that it's good. The thinking behind Up is 
new wave, we wanted to create an e-zine that didn't try to be the
latest thing in the hacking scene but rather an interesting read,
something to make you think out loud. Our main aim is to keep on going,
so many e-zines die sometime in their first five issues. I urge you to
send us something to use, as you will get to plug your site at the end.

<*> Its readers write Underground Periodical. Without you we the staff,
the fancy ascii art, it all means nothing. You are the ones who write
the magazine. What we need to get started is submissions, send us in
your text files. We accept technical information, philosophy on the
state of the scene today, articles on free speech and censorship we are
interested in all innovations of computer culture, although we are
mostly based on underground stuff. Send your articles in text format to
the e-mail address at the top.

<*> The Periodical is written in text format so as readable by any O/S
such as Unix, Windows, Mac etc. We'd like to thank fORCE the most for
designing the ascii logo and anyone who has sent us articles and/or
wished us luck. The staff's number one goal is to stay afloat, a tough
challenge which I accept head-on. If you don't think you would be able
to write an article then why not upload Up1-01.zip to your site? You
will be mentioned as an official distributor if you let us know and it
will help plug your web-site.

<*> As well as submissions we need more staff. If you would like your
own monthly column then just send us an article and if we think it's 
good (and you say that you'd be interested in writing more) then you
might just have earned you a regular spot in Up. The only thing is
we can't accept files on the warez scene or porn as our extensive range
does not cover these topics.

<*> Tell your friends!!! Tell you pals on mailing lists and IRC
channels about the Periodical. We post our existence to a few
newsgroups but it just isn't enough. We can't be everywhere at once
so advertise us to your greatest mates. If you were doing an e-zine
I'd help you out. 

<*> We'd like to thank any and all people who submitted to Issue 1 or
contributed in any way. It is understood that they are automatically
included as Shout Outs. Without continued support from the h/p
community we wouldn't have gotten Up off the ground. Anyway, on with
this issue...
