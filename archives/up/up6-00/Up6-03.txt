		  A Phreak's Guide to Net2Phone
                       By: The Mob Boss

	Net2Phone (www.net2phone.com) is an Internet telephone company, which was founded under IDT Inc. They provide good rates for international and domestic phone calls all placed over the Internet. Time is bought with a credit card right through their site or over the phone. Net2Phone is both half-duplex and full-duplex. At this time is runs on a Windows 95/98/NT platform. One of the most appealing things to hackers and phreakers is the free registration and calls to toll free numbers. You can register and download the software all without paying a dime and then use it to place calls to 800, 877, and 888 numbers, no questions asked. This allows phreaks from other parts of the world to access numbers native to the United States and it allows domestic hackers and phreakers the opportunity to make somewhat anonymous calls. When you make a call with Net2Phone the number will show as (212) 402-0000, a number in New York City. When you give that number a call you see its a "non working number", or so the computer voice will tell you. So this can be used for some very devious things if one was so inclined. Now as for some uses for this, you can use it for exchange scanning. With most telco's wising up to programs like Toneloc, scanning by hand is becoming the thing to do. Even then, it's somewhat risky, especially when dealing with toll free numbers. As we all know the reason toll free exchanges are so feared is because of the dreaded ANI that they are equipped with. With Net2Phone you can scan and mess with whatever you like with a fairly good piece of mind. It would be far better to attempt to get into a voice mail box through Net2Phone rather then your home line since they might notice your number keeps showing up on their bill and just give you a nice little call. Another thing that you can do with Net2Phone is make certain calls through the operator. Now this requires a little more thought because Net2Phone doesn't really want you to call other services to place your calls. For instance 1-800-Call-ATT is blocked and so is the beloved 1-800-Collect. So to get around this we must find numbers that aren't blocked. Now this is easier then you think. Here are some useful numbers I have found not to be blocked, for an AT&T operator call 1-800-Operator, for a 1-800-Collect operator call up 1-888-Collect, for Sprint service call up 1-888-One-Dime. I am sure there are plenty more as well so when these go dead some day just look for small companies who do collect service. From these numbers I have found you can readily do collect calls and third party billing calls. So far I haven't been able to make any operator assisted calls but with some social engineering I am sure it's possible. And the reason I think you may be able to eventually op divert is due to the fact your not calling from a payphone or anything. With some hardwork and patience it can be done. Now as for the setup of Net2Phone I have found they are not the biggest on security. Outside of the firewall I found some interesting things such as their 3Com Superstack II Switch Login at 198.4.75.6, I also found what appears to be routers at 206.20.53.30, 206.20.53.46, 206.20.53.62, 206.20.53.81. So it seems there operation runs through that Superstack II switch to some sort of standard telephony switching possibly, which would obvisouly be some sort of electronic switching. Another thing I have yet to mention is the fact that you can use calling cards that have toll free numbers with this service and even use the free calling card, Freeway, available at www.broadpoint.com. Net2phone is a interesting and rich little service and I hope all that read this will not attempt to rip them off (too much at least) but rather learn about the new dynamic field of internet telephone which seems to be advancing and expanding every day.
