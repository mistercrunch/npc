<HuSoft> Hi
<HuSoft> is there any exploit for FTP'S?
<walrus> yeah
<walrus> you can use an anonymous login to get the password file
<walrus> on some UNIX boxes
<HuSoft> I did that
<HuSoft> but, is shadowed.
<HuSoft> and I can't get the shadow passwd file
<nerd> spank it
<nerd> thats your only chance
<walrus> with a big ugly stick
<nerd> spank it true
<HuSoft> spank?
<nerd> yeah
<nerd> you never heard of the spank technique?
<nerd> you some kinda lamer?
<HuSoft> never man
<nerd> ??
<HuSoft> nope
<nerd> shit dood
<inxs> spanking is the ultimate in teqneek
<nerd> hells yeh
*** BL4Z3 has joined #hackphreak
<HuSoft> that's why I don't know that technique
<HuSoft> cause I have a lot of time out
<inxs> oh
<HuSoft> now Im here again
<nerd> heh oh well
<inxs> take a lot of time, especially the monkey spanking teqneek
<HuSoft> when I find text's about that?
<nerd> ohhh thats the ultimate in spank tecnoloG
<inxs> HuSoft, you think you can learn how to spank your monkey?
<HuSoft> I can learn whatever
*** BL4Z3 has quit IRC (Leaving_)
<inxs> cool
<nerd> I think theres even an rfC file on the spank teknique
<HuSoft> and where can I find it?
*** dork has quit IRC (quitting.c_)
<inxs> well, it's quite easy to find really
<HuSoft> yeah?
<nerd> go to www.lamer.com  I think it's there
<inxs> nerd, would you agree with that?
<nerd> yeah definately
<HuSoft> oh nerd
<nerd> it's there in there text section
<nerd> no it's a real site for learning shit
<HuSoft> ok
<nerd> yeh go there
<inxs> yeh, real shit
<nerd> click on there text file like
<nerd> like=link
<HuSoft> ok
<nerd> and look for rfc666
*** tofus has joined #hackphreak
<nerd> or it might have been rfc 420
<inxs> yeh, that sounds right, though i heard the nsa were going to classify the rfc
<tofus> fuck the nsa
<tofus> their wimps
<tofus> they're even

<HuSoft> hey nerd, there is all about MP3!
<nerd> hmmm
<tofus> aha
<tofus> the spanking teqneek
<nerd> yes

<tofus> ph33r my kungfu 5k1LL2
<nerd> maybe that wasnt the site
<inxs> specifically relating to monkey spanking, HuSoft is going to learn to spank the monkey
<nerd> yeah it complicated tho
<nerd> he needs an rfc for it
<tofus> that sucks, dude!
<nerd> yeah
<nerd> oh well
<nerd> I can't rerally remember the site
<nerd> maybe it was www.lamour.net 
<nerd>  or something........
<nerd> try shit like that
<walrus> or lamer.co.uk
<tofus> dudes, gotta hover...gotta catch a train
<walrus> surf.to/lamer
<HuSoft> I found it in other place nerd

*** SEPULTURA has joined #hackphreak
<inxs> or, you could try the search engine on antionline.com, search for monkey spanking and you should get plenty of hits, a few of the antionline people are real monkey spankers
<SEPULTURA> anyone know something about POP3?
<HuSoft> I found it on YAHOO
<nerd> yeah.....it's by far the best technique
*** helpmeplz has joined #hackphreak
<nerd> well read up man
<nerd> learn it well
<helpmeplz> http://www.medismk.net/cgi-bin/vreme.pl ->Can someone tell me what is this and how can I brake into this ?
<walrus> as in can we all hack it for you
<walrus> no
<inxs> walrus, you should message HuSoft about the technique he is learning, it may help you
<inxs> oops
<helpmeplz> http://www.medismk.net/html/login1.htm ->What about this can someone brake here ??
*** g_RaX has joined #hackphreak
<inxs> i ment to say helpmeplz, you should message HuSoft about the technique he is learning, it may help you
<walrus> thank you
<walrus> you are forgiven
<SEPULTURA> MOSSAD.ORG is workinh only on POP3 and HTTP anyone can help me to find backdoor? msg me

<dimak> hello
<dimak> huSoft I am here
<inxs> HuSoft is off spanking his monkey
<walrus> he's learning to. He's not quite mastered it
<inxs> true, he probably still hasn't quite come to grips with it yet
<AlphaVers> he's learning how to spank his monkey?
<AlphaVers> or did i miss something again?
<inxs> he will truly learn the value of in depth knowledge of the end knob and it's principal purpose
<dimak> can you help me with a problem?
<inxs> AlphaVers, no you got it right, he is learning to spank his monkey
<AlphaVers> cool
<dimak> I heed to understand IPv4 address and find out the exact location of e person, can anyone help me?
<inxs> dimak, ask HuSoft about monkey spanking
<dimak> I heed to understand IPv4 address and find out the exact location of e person, can anyone help me?
*** symbolik has joined #hackphreak
<symbolik> uNFuNFuNF
<inxs> dimak, you also need to learn about themonkey spanking teqneek
<symbolik> _i_nxs_,_ you got the log from that night?
<inxs> which nite?
<dimak> ?
<symbolik> the one we were fightin in here
<symbolik> think it was you
<symbolik> hehe
<inxs> i doubt it
<inxs> i mean i doubt i have the log
<dimak> can you help me with the problem?
<walrus> msg husoft about the spank technique
<inxs> dimak, i told you, message HuSoft and ask him how to spank the monkey
<walrus> the spank technique covers a wide range of areas
<symbolik> it's neat when people say they code and then they say things like this...

<symbolik> ya that too
<inxs> and i dont code

<inxs> no
<symbolik> dang
<dimak> I heed to understand IPv4 address and find out the exact location of e person, can anybody help me? please
<inxs> dimak, have you learned how to spank your monkey yet?
<walrus> the spank technique cobers IPv4 as well as password files
<walrus> covers even
<inxs> i think it also has a primer on ipv6 and possibly location teqneeks using ipv4
<walrus> its very versatile
<AlphaVers> wait, dimak doesn't know the spank technique yet?
<helpmeplz> http://www.medismk.net/html/login1.htm ->What about this can someone brake here it's linked to http://StNaum.medismk.net/cgi-bin/qqqq/login.cgi??
<inxs> true
<walrus> that's why its so complex
<inxs> AlphaVers, doesn't look like it
<AlphaVers> dude, that's basic knowledge
<AlphaVers> you won't get nowhere without knowing it
<inxs> helpmeplz, you would make a good monkey spanker, you also should learn the teqneek
<inxs> if only JP was here, i am sure he would teach these peasants how to spank the monkey
<inxs> JP is a true sensei of monkey psanking
<inxs> spanking
<dimak> Dear, what am I to do?
<AlphaVers> dimak, easy, learn how to spank
<dimak> where?
<AlphaVers> mail jp@antionline.com about it
<AlphaVers> he knows
<AlphaVers> thanx inxs
<inxs> hey, good idea
<walrus> yeah. He's a really good spanker
<inxs> in fact, i think that will work

<AlphaVers> you have to ask nice though, he doesn't like teaching
<AlphaVers> so if you don't ask him right, he won't reply or feed you some bullshit
<inxs> next one to repeat a question, who has not availed themselves the oppurtunity to learn monkey spanking from JP, gets banned

*** b00ze has joined #hackphreak
<dimak> ok I will mail him, but is it possible to know to decode IP right now?
<walrus> not without learning 'spank'
<HuSoft> hey people from #HACKPHREAK!!!!!!!
<HuSoft> RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
<HuSoft>    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
<HuSoft>    Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
<HuSoft>    Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
<HuSoft>    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
<HuSoft> heh ;)
<HuSoft> I found it
<AlphaVers> you need an ip decoder, which requires knowledge of the spank technique to use
<HuSoft> ok
<walrus> yeah. You can code spank programs in BASIC
<b00ze> hi ppl
<AlphaVers> in order to decode an ip you need to know the spank level of it
<dimak> damn, maybe some can help me to understand just one IP address, I need it promtly, I need to hfind one my friend
<AlphaVers> that's why you need to know how to spank
<nerd> right but spanking isn't for everyone.....
<AlphaVers> spanking makes the difference between hackers and lamers
<walrus> yeah. Most girls are crap at spanking
<nerd> some people just can't handle it's raw power
<dimak> guys, can you decode the IP for me?
<AlphaVers> sure, what is it?
<dimak> will it take much time?
<walrus> yeah. That's why it helps to write a spank program in BASIC
<AlphaVers> nah not really
<walrus> it makes it easier
<AlphaVers> dimak, what's the ip?
<walrus> yeah. Tell us the ip
<walrus> and we'll help you out a little
<nerd> spanking is much easier with basic......using tools to enhace the spank teqnique is the only way
<dimak> AlphVers, X-Originating-IP: [128.252.61.5]
<walrus> you see b00ze's ip was 202.163.254.105
<AlphaVers> that's spank level 8 ain't it?
<walrus> dimak: that has a spank level of 1 because the first digit is 1
<AlphaVers> this may take a while after all
<nerd> dood spank level8??
<walrus> oh hang on, the 3rd digit is 8
<walrus> oh yeah. Got a bit confused there
<walrus> sorry. SPANK LEVEL 8!!!
<AlphaVers> oh well
<walrus> fuck
<AlphaVers> lemme get my spanker
<walrus> b00ze would've been easier to hack 'cause it was only a level 2 spank
<walrus> 202.163.254.105 you see
<walrus> spank level 2
<walrus> but spank level 8!!!
<walrus> that's gonna be tricky
<AlphaVers> dimak, are you sure that's correct?
<AlphaVers> i can't spank the sequence out of it
<nerd> spank level 8 thats some 3331337 shiznit
<dimak> yes, i got from e-mail that was maild from Hotmail
<nerd> wow
<AlphaVers> hotmail? uhoh
<nerd> so your familiar with the spank protocol?
<AlphaVers> hotmail has it's own way of spanking
*** guji has joined #hackphreak
<AlphaVers> you'd need a hotmail decoder for it
<dimak> i got a message from hotmail, it has IP address in properties
<dimak> where I can get it?
*** Tr|cky^ has joined #hackphreak
<walrus> yeah. Spank level 8 ips never change
*** Tr|cky^ has left #hackphreak
*** guji has left #hackphreak
<walrus> and the hotmail spank level 8 is even more difficult
<AlphaVers> wait
<walrus> you need to do some pretty difficult BASIC coding to spank that one man
<AlphaVers> there it is
<nerd> now those hotmail admins know how to spank
<AlphaVers> think i got something here
<walrus> what is it
<walrus> I've never got a spank level 8 before
<AlphaVers> washington university in st louis
<nerd> yeah I've never actually encountered a spank level 8 either
<AlphaVers> or atleast, that's the last hop before the monkey puked
<nerd> ohhh dammit I hate premature termination
<AlphaVers> i assume they own the entire spank range
<walrus> The problem is that he probley bounced, 'cause you only get spank level 8 for companies and stuff
<AlphaVers> if they do, that's where it came from
<dimak> AV, How did you get that? the exact name of the location? I thoght it should have been geographical
<walrus> not home users
<AlphaVers> dimak, by spanking the monkey of course
<dimak> it gave you the university name?
*** Odyss3us has joined #hackphreak
<AlphaVers> yup
<AlphaVers> it looks like it came from somewhere on the east side of campus
<AlphaVers> not sure
<AlphaVers> could be south-east too
<nerd> well the monkey spank protocol is quite wily it can get kinda hairy if your not familiar with it's proper usage...I like to use standard spank
<AlphaVers> nerd, come on
<AlphaVers> standard spank sucks
<nerd> ok ok 
*** ratshat has joined #hackphreak
<nerd> call me old fasion
<dimak> I is greate. thank you very much, how can you tell me this, it is amazing, I hardly believe the ip can get such detailed info
<walrus> the thing is that hotmail spank is more secure
<AlphaVers> you won't even get an address with a standard spank on an arp
<nerd> oh yeah by far
<walrus> and the monkey that hotmail spank uses for level 8 spank is more prone to 'puking'
<dimak> AlphaVers, do you have a kind of database for IP codes?
<nerd> yeah correct that premature termination is a bitch
<AlphaVers> dimak, it's dynamicly created everytime i spank
<AlphaVers> if i spank you for instance, it would create a database with info on you
<dimak> where is the initial information from?
<ratshat> i forgot my password for a excel file anyone know a way around?
<AlphaVers> but unauthorized spanking is kinda illegal
<walrus> I'd have to say that theis guy probably bounced 'cause a level 8 spank is not usually seen with a home user. He must've gone through an organisation, or that could just be the hotmail spank security
<dimak> why illegal?
*** HuSoft has quit IRC (BrB..._)
*** [tefx] has joined #hackphreak
<AlphaVers> if  would spank a cia agent for instance
<AlphaVers> i'd be able to get all info on him i want
<AlphaVers> they don't like that
<walrus> but they use standard spank so what do they expect?
<AlphaVers> it's only legal on ip's in ranges below 200.
<[tefx]> hehe
<AlphaVers> it's like using hotmail
<AlphaVers> you know everyone can read your mail, but if they do you won't like it
<dimak> well, but you should know he is the agent, but you do not know. if you know I might gess you are the agent too, and the legal for you is not determined. :)
*** Odyss3us is now known as Ody|away
<dimak> AlphaVers, who sets the rules on spanking?
<walrus> the monkey of course
<AlphaVers> trust me, spanking on ip's above the 200. range is illegal for me
<[tefx]> hymm
<AlphaVers> dimak, nsa does
<walrus> the monkey sets the rules
<Ody|away> lmao
<AlphaVers> the monkey's with the nsa
<[tefx]> i think theres different ranges in th uk. not much though
<nerd> but I heard a spank session is hard to detect..........do you have to use some sort of spoofing method to have a truly successful spank?
<dimak> what is above 200?
<walrus> yeah. In the UK you can only spank up to level 4
<AlphaVers> ned yes, spank soofing
<AlphaVers> really hard to do though
<AlphaVers> nerd even
<nerd> so I have heard
<dimak> what is above 200?
<[tefx]> walrus. in scotland it goes up to 8, but in amsterdam, they let you smoke pot while you spank
<nerd> thats the critical zone
*** HuSoft has joined #hackphreak
<walrus> what about wales?
<AlphaVers> like you're ip: 212.48.192.150, that would be illegal
<[tefx]> hmm
<HuSoft> hi again people!
<AlphaVers> to spank
<walrus> I think spanking has been outlawed there
<[tefx]> as they have lega sheep spanking , i recon about a 6
<[tefx]> nah
<walrus> yeah. Sheep spanking is on its way out
<[tefx]> only sheep spanking is legal, none of this monkey crap
<walrus> hotmail spank is the new protocol
<AlphaVers> sheep spanking was used on arpanet
<[tefx]> SSP/IP
<AlphaVers> i think milnet still uses sheep spank
<dimak> AlphaVers, is it possible to prevent spanking of IP, for instance if I send e-mail and do not people to spank it?
<[tefx]> sheep spanking protocoll , intyercourse protocoll
<walrus> hotmail spank is fast becoming the global monkey spanking standard
<[tefx]> ugh
<AlphaVers> dimak, that would get the monkey pissed
<[tefx]> what about spanking penguins ?
<dimak> so it is possible, is it?
<nerd> I heard the aol spank was pretty 1337
<walrus> I didn't think penguin spanking had been introduced yet
<[tefx]> yeah, its a new nmut upgrade
<[tefx]> nut i mean
<AlphaVers> walrus, penguin spanking is still an experiment
<nerd> hmm...thats far out shit tho
<[tefx]> its in beta test
* AlphaVers hopes deamon spanking will be the next standard
<[tefx]> yeah,
<[tefx]> aint it daemon >?<
<AlphaVers> bsdi got pissed over that
<AlphaVers> so they made it deamon
<[tefx]> your telling me
<walrus> as far as I know the pp (penguin protocol) won't be introduced until IPv6 is introduced
<[tefx]> argh.
<[tefx]> oh, well, there still hope
<walrus> then it will become standard
<AlphaVers> we all know dsp (deamon spanking protocol) will kick pp's ass
<walrus> and the monkey spanking and hotmail spanking will bothe be fazed out
<[tefx]> apart from the spanking protocolls there the feet sub set : then theres ftp : foot tapping ptotocoll, http : hyper toe tapping protocoll, 
<nerd> yeh no shit
<[tefx]> i still think pengiun still has a chance
<[tefx]> hmm.
<[tefx]> i guess we'll just have to wait and see
<walrus> dimak: do you still want to know how to avoid spanking?
<[tefx]> yeah. avoid  the leather whip protocoll LWP
<dimak> yes
<AlphaVers> dimak, log that, jp won't tell you how to avoid it
<walrus> right. Go on yahoo, and search for info on anti spanking techniques
<[tefx]> heh
<walrus> yahoo is the best one for this
<[tefx]> and put in NO porn in the search as well
<[tefx]> i prefer altavista
<walrus> 'cause some twisted people will associate it with sex
<[tefx]> i though yahoo removed the spanking category ?
<AlphaVers> just be sure you don't get yahoo spanking, that hasn't been used since '91
<AlphaVers> tefx, the put it back
<AlphaVers> too much compliants
<walrus> popular demand
<[tefx]> good.
<walrus> anyway
<walrus> ...
<[tefx]> not suprised
<[tefx]> i was pissedd of when it left
<walrus> you need to find a page that gives you an anti spank script
<AlphaVers> jp threatened to sue them if they didn'tput it back
<walrus> and you send your email through the script
<walrus> and then nobody can spank your ip
<[tefx]> i rmeber when hotmail spanking and mircosoft spanking were totally different, bemore the intercourse, now its passport spanking
<walrus> 'cause its hidden
<AlphaVers> dimak, what os are you on?
<nerd> right to smite a spank you must cause the incoming spank packet to be intercepted by some medium .........it should kinda absorb the spank packet
<walrus> do you want to aviod hotmail spank, or regular spank?
<dimak> w95
<AlphaVers> damn
<AlphaVers> if you were on bsd i'd have one for you
<[tefx]> uh-oh
<[tefx]> theres but spanking youve got to avoid aswell
<AlphaVers> i wrote one a while ago
<AlphaVers> working to get it ready for pp
<AlphaVers> and dsp
<nerd> but trying to protect yourself from everytype of spank is ludicrous
<[tefx]> i had a spanking setector, but it needed a few other files, 
<walrus> an anti-hotmail spank script for BSD? Did you write that in BASIC?
<dimak> alpha, what is bsd?
<AlphaVers> walrus, yeah
<[tefx]> when you got spanked on win95, it would say Invalid page fault
<AlphaVers> gbase
<dimak> hever heard
<[tefx]> a general protection fault, is a time delayed spank
<AlphaVers> yeah
<walrus> of course newer releases of Win 98 has been patched against hotmail spanks above level 5
<AlphaVers> every time you get one you got spanked
<[tefx]> quite nasty
<walrus> Does anybody know about Win NT spanking?
<AlphaVers> walrus, it'll crash above level 7
<nerd> thats a sensitive area
<walrus> I've not had time to get any info on spaking in NT
<AlphaVers> been fixed in service pack 5 i think
<walrus> does it depend on what SP (spank pack) you've got
<[tefx]> heh there l0pht spank
<[tefx]> dont forget that
<nerd> no I think service pack five still had some errors handling the level 8 spank
<AlphaVers> wlarus, yeah, sp 3 should do the trick
<walrus> poeple oftenget service packs and spank packs confused
<AlphaVers> be carefull though, your spank black will stop working
<walrus> You need to modify your registry for spank pack 4 to work don't you?
<nerd> shit of course what was I thinking......
<AlphaVers> yeah
<AlphaVers> add an extra spank key
<nerd> yeah I wrote a BASIC script for that 
<AlphaVers> nerd, cool
<[tefx]> what about pgp spanking
<walrus> but some spank packets can still get around that one. For istance the beta penguin spanks can already get through that
<AlphaVers> tefx, don't go there man
<AlphaVers> you never know who's listening in here
<AlphaVers> shit man why the fuck did you mention that?
<walrus> It'd fall on deaf ears
<AlphaVers> you know how the gov feels about pgp spanking
<[tefx]> ah true
<walrus> mostof the lamerz in here don't even know the difference between a sheep spank and a standard monkey spank
<nerd> I don't think we should talk about the pgp spank
<AlphaVers> dimak, forget about pgp spanking
<nerd> I am feeling uncomfortable
<[tefx]> we could always talk about the clipper spanking controversy
<AlphaVers> tefx, don't
<walrus> I've not heard about that one
<[tefx]> oh
<AlphaVers> i got raided for telling ppl about that
<[tefx]> ill lay off the cryto spanking
<walrus> dimak: you found an antispank script yet?
<AlphaVers> they took my hardware spank block
<nerd> shit man
<dimak> still trying on yahoo
<[tefx]> oh god.
<AlphaVers> took me 2 years to build that thing
<[tefx]> thank god its not so bad here in the uk
<AlphaVers> correct parts are very hard to find
<walrus> I'm using a software block to stop hotmail spanks above level 4, 'cause hotmail spank is the most common one
<[tefx]> as long as they dont take my spanking board
<AlphaVers> tefx, if you don't tell anyone you have it, you're ok
<[tefx]> spanking board, what spanking board ;)
<walrus> I find that a software block can absorb most of the spank packets caused by 'puking'
<dimak> i found textbook on http://lib.daemon.am/Books/Hackers_Guide/ch26/ch26.htm
<[tefx]> no
<[tefx]> thats nsa.
<[tefx]> its the nsa
<walrus> yeah. But the monkey is in the NSA remember
<[tefx]> its instructions on how to let them spank you
<walrus> AV was saying earlier
<walrus> stay away from that
<walrus> it could be a 'spank trojan'
<nerd> ohhh nasty
<walrus> like monkey's orifice
<AlphaVers> dimak, you should get a spank scanner too
<nerd> right the monkeys orifice is like a huge hole man......fucking insanity
<[tefx]> then thers pmonkey orifice 2k
<walrus> its not that great though
<AlphaVers> brb
<[tefx]> then thers hotmail-bus
<AlphaVers> gotta set up some phone spanking stuff
<nerd> soanking the phonelines is some next level shit
<nerd> whoa
<nerd> spanking

[12:34] <AlphaVers> if you spank a nokia 6110 it'll give you it's card
[12:35] <[tefx]> true
[12:35] <[tefx]> then theres chocking techniques.
[12:35] <[tefx]> chocking the chicken often works
[12:35] <dimak> it gives out shit
[12:35] <nerd> I find the choke protocol very useful
[12:35] <[tefx]> or the bash
[12:35] <[tefx]> bash:~>bishop
[12:35] <[tefx]> bashing bishop
[12:35] <AlphaVers> don't teach him how to choke man
[12:36] <nerd> it allowss better control of the whole spank
[12:36] <nerd> ok ok 
[12:36] <[tefx]> acces found, level 4, using monkey.... ok
[12:36] <AlphaVers> he ain't ready
[12:36] <[tefx]> true
[12:36] <AlphaVers> let him fogure out the simple monkey first
[12:36] <[tefx]> heh
[12:36] <[tefx]> that can take years
[12:36] <AlphaVers> figure even
[12:36] <AlphaVers> tefx, true
[12:37] <[tefx]> or minutes
[12:37] <nerd> right.....he has to start with the monkey spank or he'll go nowhere fast
[12:37] <AlphaVers> took me over a year to get the monkey too
[12:37] <[tefx]> if you can do seemore more also know as C++
[12:37] <[tefx]> it takes minutes
[12:37] <dimak> ok, bye all, thank AlphaVers very much for help
[12:37] <nerd> yeah but once you have the monkey the rest is pretty much natural
[12:37] <[tefx]> yeah
[12:38] <AlphaVers> you're welcome
[12:38] <dimak> bye

[12:40] <[tefx]> who else wnats to know about spanking ?
[12:42] <nerd> well I am back....
[12:42] <nerd> that spanking method was quite impressive 
[12:42] <nerd> I think it was written in hypercard
[12:42] <AlphaVers> partially
[12:43] <[tefx]> heh, mine was done in flash
[12:43] <AlphaVers> some was written in cobol as well
[12:43] <nerd> wow
[12:43] <AlphaVers> depends on the os
[12:43] *** Joins: d5 (~d5@wind.angen.net)
[12:43] <nerd> I heard of these hypercard spanks so I had to try it out.....
[12:44] <d5>  hello
[12:44] <nerd> they terminate twice as fast as your standard spank
[12:44] <nerd> I like to reffer to it as the hyperspank
[12:45] *** Quits: d5 (spank-lined)
[12:45] <AlphaVers> cool
[12:45] <[tefx]> uh oh
[12:45] <[tefx]> somebody tried a spank
[12:45] <nerd> NO WAY
[12:45] <[tefx]> [12:45] *** Quits: d5 (spank-lined)
