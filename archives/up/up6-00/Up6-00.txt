			:..::..Introduction.::..:

<*> As you can see, Sadly Cyborg has left the UP staff, and I 
(CrossFire) have replaced him as editor. Cyborg left because 
of his upcoming exams (good luck btw m8), his new part time
job (Work - Aargh), and the removal of the page from Ecad.org.

Also Sadly HitMan has left the staff too, I was actually expecting
that because HitMan and Cyborg are friends irl, and he doesn't have
time for the mag any more.

Still, we have a new staff member this month, Walrus (Or Ergophobe 
as you may know him) will now be doing some reviews of up and coming 
producers. Over the next couple of issues you will notice a change
in the topics covered in Up, we will still be doing the same Hack 
/ Phreak / General Underground Stuff, but the mag will start to 
showcase more stuff to do with The Demoscene, and The Tracker Scene,
I also Hope that the mag will have a lot more technical articles.

We Have Also formed an alliance with APT, Swat and Prick - Find Out
More On The Krash Website (http://surf.to/krash).

Some Of These Articles Were Included without the permission of the
authors - this is mostly Because I simply couldn't contact them,
most likely because they include no contact details in the files. All 
the files in Up6 Are Top Quality (Well I think so) - No Crap Will go 
into this mag (except some irc logs :)

<*> Thanks To Everyone who contributed to Up6. Most Shouts are at the bottom.
    If I Forget you then Sorry - I'm a forgetful person generally :)
