Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eye eye kids.

Welcome to my file on beige boxing in a lift. Yep, believe it or not, 
you can beige from inside a lift car and I'm gonna tell ya what I know.

First Off
~~~~~~~~~

Well first off, your gonna have to find a lift with an emergency phone
(you can get the picture already :>). The lifts I recommend are shop
lifts that only have a few floors cause they are usually lame enough to
have a phone and not an intercom and sometimes, if they're pure stupid,
they have a sticker stuck in the phone box telling you to ring security
on ext. xxxx or dial 999 in the case of an emergency!! Lifts like these
are asking for abuse. You will also find this in office blocks and
other large buildings but they are harder to get into and are more
likely to be full of pricks in suites. Obviously dinner times are the
worst so avoid them like the plague if you're going into larger
buildings.

Caution: Just a word of warning, the stainless door to the emergency
phone sometimes has an auto alarm and can be *real* loud. This only
happens about 1% of the time but just be warned. If you're real unlucky
you can get a phone door that's linked into the safety circuit as well
as alarmed. This means that the lift will suddenly stop and an alarm
will sound if you open the phone door. However, this is very rare and
I've only come across it once on an old express lift. The lift will run
once the phone door is closed over again but the alarm needs resetting
up in the motor room SO RUN LIKE FUCK or you will be hammered cause a
qualified lift engineer needs to be called to go into the motor room
and reset the alarm (pretty pricey).

Tricks of the Trade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lifts in shops are mainly for moving stock so they are used pretty
often. I find that you are best to keep moving between the ground floor
and the top floor but never stopping at the shop floor. If you're in
the car, it can still be called to all the floors by people waiting
there. This can't really be avoided unless you have a special key. But
here's an excuse you can use if your in the lift and it starts to go up
to the stock room, or somewhere you're not supposed to be:

(The person gives you a funny look or makes a comment)

You say: Tut, I pressed both buttons didn't I? I'm just too impatient.

(Then laugh lightly)

This works wonders cause it means that if someone puts a call in on the
floor above and you want to go down put press both landing buttons, you
get in and press ground but the lift will collect the person above
first cause you pressed both buttons. I hope that made sense :>. But,
if you're sat at a floor and someone wants the lift, the doors are
gonna open with no warning and you're gonna be stood there with the
phone in your hand. Hmmm, nasty. If that happens, just say "Fuck me, I
thought I was stuck, I was just about to call for help". And if you're
asked what happened, say "The button lit up but went out as I took my
finger off".

MAKE SURE THAT THE BUTTONS LITUP IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!

If you've managed to get into a large building, most lifts are paired.
Just hop into one of them and get yourself stuck making sure you can
get yourself unstuck. Stay stuck for about 5 or 10 minutes then take
the lift for a mooch so it looks like its still working. When you've
had your fun, jump out and, go down to ground in the other lift and
walk out (a little paranoia never hurt anyone).

Remotely does it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a nice little way to use the line in the lift from outside the
building in the comfort of your car or whatever. Just go to a HAM Radio
Fair and pick up a cordless phone for about a 10 spot and use terminal
block to connect it into the cable. If you want it to last longer than
a couple of weeks, get a sheet of stainless and make a false back if
the box is big enough. Hide your phone behind the false back and screw
the emergency phone to the false back. If you're using an old cordless,
to power packs supplies it 8V AC~ but you can power it with the battery
backup or a 9V battery where the power pack goes. This just means that
you can't charge the handset cause I think it needs an AC current to do
this. Your gonna have to cut the charge unit out of the phone anyway so
you can charge the handset up or find out the rating of the handset
battery and make a transformer for your car. Then get an acoustic
coupler and use it for net access :)  There's no limit to what you can
do except the battery life of the base unit so have fun and play safely
kids :)
