                             The Introduction

I have chosen portsurfing as my next topic of discussion because I feel
that it is a fairly easy, but possibly rewarding skill that takes
advantage of the individual's perception, and imagination. It (in it's
basic, un-tooled) form requires no programs that you don't already have
on your machine (be it Unix or Windows).

There are some key concepts you have to understand for this text to
make any sense to you. Well as much sense as a text by me can make :).
They are things you will probably have heard of before but some may
not, so have a skim, and if you recognise them skip to the next part.

        Port (Virtual) - A software port that is used for a specific
                         purpose. A daemon runs on this port, offering
                         services to any user who drops by.

        Daemon         - A piece of software which manipulates TCP/IP
                         and offers a particular service to the user of
                         the port it's designed to run on.

        TCP/IP         - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
                         Protocol. (See my next text for details) 

                            Main Text

There are almost an infinite amount of ports available, but some are
more well known than others. For example, when contacting a web page
your browser contacts port 80 of the remote computer, and port 21 when
looking for an FTP host. 

You do not need to connect to a specific port, when the client already
has a preset port:

Netscape Navigator -> Web Page
WS_FTP             -> FTP Host

Your telnet client can also connect to these, and any other, ports,
even if they are not intended to. This is not illegal, and provides you
with a whole new perspective of the computer you are connected to.

These ports can be found using a program like SATAN or SAINT for Unix
and Linux. These programs check for open ports and exploitable daemons
from there onwards.

But as I professed that this would be a text where I didn't expect you
to have any other programs than the ones already on your machine. I
will show how this can be done manually. 

Now you select your target host (www.fubar.com will be used for
demonstration purposes). 

A port extremely well known for crackers is Port 79 ( finger port).
This port allows you to find out information on users on the system.
Early versions of a finger program are extremely easy to crash, and
also have a tendancy to either run from root, or make calls to root. 
(I'm assuming you know what root is). So in theory, if this program
just happened to crash while you were sitting there, you may just
happen to find yourself lying on root. I'm not saying that you should
do this, in fact I'm saying you shouldn't because its against the law.

To see if your target host www.fubar.com had the finger port enabled
you would use the command from your Unix shell or DOS prompt:

telnet www.fubar.com 79 

Hopefully you would get the message: 

Connected to www.fubar.com 

>From here, you would try and coax the daemon into telling you how it
takes it (input that is).

You would do this by typing: 

man  - (the man command on UNIX gives you online help for a program
?    - (trying to get the machine to show you what commands it takes) 
help - (self explanatory) 

One of these should work. If they don't then try other keywords that
come to mind, and see what kind of response you get, this is where you
are left to your own initiative. 

You could also telnet to port 15, which shows all the network
connections made by your host. If you think about it, you can probably
see how port surfing leads on to hundreds of possible break ins. Lots
of daemons have buggy software, and smaller servers may run these as a
money saving option. You can see what port software is exploitable from
www.rootshell.com, but you should see if you can find out information
on the software running. For instance if you saw that www.fubar.com was
running ushttp v1.0 (fictitious) on their web port.

You would go to www.infoseek.com and do a search for 'ushttp://'. From
here you could have a look at the software's page, and see how
professional it looked, how much it cost etc. All this should give you
a clearer picture about the system you are hacking, and knowledge of
the system you are hacking is vitally important. You should see how the
software is made up, and how it could possibly be manipulated to allow
you into the host. 

Please try to refrain from crashing the port to leave you on root
because this is considered cracking, and to me it is too 'script
kiddie' ish to be regarded as hacking. 

Hopefully with a little bit of thought you can see how you can expand
from this information, to match the system you are hacking. Dodgy
daemons and interesting ports are very popular ways of gaining access
on a machine. Port surfing is a very good way of achieving lots through
a simple technique. 

List of common or standard ports:

Port number     Service

7               echo

9               discard

11              systat

13              daytime

15              netstat

19              chargen

21              ftp

23              telnet

25              smtp

37              time

39              rlp

43              whois

53              domain

70              gopher

79              finger

80              http

110             pop

119             nntp

443             shttp

512             biff

513             rlogin
                who

514             shell
                syslog

520             route

There are more but these are the most common ones. Remember:

Get onto your computer, and call upon your telnet program. To connect
give the command:

telnet <hostname> <port number>

When you get a response, it's all down to you from there on in.
