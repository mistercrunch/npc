<*>     	      Windoze 95/98 Security Holes
                     +----------------------------+

Most schools and businesses are using Windows 95/98 yet most texts 
concentrate on obscure operating systems so here is an insight on how
to hack the O/S from hell! Some of this stuff is aimed at newbies so
don't flame me, you never know, you might just learn something!

The major way to gain access to areas your not to (passwords still
apply) is to use the "common dialogue box open/save dialogue" or in
English, the box where you save or open your work in nearly all
programs.  This dialogue box includes a box for you too enter the
document path, by enter the name/address of what you want to access the
files section will normally display what you want, bypassing Windoze
security. An example to this it to get to network computers by typing
"\\server" will give you a list of the shared folders on the computer
called "server". By using this method you can use the top pull down box
to work your way up the network tree to a full list of machines.

Another use can be to gain access to drives which you have normally
been banned, since it is hard to set up read and write access to local
drives with Windoze, this can prove invaluable. By typing "c:\*.*" you
can gain access to the local drive even if the sysadmins don't want
you. Similar tricks can be achieved with Netscape Navigator and
Internet Explorer.

Microsoft Word is a great hacking tool and yet it's badly set-up on
school networks all over the world. The major problem with Word is that
it's too powerful and includes it's own programming language. By using
this you can run any program on the network such as Explorer, Registry
Editors etc. To use this with Word 95 simply go to the "Tools" menu and
choose "Macro" from here just type a new name and press enter. This
will through you into Word Basic, now all you need to do is the type
between the "Sub MAIN" and "End Sub" lines 

shell "c:\windows\explorer"

Clicking on the play button will start up Windoze explorer for all your
hacking needs.

The real fun with good old macros is that they occasional bypass the
Windoze security settings, allowing you to run Policy Editor even if
you are not allowed to run it normally. So you can then modify your
settings to give you access to Registry Editing Programs and then shell
Regedit the same way.

By deleting the appwiz.cpl files it's possible to stop the create
shortcut wizard, if this happens then the .lnk file is still created,
simple right click it and choose properties to modify the shortcut to
point to your favourite executable/drive. If this doesn't work then
create a new file (in away way you see fit) and rename the file from
.??? to .lnk and then choose properties.

Hitting Control + Esc at a normal login screen on Win 95 will bring up
Task Manager, from here you can run explorer to bring you a desktop or
any other executable fun. This can (and is on RM networks) prevented by
adding

taskman.exe=<restricted>

to the [boot] section in system.ini.

It's often easy to access forbidden programs by right clicking the
desktop (and other places) and choosing "New" and then the file
associated with your program, it'll only run certain programs but it's
a nice way to get to NotePad etc. quickly.

By browsing though a Common Dialog Box (see above) you can select
executables and (assuming that QuickView is installed) choose QuickView
from the right click menu, from here choose the icon in the top left of
the QuickView window to launch the program.

If Windows 95 has IE4 or Windows 98 (with IE4 built in) it is normally
possible to create new toolbars. Right click the start bar, choose
Toolbars and choose New Toolbar. From here you can enter the hidden
drive letters and get a full directory listing on the start bar.

It's almost impossible to remove the Help option from the start menu,
open it up and do a search for "Click here" which will bring up a list
of help files which provide a button that'll let you launch certain
programs.

Hitting F8 when Windows say "Starting Windows 9X" (or simply after the
BIOS appears to be finishing off) will bring you a boot menu. From here
you can choose Command Prompt and Safe Mode amongst other such goodies.
If this doesn't work then modify the file "c:\msdos.sys". Within this
file is the setting which disables the "Starting Windows 9X" option
menu, modify the "BOOTKEYS=0" line to read "BOOTKEYS=1" to reap the 
benefits of this hole.

Running the group-converter program (c:\windows\grpconv.exe) brings
back the shutdown command on the start bar. This program can also be
used to create start menu items from the included .grp files in the
c:\windows\ directory, just run the .grp files or on some machines, run
the grpconv for all of them.

Windows stores nearly all passwords within a single file which is
normally the called "c:\windows\USERNAME.pwl" although encrypted all is
not lost. The encryption uses the username to encrypt the password. A
common way into the system is to delete the user's password list and
then login as the user where Windows will prompt you for a new
password. If you rename this file instead of removing it and then login
as the user the same effect will take place. Once in, you can rename
the password list back and now use all of the user's stored passwords.
This can prove useful on a Windows 95 network where all folder
passwords that are chosen to be stored are kept in the password list.

As a result of this, you can rename the admin PWL and then rename it
back to gain access to folders which would normally be password 
protected, you can also remotely administer computers and in fact do
anything assuming that the lazy sysadmin choose to save the password.

Using old Windows programs can get through restrictions set up with
policy editor, since they don't use the rundll32 APIs (I think that's
correct) they don't have hidden drives etc. Try fileman.exe and
progman.exe for examples of this.

Windows, like nearly all O/Ses, use Shells, the usual one is
explorer.exe which can't be removed but Microsoft saw fit to use the
one exe as the shell and the file-explorer, duh! Other shells include
Internet Browsers, these don't follow the Windows drive restrictions
etc. since they can run independently (usually because they're designed
to run on more than one platform).

If you're having problems getting into restricted areas of the desktops
then try creating folders names XXXX.{NNNN-NNNN} where XXXX is the
folder name and NNNN is the numbers, by using the below list this will
get you access to some areas of interest:

E.g. Printers.{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}

{208D2C60-3AEA-1069-A2D7-08002B30309D} - Network Neighborhood
{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D} - Printers - works
{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D} - My Computer
{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D} - Control Panel - works
{3DC7A020-0ACD-11CF-A9BB-00AA004AE837} - Internet - sweet!!
{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E} - Recycle Bin - works
{85BBD920-42A0-1069-A2E4-08002B30309D} - Brief Case - works
{871C5380-42A0-1069-A2EA-08002B30309D} - Internet Explorer - a link
{a4d92740-67cd-11cf-96f2-00aa00a11dd9} - DUN - Doesn't work
{D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF} - Task Scheduler

We've seen how we can bypass drives restrictions through the common
dialog box but similar can be done with explorer on some early
versions of Windows, take a peek in the tools menu and see if there's a
go... option, if so simply type in the drive and away you go, explorer
even seems to unhide the drive for the rest of the session!

Instead of pressing cancel at the login screen why not try
CTRL+ALT+Break, ALT+F4 or CTRL+ALT+Scroll Lock which also does the same
thing.

If the FIND command is needed there's no need to start hacking your way
into the admin account, just hit CONTROL + ESC (to bring up the start
menu) ESC (to hide it again) F3 (to bring up the find dialog) now that
was hard wasn't it!
