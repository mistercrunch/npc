Viruses:
-=-=-=-=

I for one can start by saying that most of us have come across a virus
at some stage in their life. It may have been yours or your mates but
it still means that you know what I am talking about. When I was about
seven or eight years old I came across my very first virus 'RIPPER'
and this by no means was a joke. It completely messed up my life by
infecting my disks and destroying my programs. It was a pain in the
ass. But since the day after that experience I have now protected
myself and I have intercepted such viruses as 'RAPE' and 'MESSIAH' etc.
The list is endless but basically this might clear up some of those
so-called newbie questions or just simply a nice little file for your
collection.

By far the most common method of transmission for viruses has been the 
floppy disk (90% of all virii have been transmitted by a floppy). In
order to stop any infection companies such as McAfee (now called
Network Associates) have brought out virus protection but because of
there being 13 new viruses discovered every day all of the protectors
lose the effect. The worst thing about the protectors is that as they
are a needed program, they consume memory which in turn will decrease
the power of your machine. This is a big piss-up if you consider that
they are not even guaranteed to find the fucker. With that in mind many
people disable the protector/scanner which leaves them wide open for 
the pray of 'abusive crackers'.

A problem that has come up is that when converting your drive to FAT32
with Windows 98 the conversion changes your partition table and your
boot record. As these are just a couple of things that the scanner
looks out for and tries to prevent it causes a very big upset with the
scanner and the scanner will take none of the grief Windows 98 tries to
put it through and starts putting up all sorts of blocks. When you
disable the scanner to install Windows 98 and when it is installed you
make the program active again it will then prompt you if you want the
scanner to fix 'corrupted' drive. Which in these cases will overwrite
the old table onto the new and cause chain reactions on most of the
programs on your computer. To put it in plain English "Do not permit
the change of overwriting the table". 

BIOS Viruses:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Motherboards frequently store the BIOS in a type of memory known as 
flash memory. This is EE-ROM, or Electrically Erasable Read Only
Memory. Circuitry on the motherboard can erase the content of the BIOS
and then reprogram it. Motherboard manufacturers use this technique so
that it's possible to upgrade the BIOS easily, with out having to open
the case and replace the ROM (Read Only Memory) chip.

However there is a small part of the BIOS that is protected against 
accidental erasure. This is known as the boot block and it's their in
case anything goes wrong with the procedure to reprogram the CMOS, you 
would end up with an unbootable machine. So, the boot block contains 
enough code to allow a new BIOS to be loaded and programmed from a 
floppy disk or other source.

Clearly, the potential danger is a virus could attach itself to the
BIOS itself - by reprogramming the flash memory - or simply erase the
BIOS and thrash your system. Unless you have the special floppy disk at
hand with new BIOS code that you can load from the boot block, your
system would be as fucked as a dodo.

However reprogramming the BIOS flash memory is not as straight forward.
There are two techniques that a virus author could use to achieve this.
If the author knows the hardware design of the motherboard, then the
virus can include the specific instructions to erase and reprogram the
flash. Alternatively, if the BIOS itself contains the code to erase the
Flash - and some do - then the virus can be written to call these BIOS
routines.

Although this may vary from computer to computer it is based on an 
average so don't blame me if it's not down to the decimal point. 

Hoaxes:
-=-=-=-

Almost as bad as viruses themselves, in terms of the wasted time, 
bandwidth and hard disk space that they cause, are virus hoaxes. These 
have been circulating ever since e-mail was invented and before that
on bulletin boards. They are cleverly designed to grab your attention
with a warning of a virus spread by e-mail that can cause severe
catastrophe. Such dire happenings as erased files, corrupt hard disks,
dying pets and toilet seats being left up are frequently cited.

Gullible readers are then further ensnared by an attempt to give the
warning authenticity, by quoting an authority that the reader might 
believe, such as Norton or Microsoft. Finally, public spirited
recipients are conned by an appeal to spread the warning to prevent
your closest friends and family from being infected.

To give a example of a typical virus hoax message: "There is a computer
virus that is being sent over the Internet". So basically if you see a
newsgroup message saying "A Moment of Silence", don't read the message,
delete it immediately. As this type of file could be like some viruses
that completely rewrite your hard disk, sending everything on it to
hell. This would only work if the sender posted in HTML and included
some hostile Java bug. So if you really want a piece of advice tell
your mates about this orally not through e-mail as that way they might
think it's one of these viruses. Look out for one of the common ones
such as 'GOOD TIMES' which has being circulating for several years now.
