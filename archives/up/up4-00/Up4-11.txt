Introduction:
-------------

Want to hear about the flaw I discovered? When I was installing Windows
98 on my computer the other week I noticed a little flaw. So basically
here's how it's done.

First of all I got the CD off a mate that got it with his brand new
computer and a big problem was that the dumbass forgot to bring over
the manual containing the 25 digit code that you need to register
Windows 98. The guy also lived too far away to go and get it so I had
to leave my machine on whilst I awaited a phone call with the code. But
after a long time the guy did not call and I was getting very fed up
with my machine being on.

<*>--------------------------How It's Done--------------------------<*>

So I clicked not to accept the license agreement, this then sent me
crashing out of the install program and into DOS. It then struck me
that it asked me for the 25 digit code after it had copied the files
onto my hard disk, meaning that there must be some sort of Win32 file
system copied onto my computer.

Another thought also struck me, it was the notion that Windows 95 put
up the prompt below:

*******<Screen>*******

Starting Windows 95...

*******<Screen>*******

When this prompt came up you could hit F8 (or sometimes F5) and it
would bring up a boot menu with several options such as:

       **************************SCREEN*************************
       *                                                       *
       *  Microsoft Windows 95 Startup Menu                    *

       *  8. Previous version of MS-DOS                        *
       *                                                       *
       *  Enter a choice: ?                                    *
       *                                                       *
       *                                                       *
       *                                                       *
       *                                                       *
       *                                                       *
       *                                                       *
       *  F5=Safe mode  Shift+F5=Command prompt                *
       *                                                       *
       **************************SCREEN*************************

So I thought just maybe these would be in Windows 98 as well. However
there was a technical hitch, Windows 98 did not bring up a "Starting
Windows 98..." so it basically meant that I would have to time the
pressing of the F8 key with the Starting Windows 98 bitmap screen...
and hey presto a boot menu did come up:

       **************************SCREEN*************************
       *                                                       *
       *  Microsoft Windows 95 Startup Menu                    *

       *                                                       *
       *  1. Normal                                            *

       *                                                       *

(Not really much difference!)

It gave me the option I needed Safe Mode eventually I selected this
and Windows amazingly went slowly into configuring the system and then
onto Safe Mode.

<*>----------------------------Next Up------------------------------<*>

So what do you do next? I hear you ask.

Click Start Menu|Run and type "REGEDIT" to bring up the registry editor
and click on Hkey_Local_Machine and then onto:

SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/WINDOWS/CURRENT VERSION

Now you will see some files here and there but the ones you need to
edit are:

ProductID
RegisteredOrganization
RegisteredOwner

**********CAUTION**********

This can easily scramble
your machine so be careful.

***************************

Double click on each one (one at a time) and change the name of the
Registered Owner and Organization to whatever you want. This will do
nothing if incorrectly done as its only a name. Now for the tricky bit,
just simply change the Product ID to any 25 digit code such as:


*****************************
12345-67891-23456-78912-34567
*****************************

You can also use a made-up number but just make sure it has the gaps
and is just 25 digits and no more. Now click OK to confirm that this is
correct. From here you just simply shutdown Windows the correct way 
through the Start Menu and reboot. Windows will then go back into the
setup program and continue the installation, all that we have done is
told the computer that Windows 98 has already been registered so then
it will skip the 25 digit code step and continue from the next 
step that is in line.   

<*>--------------------------Conclusion-----------------------------<*>

So Bill Gates what happened to your big ass business? Could you not
just make a good operating system with all of that money that you have,
or are you just a miser!! Cause the house that Bill built has crumbled
to it's foundation!!

This may be useful as I have done it and there is no reason why you
shouldn't try it with any other programs or just simply use it with
Windows 98. Send this file to your mates as it will come in useful for
future reference.

(Please note the Windows 9x screens are not set to the same size!)
