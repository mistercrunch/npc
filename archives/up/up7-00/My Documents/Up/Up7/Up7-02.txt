Tracking corner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hopefully this will turn into a regular feature as a kind of forum for general information/rants and raves about tracking.

The basic theme I'm going to be exploring this month is the idea of realism within tracked music.

Up until the advent of computers, musicians have been very limited in what they can do with their music. Simple things such as having only two arms have greatly influenced the way that instruments and consequently music have been structured. But all that has changed. Using a tracker, we can now have things which were never possible before such as snare fills and hihats at the same time, or playing 3 notes simultaneously on a flute. This has dramatically shaped the music of our time. Many of the sounds which are used in music today, particularly trance, are only possible because of synthesisers and the sounds and effects which these can create. The reason that we have music such as hardcore, techno and drum 'n' bass is because we can. Music such as this is very technology driven, and advances in the technology which is available are being taken advantage of all the time.

However this is not always a good thing. The classic example is the fact that timestretching samples is now incredibly easy has probably lead to the huge increase in the number of ripoffs being released at the moment in the hardcore scene. Less obvious is the fact that people often forget that these limitations have been lifted. When tracking a piece of techno or hardcore, just about anything goes in terms of physical limitations of your performers. The only thing you need to worry about is a nice DJ friendly intro and outro.

However when tracking a piece of heavy metal, you've got to remember that your drummer can not play 2 bassdrums and pedal a hi-hat at the same time because he doesn't have three legs. In this respect, you need to think very carefully about the way that you use a tracker. Even down to researching the range of notes that certain instruments can play. For example, piccolo's simply do not play low notes.

There is an additional aspect to the idea of physical limitation, which is the idea of speed. You have to think about exactly how fast it is possible for a person to play. A piece at 350bpm may work fine in a tracker, but when you give it to real musicians to play, its simply not going to work.

Finally it is important to consider what variety of the instrument is most appropriate. For most general saxophone parts, alto or tenor is fine, but for those higher notes, soprano is more effective, and for the really low bass parts, a baritone sax is better.

To add extra touches of realism, it is worth thinking about how the piece would actually be played. A pianist will not strike each key with exactly the same velocity every time, there will be slight variations in volume. It is also rare that a saxophonist will play each note exactly the same and completely crisp. If you listen very closely, you will notice that it is common for the note to bend slightly.

So when you're tracking, take into account the style you are actually composing in, the instruments you are using and what effect you are actually trying to create with them.
