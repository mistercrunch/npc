Making Money from your Playstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By CrossFire

Introduction
------------

Has daddy just bought you a brand spanking new playstation? Have You got a CD Writer? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, read on, if not, go away and read Pokemon Magazine.

What You Need
-------------

Playstation (Preferably chipped)
CD Writer
Account at a local video rental store
Friends
Brain (Optional)

Installing a Mod Chip
---------------------

The first thing you're going to need for this scheme is a Chipped Playstation, basically what this does is tell the playstation that the game is official and not to bother checking it out, so you can play Copied and Imported games. To find a list of suppliers try buying a mag such as Playstation Power, they have companies that will supply chips for as low a price as £5, and most will come with instructions (well I hope they do cos I aint going to tell you here :))

Obtaining The Games
--------------------

There are a few ways to obtain games, but my favourite is by renting them. Go down to your local video shop and join it, this usually is free or costs around £1. Try searching around for the cheapest video stores, and don't even think about using the big players (Blockbuster etc), cos it costs around £4 to rent a normal playstation game from them. Once you've got the game, use your favourite software to copy it (I use Adaptec CD Copier Duluxe, which came with my CD Writer). Pop the game in your newly chipped playstation and see if it works.

Another Method of obtaining games was suggested in A-S 13 (In the warez corner), the basic idea was that you go down to a games store such as Electronic Boutique, buy a game from them, take it home, copy it, then return it to the store (you must have the recipt to do this!), say you weren't satisfied with it (make up an excuse), and they will either give you a refund or credit, preferably credit because you can do it again. Repeat this until you have quite alot of games, then move on to the next step.

Now that you have some games...
-------------------------------

Load up a copy of Paint Shop Pro (Or whatever paint program you use), and make a nice cover for the CD, print it off and stick on CD Case. Write up a catalogue of the games you have, print off a few copies and give to friends. Now sit back and watch as the cash rolls in.

Extras
~~~~~~

A nice little service you should offer your customers is Selling mod chips. In the Afformentioned Playstation Power magazine there are a few services that will sell you mod chips really cheaply, the lowest I have seen is £5. The normal going rate for chips is £10. I think you can guess what happens next :)
