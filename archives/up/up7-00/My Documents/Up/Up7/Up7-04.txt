A Series On Networking


1) Who is that guy Mirage ? 

2) Networking 


Hello readers of UP, this is my first article for UP and I hope you like it. 
To those of you who don't know me, you would if you hang on the krash server shame 
on you. Well you can catch most of us there on the weekend on krash.dyndns.org 6667.
These are some of the popular channels #apt, #hdc, #krash, #cocytusUK but keep your 
eyes open for others. Well some of you are probably wondering who is this guy Mirage ? 
Well erm... in a nutshell i'm a person very curious about computer security issues
and generally anything to do with comuters. Ok my first article will be on networking 
from the basics to more advanced techniques used; from my experience anyway. This will be in a long line of articles so stay tunned!

To start of the series of tutorials we are first going to take a beginners look 
at network topologies:

My definition of a network topology is that it is a description of the layout of 
communication medium (cabling), and devices on a network (printers, peripheral etc).
In this article I will cover the following topologies: point to point, mesh, bus, 
ring, star and hybrid.

Point to point

This is a very simple one basically you have two computers connected to each other 
via communication media. Obviously routing is not necessary, as this is a simple 
"point to point" topology. It's main use is for file transferring or two player Quake.
This topology is not really used these days but I thought I'd mention it. 

Mesh

A Mesh topology basically provides each computer on the network with a point to 
point connection. In my experience Mesh topologies most of the time can provide 
fast, reliable data transmission. The reason why Mesh aren't so widely used is for 
the simple reason that they waste communication channels; which in a growing 
company would very impratical. Despite the advantages of having a dedicated 
connection the wasting of communication channels just isn't practical.

Bus

This is the most commonly used well from what i've seen. A Bus topology as it's 
name suggests uses a single communication medium (usually coaxial) to transmit 
data. This works pretty simply e.g. erm... short links of cable tap directly into 
the main Bus simple as I said. At each ends of the Bus are terminating devices
which prevent echoing when the signal reaches the end of the main Bus. If you don't 
know what echoing is well its simple it would produce the effect of multiple 
signals on the main Bus. I remember a friend had set up a network using this
topology and asked me to see why it wasn't working it was so easy to fault find,
it was just a badly made cable that wasn't built right. He said he spent over 3 
hours trying to fix the network. The twat even formatted all the computers and 
started again DOH! So remember to check you cabling first.

Ring

This is a real irritating network if one computer goes down so do all of them. 
Righty then well this topology connects computers in a continuous loop. On the
upside signal quality on these networks is good as the signals are retransmitted
by each computer to the next computer and so on the signal keeps getting relayed.
The reason why I say this is an upside is because there is very little loss in 
signal quality as the signal is always being replayed.

Star

Things start to get more interesting here with the introduction of hubs in 
networks. In a Star topology the cabling branches out from a central hub. Then 
the hub transmits signals from computer to computer, nice huh. If your not a tight
git and you invest in a decent hub you can pick one up that will increase the signal 
quality over the network and wait for it yes you guessed it keep portions of the 
network in operation should a cable break or other problem occur. There not that 
expensive to put together actually and fault finding is so easy. On the downside 
it has a low data rate.

Hybrid

In my experience I have found that Hybrid topologies can be very tricky to 
establish and manage. Well Hybrid topologies have to combine two or 
more to be considered a Hybrid topology. A lot of wide area network's (WAN's) use 
this topology as they have the ability to connect several local area network's 
(LAN's. Oh yeah and they can be dame expensive and trouble shooting can really 
be dawnting.


Well readers thats it for this issue stayed tunned for the next issue which we 
will be looking at communication medium.
