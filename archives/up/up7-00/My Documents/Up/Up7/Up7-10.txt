TRACKED MUSIC REVIEWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By: Walrus & CrossFire

This section is running in conjunction with http://walrus.bog.net/. All of the tunes and mixes reviewed by me (Walrus) are available for listening or downloading from my site. Tracks that CrossFire reviews may also be there, but no promises. Where possible, a URL will be supplied. Well that's the theory anyway. A big shout goes out to Emulation who had donated 500Mb of server space on http://www.oldskool-hardcore.i12.com/ to allow this to continue, and to frOsty who is hosting a few of the mixes on http://www.tbp.mb.ca/audio/. Thanks to both of them.

Not all the tracks and mixes that we review are happy hardcore. We review oldskool, techno, drum 'n' bass, trance and more. Yes, even Gabber. Although we tend to stick to hardcore. If you would like either of us to review any tracks or mixes, send mods/mp3s/vqfs/realaudios or whatever your chosen format is to up_reviews@hotmail.com and either me or CrossFire will review it. Please don't send huge files though. For example, sending a 1 hour mix in mp3 format is not appropriate. If you want an address to send records/CDs/tapes to, just drop one of us an email.

Title:          DJ Dodgee - Untitled mixtape 2
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Happy Hardcore

Tracklist:
Kaos & Darkcyde - Tubular Vibes
BDB feat. Lisa A - I Want You
2 Mental - Generation Love
E-Logic - The Gate
Class of '94 - Lift You One Stage Higher

When I reviewed one of Dodgee's mixes in the last issue, I said: "Expect to see more from Dodgee, with a slightly more refined sound". That more refined sound is very apparant on this tape. The mixing is smoother overall. The punches are better, and there's even more of that excellent scratching. As for the tracks, there's an absolutely excellent selection of tracks in there. Not much to keep the cheezers happy though, so if that's your style give it a miss, but overall this tape comes highly reccomended.



Title:          DJ Skippy - Awakening
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Happy Hardcore

This track by DJ Skippy has not (yet) been scheduled for release, but may appear on a Skippin Trax release sometime in the future. Its a fairly trancey affair which sounds a little like the Braveheart theme. There's nice little synth lines dropped in all over the place intersperced with pianos and the like, and every time I listen to it, I seem to hear something which I didn't notice first time round. This is an absolutely solid tune in my opinion. Deserves to be released as soon as possible.



Title:          DJ Skippy - Skippin Trax 002
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Happy Hardcore

Skippin Trax 002 is going to have 3 tracks on it, and will probably be released in mid-late November. I have reviewed 2 of the tracks from it here, as the other one hasn't been written/recorded yet.

Side A (Energy 2000) is a happy, bouncey track using a few well known samples ("spread out and scatter" anybody?). Lots of different stuff going on here, but not fragmented. The track manages to be very happy without being cheezy. There's even some nice stompy bassdrum in there to shake the floor with.
Side B (Mystery) starts off with some good breakbeats and basslines and bounces along nicely with a few little vocal samples before bringing in some trancy synths. The track really picks up with a big bassdrum fill and bounces along with the same trancey synths until it picks up the breakbeats again for the outro.
On the basis of the two tracks I have reviewed here (remember there's going to be another one on there too) I advise anybody who likes their happy hardcore to go out and buy this record when it is released.



Title:          DJ Sparkey - Hardcore Crazy
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Happy Hardcore/Gabber

This is a cool track. At 210bpm and with its hard loud kickdrums at the beginning, its fairly gabber-esque. But at the same time there's an element of happy hardcore in there. Although it does seem to lack something where the piano line is introduced, it quickly picks up, and regains a lot of the harder elements of the track. I haven't really heard anybody mix happycore and gabber together like this before, and it works surprisingly well.
Don't forget to check out Sparkey's show on Inside Beat. Check out www.inside-beat.net for details of tuning in.



Title:          DJ Sparkey - Hardcore Frills
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Happy Hardcore

This track starts off a bit weak, with a single piano line, but improves as basslines and breakbeats are added to it. For a while it sounds fairly cool. However the track just loses it somewhere along the line, and never really goes anywhere. It ends up as a fairly cheezy afair. Its OK, but Hardcore Crazy is a much better track.

Mmm, This is an interesting one this is - or maybe I'm just refering to the image on the cover, which features a pic of a woman with her arse out :) The Mixing, As Always With Smurf, Is Excellent, and the tape has some *brilliant* Tunage On There. What I am surprised about is the fact the tape is quite slow - 160 Bpm. Theres a few tracks on there I've heard on Happy Hardcore tapes, most notably Bass D & King Matthew - How Shall I, and Damien Kelly & Attic & Stylz - State Of The Nation. Overall this is an excellent tape, which proves smurf is one to look out for.



Title:          Andreas Viklund - Sweet Things
Reviewed by:    CrossFire
Available from: http://www.traxinspace.com (Title Search)
Style:          Dance-Pop

Oh Yes! This Starts off with some nice pianos, before dipping into a vengaboys-esque intro (I don't Mean that in a bad way) , and then breaking down into the main melody. The whole song is really cutesy, but cutesy in a good way. Overall I think this track is excellent - Nice One Mr Viklund!



Title:          Xentar - Tears Of Happiness
Reviewed by:    CrossFire
Available from: ftp://ftp.scene.org/pub/music/groups/te/te-tears.zip
Style:          Happy Hardcore

Mmm, Breakbeats :) This song starts off with some lovely breakbeats before dropping into the main loop that isn't too disimilar from another Happycore track which i can't remember the name off. Anyway, this continues for a while, before breaking down a bit and a new instrumental loop starts. This track Seems to be a reflection of the stuff being released in the happy hardcore scene at the moment, and although this track is better than most commercial efforts, it's nowt outstanding.

Reviewed by:    CrossFire

Style:          Dance

Woah! Lovely lovely fantasy style intro :)) This Track is a beauty - It is done in a kind of Demo Style (i mean the kind of music you would hear in a demo), sorta like something you would here in a fantasy game, but a bit more up tempo. The Song itself builds up really nicely, and then as usual starts another instrumental loop. A bit of a short 'un at 2 Minutes 55 secs, but overall an excellent track done by a very nice guy :)



Title:          DJ Creativity - Oldskool Vol. 5 (Mixtape)
Reviewed by:    Walrus

Style:          Oldskool

No tracklist available

This is proper a oldskool mix. Not just '94-'95 happy hardcore tracks which some people seem to think is oldskool. Most of the tracks are from '92-'93, and there's some excellent tracks on there. The mixing compliments the track selection excellently, everything is nice and smooth - just the way it should be. Excellent stuff.



Title:          Modulo-2 - Smile and Nod
Reviewed by:    Walrus
Available from: http://walrus.bog.net
Style:          Bit of everything

This is a 14 track album by a Canadian duo. There's a mix of hardcore, happy hardcore, drum 'n' bass and trancecore on here. The standard of production is excellent across the board. I like some of the tracks, and I'm not so keen on others. This is the problem with covering such a range of genres, but I'm certain that there's a bit of something for everybody on this CD. The best track on the CD (IMHO) is definitely Peace Love Unity Revengewhich is an excellent jungle/drum 'n' bass stylee tune. Whatever you're into, I'm sure you'll love this CD.
