Bypassing BT Call Blocking
v1.0
                                                                           

This file comes about after a phone conversation with Walrus, in which he told me someone had emailed him asking about getting past Bt Call Blocking. Because of a certain £225 Phone Bill, my Parents decided to put Call Blocking on our phoneline. Bastards. From What I can gather, Call Barring works by The Line owner entering a pin (duh), and after which a connection seems to be made to a BT Number, on which a fake dial tone is made. 

One Way I have found to circumvent this, is If you have a mobile phone or similar, call Up the 17070 Outdial that Ergophobe Mentioned last month (0800 373983) , and select the Cable Pair Identification Feature. Cable Pair Identification basically is a feature that Engineers can use to test lines, cutting off all traffic to the line in the process (And no It doesn't work on freeserve <g>). From My Findings, this temporarily allows you to make a call, but you have to be quick, because the barring comes back on pretty soon.

Another, More Foolproof way to Bypass Call Barring is to try Hacking the Pin Code. From what I've found out, the pin code is 6 numbers long, but the line owner does NOT Select the pin, so don't bother trying your pets second cousins brother in law's wife's birthdate - It aint worth it.  

Once You've Hacked the code, your going to want to deactivate the barring (duh), and to do that you need a special code - here is a list of all the codes that activate / deactivate various things in the BT System (Thanks To EXE-Gency For These):

 141              withhold number
 1471             gives details of last number to call you
 1474             call the last number to call you.
 1470             un-withhold your number if you have a perm-=Withhold-
