<*> Meridian Mail Tips And Tricks For Quicker Hacking

This is designed for intermediates that haven't really used meridians
before. These apply to meridians that aren't direct except for the
last piece of information marked "For Directs". Please note that most
of this information applies to people living in the UK.z

Names 
~~~~~ 

You can often find where most of the extensions are by using names 
directories. 

Common numbers to dial for names are: (P) stands for 2 second pause. 
09 [P] 11 
09 [P] 14 
09 [P] 144 
09 [P] 158 

Then when it says enter the name last name followed by first name enter
something like 56637 meaning "Jones" or just a 3 or 4 random digit
combo of numbers, if it says more than 1 name was found then press #
again, if it then says too many names were found,  then refine your
search. 

Extensions 
~~~~~~~~~~ 

To get at this you dial: 

09 or 0* (There might be another one but I dunno)

Then start guessing 3,4,5 digit extensions, mainly 4 digit but not 
always, if it rings then bingo you hit a valid extension, write it
down, others will likely be around that area. Write as many extensions
down as possible about 30 to guarantee getting a box (not necessarily
but likely). Most extensions are normally in common ranges which are 
listed in order of commodity below: 

8*** 
3*** (I don't know why but 3231 seems exceedingly common on all types
of Voice Mail Systems) 
5*** 

Getting more than 1 box using compose 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

When you got one box and pass, you log in and press 75 for compose, now
start guessing boxes, if it says mailbox **** or some name then you hit
a valid box, this is like 09 and 0* but you need to log in, it is
quicker though and you can get hundreds of valid box numbers in minutes
inside your box you can use 0* and 09, these are sometimes outdials.

Surveillance 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

If you find a system of interest i.e. Nokia Meridian Mail, in which 90%
of passwords are default (box number) and you want to listen to their
messages esp new ones without it saying "Read" when they check their
box which would make them very suspicious you can listen to their
messages another way, you could of course read then delete but that
causes suspicion too. How to be subtle:

1. Get yourself a box that hasn't been checked for months
2. Change the password (84)
3. Now 81 to log in
4. Go through people's mailboxes and forward all mail to your box
   number (73) e.g. 

   Log in
   It says you have 2 new msgs
   Now type 73
   Type your box number then ##
   Press 5
   Say What box number the msgs you nicked are from, then the message
   number.
   Press #
   Press 79
   **Now for message 2**
   Press 6 then repeat

5. Logout of other box 
6. Log in to your own box 
7. You have their messages!! 

**To check that it works press 81 then log in to the box you nicked the
msgs from and it will say you have 2 new messages still! 

Difficulty logging in?? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

If you have hit a meridian but you cant log in, then you can probably
log in using the following ways: 

1. As soon as you dialed the number press 09 (It might slam you to the
log in prompt)
2. Call any extension then press ##81.
3. Press ##81.
4. Find the extension that takes you the log in bit (e.g. in the Nokia
one it was 5555).

Likely ones are 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999,
0000, 1000, 2000, 3000,
4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 or things like 5005 or 6005 and
stuff, if necessary scan 999 numbers until you find it.

5. Hand scan the number around the meridian you have got to see if
there is a direct.
(Scan 50-100 either way)

For Directs
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you call up a direct e.g. 0800-899-050 it can be just slightly
pissing off when you don't know whether the boxes are 3, 4, 5 digits
long or whether they start with 5 or 8 or 3? What you can do is guess
at a box and try to log in 3 times with a shit password. It may then
suspend the account temporarily (48hrs approx). Try this with box 0593
or 0594 (My old boxes) and on the fourth attempt it will boot you from
the system automatically in 1 go, this will tell you if you have a
valid box.
