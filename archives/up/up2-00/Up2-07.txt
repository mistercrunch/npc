<*> The main question I would ask about doing this illegal activity is
why? But for the purpose of hacking I will ask no further questions and
presume that you are trying to get revenge on the leader of a child
porn racket or some other perverse organisation. And if it is for the
child porn reason let me know how you get on as I am highly against
any type of child porn and the likes.

With this I don't by any means mean just any old type of account I mean
the free one you get just like a tripod account or xoom. With that in
mind I must tell you that this is a long process in getting access but
if you feel it's worth it then by all means go and do it.

Did you ever notice that when registering with tripod they send you
all heap of shit such as username/password over e-mail. So basically
you have to follow a few but still simple steps in doing this.

First find out as much as you can about the target such as their name
current e-mail address that kind of thing, with that you build up a
profile on the target and use this against them. Now create a free
e-mail address with yahoo (or any one you want) using the targets
details.

For example the targets name is Dohn Divine and lives in 38 Cowper
Downs, Rathmines, Dublin 14, Ireland (Made up name and address). Just
use this as the data you enter when setting up the account.

Now e-mail the web-master in tripod and just simply let them know that
you (John Divine..........) has now changed your e-mail address to
jdivine@yahoo.com (or whatever) and that they should change their
records etc. 

New username: johndivine
New e-mail address: jdivine@yahoo.com

Now with this a few months down the road e-mail them saying that you
have forgotten your password. Now they will send you a new password
to the given e-mail address (Which in this case would be the one you
made). This will then in turn give you 100% access to their account.
You can just do it as soon as you change the e-mail address but this
could fail for two reasons A) They will think it's too soon and get
a bit suspect of your activities. B) It will  be to soon and the record
will not be updated for a couple of days.
