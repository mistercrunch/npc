<*> Breaking into cars for fun, profit as well as for stealing 'em.
The purpose of this file is to educate people of the security flaws
associated with car related features (alarms, imobilizers, locks,
etc).

Now let me begin by getting a few things straight. If your the kind of
person who's going to do this thinking they're the man when drunk out
of their skull, then forget it as you have as much hope as getting away
with it as you stand not falling asleep the second you sit in the car,
trust me, friends of friends have done this so may times and got nicked
so many times that it's not even funny anymore! I'm serious, practice
and maturity is an essential!!!

There are many approaches to gaining access into a car, but it also
depends if your stealing the contents (radio, mobile phone etc.) or
stealing the car itself. If you're simply breaking into the car to
steal the contents then you've got tons of options.

(a) Smashing the window
(b) Picking the locks

(i) Now this must be the crudest of all methods on gaining access to a
car. Use a stone, screwdriver, yourself, or what ever the hell you
like. After this it's kind of self explanatory... if stealing the
contents.

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

                                     TIP

When breaking the glass, a good idea would be to use sticky tape,
(preferably carpet tape). This is always a good idea as it quietens the
sound of the glass breaking and practically no glass splinters will
cover the seat or floor so that when you sit down you don't end up with
a bloody arse.

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

(b) Now as there are so many options I'm gonna break it into sections 

*** Section 1

If you're trying not to damage the lock (to the naked eye) and you just
want to steal the contents to freak the owner out well here goes...

Approaches... (i) pick set (ii) electric pick gun or (iii) screwdriver
and coat hanger (or "Slim Jim") methods.

(i) If you're an unskilled bastard with no patience then go past this
bit and see (ii) and (iii) The idea behind using a pick set is to turn
the various metal slides, which in turn pops the lock pull bit up, (see
below for a pitiful diagram).

You can use various types of files, professional ones (a bit fucking
expensive!) or make your own. See bottom of page for addresses of
suppliers). If making your own then see yet again another pitiful
diagram and follow the simple instructions...

Materials:

Irregular sized paper clip or strips of easily bendable metal (easy to
cut is a big advantage). If using the paper clip, bend the paper clip
so that it is in a complete straight line and bend one end so that it
forms a small hook to help catch the metal slides in the lock. (See
diagram below).
                                             __
                                               | [the hook in the clip]
                         ______________________|

Once you've done this you will be the proud owner of a simple but
effective pick, HORAAAAAAA. 

IN USE: Insert the pick into the lock and attempt to hook it behind one
of the moving parts, then with a "SERIOUSLY FIRM" grip, pull the pick
towards you using a pair of pliers. The idea being that the force being
applied is so great that instead of the pick simply shooting out, its
on its way out, manages to slip the moving parts which as you've
probably guessed opens the lock. This will take some practice and
indeed a great deal of time. Also the chances of you opening the lock
are only as good as the build of your pick.

If using the bendable metal, get a close up shot from either the
internet or a catalog of a professional pick sets. The picture must be
a close up, as you need to be able to distinguish and size the various
shapes for when it comes to actually making the picks. Simply "copy
carve" the picks and there you have it, an inexpensive professional
pick set. 

IN USE: You firstly insert one pick, one that would allow a second to
be inserted at the same time and position them so that each makes
contact with the moving parts in the lock so that you can apply
sufficient leverage and in turn hopefully pop the lock. Before you
think you can go fuck if you think I'm gonna spend half an hour drawing
another bloody diagram. As this is one of the most skill-demanding
approaches, I advise much practice, and don't be discouraged easily.

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

                                     TIP

A good way to improve your lock picking skills is to practice them...
where? I've always found the scrap yards a fantastic practice site.
Simply find yourself a car of your own personal preference and work
away at the lock. The beauty is that if you're asked what you're doing
you can say you're trying to open the door to get a part from the
inside. As well as this, if you have your eye on a particular car you
want to steal or break into, you can go the scrap yard and examine its
locks in the knowledge that you won't be stopped and that you can't be
arrested for doing it either.

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

(ii) This is by far the easiest of ways to open the lock though... but
this is the hideous downer, the price, expect to pay upwards of £120.

If you're "NOT" like me and can afford one then I recommend one as with
the minimalist of practice you can be successful practically every time
even when working with many new cars. The basic principal if you don't
know, is that the file you insert into the lock vibrates when turning
on the gun and in most cases it will temporally unlock the locking
mechanism and if your'e quick enough you will be able to open the door
before the gun vibrates the lock back to the closed position. Many
private detectives and members of the government use them because of
the fact that they leave little if any scratch marks and are easy and
quick to operate, but they're not too concealed so don't get caught.
You try explaining.

Or if you want the car for a job (off license or post office job).
If this is the case your gonna want to have the car looking as
inconspicuous as possible, and that means no missing windows and no
wierd looking locks. First off a good idea is to get something reliable
(trust me it may see stupid, but so many jobs have gone arse ways when
the getaway car conks out on them), remember, a getaway car is as
essential to the job as your dick is for fucking with! Volkswagons and
Mercedes are among the best, though if getting one, get an oldish one,
(4-8 years, no flash GTI or E-500s. The way in which you would go about
opening the lock would in many cases be the pick or screwdriver
approach, (see afore mentioned sections). Near the end of the page is a
list of cars (with methods) which are simple to pick open and steal,

(iii) At this point your probably wondering where my mention about the
humble Slim Jim is. Well, wait no longer for I have prevailed. The Slim
Jim (of American origin) has been around for countless years, okay fine
30-40 years in one form or another (i.e. coat hanger). The Slim Jim is
really an ore refined rich man's coat hanger, though the coat hanger
has one undeniable advantage that it can be bent away so you don't have
to wear a long trench coat. If anyone knows or has details about a fold
away Slim Jim then please e-mail me at crops@indigo.ie or at
potmand@hotmail.com.

The basic principal behind them is very crude and measures to hamper
their uses by manufacturers are now commonplace in cars under 3-4 years
old (depends on the manufacturer... well duhh!!!). Back to the point,
the principal is that the hook or catch part when inserted between the
window and rubber seal and pushed down far enough, is that it latches
on to the pop up lock cord and usually with an upward movement "pops
the lock" and voila. Recently, re-enforced Jims have been made to cope
with motor corps such as Ford and G.M. to help counteract their counter
actions (try saying that 15 times with 10 sour balls in your mouth).

The screwdruver approach is really easy and with practice can be used
to open locks whilst leaving behind little external damage (perfect for
the careful car thief). The idea is again quite simple... all that has
to be done is that you get a set of screwdrivers, (don't go buying the
most expensive though don't buy ones which will bend easily) pick out
one you think best for the lock and shove it in and turn. Like I said,
extremely easy. Its always a good idea to use a screwdriver which has a
longish screw bit which is also thin so that you can get some depth
when working on the lock.

If you don't care a toss about the appearance of the car then do what
the hell you like to open the door. What more were you expecting?

Approaches... (i) easy to steal cars (ii) locksmith contacts

                                     TIP

A good way of gaining entry to a car is through the boot lock, reason
being is that especially on oldish and old cars, the manufacturers use
lesser locks and therefore make it very easy for thieving. I've used
kitchen knives on these locks before and 75% of the time I've got in.
This is one of the easiest methods of getting into cars!

<*>-----------------------------------------------------------------<*>

(i) Cars which are easy to steal...

Morris Minor (any type), opens with an ordinary ford key (15-20 years)
or house key.

Fiats (ages 12-25) opens again by a similar approach.

Fords (aged 10-25) opens with a Ford key of the period, or a similar
key.

Volkswagons aren't reputed for being easy to steal, the new ones
anyway, but I feel I have to give them a mention because they are by
far more reliable and start in every weather condition time and time
again and are ideal. Volks (aged 7-82) open with the simple
screwdriver approach best. Remember, don't damage the lock externally
if on a job. My preference would be a Golf.
