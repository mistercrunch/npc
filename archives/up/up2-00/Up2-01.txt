                       :..::..Introduction.::..:

<*> Welcome to the second and thus latest greatest issue of Underground
Periodical. Well, not dead yet, as it seems. The counter on our website
indicates that there are about 600 readers. What is needed the most now
are file submissions and suggestions on how to improve it. Some people
have been complaining that they can't download Up1-00.zip from the
website so take note that there is already a few distributors. I urge
you to send us something to use, as you will get to plug your site at
the end.

<*> Due to the high demand we have started up a subscription list. To
join it just go to the bottom of our website and enter your e-mail in
the dialog box to sign up. Now issues will be e-mailed to you every
month. It will appear in digest form as a mailing list only the .zip
file will come attached. The list is powered by ListBot so what are
you waiting for? Go sign up now.

<*> Issue 1 of Up was reviewed by Anti-Social magazine this month in
their twelfth issue so download it at http://www.antisocial.cjb.net
This is very important, as it will provide the much needed constructive
criticism to help improve for next month and beyond. It might also help
to spread the URL around for the website so that more people will
download the issues thus increasing our fan base.

<*> Its readers write Underground Periodical. Without you we the staff,
the fancy ascii art, it all means nothing. You are the ones who write
the magazine. What we need to get started is submissions, send us in
your text files. We accept technical information, philosophy on the
state of the scene today, articles on free speech and censorship we are
interested in all innovations of computer culture, although we are
mostly based on underground stuff. Send your articles in text format to
the e-mail address at the top.

<*> Tell your friends!!! Tell your pals on mailing lists and IRC
channels about the Periodical. We post our existence to a few
newsgroups but it just isn't enough. We can't be everywhere at once
so advertise us to your greatest mates. If you were doing an e-zine
I'd help you out. 

<*> We'd like to thank any and all people who submitted to Issue 2 or
contributed in any way. It is understood that they are automatically
included as Shout Outs. Without continued support from the underground
community we won't be able to keep Up going. It's your magazine, so
help it out a little. Anyway, on with this issue...
