<*> This is the part of the e-zine where we respond to e-mails and
questions and stuff. This section is meant to add a personal touch to
the e-zine. The original mail headers have been left in, as we aren't
going to protect people who send us lame messages. Keep those
intelligent e-mails flowing in. Everybody likes a bit of encouragement.
The e-mails are arranged in the order of the date they were received.

i read your article in one of the e-zines i downloaded.
The desktop surveillance program u wrote about, that appears as OSA
seems to be installed by Microsoft Office.
if it is a logger, could u tell me where the log file is , so that i
can see it, or is the name just a coincidence?
Thanks for your time

The reason Desktop Surveillance appears on the Task List as OSA is done
on purpose so that people will confuse it with the Office Setup
Application, a small program that is used in setting up MS Office. By
doing this there would be less chance of someone interuptting it by
closing it on the task list.

The website is not passworded. It must just be something running on
your box that is stopping you. You probably saw the paragraph in the
Introduction about our new subscription list. Alternatively you could
try downloading from one of the websites in our distributor list.

I thought you might like to include this with your d/l's.
It's a nice FTP prog. There is a detailed help file included.
Upon unzipping it will self install to your program files unless you
specify
otherwise. I have scanned each file with Norton 5 and found it to be
virus free.

Thanks for the gesture but zipped copies of issues are the only
downloads on the site. You should build your own website. I'd help but
I'm too busy and all. You could then upload this magazine and become a
distributor for us.

No, major hacking trick here. Most hackers have a password cracker or
can
gain access to systems easily enough, but if the victim changes their
password frequently, what can you do instead of re-discovering it all
the time?

If for instance your school network is like mine Using a login prompt
before
opening your desktop it's quite easy.

Logon as your victim with their password.
Load up 'My Computer' and then enter Server13.
Open the 'Users' folder.
Click on 'All Users'
Right click on their account name.
Go to 'Properties'
Click on 'Security'
Click on 'Add'
Click 'Show users'
Click on your own account name.
Select 'Full Control' from the scroll bar below.
Click on 'Add'

That's it. You can access that users files from your own desktop no
matter
what. I recommend however, that you delete the administrators access to
their files otherwise he'll cancel your access and we can't have that.
After
all. Out smarting other people is really what hacking is all about.

Catch ya' later

greets, I am archive.  I am in the process of currently d/l'ing your 
zine.  Currently I publish the EUA monthly, a zine on the similar topic
of h/p.  If you want to grab a copy of our zine you can get it off of 
our site at www.freespeech.org/eua --> follow the links to the zine. We
do our pub in pdf format. various writters provide articles to us as
well as information from the EUA's own information networks around the 
world. You can respond here for further information or contact me on
irc.xnet.org in #eua.

After reading EUA and dropping into #eua I came to the conclusion that
archive and his group are very intelligible people. EUA monthly will be
reviewed in the next issue of Up so look out for that.

Sorry but the Pirate Radio Series is only meant as a general guide.
I've since been asked specific questions by many people but I don't
have the time to answer them in detail. The information is available to
anyone who can use a search engine. All you need is time and patience.
