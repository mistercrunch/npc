Heh. So here is issue II of f41th... I'll be honest and say that I never
thought we would get to issue II because we are so damn lazy. because ppl
liked the 1st issue (bumber codes xmas delight).. We have decided to do it
again, this time with my raw info to feed your tormented starving minds. As
usuall the site is still under construction, but is updated regulary:
darkcyde.8m.com. I really cannot be bothered to write an editorial, so here
is the zine: :]

LAME AS FUCK PRIZE:

'PLUK' - PhoneLossersUK

OMG, when we read the stuff they where publishing in there zines, we cried in
pity for there lame souls... where sorry, but 'PLUK' is about as origional as
calling yourselves 'UK h4x0rz'... HEH, lets take a look at the PLUK elite
zine@!$!

The Art of Wardialling (mrsp00n [mrsp00n@phreaker.net]) - PLUK I

This has to be the lamest thing we have seen!@$!@!! What the hell is this
dude called Mrsp00n on about?... We'll if you are sad enough to get their
zine you will see... He trys to teach you to wardial! wo!!, how fucking dumb,
if you need to be taught how to wardial, you must be as thick as he is..
O, in excahnge for the knowledge he has provided you with, you are allowed to
send him your scanlists@!$!! :

" As  a  final  note, if you do come up with any decent scans, feel free to
share them  with us  all.  Email me at DavidW@deathsdoor.com and I'll stick
it on the site and, needless to say, give you full credit. "

In issue I of PLUK you can also learn how to get past internet censoring
software that your mommy and daddy have put on your puter! -we say no more.

LOL!... You thought that was bad? take a look at issue II of PLUK!, damn,
this 'mrsp00n' guy is lame as shit.. lets see what 0-day knowledge he shares
with us in issue II....

HaXoring Meridian Mail (by mrsp00n [mrsp00n@phreaker.net]) - PLUK II

WTF is this!@!$!, lets see...more words from the o great elite h4x0r mrsp00n:

"Ahhhhh....Voicemail. Want your own  31337  Voicemail Account?  This  issue,
I'm going to be looking at getting a Voicemail box on Meridian Mail [0800 318
716]."

HEH, mrsp00n, you suck. 0800 318 716 was owned 4 years ago. for some reason
we don't believe this is new info.. go back to your AOL buddy lists PLUK, is
your zine aimed at complete morons, or written by some? (or maybee even both)

Another example from PLUK II:

Social Engineering / Stalking over IRC (by despair [despair@mailcity.com])

words from 'despair':

" When people fuck with me, I fuck with their heads.  Fair's fair.  You  piss
  me off.  You  get  fucked  in  the  head.  Of  course  it  works  better
  the more ignorant the person is.  Come  up  against  another  of  the
  intellectual mafia and it's a very frustrating fight, but  there  are
  always  ones to make up for that. "

so this nob has written a text file on how to mess with peoples minds on IRC.
It's so lame we cannot be bothered to even take the piss out of it.

PLUK even tell you what FTP is in issue II @!$! - they also have somthing
called 'the PLUK hitlist' -i list of ppl they don't like, watch out they will
own you with their 'what is FTP?' 0-days technik.

OK, thats enough for ripping the piss out of the inferior, on with the zine:

..::::: |-----> By ppl ........::::::::::::|||lllSSSS$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
..::::: |-----> efnet .........::::::::::::|||lllSSSS$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Why are why putting irc logs in the zine? - fuck knows, just read it!

Look.. an elite converstaion with Rloxly on undernet@!$

Introduction.
This article is to explain some methods of making your routes through the
networks, less traceable(specifically through x.25 networks, as most people
only think of going through systems on the internet). Logically, the more
networks and systems you pass through, before connecting with your target,
uh.., i mean host, the harder it will be for the admin of the host to follow
you back through.  So, let's begin.

=============================================================================

Part 1:The diverter.

A short note:The purpose of the modem diverter is, in essence, to create a                homemade outdial.  The point is, to phone  the outdial, have a               modem answer, that connect's you to a different line to phone                out of, so they don't trace you to your home line.  This won't               be the only precaution we will take, it will be much more                    complex.

i. -Supplies.
    
    You will need the following parts to properly construct your modem
    diverter:

  1)Two modems(These can be any speed at all, i used a 2400 baud and a 9600
    baud that my school through out. But, since the slowest modem is 2400,
    that is the fastest you will be able to connect, and then dial out of.)

  2)A serial cable you will use to connect the two modems together.

  3)You need two phone lines, I will go into this later as you cas use pay
    phones, your neighbors phone, boxes, etc..

  4)Some phone cable probably, you may not need this.

  5)Recomended, but not needed, is a beige box. This is to test the lines
    you will be using to make sure they will work.  And also alligator clips,
    get them at your local rat shack.

ii. -Instructions.

     1)Hook the serial cable to the ports of each modem.

     2)Get a couple feet of phone cable and hook either end into each modem,
       there should still be an empty port on each modem for another plug as
       well.

     3)Switch one of the modem to dumb mode, and one to smart mode, you will
       phone the one in dumb mode, which will transfer you to the smart modem
       to dial out of.

     4)You must now find a place to set this up.  Here some locations you
       could choose. If you're in canada, then the phone company is probably
       ripping out the old centuriums, and putting in the new millenium
       payphones. If this is happening in your city, you are in luck.
       Becuase of the phone companys lazyness, they have ripped out 2 old
       payphones in my town, and have not put in the new ones, so the phone
       line is still sticking up out of the dirt. I recomend comming back at
       night, with your modem diverter wrapped up in plastic bags, or a
       container with some holes for the wires.  Now, dig a hole about a foot
       deep and put the container in, attach one of the phone cord to the
       wire protruding from the ground, you may need solder for this.  But
       wait, first hook your beige box up to the line, if there's a dial tone
       you're in business.  Phone your home, get some there to be waiting,
       and pickup, then when you hang up, they press *69 to get the number of
       the line, you will need this later. Ok, this is but one of the place
       you can hook it up, you can attach it to your neighbors phone, however
       they may get a little suspicious.  You might try your schools fax
       line, becuase it's not used as much, it could go months without being
       noticed.  You could open up one of those "green towers", or brown in
       some areas, and hook the phone line up to one of the screws inside.
       This is the usual place you would beige box from.

      5)Now go home, start up your terminal program, and dial the number of
        the line you hooked up the diverter to.

iii. -Terminal Commands.

A short note:Yes you probably know many a terminal commands, but this is for
the people who ripped thier modem out of the box, and through out the manual
in the excitment of dialing out at 56k.

Commands.
ATDT555-6789                -this dials the number 555-6789
+++                         -disconnects you from the computer you dialed
A                           -answer incoming call
H1                          -take phone off hook
L2                          -medium speaker volume

here is a chart that helps you set your modem speed:

Part 2:x.25 routes

i. -Explanations.
    The purpose of going through at least two x.25 networks is to become
    untraceable.  While it is impossible to become 100% untraceable, this
    will help you out.  There are many x.25 networks out there, SpirntNet,
    Tymnet, and datapac to name a few, almost every country has them, and
    they are easy to use.  The point is to not only use x.25 networks, but
    the modem diverter, shell accounts, andonymous wingates, or guest account
    you can telnet out of.

ii. -Where to?
Depending on where the system is you are targeting, you may use a different
route each time.  Let's say, you want to connect to this system:1302033401455
This is a Dynix system on datapac.3020 is the DNIC for datapac.  And
33401455 is the NUA.  Ok, let's assume you have a dial-up shell account.
First, dial the number for your modem diverter, this should connect you to
your out dialing modem, dial the number for your shell, once you have logged
in, telnet to dialout.psu.edu.  This is a outdial on the internet.  From
there dial the local sprintnet access number that's nearest to Pennsylvania
State University. When you get one sprint, connect to the NUA mentioned
earlier and that's it.  There should  also be a Datapac number near you as
well, even though you're in the US. There are about 6 sprintnet access
numbers in canada, so there must be some datapac access numbers for the
states. For those of you in canada, here are the sprintnet numbers for
canada:

(They all support up to 14400 bps)

Calgary                        403      262-7887     
Halifax                        902      492-0036    
Montreal                       514      392-0202     
Ottawa                         613      235-6481     
Toronto                        416      594-1121     
Vancouver                      604      684-4696     

iii. -DNIC's and systems.

There are many more gateways from the internet to x.25 networks, here are
some datapac ones.

If you want to find some systems, you can get a sprintnet nua scanner from
http://www2.dope.org/9x
So, If you aren't in north america, then you need the DNIC of the PSN in your
contry. Here is a list of SOME. There a lot more extensive lists out there.

Datapac.....3020
Sprintnet...3110
Tymnet......3106
Infogram....3028
GlobeDat....3025
InfoSwitch..3029
IntelPak....4542
ADP Autonet.3126
Bell South..3143
Nynex.......3144
Austpac.....5052
Dataex-P....2624

Remeber, yo will probably need to get yourself and NUI to connect to some of
these, and put a 1 before the DNIC, it's the same as a long distance call.

iv. -Examples

Ok here is a diagram of some systems you could route your signal through.


your------>--->---Modem------>----->----ISP---->--shell account---->--------
computer          diverter 

---telnet:dialout.psu.edu------->--------->--1(800).555.4401

.this would connect you to the computer sitting on 1-800-555-4401.
This may seem complicated, but for the truly paranoid hacker, it works.


v. -Sources

Here are some websites that contain valuable information on x.25 and old
school h/p.

a. National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications.
Telecommunications services which are used to maintain a state of readiness
or to respond to and manage any event or crisis which causes or could cause
injury or harm to population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or
threatens the NS/EP posture of the United States.

b. National Communications System. The NCS is a confederative arrangement in
which member Federal agencies participate with their owned and leased
telecommunications assets to provide necessary communications services for
the Federal Government, under all conditions, including nuclear war.

c. NS/EP Telecommunications Service Priority. The TSP is the regulative
system authorizing and providing for priority treatment (i.e., provisioning
and restoration) of NS/EP telecommunication services.

     (1) A TSP provisioning priority is obtained to facilitate the priority
         installations of new NS/EP telecommunications services. 

     (2) A TSP restoration priority is applied to existing NS/EP services and
         requires telecommunications carriers to restore the service before
         any system without a TSP assignment.

Department of Defense Activity Address Directory 
(http://www.daas.dla.mil/daasinq/dodaac.htm)

Connect to the DAASC Inquiry System to perform DoDAAD Queries

The DoDAAD is authorized under DoD 4000.25-6-M. This manual prescribes
uniform methods, codes, formats, and standards for the establishment,
maintenance, publication, and dissemination of address data to required
Military Services, Federal Agencies, and Civil Agencies. 

DAASC serves as the Central Control Point (CCP) responsible for maintaining
the official master DoDAAD.

Required updates to the DoDAAD are forwarded to DAASC from designated
Service/Agency Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC) Service
Point (SP) activities. These updates include additions, changes, and
deletions, to the mailing, shipping, and billing addresses of the identified
DoDAAC’s.

The DoDAAC is a six position code that uniquely identifies a unit, activity
or organization that has the authority to requisition and/or receive
materiel. The first position designates the particular Service/Agency element
of ownership. There may be up to three distinct addresses contained in the
DoDAAD for each DoDAAC, as follows:

TAC1 - Identifies the mailing address for the activity (mandatory)

TAC2 - Identifies the ‘ship to’ (freight) address for the activity 

TAC3 - Identifies the billing address (The activity responsible for payment
       of bills.)

The master DoDAAD database maintained at DAASC can be queried remotely by any
user having internet ‘telnet’ capability or dialup modem capability to access
the ‘DAASINQ’ application.
