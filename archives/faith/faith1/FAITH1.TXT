Welcome to the very 1st issue of FAiTH!... Why the hell have we called the
zine FAiTH?, well, we don't know. FAiTH is based on HP (Hacking & Phreaking)
Wether you are in the US or UK, or Russia, we hope you enjoy this zine, it's
taken us ages to compile *@CoTh*! , by the way, we cannot spell because we
retarded digital deleqents, but we don't care. So what are you going to find
in this new zine? erm, good question, shit I'm talkiing to myself... You will
find Everything and Anything to do with HP, it will be a mixture of UK & US
relevency. The 1st issue (what you are l00king at n0w, has been primarily
composed by D4RKCYDE (old & new members), but 1st lets get one thing
straight.... D4RKCYDE, (previously DarkCYDE), (the 4 looks good), is NOT an
active HP group, we just write cool things like this zine now. If you are
looking for all the old DarkCYDE realeses just take a look at the website,
you can download a load of them there. We have decided to make this zine
cuse we have nothing better to do, and it was an excuse to sit around for
ages making asKi art. If you think this zine is lame, then hit ALT-ENTER-
EXIT, and stop reading.. I have heard some shit on the net lately that some
people (well, most of the UK scene), hate D4RKCYDE. Heh, I only have one
thing to say to you.. G0 p0sT s0m3 m0rE, d0eS blu3b0x1ng w3rK 1n d4 uK p0sts
1n 4lT.pH.uK. Sorry about my shite editorial, but I was the only person who
could be assed to do it. So OK people, heres what we have been promising for
a while now, we hope you enjoy it, FAiTH M4g4Z1nE:

Hi there DC readers, I'm =3DThe-Doh-Boy=3D and you can check out my earlier,
lamer articles at the SWATeam webpage, swateam.base.org. But for now I'm
writing for DC and my chosen specialised subject is cellular phreaking. I'd
like to think I am pretty well experienced with the standard forms of cell-
phreaking, i.e. cloning, modifying SIMMS, programmable backdoors on fones. I
also think I know A LOT about pre-pay fraud. So I am going to concentrate on
this as I know a lot about it, I could be wrong however, and I always enjoy
being told I'm wrong :>

I'm going to give you a brief outline of the older methods of phreaking
cellular fones and why they were introduced (a more in-depth account to come
soon), I'm then going to move on and give a brief summary of the relatively
new field of pre-pay fraud.

GOLDEN OLDIES :>

First principle of cellular fones is the principle of knowing the basics of
how they work. A cellular fone is more or less a HAM Radio with a small
computer attached (no it can't run MSWorks!!!!) The computer handles the
signalling to the local cell tower (like an exchange) and performs the
"negotiations" necessary to complete a call. It will also handle signal
conversion in the case of digital fones. The most important two numbers that
are ever signalled to the tower are the ESN and MIN numbers. These are the
numbers which uniquely identify the fone within the network. They are the DNA
of fones. We have all seen the two stranded DNA molecule, well thats a good
way to think of ESN/MIN. They must come together and fit precisely before the
tower will let you go anywhere with the fone. The ESN is the Electronic
Serial Number, this tells the tower what fone is logged into the network. The
MIN is the Mobile Identification Number and this tells the tower the
customers number. The network you are with has the ESN/MIN in pairs logged in
a database for every fone they will provide service to. If a fone logs in
with a pair which is not on the database, it will either kick you or let ONE
call go through (I will come back to this). We have all used Dial Up
Networking or a Keycard or anything with a passcode. You could see the
ESN/MIN as login/passcode. If these are not valid, then NO ACCESS CHUMP. So
naturally (as with other forms of hacking) you are going to need ways of
using someone elses account. Obviously you must get your fone to give the
cell tower a different ESN/MIN pair from yours.. This is the principle behind
cellular cloning. The de-facto standard for doing this involves replacing the
ESN chip with a PROM which can then be loaded with the ESN/MIN pair of
another subscriber. Other methods are commonly used on Motorolas (THE PHREAK
FONE!!!) which can often be re-programmed at the keypad!!! or often using a
ready made cable connection from computer-fone. 

So now you have got your fone ready to take new pairs, WHERE DO YOU GET THEM
FROM. Well there are many different options as far as this is concerned!!!
ranging from the HI-TECH 31337 scheme to the low-tech lamo scheme. A popular
way, for people who can't stop spending cash, is a scanner. As mentioned
before, the fone contains a computer which signals to the tower.. It just so
happens that if you find carrier signals in the mobile range (can't remember
exactly, will have everything down previsely next article) tune down 20MHz
and hook the scanner to your modem. With some decoding you can recieve ESN/
MIN pairs aplenty! (this is not my favourite method $$$!!!)

Another, more deviant scheme is to go trashing at your local cell shop. They
always write down the ESN/MIN and other customer info. before entering it
into the computer to get the fone hooked up. They then throw this paper into
the bin after. So its the usual trashing drill, rummage around and see what
you can get. (a good method for the low budget, but not for the over-vain!!)
My favourite method is to stand around at airports e.t.c. and wait for
business guys to leave their fone to go to the mens room, have a coffee
e.t..c. and just read the pairs from the fone. The MIN can be calculated from
the Mobile number (always available in an in-built menu) and the ESN is at
the back of the fone inside the battery case. Once you have your number pairs,
load them up and start making free calls.. Good point to note: this only
works on analouges so everything you say can be heard BE CAREFUL Make sure
not to use the same one repeatedly, change them every now and then to be
safe.

Mentioned earlier was a now defunct method of cell phreaking. This involved
churning out random ESN/MIN pairs which the tower thought to be outwith its
domain, while it was validating this pair the call can still go through!!!
Doesn't work anymore(?) so just a passing mention here. Another use for
Motorolas made before 1995 (get one from before this year for all your
cloning related fun) is as an eavsdropper. Certain keypresses in test mode
(ground pin 5 and power up, enter security code twice to enter test mode)
which I will have for you next article, allow you to listen to the channel of
your choice. This means you can listen in to any analouge fone conversation
in the same cell as you. There is also a channel left for "handing off" to
other cells called the FOrwardVoiceCell, this can be obtained from the text
shown on your fone during handoff to listen to the call which was handed to
another cell. If your signal strength is great enough then you can talk to
those you are eavsdropping on!!! This covers the basics of the old time
fraud, now to move on to something which is just emerging, PRE-PAY FRAUD...

PRE-PAY FRAUD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

To meet demand for a more flexible service, one of the two largest cell
providers in the UK, Vodafone, launched its "Pay As You Talk" package. The
instant I saw the advert on TV I knew that people would scam it eventually. I
was right. Every one this christmas wants a pre-pay fone. You couldn't sell
one to your own mother they are in such demand. This is obviously a money
spinner, and good news for fraudsters like us.

There are now so many pre-pay packages that its hard to keep up. As I write
this every single cell provider has such a package. For this inaugiral
article I will concentrate on the Vodafone package as I have LOADS of
experience with this package. One such benefit is the anonymity the fone
provides. You do not have to sign legal contracts or such with your true
identity. Most registration is done by fone or even by post to the provider.
So you can register your fone to "Michael Mouse, 10 Sesame Street, Botswana"
if you wanted. I know that on analouge PAYT you call 191 and there is an
automated registration sevice. Do not ask for stuff to get sent out to you
(its not your address) but once you register the fone under a false name,
there is just about no way of tracing the owner. I believe that this is the
same for most packages, although roumors have been floating round ph.uk that
some require a postal registration (easily defeated). Most services allow
topping up by pre-payed card or credit/debit card. This is where the fun
begins. Topping up can be done automatically over the fone by calling 191 on
Vodafone and asking to top up by credit/debit card. I assume you have your
own method of getting these numbers (docs are required too). Just give the
details and off you go. It also helps to re-register the fone with the docs
on the card. This works on analouge particularly well because there is no
postal registration required. On digital PAYT you must register two cards by
post if you wish to top up. This does not make it impossible to fraud, just
more difficult. Because of this, if you were choosing PAYT go for the
analouge option (I know the quality is bad but, hey, its free aint it?)
Other roumors going round is that new PAYT cards can be generated from old
using a simple checksum formula. I'll definetly get back with more news on
this as/when it comes.

Also doable is to social engineer the reference code of your local shop for
your provider (go for the big superstores who know less about fones). This
means you can fone up, say your local store were out of cards and they said
to give you the reference number and you'd sort out a top up. A pretty lame
way which would wear thin eventually. So heres the basics of PAYT fraud, I'll
get the news updated next ish and will certainly check out other packages OK?

                            Presents: WoDNet



Founded by Dialt0ne
Date file created 11/21/98

INTRODUCTION

What's up all of my hackers and phreakers this is Dialt0ne coming from the
Hacker Head Quarters where the WoD Servers are stored.  WoDNet was made
becuase I personally got sick of are government and ever other government
out there.  WoDNet consists of files that you couldn't find even if you
wanted to in your local search engine.  This server uses encryption used
by the russian government and military and to this day is unbreakable.
The server is just a home base for the hackers/phreakers of WoD can
upload,download,chat, post messages on the message board etc....  This
file will give you a over all view of how the WoD System works, people who
run it and also some of it's members.  


SECURITY

The security of WoDNet is very strict.  There are atleast 2 SysOp
(Sys-Admins) on at all times.  WoDNet follows B2 standards of DoD
(department of defense : Orange book)  System Evaluation Criteria which
states that it must have labeled security protection, label integrity,
exportation of labeled information, and the list goes on.  When a program
of any type is uploaded to the server it is automatically encrypted with
one of the many unbreakable encryption algorithms that WoD has.  After the
file is uploaded it is placed in a certain directory which I check ever
night, if they file is a txt of some sort then I will briefly read over it
and see if it's worth being put onto the server, and also if it's a
program of some sort it is mandatory that the uploader include a txt on
how this program works etc.... Security is the #1 piorty on this server if
an unauthorized user is found in the server, action will be taken, and we
will persecute to the highest degree. At the Hacker Head Quaters where the
WoD server is found with various other computers that work along with it
there is a series of steps you have to go threw to get in.  I will not
explain in detail ever aspect on the system specs but I will give a brief
over view.  To get past the main server, firewall, screening router, you
will have to have 1 login, 4 passwords.  In which the user is only allowed
two chances of trying to log in after that the account will be disabled
for approx 2hrs or more.  And as this is happening several system monitor
tools will be sending messages to me, and the other SysOp on the system to
tell them what is going on at the moment.  I am not going to get into what
are on the internal servers after you get past the main one but the
security on those are the same or even more severe then the main server.
I keep saying main server but only thing it really is, is a gateway to the
internal network but if you want to have a crack at it first you have to
find it, but if you do try to hack it all you want, but I will warn you
now your hacking days will be soon over once you try.


ACCESS

Access to the WoDNet will be far and few between.  I do not go out looking
for members to join this army.  They come to me, and once they, do they
will go threw a 3-6 week screening process which will consists of:  I will
give you a certain thing to do and if you can complete it in the time
period I give you : we will have one of the guys in WoD to perform a
back ground check (and yes we will get your real docs) : 

This is all I will say about the screening process at this point.

The screening process will be tough and if you can get threw all the task
that me and another WoD member ask you to do then you might be considered
(notice that considered) to be a part of this up rising computer army.                                                                                                                                                                                         

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
PURPOSE

The purpose of WoD is to let the world know about some of the illegal
things that the government is doing.  Also projects they plan on doing
wiht out the notification of the citizens of the free world at all.  But
the government doesn't care, they could care less, but WoD will change
that for ever.  WoD will also shut down and humilate some of those so
called "leet" hacking groups out there at the moment such as HcV, Tk, HBK
and the list goes on.  These groups that I've listed alone hack webpages
just to brag.  Saying to there other so called "leet" friends look what I
did I'm powerful and I know all etc...  In which the only thing most of
these groups do is go to www.rootshell.com and download ever expoit in
there archive then find a system so they can use it on.  THAT IS NOT
HACKING that is running a program that does it for you.  It's not the
point of having a program that can assist you such as after you gain root
you would write up a little program that will allow you to log into the
system undetected under various accounts such as login: a password: a.
Now that takes some skills in varies areas such as programming.  But what
these groups are doing now a days is just totally annoying and childish.
But soon these groups and the world will see what WoD has in store for
them we will have control over most of the computer communications on the
net and also tele-communications all over the world.  There are members
from WoD from the United States, Germany, China, New Mexico and many other
countries around the globe.  The petty Computer Crime Division will not be
able to stop us even with there best prayers.  We will attack on certain
dates and they will be very planned out to limit the mistakes
tremendously. There will be destruction and chaos from now on and there
will be certain  reasons listed for each attack in detail.  

This is all that will be said for now, when we strike you will learn more.  


NETWORKS

WoDNet does not just consist of the computers in side the Hackers Head
Quarters but it also consists of a wan that strechs all across the world.
In which certain parts of it are very slow, but others are extermely fast.
These servers are placed to insure that if one server of WoD is taken down
for one reason or another, the network will still be up so that we do not
lose contact from each other and the destruction can continue.  

No more will be said on this topic!


CONTACT

You will not be able to contact me or any other WoD member directly, no
one will even know what the server address is so they may try to connect.
If you are thinking in your mind at the moment that you would like to be a
part of this group just remember we only accept the best (or close enough
to it) out there.  NO SCRIPT KIDDIES  And even if you do know who I am or
you know me personally the server address will never be given out until
you are verified and are accepted and voted in by most of the members.
But some times you may find me on IRC server efnet or some times on
Tele-Conferences.  

So if you need me you should know how to find me.

BT Test Codes  .......::::::::::::|||lllSSS$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
By Onion & Barakis .....::::::::::::|||lllSSSS$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
02-December 1998 .....::::::::::::|||lllSSSS$$$$$$$$$&$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

We Socially Engineered this info out of some guy who went to B.T. for work
experience. He just wandered around lifting interesting bits of paper and
stuff. We also got a lot of other crap, codes for the local exchange etc. but
these should work from any B.T. line. 175: Works on; old payfones (the ones
with the metal casing, there's still loads of them about.) 

What it does; when the fone starts going "beepbeepbeepbeepbeep" you can enter
various codes.

CODES:  01 gives a strange tone.
        02 powers the fone down for 3 minutes. It should say "no cash calls".

        this is great phun when some little kid keeps pestering you to get
        out of the fonebox. I think is also wipes out your caller I.D. and
        you cannot be traced while it is powered down, but don't hold me to
        that. 06 is supposed to power down the exchange, but doesn't seem to
        work. You can hit 02 after 06 to power the fone down, though. 175/176
        rings the fone back. There are others which I can't remember, most
        just send tones down the line.

        176: Works on; new, plastic cased fones.

        What it does; same as 175. On some fones, you may have to enter it
        several times to get it to work. You will know it's working when you
        get that "beepbeepbeep".

         17070: Works on; B.T. fones. If in a payfone, you have to put 10p in
         (you get it back)

         What it does; the only thing this doesn't do is make your tea for
         you. It's the B.T. line test facility. It starts out by reading out
         the number of the fone you are calling from (use a payfone), then
         gives you some options. You can run ringback tests, send dodgy (and
         bloody loud!) tones down people's lines, and probably lots of other
         stuff too. It even makes french fries in 6 different ways!
         Experiment with this one, as I have been far too busy to find out
         all the capabilities of this thing. Have phun!

werd. in this article i will explain a bit about country direct numbers and
also list all of the country direct numbers from the UK and the US.
Country direct numbers are toll free numbers that go direct to an operator
in the desired country.  They have been set up so foreign visitors, tourists
and business men can call the country direct number of their country and
either use a charge card or bill the call to their home phone bill making it
a lot easier to call abroad.  These numbers have all been put in the
0800 89X-XXX section.
These numbers are useful to phreaks because you can abuse charge cards using
most of these numbers and some are c5 lines, which obviously means that you
can blue box over them.

The following is a table of the assigned country direct numbers from the UK

CCS stands for Common Channel Signalling and forms the basis of our SS7 phone
networks. SS7 is different from previous switching systems because it has a
unique feature. The data used to control the system is seperate from the
voice circuit, so boxing an SS7 system is not possible. Modems are employed
to transmit and recieve the serial binary data over *analogue* transmission
channels, effectivly seperating the switching from the speech, so it would be
imposible to do a captain crunch down the phone with your whistle.

CCS has it's advantages for the phone companys. For example:

*Faster signalling rates
*CCS can accomodate a larger volume of signals
*The system can handle siganals during the speech period.
*Signalling patterns, reates etc, can be cahnged at anytime.
*It's cost effiective for large networking hierarchys.

CCS, however, gives rise to requirements which do not arise with signalling
on speech-path systems such as:

*High order error rate performance
*Signalling link security backup
*Assurance of speech-path continuity as, unlike speech-path signalling, CCS.
does not establish speech path integrity.

General features of CCS:

*Information may be transferred as signal messages of varying bit length, or
by defined signal units. 

*Each signalling channel operates in the synchronous mode with its continuous
bit stream divided into contiguous signal units which all contain the same
number of bits for the same application or service. The two signalling
channels of a link need not necessarily be synchronised to each other, and if
not, drift may arise between the signal units in the respective directions,
which, in certain implementations of CCS (e.g. CCITT 6 system) may require
compensation arrangements.

*Synchronisation (idle) units are transmitted when message signals are not
being transmitted, to maintain signal unit synchronism on the signalling
channel.

*The signal unit is divided into a number of constituent bit fields each
having its own function in the system, typically, heading, signal
information, circuit label, parity check, etc.

*As the CCS link is time-shared, each message signal requires identification
of the speech circuit (and thus the call) to which it belongs. This is by
means of a circuit label bit-field of size depending on the number of speech
circuits to be identified.

*As CCS signals do not prove the continuity of the speech path selected,
other arrangements (e.g. per-call continuity check, routine testing of idle
paths) must be made.

*Errors are liable to occur in the signal-transfer process and some form of
error control is required as the uncorrected error-rate of transmission plant
is usually unacceptable for c.c s. Error detection is based on redundant
coding, the parity check bits being, typically, part of each signal unit.
Error correction can be, and usually is in telephony CCS, by retransmission.
Despite the incorporation of error control, undetected errors may arise. Even
with a high degree of error correction a signalling link could be unusable
for varying periods, which requires signalling security backup.

*For signalling 'security', signals may be directed, by automatic procedures,
from a regular signalling link to an alternative signalling facility when an
excessive error rate, or complete failure, of the regular link is detected.

*On multilink connections, signalling information is transmitted on a link-by
-link basis, the signals being transferred from one link to the next only
after processing. This is a majour feature of CCS.

*Since the circuit label may require a substantial proportion of the bits
available in a signal unit, comparatively few bits may remain for coding the
information a message has to convey. It follows that when the information is
even moderately extensive, and particularly when it has a data content which
can vary from one message to another, it cannot be transmitted efficiently by
a succession of single signal unit messages. Instead, the initial circuit
label carrying signal unit may be augmented by one or more subsequent signal
units in which all the available bits can be used for carrying the
information, thus producing an efficient multiunit message. Thus lone signal
units (LSU) and multi-unit messages (MUM) may apply with CCS, and in the
latter case the initial signal unit (ISU) carries the circuit label bit-field
for the whole MUM. Each SU in a MUM carries its own check bit-field.

1.  Introduction

Although wiretaps are generally illegal in the United States, the federal
government and the governments of thirty seven states have been authorized
through federal and state legislation to intercept wire and electronic
communications under certain stringent rules which include obtaining a court
order.  These rules have been designed to ensure the protection of individual
privacy and Fourth Amendment rights, while permitting the use of wiretaps for
investigations of serious criminal activity and for foreign intelligence.

This article describes the legal requirements for government interceptions of
wire and electronic communications and some of the additional procedures and
practices followed by federal and state agencies.  The legal requirements are
rooted in two pieces of federal legislation: the Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act (Title III of the Act (hereafter "Title III")), passed in
1968, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), passed in 1978.
Title III established the basic law for federal and state law enforcement
interceptions performed for the purpose of criminal investigations, while
FISA established the law for federal-level interceptions performed for
intelligence and counterintelligence operations.  We will first describe
Title III interceptions and then describe FISA interceptions.

2.  Title III Interceptions

Title III, as amended (particularly by the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986), is codified at Title 18 USC, Sections 2510-2521. These statutes
provide privacy protection for and govern the interception of oral, wire, and
electronic communications.  Title III covers all telephone communications
regardless of the medium, except that it does not cover the radio portion of
a cordless telephone communication that is transmitted between the handset
and base unit. The law authorizes the interception of oral, wire, and
electronic communications by investigative and law enforcement officers
conducting criminal investigations pertaining to serious criminal offenses,
i.e., felonies, following the issuance of a court order by a judge. The Title
III law authorizes the interception of particular criminal communications
related to particular criminal offenses.  In short, it authorizes the
acquisition of evidence of crime.  It does not authorize noncriminal
intelligence gathering, nor does it authorize interceptions related to social
or political views.

Thirty seven states have statutes permitting interceptions by state and local
law enforcement officers for certain types of criminal investigations.  All
of the state statutes are based upon Title III from which they are derivative
These statutes must be at least as restrictive as Title III, and in fact most
are more restrictive in their requirements.  In describing the legal
requirements, we will focus on those of Title III since they define the
baseline for all wiretaps performed by federal, state, and local law
enforcement agencies.

In recent years, state statutes have been modified to keep pace with rapid
technological advances in telecommunications.  For example, New Jersey
amended its electronic surveillance statute in 1993 to include cellular
telephones, cordless telephones, digital display beepers, fax transmissions,
computer-to-computer communications, and traces obtained through "caller-ID".

Wiretaps are limited to the crimes specified in Title III and state statutes.
In New Jersey, the list includes murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery,
bribery, aggravated assault, wrongful credit practices, terrorist threats,
arson, burglary, felony thefts, escape, forgery, narcotics trafficking *LOL*
firearms trafficking, racketeering, and organized crime.

Most wiretaps are large undertakings, requiring a substantial use of
resources.  In 1992, the average cost of installing intercept devices and
monitoring communications was $46,492.  Despite budget constraints and
personnel shortages, law enforcement conducts wiretaps as necessary, but
obviously, because of staffing and costs, judiciously.
  
2.1  Application for a Court Order

All government wiretaps require a court order based upon a detailed showing
of probable cause.  To obtain a court order, a three-step process is involved
First, the law enforcement officer responsible for the investigation must
draw up a detailed affidavit showing that there is probable cause to believe
that the target telephone is being used to facilitate a specific, serious,
indictable crime.

Second, an attorney for the federal, state, or local government must work
with the law enforcement officer to prepare an application for a court order,
based upon the officer's affidavit.  At the federal level, the application
must be approved by the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate
Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant
Attorney General, or any Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
Division designated by the Attorney General.  At the state and local level,
the application must be made and approved by the principal prosecuting
attorney of the state (State Attorney General) or political subdivision
thereof (District Attorney or County Prosecutor).  The attorney must be
authorized by a statute of that state to make such applications.

Third, the attorney must present the approved application ex parte (without
an adversary hearing) to a federal or state judge who is authorized to issue
a court order for electronic surveillance.  A state or local police officer
or federal law enforcement agent cannot make an application for a court order
directly to a judge.

Typically, a court order is requested after a lengthy investigation and the
use of a "Dialed Number Recorder" (DNR).  The DNR is used to track the
outgoing calls from the suspect's phone in order to demonstrate that the
suspect is communicating with known criminals.

Title III requires that an application for a court order specify:

   (a) the investigative or law enforcement officer making the
       application and the high-level government attorney authorizing
       the application;

   (b) the facts and circumstances of the case justifying the
       application, including details of the particular offense under
       investigation, the identity of the person committing it, the
       type of communications sought, and the nature and location of
       the communication facilities;

   (c) whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried
       and failed or why they would likely fail or be too dangerous;
   
   (d) the period of time for the interception (at most 30 days -
       extensions may be permitted upon reapplication);

   (e) the facts concerning all previous applications involving any of
       the same persons or facilities;

   (f) where the application is for the extension of an order, the
       results thus far obtained from the interception.

The process of making an application for a court order is further restricted
by internal procedures adopted by law enforcement agencies to ensure that
wiretaps conform to the laws and are used only when justified.  The following
describes the process for the FBI and the New York State Police.

2.1.1  FBI Applications . Call the FBI from the UK:  0800-961-238

In order for an FBI agent to conduct an interception, the agent must follow
procedures that go well beyond the legal requirements imposed by Title III
and which involve extensive internal review.  In preparing the affidavit,
the FBI agent in the field works with the field office principal legal
advisor and also with an attorney in the local U.S. Attorney's Office,
revising the documentation to take into account their comments and
suggestions.  After the documents are approved by field office management,
they are submitted to the Department of Justice's Office of Enforcement
Operations (OEO) in the Criminal Division and to the FBI Headquarters (HQ).
At FBI HQ, the documents go to the Legal Counsel Division (LCD) and the
Criminal Investigative Division (CID).  Within the CID, they are sent to the
program manager of the criminal program unit relating to the type of
violation under investigation, e.g., organized crime.  The program manager
determines whether the subjects of the proposed interception are worthy
targets of investigation and whether the interception is worth doing.
Attorneys in the FBI's LCD and the DOJ's OEO further refine the documents.

After the documents are approved by the DOJ's OEO and by FBI HQ, they are
referred to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General (or above), who reviews the
documents and signs off on them.  At this point, the DOJ authorizes the local
U.S. Attorney's Office to file the final version of the documents
(application, affidavit, court order, and service provider order) in court.
The U.S. Attorney's Office then submits the documents and the DOJ
authorization to a federal judge.  The entire process can take as long as a
month.

The following summarizes the people and organizations involved in the
preparation or approval of the application and the issuance of a court order:

   1.  FBI agent
   2.  FBI field office attorney (principal legal advisor)
   3.  FBI field office management
   4.  Attorney in local U.S. Attorney's office
   5.  DOJ Office of Enforcement Operations (OEO)
   6.  FBI HQ Legal Counsel Division (LCD)
   7.  FBI HQ Criminal Investigative Division (CID)
   8.  DOJ Deputy Assistant Attorney General (or higher)
   9.  Federal District Court judge


2.1.2  New York State Police Applications

Within the New York State Police, electronic surveillance is conducted by
Senior Investigators in the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). In
preparing an affidavit, the investigator works with the District Attorney's
Office (or, in the case of a federal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's
office) and with the BCI Captain of the investigator's troop.  (Wiretap
applications can be made and approved by the State Attorney General, but this
is unusual.)  The Captain assesses whether review by Division Headquarters is
necessary and confers with the Assistant Deputy Superintendent (ADS) or
Headquarters Captain for final determination.  If Headquarters review is
deemed necessary, then all documentation is sent to the ADS along with a
memorandum, endorsed by the Troop Unit Supervisor and the Troop or Detail
Commander, requesting approval.  If Headquarters review is deemed
unnecessary, then the memo is sent without the documentation.  Once the ADS
and District Attorney (DA) approve the application, the DA submits the
application to a judge who grants or denies the court order.

2.2  Issuance of a Court Order

Not all judges have the authority to grant court orders for wiretaps. In New
Jersey, for example, only eight judges are designated as "wiretap judges" for
the entire state.  These judges are given special training to be sensitive to
personal rights of privacy and to recognize the importance of telephone
intercepts for law enforcement.

Before a judge can approve an application for electronic surveillance and
issue a court order, the judge must determine that:

   (a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is
       committing, has committed, or is about to commit an offense
       covered by the law;

   (b) there is probable cause for belief that particular
       communications concerning that offense will be obtained through
       such interception;

   (c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed
       or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed or to be too dangerous;

   (d) there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from
       which, or the place where the communications are to be
       intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in
       connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased
       to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.

In addition to showing probable cause, one of the main criterion for
determining whether a court order should be issued is whether normal
investigative techniques have been or are likely to be unsuccessful
(criterion (c) above).  Electronic surveillance is a tool of last resort and
cannot be used if other methods of investigation could reasonably be used
instead.  Such normal investigative methods usually include visual
surveillance, interviewing subjects, the use of informers, telephone record
analysis, and DNRs.  However, these techniques often have limited impact on
an investigation.  Continuous surveillance by police can create suspicion and
therefore be hazardous; further, it cannot disclose the contents of telephone
conversations. Questioning identified suspects or executing search warrants
at their residence can substantially jeopardize an investigation before the
full scope of the operation is revealed, and information can be lost through
interpretation.  Informants are useful and sought out by police, but the
information they provide does not always reveal all of the players or the
extent of an operation, and great care must be taken to ensure that the
informants are protected.  Moreover, because informants are often criminals
themselves, they may not be believed in court. Telephone record analysis and
DNRs are helpful, but do not reveal the contents of conversations or the
identities of parties.  Other methods of investigation that may be tried
include undercover operations and stings.  But while effective in some cases,
undercover operations are difficult and dangerous, and stings do not always
work.

If the judge approves the application, then a court order is issued
specifying the relevant information given in the application, namely, the
identity of the person (if known) whose communications are to be intercepted,
the nature and location of the communication facilities, the type of
communication to be intercepted and the offense to which it relates, the
agency authorized to perform the interception and the person authorizing the
application, and the period of time during which such interception is
authorized.  A court order may also require that interim status reports be
made to the issuing judge while the wiretap is in progress.

2.3  Emergencies

In an emergency situation where there is immediate danger of death or serious
physical injury to any person, or conspiratorial activities threatening
national security or characteristic of organized crime, Title III permits any
investigative or law enforcement officer specially designated by the Attorney
General, the Deputy Attorney General, or the Associate Attorney General, or
by the principal prosecuting attorney of any state or subdivision thereof, to
intercept communications provided an application for a court order is made
within 48 hours.  In the event a court order is not issued, the contents of
any intercepted communication is treated as having been obtained in violation
of Title III.

In New York State, even an emergency situation requires a court order from a
judge.  However, the judge may grant a temporary court order based on an oral
application from the District Attorney.  The oral communication must be
recorded and transcribed, and must be followed by a written application
within 24 hours.  The duration of a temporary warrant cannot exceed 24 hours
and cannot be renewed except through a written application.

2.4  Execution of a Court Order 

2.4.1  Installation of a Wiretap

To execute a court order for a wiretap, the investigative or law enforcement
officer takes the court order or emergency provision to the communications
service provider.  Normally, the service provider is the local exchange
carrier.  When served with a court order, the service provider (or landlord,
custodian, or other person named) is mandated under Title III to assist in
the execution of the interception by providing all necessary information,
facilities, and technical assistance.  The service provider is compensated
for reasonable expenses incurred.  In light of rapid technological
developments including cellular telephones and integrated computer networks,
the New Jersey statute also requires the service provider to give technical
assistance and equipment to fulfill the court order.  This requirement has
not yet been tested in court.

Normally, the government leases a line from the service provider and the
intercepted communications are transmitted to a remote government monitoring
facility over that line.  In many cases, the bridging connection is made
within the service provider's central office facility.  Alternatively, a law
enforcement agency may request the service provider to give the "pairs and
appearances" (a place to connect to the suspect's line) in the "local loop"
for the suspect's phone.  A law enforcement technician then makes the
connection.

When a suspect's telephone is subject to change (e.g., because the person is
attempting to evade or thwart interception), then a "roving" wiretap, which
suspends the specification of the telephone, may be used.  In this case,
prior to intercepting communications, the officer must use some other method
of surveillance in order to determine the exact location and/or telephone
number of the facility being used. Once determined, the location or telephone
number is given to the service provider for coordination and prompt
assistance.  The officer may not intercept communications randomly in order
to track a person (random or mass surveillance is not permitted under any
circumstances).

2.4.2  Minimization

Once any electronic surveillance begins, the law enforcement officer must
"minimize" -- that is, attempt to limit the interception of communications to
the specified offenses in the court order.  Prior to the surveillance, a
federal or state attorney holds a "minimization meeting" with the
investigators who will be participating in the case to ensure that the rules
are followed.

Minimization is normally accomplished by turning off the intercept and then
performing a spot check every few minutes to determine if the conversation
has turned to the subject of the court order.  This avoids picking up family
gossip.  Special problems may arise where criminals communicate in codes that
are designed to conceal criminal activity in what sounds like mundane
household discussion.  If an intercepted communication is in a code or
foreign language, and if someone is not reasonably available to interpret the
code or foreign language, then the conversation can be recorded and
minimization deferred until an expert in that code or language is available
to interpret the communication.  Should a wiretap fail to meet the
minimization parameters, all of the evidence obtained from the wiretap could
be inadmissible.

2.4.3  Recording

All intercepted communications are to be recorded when possible.  As a
practical mater, law enforcement officers make working copies of the original
tapes.  In many instances at the state and local level, the originals are
delivered to the prosecutor's office and maintained in the prosecutor's
custody.  The copies are screened by the case officer for pertinent
conversations (e.g., "I'll deliver the dope at 8:00 pm.").  A compilation of
the relevant conversations, together with the corroboratory surveillances
often provides the probable cause for search warrants and/or arrest warrants.

2.4.4  Termination of Electronic Surveillance

Electronic surveillance must terminate upon attainment of the objectives, or
in any event within 30 days. To continue an interception beyond 30 days, the
officer, through a government attorney, must apply for and be granted an
extension based upon a new application and court order.

When the period of a court order, or extension thereof, expires, the original
tapes must be made available to the issuing judge and sealed under court
supervision.  The tapes must be maintained in such fashion for 10 years.

2.5  Notification and Use of Intercepted Communications as Evidence

Upon termination of an interception, the judge who issued the court order
must notify the persons named in the order that the interception took place.
Normally, this must be done within 90 days, but it may be postponed upon
showing of good cause.  If the judge determines that it would be in the
interest of justice to make portions of the intercepted communications
available to the subjects, the judge may do so.

The contents of the communications may not be used as evidence in any trial
or hearing unless each party has received a copy of the application and court
order at least 10 days in advance of the trial, and has been given the
opportunity to move to suppress the evidence.  A motion to suppress the
evidence may be made on the grounds that it was not obtained in complete
conformance with the laws.

2.6  Reports

Within 30 days after the expiration or denial of a court order, Title III
requires that the judge provide information about the order to the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO). Each year the
Attorney General (or a designated Assistant Attorney General) must report, on
behalf of the federal government, to the AO a summary of all orders and
interceptions for the year; reports for state and local jurisdictions are
made by the principal prosecuting attorney of the jurisdiction.  The AO then
integrates these summaries into an annual report: "Report on Applications for
Orders Authorizing or Approving the Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic
Communications (Wiretap Report)" covering all federal and state electronic
surveillance, including wiretaps.  The 1992 report is about 200 pages and
includes information about each interception authorized in 1992, update
information for interceptions authorized in 1982-1991, and summary statistics
The summary statistics include the following data (numbers in parenthesis are
the 1992 figures):

   (1) number of interceptions authorized (919), denied (0), and
       installed (846)

   (2) average duration (in days) of original authorization (28) and
       extensions (30)

   (3) the place/facility where authorized (303 single family dwelling,
       135 apartment, 3 multi-dwelling, 119 business, 4 roving, 66
       combination, 289 other)

   (4) major offenses involved (634 narcotics, 90 racketeering, 66
       gambling, 35 homicide/ assault, 16 larceny/theft, 9 kidnapping,
       8 bribery, 7 loansharking/usury/extortion, 54 other)

   (5) average number of (a) persons intercepted (117), (b)
       interceptions (1,861), and (c) incriminating intercepts (347)
       per order where interception devices were installed

   (6) average cost of interception ($46,492)

   (7) type of surveillance used for the 846 interceptions installed
       (632 telephone, 38 microphone, 113 electronic, 63 combination)

   (8) number of persons arrested (2,685) and convicted (607) as the
       result of 1992 intercepts

   (9) activity taking place during 1992 as the result of intercepts
       terminated in years 1982-1991, including number of arrests
       (1211), trials (280), motions to suppress that are granted (14),
       denied (141), and pending (37), and convictions (1450) (there is
       a lag between interceptions, arrests, and convictions, with many
       arrests and most convictions associated with a wiretap that
       terminated in one year taking place in subsequent years)

Most of the above data is broken down by jurisdiction.  Of the 919 authorized
intercepts, 340 (37%) were federal.  New York State had 197, New Jersey 111,
Florida 80, and Pennsylvania 77.  The remaining 114 intercepts were divided
among 18 states, none of which had more than 17 intercepts.  During the past
decade, the average number of authorized intercepts per year has been about
780.

Individual law enforcement agencies also require internal reports.  For
example, the New York Sate Police requires that each week, the Troop or
Detail Captain prepare a report summarizing the status of all eavesdropping
activity within the unit, including the productivity and plans for each
electronic surveillance installation and a brief synopsis of pertinent
activity.  This is sent to the New York State Police Division Headquarters
Captain who prepares a report summarizing the status of all eavesdropping i
nstallations.

One of the reasons for the significant amount of post wiretap reporting is to
provide a substantial record for legislatures when considering whether or not
to reenact or modify wiretap statutes.

3.  FISA Interceptions

Title 50 USC, Sections 1801-1811, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act (FISA) of 1978, covers electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence
purposes (including counterintelligence and counterterrorism).  It governs
wire and electronic communications sent by or intended to be received by
United States persons (citizens, aliens lawfully admitted for permanent
residence, corporations, and associations of U.S. persons) who are in the
U.S. when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be
required for law enforcement purposes; nonconsensual wire intercepts that are
implemented within the U.S.; and radio intercepts when the sender and all
receivers are in the U.S. and a warrant would be required for law enforcement
purposes.  It does not cover intercepts of U.S. persons who are overseas
(unless the communications are with a U.S. person who is inside the U.S.).
Electronic surveillance conducted under FISA is classified.

FISA authorizes electronic surveillance of foreign powers and agents of
foreign powers for foreign intelligence purposes.  Normally, a court order is
required to implement a wiretap under FISA.  There are, however, two
exceptions.  The first is when the communications are exclusively between or
among foreign powers or involve technical intelligence other than spoken
communications from a location under the open and exclusive control of a
foreign power; there is no substantial risk that the surveillance will
acquire the communications to or from a U.S.person; and proposed minimization
procedures meet the requirements set forth by the law.  Under those
conditions, authorization can be granted by the President through the
Attorney General for a period up to one year.  The second is following a
declaration of war by Congress.  Then the President, though the Attorney
General, can authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence
purposes without a court order for up to 15 days.

Orders for wiretaps are granted by a special court established by FISA.  The
court consists of seven district court judges appointed by the Chief Justice
of the United States.  Judges serve seven-year terms.

3.1  Application for a Court Order

Applications for a court order are made by Federal officers and require
approval by the Attorney General.  Each application must include:

  (1) the Federal officer making the application;

  (2) the Attorney General's approval;

  (3) the target of the electronic surveillance;

  (4) justification that the target is a foreign power or agent of a
      foreign power (except no U.S person can be considered a foreign power
      or agent thereof solely based on activities protected by the First
      Amendment) and that the facilities or places where the surveillance
      is be directed will be used by the same;
 
  (5) the proposed minimization procedures, which must meet certain
      requirements to protect the privacy of U.S. persons;

  (6) the nature of the information sought and type of communications
      subjected to surveillance;

  (7) certification(s) by the Assistant to the President for National
      Security Affairs or other high-level official in the area of
      national security or defense (Presidential appointee subject to
      Senate confirmation) that the information sought is foreign
      intelligence information and that such information cannot
      reasonably be obtained by normal investigative methods;

  (8) the means by which the surveillance will be effected;

  (9) the facts concerning all previous applications involving the same
      persons, facilities, or places;

 (10) the period of time for the interception (maximum 90 days or,
      when the target is a foreign power, one year);

 (11) coverage of all surveillance devices to be employed and the
      minimization procedures applying to each.

Some of the above information can be omitted when the target is a
foreign power.  

Within the FBI, the process of applying for a court order under FISA is
as exacting and subject to review as under Title III.  The main
differences are that under FISA, the FBI Intelligence Division is
involved rather than the Criminal Investigative Division, the DOJ
Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) is involved rather than
either the U.S. Attorney's Office or the DOJ Criminal Division, and the
application is approved by the Attorney General (or Acting Attorney
General) rather than by a lower DOJ official.

3.2  Issuance of a Court Order

Before a judge can approve an application, the judge must determine
that the authorizations are valid; that there is probable cause to
believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign
power or agent of a foreign power and that the facilities or places
where the surveillance is be directed will be used by the same; and
that the proposed minimization procedures meet the requirements set
forth in the law.  If the judge approves the application, an order is
issued specifying the relevant information from the application and
directing the communication carrier, landlord, custodian, or other
specified person to furnish all necessary information, facilities, and
technical assistance and to properly maintain under security procedures
any records relating to the surveillance.

3.3  Emergencies

In an emergency situation, the Attorney General or designee can
authorize the use of electronic surveillance provided the judge is
notified at the time and an application is made to the judge within 24
hours.  If such application is not obtained, then the judge notifies
any U.S. persons named in the application or subject to the
surveillance, though such notification can be postponed or forgone upon
showing of good cause.

3.4  Use of Intercepted Communications as Evidence

Like Title III, FISA places strict controls on what information can be
acquired through electronic surveillance and how such information can
be used.  No information can be disclosed for law enforcement purposes
except with the proviso that it may only be used in a criminal
proceedings under advance authorization from the Attorney General.  If
the government intends to use such information in court, then the
aggrieved person must be notified in advance.  The person may move to
suppress the evidence.

3.5  Reports

Each year, the Attorney General must give the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts (AO) a report of the number of FISA
applications and the number of orders and extensions granted, modified,
or denied.  In 1992, there were 484 orders.  Since 1979, there has been
an average of a little over 500 FISA orders per year.

Because intercepts conducted under FISA are classified, detailed
information analogous to that required under Title III is not reported
to the AO, nor made available to the public.  However, records of
Attorney General certifications, applications, and orders granted must
be held for at least 10 years, and the Attorney General must inform two
Congressional oversight committees of all surveillance activity on a
semiannual basis.  These committees are the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.
