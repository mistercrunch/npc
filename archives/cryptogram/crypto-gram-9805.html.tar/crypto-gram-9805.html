<a name="nonsecret"><H2>The Secret Story of Non-Secret Encryption</H2></a>

<P>On Dec 16, 1997 the GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA, released a 
document stating that they had invented public key cryptography several years 
before it was discovered by the research community.  According to the paper, 
they had discovered both RSA and Diffie-Hellman, and had kept their discoveries 
secret.

<P>During World War II, some unknown researcher at Bell Telephone Labs had the 
idea that a reciever could inject noise onto a communications circuit and 
effectively drown out any signal.  An eavesdropper would only hear the noise, 
but the receiver could subtract the noise and recover the signal.  The 
interesting idea here is that the sender doesn't have to know any encryption 
&quot;key&quot; in order to send a secret message to the receiver; the receiver does all 
the work.  (This is essentially what echo-canceling modems do; they scream at 
each other along the same line, and subtract out their own signal when they 
listen for the other.)  The research was promptly classified by the US 
Government.

<P>Fast forward to 1960 in the U.K.  Intrigued by this idea, James Ellis wrote a 
classified paper providing an existence proof of &quot;non-secret encryption.&quot;  It's 
a thoroughly impractical scheme, with large tables and other pre-computer 
cryptographic ideas, but there it was.

<P>In 1973 Clifford Cocks (another British spook) published a classified paper 
where he described (essentially) RSA.  And in 1974, M.J. Williamson invented 
another classified algorithm, remarkably similar to Diffie-Hellman.

<P>Those who pay attention to such things believe that the GCHG claims are 
valid, and that the mathematics of public-key cryptography were discovered 
within the intelligence community several years before they were discovered by 
academic cryptographers.  But while they may have discovered the mathematics, it 
is clear that they never understood its significance.

<P>Public-key cryptography is not used to encrypt data directly.  It is used for 
key exchange, key distribution, and digital signatures.  Its primary benefit is 
allowing people who have no pre-existing security arrangement to exchange 
messages securely, or for a sender to authenticate a message to a random 
receiver.

<P>The military world is a fixed hierarchy.  Key distribution works through the 
chain of command, and units trust their superiors.  Soldiers don't need to 
communicate with people they don't have pre-existing arrangements with; those 
people are either civilians or the enemy.  The problems that are immediately 
obvious to someone trying to secure the nutty world of business and personal 
communications just didn't occur to those trying to secure a military.

<P>So the British didn't envision their non-secret encryption as a solution to 
the key management problem, and the notion of digital signatures didn't occur to 
them.  It took Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie to invent 
public-key cryptography, and Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adelman to invent 
RSA.  (The British did not invent knapsack encryption or the ElGamal algorithm 
before it was published in the academic community.)

<P>This announcement by GCHQ doesn't mean that we're going to start calling RSA 
&quot;Cocks&quot; and Diffie-Hellman &quot;Williamson,&quot; but it is an interesting footnote to 
the history of modern cryptography.  And we still don't know if the NSA 
developed public-key cryptography before learning about it from the British or 
the press, as they have sometimes claimed.  But we do know that the first 
military device that used public-key cryptography, the STU-III telephone, was 
not built until the mid 1980s, long after the academic community expounded on 
the technology.

<P><STRONG>&quot;Conditional Purchase Orders&quot;</STRONG>

<P>J. Kelsey and B. Schneier, 4th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications 
Security, ACM Press, April 1997, pp. 117-124.

<P>This paper describes a system of commerce based on the Conditional Purchase 
Order (CPO).  This system is buyer-driven: individual buyers issue CPOs, which 
are evaluated and fulfilled by sellers.  There are mechanisms to bind the buyer 
to the transaction once a seller meets the conditions.  Additional enhancements 
include the ability to add anonymity, and assurances of product quality by 
trusted third parties.

<a name="aes"><H2>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</H2></a>

<P>In 1972 and 1974, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST) issued the first public request 
for an encryption standard.  The result was DES, arguably the most widely used 
and successful encryption algorithm in the world.  

<P>In response to a growing desire to replace DES (too-short key, too slow, too 
clunky), NIST announced the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) program in 1997.  
NIST solicited comments from the public on the proposed standard, and eventually 
issued a call for algorithms to satisfy the standard.  The intention is for NIST 
to make all submissions public and eventually, through a process of public 
review and comment, choose a new encryption standard to replace DES.  Think of 
it as a giant demolition derby: people submit algorithms and then beat on each 
other.  The last one standing wins.

<P>NIST's call requested a block cipher.  They wanted it to have a 128-bit block 
size (which effectively ruled out almost all existing algorithms), and key sizes 
of 128-, 192-, and 256-bits.  They wanted it to be efficient and flexible 
(whatever that means).  And they wanted it to be free, either unpatented or with 
patent right given away.

<P>About a dozen groups are working on a submission.  IBM has already submitted 
something, as did Cylink and RSADSI.  An Australian submission has appeared on 
the WWW, and Serpent was published at a conference in March.  I expect 
submissions from Katholieke Universiteit in Belgium, NTT in Japan, Entrust 
Technologies in Canada, and L'Ecole Normale Superieur in France.

<P>The NSA will not submit an algorithm.  They claim that NIST asked them not to 
submit, so they could be an impartial assistant judge rather than a participant.
