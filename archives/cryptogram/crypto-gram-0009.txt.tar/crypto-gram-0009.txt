    Full Disclosure and the Window of Exposure



To read this essay with the nifty graphs, see:
<http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0009.html#1>


Every season yields a bumper crop of computer security stories: break-ins, 
new vulnerabilities, new products.  But this season has also given us a 
crop of stories about computer security philosophy.  There has been a 
resurgence in opposition to the full disclosure movement: the theory that 
states that publishing vulnerabilities is the best way to fix them.  In 
response, defenders of the movement have published their rebuttals.  And 
even more experts have weighed in with opinions on the DeCSS case, where a 
New York judge ruled that distributing an attack tool is illegal.

What's interesting is that everybody wants the same thing; they're just 
disagreeing about the best way to get there.

When a security vulnerability exists in a product, it creates what I call a 
window of exposure.  This window exists until the vulnerability is patched, 
and that patch is installed.  The shape of this window depends on how many 
people can exploit this vulnerability, and how fast it is patched.  What 
everyone wants is to make this window as small as possible.

A window of exposure has five distinct phases.  Phase 1 is before the 
vulnerability is discovered.  The vulnerability exists, but no one can 
exploit it.  Phase 2 is after the vulnerability is discovered, but before 
it is announced.  At that point only a few people know about the 
vulnerability, but no one knows to defend against it.  Depending on who 
knows what, this could either be an enormous risk or no risk at 
all.  During this phase, news about the vulnerability spreads -- either 
slowly, quickly, or not at all -- depending on who discovered the 
vulnerability.  Of course, multiple people can make the same discovery at 
different times, so this can get very complicated.

Phase 3 is after the vulnerability is announced.  Maybe the announcement is 
made by the person who discovered the vulnerability in Phase 2, or maybe it 
is made by someone else who independently discovered the vulnerability 
later.  At that point more people learn about the vulnerability, and the 
risk increases.  In Phase 4, an automatic attack tool to exploit the 
vulnerability is published.  Now the number of people who can exploit the 
vulnerability grows exponentially.  Finally, the vendor issues a patch that 
closes the vulnerability, starting Phase 5.  As people install the patch 
and re-secure their systems, the risk of exploit shrinks.  Some people 
never install the patch, so there is always some risk.  But it decays over 
time as systems are naturally upgraded.

In some instances the phases are long, and sometimes they're 
short.  Sometimes Phase 5 happens so fast that Phases 3 and 4 never 
occur.  Sometimes Phase 5 never occurs, either because the vendor doesn't 
care or no fix is possible.  But this is basically the way things work.

The goal of any responsible security professional is to reduce the window 
of exposure -- the area under the curve -- as much as possible.  There are 
two basic approaches to this.

The first is to reduce the window in the space dimension by limiting the 
amount of vulnerability information available to the public.  The idea is 
that the less attackers know about attack methodologies, and the harder it 
is for them to get their hands on attack tools, the safer networks 
become.  The extreme position in this camp holds that attack tools should 
be made illegal.

This might work in theory, but unfortunately it is impossible to enforce in 
practice.  There is a continuous stream of research in security 
vulnerabilities, and most of this research results in public 
announcements.  Hackers write new attack exploits all the time, and the 
exploits quickly end up in the hands of malicious attackers.  Any one 
country could make some of these actions illegal, but it would make little 
difference on the international Internet.  There have been some isolated 
incidences of a researcher deliberately not publishing a vulnerability he 
discovered, but public dissemination of vulnerability information is the 
norm...because it is the best way to improve security.

The second approach is to reduce the window of exposure in time.  Since a 
window remains open until the vendor patches the vulnerability and the 
network administrator installs the patches, the faster the vendor can issue 
the patch the faster the window starts closing.  To spur the vendors to 
patch faster, full-disclosure proponents publish vulnerabilities far and 
wide.  Ideally, the vendor will distribute the patch before any automatic 
attack tools are written.  But writing such tools can only hasten the patches.

This also works a lot better in theory than in practice.  There are many 
instances of security-conscious vendors publishing patches in a timely 
fashion.  But there are just as many examples of security vendors ignoring 
problems, and of network administrators not bothering to install existing 
patches.  A series of credit card thefts in early 2000 was facilitated by a 
vulnerability in Microsoft IIS that was discovered, and a patch released 
for, a year and a half earlier.

The problem is that for the most part, the size and shape of the window of 
exposure is not under the control of any central authority.  Not publishing 
a vulnerability is no guarantee that someone else won't publish 
it.  Publishing a vulnerability is no guarantee that someone else won't 
write an exploit tool, and no guarantee that the vendor will fix 
it.  Releasing a patch is no guarantee that a network administrator will 
actually install it.  Trying to impose rules on such a chaotic system just 
doesn't work.

And to make matters worse, it's never one single vulnerability.  There are 
dozens and hundreds of vulnerabilities, all with overlapping windows.  One 
vulnerability might be shrinking while another ten are growing.  We're like 
the little Dutch boy, plugging leaks in the dike with our fingers while 
others spring up nearby.  It doesn't matter if we believe that full 
disclosure is the best way to reduce the window's size or if quietly 
alerting the vendor does better...we're going to lose the war fighting it 
either way.

Vulnerabilities are inevitable.  As our networks get more complex and more 
pervasive, the vulnerabilities will become more frequent, not less.  We're 
already seeing this; every year brings more security holes than the 
previous one.  The only way to close the window of exposure is to make it 
not matter.  And the only way to do that is to build security systems that 
are resilient to vulnerabilities.

In _Secrets and Lies_, I talk about security processes that make systems 
resilient to vulnerabilities.  The most relevant one to this debate is 
detection and response.  Most computer-security products are sold as 
prophylactics: firewalls prevent network intrusions, PKI prevents 
impersonation, encryption prevents eavesdropping, etc.  The problem with 
this model is that the product can either succeed or fail: either the 
window of exposure is closed or it is open.  Good security includes not 
only protection, but also detection and response.  An Internet alarm system 
that detects attacks in progress, regardless of the vulnerability that was 
exploited, has the ability to close the window of exposure completely.

The key to Internet detection and response is vigilance.  Attacks can 
happen at all times of the day and night, and any day of the year.  New 
attack tools appear all the time; new vulnerabilities become public all the 
time.  I built Counterpane Internet Security, Inc. as a managed security 
monitoring company because I saw this as the only way to bring security to 
computer networks.  Without outsourced detection and monitoring, we're at 
the mercy of all the hackers and product vendors and security professionals.

Those advocating secrecy are right that full disclosure causes damage, in 
some cases more damage than good.  They are also right that those who build 
attack tools should be held liable for their actions; the defense of "I 
just built the bomb; I didn't place it or set the fuse" rings hollow.  But 
they are wrong to think they can enforce secrecy.  Information naturally 
disseminates, and strategies that go against that are doomed.  Those 
advocating full disclosure are right that rapid dissemination of the 
information benefits everyone, even though some people make ill use of that 
information.  We would be in a much worse position today if vulnerability 
information were only in the hands of a privileged few.

Neither full disclosure nor secrecy "solve" computer security; the debate 
has no solution because there is no one solution.  Both sides are missing 
the point.  The real issue, how to close the window of exposure, is more 
subtle.  We have to stop thinking of software security as an end state, 
that fixing the bugs will somehow make the software perfect.  Security 
vulnerabilities are inevitable and there will always be a window of 
exposure; smart security solutions will work regardless.

             Carnivore Disinformation



This bit, from Newsweek's Periscope, sounds very much like government 
propaganda:

Tracking bin Laden's E-Mail

American counter-terrorism experts are aghast that the FBI has gone public 
with Carnivore, its new Internet-wiretap system.  The reason for their 
dismay: Osama bin Laden uses e-mail to communicate with his terrorist 
network.  The intelligence community's ability to track his messages has 
been, according to one intelligence source, "the biggest single factor in 
shutting down several planned operations," including some in the United 
States.  "Bin Laden thought his communications were secure," says the 
source.  "They weren't.  Now we've told him."

FBI officials acknowledge that Carnivore has been used about 25 times, 
primarily in terrorism investigations.  But they decline to comment on its 
use against bin Laden.  "Everyone knows we can wiretap phones," says a 
bureau spokesman.  "There's no reason why an ability to intercept e-mails 
must necessarily be covert."

      FBI Requires Constitutional Changes



It's hard to know what to think of this:

"One of the FBI requirements for the Internet kiosks at the 2002 Olympics 
is that the FBI be able to record all passwords, copy all sent email, and 
divert sent email for administrative decisions on whether it should be 
delivered."

If it is true, it is the most intrusive power grab we've seen so 
far.  Would there even be warning notices on the kiosks?  Would they demand 
eavesdropping rights on all direct computer hookups as well?  The mind boggles.

                PGP Vulnerability



A very serious PGP vulnerability was just discovered.  Using this 
vulnerability, an attacker can create a modified version of someone's 
public key that will force a sender to encrypt messages to that person AND 
to the attacker.

Let me explain.

Starting with PGP version 5.5, the software supported something called an 
Additional Decryption Key (ADK).  Normally, when a PGP user creates a PGP 
certificate, it contains a single public key (as well as identifying 
information as to who the key belongs to).  PGP version 5.5 and 6.x allow 
the user to add additional ADKs to the certificate.  When a sender encrypts 
a message to that user, PGP will automatically encrypt the message in both 
the user's public key and the ADK.  The idea is that the ADK belongs to the 
secret police, or the user's employer, or some organization, and that 
organization can intercept the encrypted message and read it.

(On Slashdot I said that Network Associates did this when they joined the 
Key Recovery Alliance, but PGP Inc. added the feature before then.  They 
needed it to get certain corporate contracts.)

The flaw is that some version of PGP don't require the ADKs to be in the 
signed portion of the PGP certificate.  What this means is that an 
organization can take a PGP certificate, append his ADK, and spread it out 
to the world.  This tampered version of the certificate will remain 
unnoticed by anyone who doesn't manually examine the bytes, and anyone 
using that tampered version will automatically and invisibly encrypt all 
messages to the organization as well as the certificate owner.

Colleague Greg Guerin likened the lesson of this vulnerability to something 
he learned in kindergarten: "Don't put something in your mouth unless you 
know where it's been."

The reaction from Network Associates has been pretty good: they fixed the 
problem.  Unfortunately, the president of the PGP Security unit 
demonstrated a high degree of cluelessness when he said: "This a fairly 
esoteric attack.  It's not likely that anybody without specialized 
knowledge could use it."  Certainly it is an esoteric attack but, as we all 
know, that person with specialized knowledge could easily encapsulate the 
attack in a point-and-click program that any script kiddie could use.

On the plus side, it doesn't seem like anyone took advantage of this 
vulnerability.  Network Associates inspected all 1.2 million PGP keys on 
its keyserver, and found none of them were tampered with in this way.

Way back in 1997 a bunch of us cryptographers predicted that adding key 
escrow would make system design harder, and would result in even more 
security problems.  This is an example of that prediction coming true.

Subject: PGP Vulnerability and the DMCA

I have copyrighted works protected with PGP.  I did not consent to the TPM 
I use being circumvented.  Bruce's description of this vulnerability is

I'm going to file a lawsuit against Bruce and Slashdot and anyone who links 
to Slashdot and anyone who reads the article and anyone who points at or 
otherwise refers to a person who reads the article.  In fact, Bruce himself 
is circumvention technology, so I'm suing his parents, too, along with the 
major airlines, both of which have distributed Bruce.

Subject: Firewalls and tunnelling protocols

Firewalls were never meant to stop covert channels.

While it's all too true that current firewalls performs a rather lacking 
job at verifying that a protocol they are forwarding meets its 
specification, and you could certainly be creative and attempt to find ways 
to detect and stop covert channels, as long as the firewalls allows some 
traffic through, any traffic, a covert channel will be possible.

So the real problems are in your expectation of a firewalls capabilities, 
something all too common, and in vendors exploiting overly generic and 
complex protocols to bypass what they see as nothing more that an annoyance 
to the ease of use and deployment of their application.

Subject: SANS

I think you let SANS wriggle off the hook in your article from two weeks 
ago, and I think their fingerprints from the MSNBC article runs the same 
direction.  While I'm not convinced that Genuity, UUNet, AT&T, C&W, Sprint, 
PSINet and others are doing all that our business motivation demand, I also 
do not think that the answer is found in a loose confederation of SANS, 
CERT CC, OMB/FEDCIRC, and WH/NSC/CIAO staff designing private-sector 
requirements.  SANS now and CERT CC in the past have contributed to some 
good work for network security, but I do not think this means they should 
take an operational role and drive the private sector on behalf of the 
government.  The SANS stumbling over the Microsoft problem is a reflection 
of this inappropriate role.

I completely agree with your editorial about the SANS news flash thing.  It 
has done their credibility no good at all, which is such a shame because 
(until then) I had been very impressed with the SANS services and their 
(usually) tempered tone.  It seems quite out of character, in fact I 
wondered if someone had hacked the SANS emailer and sent out a spoof!  The 
'virus to catch a virus' was really over the top!

Subject: Bluetooth

If you visit www.bluetooth.com, you will find that the full specifications 
(1400 pages long and amusingly captioned 'Wireless Connections Made Easy') 
are available and include information on link encryption and key generation 
and exchange mechanisms.

The specifications do explicitly leave some security issues up to the 
applications to deal with.  If the security of something is terribly 
important to you, you will need to provide heftier application level 
security mechanisms than Bluetooth provides, *and* ensure that the hardware 
platform that you are running on has the computational resources required 
to service the application.  Remember that Bluetooth is, to some degree, a 
lowest common denominator.

Subj: Bluetooth Security

The Bluetooth security system is well documented in the Bluetooth specs.

Hold tight for this one: it exchanges secret keys using SAFER+.  No, this 
is not my error.  They are serious.  You are supposed to use sideband 
information -- a PIN or a serial number -- to enhance the key that you must 
exchange to use SAFER+ in the first place.  The only "good" news is that 
the keys are persistent and the devices only need to do this on first 
introduction.

In a cellphone (the cellphone guys wrote the spec) there is a smart card to 
help this process along.

Worse, there is no security requirement.

Bottom line: it could be worse but, in most hands, Bluetooth security is 
going to be a mess.

Subject: M-134-A

Take my word for it: the Friedman patent issued last month is definitely 
the M-134-A, and not the M-229.  This is indicated unambiguously in the 
abstract of the patent, and in the wording of claim 6, but I'll admit it is 
hard even to read the claims.

The diagram on page 1 (shown enlarged on page 2) also makes it clear that 
the keyboard is connected through the rotors to a lamp-board in 
conventional Hebern (or Enigma) fashion, but the 5-level signal goes to the 
5 rotors individually.

Starting near the bottom of page 4, the first text page of the patent, we read:

"Now, in all cryptographs based upon the use of rotatable cipher wheels of 
the type referred to above, and arranged as indicated, means are embodied 
within the cryptograph for automatically changing the rotatory portions of
the cipher wheels during the course of enciphering or deciphering a 
message; these means are always of such a nature as to make these changes 
of a definite and predetermined character...."

"The basic feature of my invention of this predictable factor and the 
provision of a mechanism for displacing the cipher wheels in an entirely 
irregular, aperiodic manner.  This is accomplished by means of the 
wheel-stepping mechanisms shown as at 4, and operated in the present 
embodiment by individual magnets which are controlled by the single tape 
transmitter 5..."

(Incidentally, all information in the following is based on openly 
published sources, including, admittedly, material released in the National 
Archives, and hence may be freely used and disseminated.  I have not at any 
time had exposure to any information covered by security restrictions of a 
military or intelligence nature by the government of the United States or 
any other country.)

The distinguishing feature of the M-134-A is that it took the bits of a 
paper tape as input, and used that input to control the movement of rotors, 
and these rotors then encrypted a character in the basic fashion of a 
Hebern machine.  This is mentioned explicitly in the patent.

The M-229 and M-228, for different purposes, did exactly the reverse of 
this.  Rotors moved (still with the use of an electrical circuit) 
conventionally, in the way usually produced by gears, but the rotors were 
wired to a fixed set of live inputs to produce what were essentially binary 
bits as output.

In the M-228, these bits were XORed with a teleprinter character, and in 
the M-229 they were used to control rotor movement in an M-134 (the M-134, 
M-134-A, and M-134-T2 were essentially the same machine; the M-134-T1 was 
the subject of a patent granted on January 28, 1936 (U.S. patent 2,028,772, 
as referenced in a Cryptologia article on Friedman's patents).  And, of 
course, the M-134-C is one U.S. Army designation for the famous ECM Mark 
II, or SIGABA.

It should be clear, from the quotes given from the patent, why I am 
definite about this being the M-134, since the patent clearly refers to the 
distinguishing feature of that machine: paper tape as input, a permutation 
of the alphabet as output.

Authentica recognizes that a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) on its Web 
site, which correlated the strength of encryption with the security of our 
products, was misleading.  This FAQ has been removed and we thank Mr. 
Schneier for pointing this out as well as apologize for using his name 
without his permission.  We recognize that no security products are 
unbreakable and protecting information after it's been delivered to another 
user's computer is not foolproof.  However, our goal is not to ensure 
"absolute" security, but to provide organizations with tools that better 
manage the risk in sharing digital information.
