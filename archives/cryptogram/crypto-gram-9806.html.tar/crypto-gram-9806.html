<a name="side"><H2>Side-Channel Attacks Against Cryptosystems</H2></a>

<P>In the last few years, new kinds of cryptanalytic attack have begun to appear 
in the literature: attacks that target specific implementation details.  The 
&quot;timing attack&quot; made a big press splash in 1995: RSA private keys 
could be recovered by measuring the relative times cryptographic operations 
took.  This attack has been successfully implemented against smart cards and 
other security tokens, and against electronic commerce servers across the 
Internet.

<P>Researchers have generalized these methods to include attacks on a system by 
measuring power consumption, radiation emissions, and other &quot;side channels,&quot; and 
have implemented them against a variety of public-key and symmetric algorithms 
in &quot;secure&quot; tokens.  Related research has looked at fault analysis: deliberately 
introducing faults into cryptographic processors in order to determine the 
secret keys.  The effects of this attack can be devastating.

<P>What's the big idea here?

<P>There are two ways to look at a cryptographic primitive: block cipher, 
digital signature function, whatever.  The first is as a chunk of math.  The 
second is a physical (or software) implementation of that math.

<P>Traditionally, cryptanalysis has been directed solely against the math.  
Differential and linear cryptanalysis are good examples of this: high-powered 
mathematical tools that can be used to break different block ciphers.

<P>On the other hand, timing attacks, power analysis, and fault analysis all 
makes assumptions about implementation, and uses additional information garnered 
from attacking those implementations.  Failure analysis assumes a one-bit 
feedback from the implementation---was the message successfully decrypted---in 
order to break the underlying cryptographic primitive.  Timing attacks assumes 
that an attacker knows how long a particular encryption operation takes.

<P>I like to think of these attacks as biological.  There are some things you 
just can't learn about an organism by taking it apart.  Sometimes you have to 
look at the inputs and outputs.  How does it move?  What does it eat?  If you 
thwack it in a particular way, how does it react?  If you break it, what 
happens?

<P>Call them side-channel attacks.  Normal attacks look at the plaintext and the 
ciphertext and attempt to recover the key.  Side-channel attacks also look at 
some other information--how the power consumption changes as the cipher 
executes, what the output looks like when you cut some wires--in an attempt to 
recover the key.

<P>These attacks don't necessarily generalize.  A fault-analysis attack just 
isn't possible against an implementation that doesn't permit an attacker to 
create and exploit the required faults.  But these attacks can be much more 
powerful.  For example, differential fault analysis of DES requires between 50 
and 200 ciphertext blocks (no plaintext) to recover a key.  Contrast this with 
the best non-side-channel attack against DES, which requires just under 64 
terabytes of plaintext and ciphertext encrypted under a single key. 

<P>Some researchers have claimed that this is cheating.  True, but in real-world 
systems, attackers cheat.  Their job is to recover the key, not to follow some 
rules of conduct.  Prudent engineers of secure systems anticipate this and adapt 
to it.  It is our belief that most operational cryptanalysis makes use of 
side-channel information.  Sound as a side-channel---listening to the rotation 
of electromechanical rotor machines---was alluded to in The Codebreakers.  
TEMPEST is another side channel that can be very effective.  And in his book 
Spycatcher, Peter Wright discussed data leaking onto a transmission line as a  
side channel used to break a French cryptographic device.

<P>Defenses are hard.  You can either reduce the amount of side-channel 
information that leaks, or make the leakage irrelevant.  Both have problems, 
although researchers are working on them.  This is a powerful attack, and it 
will be a while before there is a good theory of the defense.  In the meantime, 
any system where a device is held by one person, and the secrets within the 
device are held by another, is at risk.

<P>&quot;Cryptanalytic Attacks on Pseudorandom Number Generators&quot;

<P>J. Kelsey, B. Schneier, D. Wagner, and C. Hall, Fast Software Encryption, Fifth International Workshop Proceedings (March 1998), Springer-Verlag, 1998, pp. 168-188. 

<P>Our work centered around analyzing pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs): 
the mechanisms used by real-world secure systems to generate cryptographic keys, 
initialization vectors, and other values assumed to be random.  We argue that 
PRNGs are their own unique type of cryptographic primitive, and propose a model 
for analyzing them.  We discuss possible attacks against this model, and 
cryptanalyze four real-world PRNGs: X9.17, RSAREF 2.0, DSA RNG, and CryptoLib.

<a name="escrow"><H2>Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third Party 
Encryption</H2></a>

<P>A year ago, a group of cryptographers published a report outlining the risks of 
key escrow, key recovery, and trusted third-party encryption.  (The differences 
in the above are more marketing distinctions than anything else.)  Our 
meta-conclusion was simple: The deployment of key recovery systems designed to 
facilitate surreptitious government access to encrypted data and communications 
introduces substantial risks and costs. These risks and costs may not be 
appropriate for many applications of encryption, and they must be more fully 
addressed as governments consider policies that would encourage ubiquitous key 
recovery.

<P>Our report was designed to stimulate a public, technical debate and analysis 
that, in our judgment, must precede any responsible policy decision that could 
result in the wide-scale deployment of key recovery systems.  While there are 
numerous and important economic, social, and political issues raised by key 
recovery, the report's analysis was confined to the technical problems created 
by deployment of key recovery systems designed to meet government access 
specifications.  As of mid-1998, no substantive response addressing these 
technical concerns has been offered. 

<P>So we re-released the report.

<P>While efforts have been made over the last year to design key recovery 
systems for commercial purposes, they do not alleviate the concerns raised by 
deployment at the scale and in the manner required to meet government demands.  
The design of secure key recovery systems remains technically challenging, and 
the risks and costs of deploying key recovery systems are poorly understood.  
Most significantly, government demands for access place additional requirements 
on key recovery systems, including covert access, ubiquitous adoption, and rapid 
access to plaintext.  There is good reason to believe that these additional 
requirements amplify the costs and risks of key recovery substantially. 

<P>Members of the law enforcement and intelligence communities continue to 
express concern about widespread use of unescrowed cryptography.  At the same 
time, these communities have expressed increasing alarm over the vulnerability 
of &quot;critical infrastructure.&quot;  But there is a significant risk that 
widespread insertion of government-access key recovery systems into the 
information infrastructure will exacerbate, not alleviate, the potential for 
crime and information terrorism.  Increasing the number of people with 
authorized access to the critical infrastructure and to business data will 
increase the likelihood of attack, whether through technical means, by 
exploitation of mistakes or through corruption.  Furthermore, key recovery 
requirements, to the extent that they make encryption cumbersome or expensive, 
can have the effect of discouraging or delaying the deployment of cryptography 
in increasingly vulnerable computing and communications networks. 

<P>The technical concerns about key recovery and trusted third-party systems in 
1998 remain largely unchanged from our 1997 analysis.  We specifically do not 
address questions of how and whether key recovery might benefit law enforcement 
and whether there are alternatives to key recovery that might achieve equal or 
greater benefits.  However, the predictable costs and risks of key recovery, 
particularly when deployed on the scale desired by law enforcement, are very 
substantial.  The onus is on the advocates of key recovery to make the case that 
the benefits outweigh these substantial risks and costs.
