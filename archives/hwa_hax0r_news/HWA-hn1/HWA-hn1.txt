 Synopsis
 --------
 
  The purpose of this list is to 'digest' current events of interest that
 affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
 coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
 and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. 
 
  This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the 
 likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
 AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as 
 BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so. 
 
  It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
 reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
 sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
 of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
 motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
 the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
 a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

 Yet another MSIE bug
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  IE bug: restart Windows
  By: demoniz Nov 9,22:16
  From: http://www.bikkel.com/~demoniz/

 A new and very serious Internet Explorer bug has been found. A
 special Java applet which uses the 'modified' Microsoft DirectDraw
 Java classes is able to crash not only MS Internet Explorer 4.* or 5, but
 the whole Windows 9* system. On a Windows NT system Internet
 Explorer crashes, but the operating system is in most cases still
 usable.

 According to Fabio Ciucc, who discovered the major flaw, the applet
 will not run in true and 100% pure Java environments, such as
 Netscape Navigator, Sun's HotJava or using the Java Plugin. The bug
 is only present in non standard Java modifications done by Microsoft
 in its Internet Explorer 4/5 on Windows systems.

 Fabio Ciucc hasn't released the information required to re-create the
 bug because of the potential danger of a huge DoS flood. Microsoft
 acknowledged the problem with its DirectDraw Java foundation
 classes that causes computers to crash. A patch will be released
 soon.

 A test is available at Fabio Ciucc's website. 
 http://www.anfyjava.com/iebug/
 (IE users: please note that your entire system will crash!)


2.1 Where's the WaReZ?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     There is no information in this list pertaining to 'warez' that scene
    is covered quite adequately by others and has no place here.'nuff said.

3.0 HACKER CASH GRAB? 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Bow to the Cash cOw:
    
   Hey Cartman, did the |<r4d Back Orifice<tm> watch come yet???

    http://www.cultdeadcow.com/merchandise/watch.html
    
   At least we know where the cDc guys are coming from, ;-)
     
    Gimme your money:
    ----------------
    
    It seems the old hacker gold rush is on, I don't care what anyone
   says, HACKING sells, and it sells big, I'm actually surprised it
   has taken this long for some people to realize this and begin to 
   cash in on it, but it is readily apparent to me that the 'golden
   age of hacking' <sic> is far from over.
        
   AntiOnline, run by 19yr old John Vranesvich seems to have struck
   the mother lode. Already a commercial entity offering shell accounts 
   to the wannabes the site now proclaims the following: 
    
     "AntiOnline Forms Partnership With  Zarite Inc.Sunday 10:00am, 
     November 08, 1998 - Venture Capitalists see a future in AntiOnline,
     and decide to invest."

   uh, yeah, hey maybe someone will invest in us too some day <guffaw>.
    
   http://www.antionline.com/SpecialReports/zarite-partnership/
   
    "Under the terms of the agreement, Vranesevich will retain a majority
     70% stake in AntiOnline, and will maintain sole managerial control"
     
     
   From the press release:
     
     In exchange for 30% control of AntiOnline "Zarite Inc. has provided
     an undisclosed amount of investment capital, which is set to be used
     to launch a second generation site.
     
                                 ... which is expected to span over some 8
     separate domains, will collectively be dubbed "AntiOnline - The 
     Internet's Information Security Super Center". Along with the latest
     InfoSec news updated 3 times a day, AntiOnline will also run weekly
     columns and interviews from and by some of the biggest names in the
     computer security and hack scene. Another domain will host Bub,
     AntiOnline's artificial intelligence bot, 6 months in the making, that
     will be able to interactively answer questions about computer security
     issues posed to it by web surfers. One of the domains will host a
     virtual store front that will be a one stop shop for security products
     and hacker memorabilia, and yet another one will serve as a high
     power search portal to information security related sites, based on
     technology being leased from InfoSeek. Another of the domains will
     serve as the world's most extensive web companion to IRC, the form
     of real time type written communication used by thousands of hackers
     around the world."
     
    
3.1 WWWHACK 
    ~~~~~~~
    "Hacking" XXX sites for fun and profit. If it isn't trojaned
    then you have just another password brute force hacker?

3.2 BackOrifice 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Note: I debated wether or not to include info on this as it has been
    around for quite some time (first unleashed at DefCon in July 1998) 
    but since it is still so prevelant and people are STILL unclued as to
    what it is and where to get it etc here's the info...
    
     People are still in awe over this, and with good reason, its use
    has spread like wildfire among hackers and crackers alike with many
    netizens (especially warez pups) being completely unaware that their
    systems have been compromised. In a nutshell back orifice consists of
    two pieces, the server which runs in the background of an 'infected'
    Windows95 machine and a client program that allows the attacker to do
    "anything" he or she wishes with the compromised box. Clients exist 
    for both Windows9x and unix environments, the standard port that the
    server runs on is 31337 but it can be configured to run on any port
    and even connect to irc and announce that it is 'owned'.    
    
    You can get it and all the info you can stand here:
    http://www.cultdeadcow.com/tools/
    Or see who's currently 'owned' on the EFNET channel #bo_owned

 From: Ralph Logan <rlogan@medusa.blackops.org>

 Approximately a year and a half ago, I attended Defcon V.  Information
 Security professionals attend Defcon regularly to see old friends, form
 new relationships, and generally relax in an environment where we can
 speak about familiar topics without having to stop and explain years of
 computer knowledge to the general public, managers, clients or our bosses. 
  
 According to the Official Defcon V page there was a panel discussion
 moderated by:
 
 Carolyn P. Meinel - Moderator of the Happy Hacker Digest and mailing
                     lists.  She will preside over a seperate[sic] Happy
		     Hacker discussion pannel[sic] that 
                     will cover the topics of wether[sic] or not "newbies"
                     should hav[sic] information handed to them, or should
                     they learn for themselves?  
 
 Having established relationships previously with other Information
 Security Professionals, I was surprised her name had never been mentioned,
 so I decided to sit in on the panel.  Understanding that this was an
 informal convention, I was not expecting strict guidelines or 'stuffy'
 behavior from any of the panel members, but the complete ignorance and
 irrelevance of Ms. Meinel's statements, retorts and reactions to open
 questions amazed me.  I left the panel discussion early. 
  
 Over the last year, I have kept a watchful eye on this person, Ms. 
 Meinel.  I researched her history, read her list, watched other mailing
 lists, and attempted to understand how and when she became a 'Security
 Professional'.  Knowing the experience and educational backgrounds of
 other Information Security Professionals, I could not grasp how the
 moderation of a mailing list qualified her as a 'Security Professional.'
  
 I received a document sent to Mike Bellus of the FBI outlining Ms. 
 Meinel's services as a consultant.  In the description of the "3-day
 Beginner Hacking Course" she was proposing to the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation, Ms. Meinel roughly portrays one of her services as
 "...designed to go far enough in these three days to teach serious
 proficiency at catching email criminals such as mail bombers." 
  
 Such are the 'skills' that Ms. Meinel encourages in her followers on the
 "Happy Hacker" mailing list and journal, although the 'skills' Ms. Meinel
 teaches on her list are just sufficient to get a new computer enthusiast
 in enough hot water to send them to prison.  She of course throws in an
 occasional 'Don't do this or you will go to jail' comment, but let's
 compare that to setting the cookie jar in front of the hungry child, shall
 we? 
 
 Questions began to form in my mind: 'Is Ms. Meinel attempting to generate
 business for herself?', 'Is her skillset really this limited, or is she
 teaching new computer enthusiasts just enough to set off the warning
 signals with potential clients?'
 
 I watched at a distance as Ms. Meinel continuously poked and prodded her
 way around the underground scene with inflammatory accusations, ridiculous
 claims, and pious retorts to intelligent queries.  Taunting the
 underground personalities with challenges, then turning to Federal
 Officials and accusing innocent people of terrorizing her, Ms. Meinel has
 unjustly accused many people of criminal activities, with not the
 slightest bit of evidence. 
 
 It was obvious to me that Ms. Meinel had an agenda other than simply
 helping the uninformed in her 'Happy Hacker' mailing list.  Sure enough,
 in early 1998 her book 'The Happy Hacker' was published. 
  
 Interest waned after the book was released, as myself and other security
 professional associates realized that she was a harmless charlatan. 
 
 At Defcon VI Ms. Meinel was amazingly quiet. 
 
 A few months later, my current military client and I attended NISSC
 (National Information Systems Security Conference). 
  
 One session of the conference concerned 'The Future of Information
 Security'.  Included in this session's audience were professionals from
 the Department of Justice, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of
 Investigation, Secret Service, security professionals from the 'Big Five'
 accounting firms, Microsoft, and INFOSEC Professionals in the private
 industry.  The panel discussion soon moved to 'How are we as INFOSEC
 professionals going to police the integrity of our profession?' When
 someone mentioned the content of Ms. Meinel's recent 'Scientific American'
 article, the entire audience burst into laughter.  It was a satisfying
 moment for those of us following Ms. Meinel's less than illustrious
 career: to finally see that our fellow PROFESSIONALS see her for what she
 is, and not what she purports to be.  I returned home from that conference
 with a sense of satisfaction, knowing that other INFOSEC professionals see
 through the charade that Ms. Meinel is creating. 
 
 The most disturbing part of this last year and a half of watching Ms. 
 Meinel, is her uncanny ability to pull the wool over the eyes of the press
 and the limited amount of the public that listen to her.  I am afraid we
 are going to see more people in our industry playing these games with
 potential clients and the public, and we must constantly guard the
 integrity of INFOSEC, for integrity is a mainstay of any INFOSEC
 professional. 

 It was with shame that I read your article after my boss pointed it out to
 me, asking if I was familiar with Ms. Meinel. 

 This letter is not for publication, only to ask you to please research
 your publicized writers before publication in the future. 

 This is not a letter to taunt Ms. Meinel, for I have no desire to respond
 to her, correspond with her, or even give her an attempt to justify her
 ever downward spiralling 'career' as a 'Security Expert'.

7.1  SAR Project
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Like so many other things in the security field, this is a double
    edged sword... this site lists the current top 10 smurf amplifier
    networks. The idea is that by revealing which networks are "broken"
    (allowing the broadcast attack packets through) it will shame the
    NOCs into fixing their networks. Another idea may come to mind for
    people that like to play dirty though.
