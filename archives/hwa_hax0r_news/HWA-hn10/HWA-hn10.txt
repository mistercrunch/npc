   Synopsis
   --------

   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see.

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you

    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written

             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

       The 19 states who joined the federal government's landmark
       antitrust case against Microsoft are unlikely to settle for
       any remedy that doesn't include a revamping of the software
       company, the The New York Times reported. At least some
       attorneys general will seek to force Microsoft to license
       the source code for its Windows operating system to other
       companies. The attorneys acknowledge that the judge in the
       case could still rule in the favor of Microsoft, but they
       say they were emboldened by the performance of lead attorney
       David Boies, and are considering asking for stronger
       remedies. (Registration required to access New York Times on

       Tears, saliva, and the urine of pregnant women -- they all
       contain a powerful protein that laboratory scientists have
       successfully used to kill the AIDS virus. A New York
       University biochemist said the protein, called lysozyme, may
       one day yield more effective AIDS drugs since lysozyme is a
       natural human compound. The new study appears in the
       Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The search
       for the anti-HIV protein began when scientists realized the
       babies of HIV-infected women were somewhat protected from
       the virus and speculated that pregnant women made more
       virus-killing proteins to protect their developing babies.

       advances, lower rates, and industry consolidation will boost
       the mobile's popularity even more in the next few years, the
       Los Angeles Times reported. So far, incentives like
       single-rate national pricing, and plans that offer a wealth
       of minutes, have produced successful results, but in order
       to fulfill the vision of the inter-operability of wireless
       and cordless lines, companies are considering all kinds of
       technological innovations and pricing plans. While most
       consumers may need to wait a while for cellular global

       The local US phone companies have been unable to locate
       nearly US$5 billion in telecommunications equipment, and
       should write off the missing amount, according to an FCC
       audit released on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported.
       In response to the audit, which could spur regulators to
       push for lower phone rates, Bell Atlantic and SBC
       Communications, highest on the list, argued that the audit
       results were flawed, and all of the Bells argued that the
       results shouldn't affect rates. Although the FCC report
       recommends that the companies write off the missing
       equipment, it isn't taking any action. Instead, it's

       sought the government's help, would show how fast

    ++  Intel and FTC settle

        The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved the settlement of its
        antitrust case against Intel, but has imposed only mild restrictions and
        is continuing an ongoing investigation into the chip giant. Under the
        settlement, while Intel is not able to withhold most technical
        information
        from companies with which it is involved in patent disputes, it may
        withhold that information if it concerns the specific processor that is
        the subject of the dispute and the customer is seeking to have that product
        banned. Information must be provided to manufacturers no later than six
        months before a processor is due for release. Intel must also report
        regularly to the FTC concerning its compliance with the order. However,
        the FTC may not have had its last word; it will be continuing its broader
        investigation into whether Intel's dominance of the processor market
        constitutes a monopoly, and if its power has been abused.

           Beenz Company Ltd., a British start-up, is launching what it
           calls the Internet's first universal currency, symbolized by
           a bright red bean with two strokes at the top, The Wall
           Street Journal reported. Founder Philip Letts envisions the
           concept as an alternative to Web advertising, explaining
           that Beenz will market itself by rewarding customers who
           visit sites using Beenz with the currency, which can then be
           deposited at the Bank of Beenz. In preparation for the
           launch, Beenz has recruited a number of retailers to hand
           out and accept the currency in lieu of payment. It expects
           to derive future revenue through its role as a bank,
           clearing transactions and taking commissions on the Beenz it
           sells. (The Wall Street Journal Interactive requires

           combination will be Barry Schuler, AOL's president of
           interactive services. The biggest challenge for him and for
           AOL will be to set up services that can meet the needs of

       i just wanted to make note of the fact that yr site is not the
       only site to be rejected by link exchange on the basis of  
       content. when i attempted to sign up for their program i sent 
       them a banner as they requested, but instead of being included
       in the program, i got a nasty email rejecting my site due to 
       so called "objectionable" material. link exchange apparently 
       feel that pages dealing with security issues are not acceptable,
       yet another friend of mine who *is* in the program is 
       consistently getting banners on his site for pr0n :) go figure.
       anyway i say fuck link exchange, even the ppl i know who are in 
       it are not noticing a significant increase in traffic, and how 
       much do you want "random" viewers to come to your site anyway?
       has anyone else experienced anything like this with this company?

       Although this may not be an appropriate topic for this list, there is a 
       related issue with Outlook password protected add-ins.
       
       Many companies make add-in components for Microsoft Outlook such as 
       custom forms or folders.  These add-ins are password protected to 
       protect code.  However, when these passwords are checked at runtime, 
       they are left in memory as plaintext.  And since Outlook forms aren't 
       compiled, all code is available to anyone with a password.

       Well you will need a mouse or you ain't going too far, also the

       like a C64 or C128 that has basic in rom and the disk is extra...
       you can find the software on the web just look good and hard if 
       you get stuck I can maybe rustle up some software and post it

 03.0 The Mitnick Trial Update
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From Wired news
      http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/18432.html


      Mitnick Trial: Full Speed Ahead
      by Douglas Thomas 

      12:00 p.m.  12.Mar.99.PST
      LOS ANGELES -- The trial against celebrity cracker Kevin Mitnick will
      begin as scheduled on 20 April. 

      That's the ruling from US District Court Judge Marianne Pfaelzer, who
      denied a defense request Tuesday for a continuance that could have 
      delayed the case until the summer. 

      In court on Tuesday, Pfaelzer told Don Randolph, Mitnick's attorney,
      that if he expected the trial to be delayed by so much as a day beyond
      its 20 April start date, he should "disabuse himself of that notion." 

      In a 25-count Federal indictment, the government alleges that Mitnick 
      copied proprietary software from computers owned by cellular telephone
      manufacturers. Mitnick has been in custody here,awaiting a trial, since
      1995. 

      The defense team wanted the court to make the government comply with the
      court's previous order to identify the materials that would be presented
      at the trial. Most recently, the defense requested that the government
      provide the passwords for the files they have been able to decrypt. 

      Because of the sheer volume of new information, the defense asked that 
      the court "exclude from evidence any files not reasonably identified," 
      according to defense team attorney Greg Vinson. 

      Failing that, the defense requested an extension to review the new 
      evidence. Pfaelzer denied all motions, but did require the government
      to provide passwords to the files they deciphered. This week's ruling
      is not the first time Pfaelzer has turned down the defense's request
      for more time. 

      In late January, she denied a defense motion for a 60-day continuance. 
      Pfaelzer has been reluctant to allow delays in the case, and made it
      clear that the motion which pushed the start date back to April would
      be the last before the case went to trial. 

      For some time, the defense has claimed that the prosecution has "failed
      to comply with its constitutional and statutory discovery obligations." 

      Specifically, Mitnick's lawyer had accused the government of failing to
      disclose its exhibit list. The defense also wants access to witness
      interviews and time to review 1,300 pages of witness statements produced
      by the government.

      Mitnick also says he is having difficulty  reviewing the evidence to be
      presented against him. A laptop computer containing the electronic 
      evidence was installed for his use at the Los Angeles Metropolitan
      Detention Center. But Mitnick was not allowed to access the portable 
      for nearly a month while experts inspected and re-inspected the machine. 

      The government denies claims that they have withheld evidence.  

      US Attorneys said in court documents that is "absurd" for Mitnick to
      suggest that the defense team's failure to conduct interviews or perform
      investigations are "somehow attributable to the government." 

      Pfaelzer agreed, and denied the defense motions. This week, she granted a
      prosecution request to dismiss the continuance without a formal hearing. 

      Meanwhile, Mitnick's co-defendant Lewis DePayne, filed a motion for
      severance on 1 March, asking that his case be heard separately. 

      In that filing, DePayne requested that his case be heard immediately, 
      without a jury. DePayne's attorney, Richard Sherman, argued earlier before
      Pfaelzer that there is simply no evidence against his client. Pfaelzer has 
      indicated that she is inclined to grant the severance. 

      DePayne's motion is scheduled to be heard on 22 March.

       Mitnick to Plead Guilty

      The 'Free Kevin' movement may have to wait a bit
      longer-- hacker Kevin Mitnick is set to plead guilty to
      criminal hacking charges.
      By Alex Wellen and Luke Reiter   March 17, 1999 


      8:30 PM Pacific Hacker Kevin Mitnick will plead guilty to computer
      -related  crimes after more than four years in prison awaiting trial, 
      according to CyberCrime sources. 

      The plea is contained in a court document, or "notice," jointly filed
      by Mitnick's attorney and federal prosecutors, sources said. The notice 
      itself was filed under seal and "in camera"-- meaning the subject matter
      will be discussed  privately between the parties in chambers before US 
      Federal Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer. 

      The timing for that meeting will depend on Pfaelzer's schedule and could
      be as early as Friday. 

      Assistant US Attorney David Schindler confirmed a notice was filed, but 
      would not comment on whether it was a plea agreement. Mitnick's attorney,
      Donald  Randolph, did not respond to CyberCrime inquiries on Wednesday. 

      Sources said the plea agreement will place a cap on Mitnick's sentence.
      Taking into consideration time already served, he  could be released by 
      the end of the year. 

      This plea agreement does not involve codefendant Louis DePayne, set to
      be tried alongside Mitnick next month. The  proposed plea agreement does, 
      however, call into question DePayne's status-- suggesting that he may also
      resolve his case prior to trial. DePayne's attorney, Richard Sherman,
      declined to comment Wednesday night. 

      Mitnick, 35, has been imprisoned in the Metropolitan Detention Center, 
      Los Angeles for more than four years awaiting trial on computer-related
      fraud charges. The 25-count federal indictment issued against Mitnick
      accuses him of using computers to steal millions of dollars in software
      Following the September 1996 indictment, Mitnick  pleaded "not guilty" 
      to all counts. 

      Mitnick pleaded guilty twice before to similar computer
      crimes, in 1989 and 1996. 

      In 1989, Mitnick was convicted for stealing computer programs and 
      breaking into corporate networks, and served eight months of a 
      one-year sentence. In April 1996, he pleaded guilty to possession of 
      15 or more unauthorized access devices (cloned cellular telephone 
      numbers), and for violating supervised release, and was sentenced to
      22-months in federal prison. 

      Based in part on his prior two convictions, Mitnick has been detained 
      without bond since February 1995. The hacker's imprisonment without a
      bail hearing, combined with his prison restrictions, has generated a
      backlash among Mitnick supporters. Some critics have protested Mitnick's 
      treatment by attacking websites and posting political messages-- the
      most recent earlier this month to a Monica Lewinsky website,
      and the most notable of which shutdown the New York Times's website for
      approximately nine hours last September.

      Mitnick supporters have also criticized the government for delaying the
      trial. However, the delays can also be attributed in part to the defense. 
      Over the last four years, Mitnick has been represented by three different 
      attorneys -- who, in combination, have filed a half-dozen motions requested
      additional information. Mitnick's attorneys have argued government attorneys
      have stalled efforts by unreasonably withholding information requested by the
      defense. 

       ZDTV's CyberCrime Bureau-- which includes former
       prosecutor Luke Reiter, litigator Alex Wellen, and reformed
       hacker Kevin Poulsen-- will continue to bring you coverage.

 03.2 Federal Prosecutors Leak Info on Mitnick 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
      March 19th
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
      
      contributed by Space Rogue 
      
      Numerous mainstream media outlets are reporting that
      Kevin Mitnick has pleaded guilty to computer related
      crimes. It is believed that this plea of guilty is in
      exchange for reduced charges and a sentence of mostly
      time served. The real story is not that Kevin pleaded
      out as only 4% of federal cases actually go to trial, the
      real story is how the press got notified of the contents
      of a _sealed_ federal court document. 

      If the Honorable Mariana Pfaelzer declines the plea
      agreement Kevin will still be headed for trial on April 20.
      If that happens Kevin's defense hopes to introduce a
      motion that will dismiss most of the evidence against
      him on the grounds of illegal search and seizure. It
      would appear the the information used to provide
      probable cause to issue a search warrant for Mitnick's
      apartment was itself illegally obtained. The defense is
      claiming that Tsutomu Shimomura, while a private
      citizen, was in fact acting as a government agent and
      therefore subject to the laws regarding illegal search
      and seizure.

      about what is not being said by the mainstream media.

      Anonymous Sources, Politics, and the Media 

                                          March 18, 1999 
     In yet another political twist in the highly politicized trial preparations in United States v. Mitnick, the claim that a "notice"
     was filed in camera and under seal with Judge Mariana Pfaelzer somehow found its way to the telephone, fax machine, or
     email accounts of Alex Wellen, an intellectual property attorney and now a reporter with ZDTV who interned with the US
     Attorney's Office Criminal Division (and two federal court judges). The lead prosecutor in the case apparently confirmed
     for Alex Wellen that a notice was indeed filed. This post addresses an article that appeared on ZDTV the evening of
     March 17; subsequent posts will address an article that appeared on the same topic in the L.A. Times on March 18,
     1999. 
   
     Freekevin.com has learned that the "notice" is a plea agreement wherein Kevin Mitnick has agreed to plead guilty to a
     reduced set of charges. While we'll discuss those reduced charges below, we'll take this opportunity to look at the curious
     circumstances under which the contents of a document filed under seal in a federal court were somehow leaked to a
     reporter who worked with prosecutors and two federal judges. 
   
     Why is This a Political "Twist"? 
   
     It's a violation of federal law to reveal matters that are filed under seal with the court. This creates a dilemma for politically
     ambitious federal prosecutors, most recently witnessed in the repeated leaks of information from the office of independent
     counsel Ken Starr. 
   
     Media Analysis 101 
   
     Returning to Alex Wellen's story, we read that.... 
   
             "Hacker Kevin Mitnick will plead guilty to computer-related crimes after more than four years in
             prison awaiting trial, according to CyberCrime sources." 
   
   
     Anonymous sources... and it is not rather odd for someone to plead guilty after spending "more than four years in prison
     awaiting trial"? Can't be too odd, since Alex Wellen's article failed to mention that curiosity. Notice that there's no mention
     that Kevin Mitnick was held in defiance of constitutional requirements that a detention hearing be held and the issue of bail
     considered. Must not have been important. Nor was there any mention that federal law was broken in leaking the sealed
     document to the press. 
   
             "The plea is contained in a court document, or "notice," jointly filed by Mitnick's attorney and
             federal prosecutors, sources said. The notice itself was filed under seal and "in camera"-- meaning
             the subject matter will be discussed privately between the parties in chambers before U.S. Federal
             Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer." 
   
   
     Anonymous sources for the second time. Second paragraph without mention that federal law was broken in leaking the
     sealed document to the press. Must have been as unimportant as being held four years without bail and without a bail
     hearing. 
   
     After learning the possible schedule for the trial, we read... 
   
             "Assistant U.S. attorney David Schindler confirmed a notice was filed..." 
   
   
     The first source attributed to an individual was attributed to the lead U.S. Attorney prosecuting the case. And defense
     attorney Donald Randolph "did not respond" to inquiries, presumably by reporter -- and ex-intern at a U.S. prosecutor's
     office -- Alex Wellen. 
   
     The Way Sources and Journalists Cooperate 
   
     Even ethical journalists know that they must rely on anonymous sources on occasion. To maintain their integrity, they'll
     frequently insist on a quid pro quo: that they must attribute something to the source, even if it's a statement saying that "I'll
     neither confirm nor deny...". That way, the story is sourced anonymously, but there's at least one, and usually more,
     statements attributed to named sources. 
   
     Leaking Benefits Prosecution in U.S. v. Mitnick 
   
     Leaking the existence of a plea agreement benefits the prosecution in numerous ways; we identified three of them above
     (see "Why is This a Political "Twist"?"). In addition, the first leak sets the tone of the coverage that follows, and even
     first-year debate students know that when you set the boundaries of the debate, you've won without saying a word. The
     prosecution has everything to gain and nothing to lose by leaking word of the existence of a plea agreement: they set the
     tone of the discussion, they hope to take the energy out of the principled people who've learned about the case and
     become supporters of Kevin Mitnick, and they blindside the defense attorneys. If the leaks are somehow attributed to the
     prosecution, they merely issue vigorous denials, and there the matter will stop. 
   
     Leaking Poses Enormous Risks to Defense 
   
     Leaking the existence of a plea agreement poses enormous risk to Kevin Mitnick, because any agreement is submitted for
     the judge's approval. Because of this uncertainty, and even at this late date, Kevin is completely focused on preparing for
     trial on April 20, 1999, just 22 working days away. Indeed, Kevin's investigators have subpoenaed Tsutomu Shimomura
     to do one of two things: either sign a sworn declaration that a number of factual statements in his book Takedown are
     true, or appear in court on April 5th to participate in a hearing to suppress any evidence in this case based on
     Shimomura's actions as a de facto federal agent who allegedly broke federal law repeatedly, and on multiple occasions.
     Note that Shimomura illegally intercepted electronic communications purported to be from Mitnick, and that the court
     hearing scheduled for April 5th is intended to suppress those interceptions, as well as a warrantless search conducted on
     Kevin Mitnick's home in Raleigh, North Carolina (the search was undertaken subsequent to Shimomura's illegal
     interceptions). 
   
     A leak from the defense runs the enormous risk of further antagonizing the judge, who might then reject the agreement,
     and Kevin would then face going to trial with an overworked and understaffed attorney. The possible sentence upon
     conviction of all charges is more than 35 years in federal prison. The defense would have jeopardized their entire hopes of
     settling before trial if they had illegally leaked this notice -- no, the defense had no role in this leak, in our opinion. 
   
     Plea Agreement Includes Reduced Charges
   
     If the plea agreement is approved, Kevin Mitnick will spend just a few additional months in prison, and 20 counts of the
     27 original counts will be dropped. This circumstance -- that the government is willing to dismiss 75% of the charges
     against Kevin -- is ample evidence in support of our claim that this case was dramatically overcharged, and was
     overcharged solely as a result of the extraordinary and repeated media assaults on Kevin Mitnick by reporter John
     Markoff on the front page of the New York Times. We'll have more on this issue in subsequent updates to this site. 
   
     Summary 
   
     Fewer than 4% of all federally charged defendants go to trial. The federal system is set up to virtually ensure a conviction,
     as the enormous resources of the federal government are brought to bear on a single individual: trying to fight federal
     charges is like trying to stop a steamroller with a picket sign protesting your innocence. 
   
     As an indigent defendant held without a bail hearing and without bail for more than four years, Kevin Mitnick has had
     virtually no control over the conduct of his defense. Using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, Kevin faced more than 35
     years if found guilty of all charges. Held in jail for four years, his contact with the outside was limited to collect phone calls,
     visits with legal personnel, and with his immediate family -- all other visitors were forbidden. Although the terms of the
     guilty plea are quite onerous, the possible alternative -- a potential maximum penalty of more than 35 years in federal
     prison -- was simply not worth the risk of going to trial with a court-appointed attorney whose two recent motions for
     continuances less than 50 days before trial were rejected by the court.

     In researching the long-standing Microsoft Office/OLE security holes, we took a look at some of Microsoft's
     own Word documents, published on its web site long after the release of its security patch, as well as a Word
     document posted by Compaq on its web site. These documents, like millions of other MS Office documents,
     contain extraneous data that may unintentionally reveal sensitive confidential or private information, hidden from
     view within Word. 

     A MacInTouch reader who pointed out one of the files wrote: 

          "You can easily read the name and directory path of the original file, any revisions and who did
          them with full directory paths (even on the MS server), the directory paths of all attached graphics,
          and what appears to be a registration numbers and passwords associated with each user that saved
          the file. With enough documents, you could concievably construct a full directory structure for the
          entire MS network, and have the machine codes to mimic a computer in the building. Looks like
          MS has done half of the hacker's work for them... they are a break-in waiting to happen." 

     In each example below, we show hidden information that is invisible within Word but readily available when the
     document is opened with a text editor or utility program, such as John Lamb's TextBrowser or Bare Bones
     Software's BBEdit. We did not do an detailed security analysis of each document, but simply copied out some
     interesting hidden material. In each case, it is unlikely that the document authors intended to reveal the hidden
     information in these files, which now are available to millions of people on the Internet, although this information
     appears far more innocuous than the URLs, source code directories, credit card information and private mail that
     readers report finding hidden in their Word documents.

          Subject: word98 security issue, it's bigger than you think.
          Date: Wed, 10 Mar 1999

          I have to remain anonymous about this please, because of the implications this might have. 

          I am a developer and I occasionally use word98 for reports and such. Reading your report
          yesterday about the security issue, I wanted to see if it was true. I opened one of my old word docs
          in codewarrior (after changing the file type/creator codes ) and found the there were not only
          directory listings to source code I was working on at the time, but also names of specific functions
          within the source. These things were not menitioned anywhere within the document I typed, but
          they are embedded in my file. I can supply you with the file if you like, but I'd rather not because it
          has my name in it and I think the reprecussions of this could be rather large. If you have any
          questions about this, feel free to send them to me.

          Ric, 

          After reading about all these problems with the info Word stores with it's files I decided to look at
          some of the files I had for my business. I picked a simple file that only had my business letterhead
          and address info and business tax id numbers that I had to give to our bank recently. 

          When looking at the file in canopener I was astonished to find that the file had information from
          other files containing my credit card numbers and personal information about myself and my family. 

          I have tried for the past several years to not be a Microsoft basher and have tried to learn as much
          about their software applications to keep myself up to date with the standard business technology,
          but this is absurd. This along with some of the testimony that has been presented in their anti trust
          trial I am terrified that they are big brother and may be more corrupt than our government. If that
          isn't a scare. 

          Enjoy your information and keep up the great web site.

          *** Please keep the following anonymous: 

          I too have stopped defending Microsoft. 

          I work for a *major* Internet company at a fairly high level. This morning I too looked at a report I
          submitted last week using Notepad. Not ONLY did it have my name and directories on my hard
          drive, but it had information on OTHER applications that are totally unrelated to MS Word in it!
          These apps are competitors of MS (not that many aren't these days). BUT I think the most
          disturbing was this: all my reports have the same filename except for the date (contained in the
          filename too). The paths to EVERY report in that directory were there too. 

          In a world where the economoy is changing (mostly for the better I like to think) it's SAD to think
          actions like these undermine the trust people place in companies that work hard. People should be
          empowered and educated about technology, not intimidated and afraid because of it. I believe
          Microsoft is validating a LOT of people's fears about privacy and security unnecessarily.

          I read with interest your stories and updates concerning GUID numbers and other personal
          informaion being found in documents created by microsoft programs. Thanks for all the updates
          and keeping with the story. 

          Yesterday I finally got around to removing some original software that my imac came with, when I
          noticed a control panel called "Configuration Manager". In it was a section called "Cookies", which
          (when clicked on) displayed *Some* cookies on my system. Two of the cookies immediately
          caught my attention since I had never visited the sites with my imac. They were: microsot.com and
          msn.com, they both had the name "MC1" and they were 'enabled'. Double clicking on the cookies
          brought up the Cookie Properties box which had this shocking line: "Value: GUID=(my GUID
          presumably)". I couldn't believe it! Both cookies were identical (both were also set to expire on
          "Expires: Wed, Sep 15, 1999 7:00 PM GMT") in every respect. 

          The "Configuration Manager" control panel is apparetly made by Microsoft (as the about box
          says)...

          Subject: Microsoft Security Issues

          Ric, 

          This may have been reported prior, and it may be less intrusive than the Microsoft issues, but we
          seem to be ignoring the fact that many other applications besides those from Microsoft carry
          artifacts from files unrelated to the current one. For the most part these are data that we'd rather not
          be seen by others. 

          At the moment, I'm referring specifically to Adobe PageMaker. PageMaker files opened in Can
          Opener reveal lots of extraneous data - directory paths, hard drive names, file names that appear to
          be unrelated to the current file, and perhaps references to other sensitive data. These are data that
          are not visible and cannot be found or expunged by any normal means. In addition to embedding
          directory paths, filenames, etc., related to the current file, it seems that whenever you do a "save as"
          in PageMaker a lot of data from the original file become permanent and reside in that and all future
          iterations, or saved as versions, of that file. The data can compound to become an interesting
          record in its own right. 

          Lots of folks transfer lots of data in the form of PageMaker files and I'll wager that few of them are
          aware of the nature of some of the data they're "making public" when they do. 

          Maybe some of the more experienced (than me) sleuths will care to comment on PageMaker too?

          Unbelievable! 

          After reading your section on Word privacy issues, I opened up a paper I wrote last week in
          BBEdit. In addition to a bunch of paths on my machine (which is somewhat understandable) i found
          addresses of all the sites I had visited that night (using Internet Explorer): 

          3Com/Palm Computing - Macintosh 

          The Apple Store (U.S.) 

          The Apple Store (U.S.) 

          In other documents I found information about my email account like my mail server. Who knows
          what other information is hidden in the document mixed in with all of the gibberish. 

          This really bothers me! The paths to images used in the file in somewhat understandable and
          relevant, but this is completely irrelevant, and I really think Microsoft needs to explain themselves.

          Encouraged by the interesting reports about security problems in word98 docs I carefully examined
          some of my files with a text editor. 

          Guess what. The complete history of some documents I've been using since one year has been
          recorded in the file (different OS versions, different machines to be identified by their owner's
          names and different hierachical file structures were all plainly visible). 

          Obviously previous versions of word (at least word 6) own this special "recording feature", too.
          Isn't it nice? Thank you, Big Bill, this is exactly what users needed most.

       Subject: [ ALERT ] Case Sensitivity and Symbolic Links
       
       Prasad Dabak of Cybermedia Software Private Limited has discovered yet
       another security risk in Windows NT involving the operating system's case
       sensitivity. According to the report, using the permissions on the "\??"
       object directory and by exploiting the case sensitivity of object manager,
       it is possible to trojan any system executables.
       
       Any ordinary user has write permissions on \?? Object directory. This is to
       allow user to map network drives or use "subst" utility to alias a directory
       to a new drive letter. Each system drive has an entry into \?? object
       directory. Each entry is actually a symbolic link which points to the device
       associated with that drive (ergo: Symbolic link \??\C: will typically point
       to a device such as \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1). It is possible to create
       a trojaned version of this symbolic link using the different character
       case -- for example, it is possible to create a symbolic link such as \??\c:
       (notice the small letter "c".) By doing this, all the requests to drive C
       get routed through the trojaned symbolic link.

       Case Sensitivity vulnerability:
       
        Description: 
        Using the permissions on the "\??" object directory and by exploiting the 
        case sensitivity of object manager it is possible to trojan any system 
        executables. 
                
        Problem: 
        Any ordinary user has write permissions on \?? Object directory. This is to 
        allow user to map network drives or use "subst" utility to alias a directory 
        to a new drive letter. Each drive on the system (let it be local/network/substed) 
        has an entry into \?? object directory. Each entry is actually a symbolic link
        which points to the device associated with that drive. (e.g Symbolic link \??\C: 
        will typically point to a device such as \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1). It is 
        possible to create a trojaned version of this symbolic link using the different 
        case. e.g it is possible to create a symbolic link such as \??\c: (notice the
        small letter c). By doing this, all the requests to drive C gets routed through 
        the trojaned symbolic link. (e.g If you get the contents of symbolic link \??\D: 
        and create a symbolic link say \??\c: and put those contents there, then 
        executing dir command on drive C will give you directory listing for drive D). 
        So effectively you can route the traffic on drive C to drive D. This is exactly 
        what the simulation program exploits. 
                
        Simulation: 
        The description of simulation assumes that you have unzipped the files from the 
        demo in a directory called C:\FOO and your Windows NT System directory is 
        C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32. 
       
        The simulation works on latest service packs of all Windows NT versions (3.51, 4.0, 5.0)
       
        When you execute BESYSADM.EXE. The program follows the following steps. 
       
              Create an indentical directory structure of Windows system directory under 
                   the directory C:\FOO. i.e it will create a directory structure such as
              C:\FOO\WINNT\SYSTEM32 
              Copy all the POSIX subsystem binaries and required DLLs (except PSXSS.EXE) 
                   from C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory to
              C:\FOO\WINNT\SYSTEM32 
              Copy the trojaned version of PSXSS.EXE and a dummy posix application 
                   DUMMYAPP.EXE from C:\FOO to C:\FOO\WINNT\SYSTEM32 
              Get the contents of the symbolic link \??\C: and append \FOO to it. i.e if 
                   the contents of symbolic link \??\C: is \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1
                   then new name formed will be \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1\FOO 
              Create a symbolic link \??\c: (note small c) with the contents as 
                   \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1\FOO 
              Hence effectively executing a dir command on drive C will now give 
                   directory listing of C:\FOO 
              Next the program starts a posix application DUMMYAPP.EXE as "POSIX /c DUMMYAPP.EXE" 
              This results in SMSS.EXE starting POSIX subsystem which effectively loads 
                   trojaned version of PSXSS.EXE. 
              This trojaned version inherits security context of SMSS.EXE and hence our 
                   PSXSS.EXE runs in root privilege. 
              This trojaned version adds the logged in user to the local administrator group. T 
              The name of the logged in user is passed through a file called u.ini that 
                   is created in C:\FOO\WINNT directory. 
       
        Comments 
        The program actually uses \DosDevices everywhere instead of \??, since Windows NT 3.51 
        does not have \?? object directoy and has DosDevices object directory. Starting from 
        Windows NT 4.0, \DosDevices is actually a symbolic link which points to \??. Hence using 
        DosDevices allows the program to run on all Windows NT versions. 
       
        Instructions for Demo
       
              Fresh boot the machine. 
              Login as any ordinary user (guest will also do) 
              Unzip the files in attached .ZIP file in some directory on any local hard drive 
                   on your machine 
              Run BESYSADM.EXE 
       
        Note: 
        If you are using Non-English version of Windows NT OR name of the local administrator 
        group is renamed, then specify the name of the local administrator group as a command 
        line to BESYSADM.EXE. If no arguments are specified the program assumes that you are 
        runnning on English version and the name of the local administrator group is "Administrators".

       Well, the exploit does not work on my machine--it fails with "Internal
       error..." when run in my test configuration.  I am running NT 4.0
       Workstation, SP4, ProtectionMode set to 1, file and registry permissions
       set to those recommended in Steve Sutton's NSA guide, Guest user enabled
       and allowed to log on locally, %SystemRoot% is on the C partition, and the
       exploit executables on the D partition (the only place writable by guest on
       my system).  I enabled auditing on the \?? object and no access was
       attempted.  So, it appears that something about my configuration stopped
       the exploit in its tracks ;)  When I run it from an admin account, it
       returns a message saying that the account is already a member of the
       administrators group.  Oh yeah, I had to enable the Posix subsystem too.
       
       As with the KnownDLLs exploit, good system administration should impede
       these kinds of exploits.  Though, they are doing a good job of scratching
       the surface of huge classes of local privilege escalation attacks for NT.

 09.0 Government Y2K Readiness
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Government Y2K progress
      Full story: http://newswire.com.au/9903/y2kdisc.htm

      The first in-depth data on the progress of Federal Government agencies
     in dealing with the Y2K problem shows that more than half of all agencies
     are now ready to deal with the problem -- but some are still struggling to
     catch up, including the department responsible for IT. The figures, which
     cover activities through to February this year, show that the total number
     of systems identified as compliant or back online is now 59%, up from
     44% in November. However, a handful of departments have not have half or
     less of their systems compliant. These include Communications, Information
     Technology and the Arts (36%), Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (48%),
     Treasury (50%) and Veterans Affairs (38%). Government officials said
     they were pleased with the progress to date, and that there were unlikely to
     beany major glitches come January 1, 2000.

 10.0 Voice mail fraud warning
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     http://newswire.com.au/9903/vfraud.htm
     
     Companies with call-through facilities on their voice mail systems have
     been warned to watch out for exposure to fraudulent use. According to
     the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), a number of Australian and
     New Zealand organisations have been hit by a scheme in which call-through
     options on some voice mail facilities are used to dial other numbers,
     often overseas. The fraud is well organised and the ACA is considering whether
     a code or standard for such equipment is necessary to prevent it occurring
     in future.

    Watch out for voice mail fraud: ACA 
    Selina Mitchell 

    Companies with call-through facilities on their voice mail systems have
    been warned to watch out for exposure to fraudulent use. 

    According to the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), a number of
    Australian and New Zealand organisations have been hit by a scheme in
    which call-through options on some voice mail facilities are used to dial
    other numbers, often overseas. The fraud is well organised and the ACA is
    considering whether a code or standard for such equipment is necessary to
    prevent it occurring in future. 

    "The ACA advises organisations with voice mail systems which have such
    features to contact their supplier immediately to assess their susceptibility
    to this fraud, and either de-activate or limit the extent of the call-through
    facility and their possible exposure to the fraud," said ACA executive
    manager, Grant Symons in a statement. "They should also monitor their
    costs for international calls." 
   
    The modus operandi is for the perpetrators of the fraud to telephone an
    organisation (often after hours and on weekends) to gain access to their
    voice mail. If the voice mail system has the ability to direct a call back from
    voice mail to the organisation's PABX system (known as call-through), then
    they can dial out to international destinations, it said. 
   
    "The latest telecommunications equipment is very sophisticated and offers
    benefits to industry and consumers, but has the potential to be misused for
    fraudulent purposes," said Symons. "It may be necessary to protect the
    Australian community by regulating the equipment to limit the potential for
    future fraud." 
   
    The ACA is taking an increasingly active role in regulating
    telecommunications equipment. The warning comes just a week after it
    banned mobile phone jamming systems (see story).

      The Java-Powered Ring is a special version of the Digital Decoder Ring that runs Java Card 2.0, enabling multiple applications to reside in a
      single iButton. Dynamic objects, large stacks, and garbage collection give the form exceptional functionality. Fast-write nonvolatile RAM lets
      applets be added or deleted on demand, giving you the ability to update. Services not even envisioned today can be added in the future by
      downloading applets. The 6K byte RAM lets this Java computer take on the more complex tasks envisioned for Internet commerce, requiring
      end-to-end connectivity.

 12.0 Courier and Press Newspaper hacked
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Via DC-STUFF posted by erehwon
      
       SJ Mercury News) EVANSVILLE, Ind. [2.20.99] -- A computer hacker
       gained access to online classified advertisements at the Courier &
       Press, said company president Vince Vawter. 
       
       
       The hacker altered wording in more than a dozen ads in the electronic
       edition of the ``Fast Trak'' automotive publication. Ads in the
       printed version of ``Fast Trak'' were not affected. The incident was
       reported to the FBI. Electronic advertising can be viewed by persons
       across the nation and is considered a form of interstate commerce. 
       
       
       ``I think it may have been a prank, but it's very serious,'' said
       Vawter. ``It's tampering with a commercial message. These advertisers
       are paying us to put that message out there.''
       
       
       The electronic ads are part of the Courier & Press online edition. 
       Online ads are protected with a password that is changed periodically.
       But further precautions will be instituted to protect the on-line
       publication. 
       
       
       Vawter said the ads were paid for by an area car dealer. He declined
       to identify the car dealer or what message the hacker posted in the
       dealer's ads. 
       
       
       The Courier & Press is taking steps to identify the hacker.  Vawter
       said it is important to protect the integrity of online advertising. 
       
       
       ``Electronic commerce is certainly in its infancy, but it's going to
       be a growing field. We consider this to be like somebody coming into
       our shop and changing the wording in our ads,'' he said.

  13.0 Youths busted in Backorifice fiasco
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       FUD FUD FUD and FUD, I was toying with the idea of putting this in the
       humour section this article is so damn funny or even leave it out 
       completely but its included here for the archive if for no other use as
       to put a smile on your face and bring a tear to your eye... here it is

       in all its glory, pHEAR BO hax0rz (sniff sniff)
       
       Secrets of an Internet snoop exposed 

       Trojan Horse is the name of software that allows hackers to find out
       other users' passwords. Computer  experts from Singapore, Australia 
       and the US tell SAMANTHA SANTA MARIA about the software with a sting 
       in its tail.


       A TROJAN Horse program, which a hacker sends out to snoop and bring 
       back information from cyberspace,  can be followed back to the hacker's
    ** nest quite easily, computer experts said. 
         
       ** We live in trees now do we? - Ed  
       
       This is because such programs generate unique identification codes for
       the hacker while he is capturing information from his victims. 

   **  These codes allow the authorities to find out where the hacker came from. 
         
         ** codes? what codes? 31337 and 12345 or our ips?!? pHEER!! pHEER!
                     
       The Singapore, Australian and US experts were commenting on the recent
       case here in which 17 SingNet users' passwords were posted on the Internet
       by a character called Acidgerm. 

       The Criminal Investigation Department arrested two youths two days after 
       The Straits Times reported on the  website containing the passwords. 

   **  The CID declined to say how it went about its work, but revealed that 
       the Trojan Horse method had been used. The experts The Straits Times 
       contacted said the most common Trojan Horse programs are Back Orifice and
       NetBus, which can be obtained from the Internet easily .

       Both work the same way: The hacker sends them to the victim as an attachment
       to an e-mail, or while the victim is exchanging files during a chat using a 
       program such as Internet Relay Chat. 

       The hacker's programs then gather information -- passwords and credit card 
       numbers, for instance -- and (pHEER!) send this back to him. 

       But each of these snooper programs generates a unique number for the hacker
       -- NetBus generates 12345 and Back Orifice, 31337. (least they got this bit
       right)  Normal Web users have other codes while they are in cyberspace. 
       
       (cyberspace?)

        And just like the Electronic Road Pricing system, which can detect what 
        kind of vehicle is passing under a gantry, the servers of the various
        Internet access service providers, such as SingNet or CyberWay, log the 
        traffic passing through. 

        Mr Stephen James, managing director of IT Audit & Consulting, an Australian
        computer security firm, said investigators need scan only the service providers'
        records for the numbers. 

        They can then track the source of the Trojan Horse: the telephone number from
        which it originated and to which the information gathered was sent. 

        Commenting on the expertise of those who used the Trojan Horse method of entry
        here recently, Mr James said that they appear to be inexperienced. 

        A spokesman for Infinitum, a local IT security firm, said: "The numbers, 12345
        and 31337, are default numbers in the Trojan Horse programs. "More advanced
        hackers would have known how to change them."

 14.0  Reno Looks To Curb Internet Crime

        Reno Looks To Curb Internet Crime
        Contributed by FProphet
        
        WASHINGTON  (AP)

        A NEW public-private alliance to curb Internet crime will help 
        teach children "that hacking is the same as breaking and 
        entering," Attorney General Janet Reno said Monday. 

        Educating children about acceptable online behavior is among three
        initiatives under the Cybercitizen Partnership, an initiative of 
        government and the high-tech industry to promote cyberspace ethics
        and help law enforcers track down online criminals. 

        "All children know it's wrong to break into a neighbor's house or 
        read your best friend's diary. Unfortunately, fewer realize that 
        it's wrong to break into their neighbor's computers and snoop through
        their computer files," Reno said. 

        The Cybercitizen Partnership also will feature a "personnel exchange
        program" between private business and federal agencies in which both
        will learn how the other responds to threats and crimes over the 
        Internet. Companies can find out how best to help law-enforcement
        agencies, and government officials will learn what business 
        interests and influences drive industry decisions. 

        The campaign also will create a directory of computer experts and 
        computer security resources so that "law enforcement will know where
        to turn," Reno said. 

        The partnership was announced, along with Reno's comments, during a
        high-tech industry summit sponsored by the Information Technology 
        Association of America. 

        "A decade ago, cybercrime and cyberterrorism didn't really exist 
        outside of Hollywood movies. Today, they are very real threats," 
        Reno said. 

        "We cannot allow cyberspace to become the Wild West of the 
        information age." 

        Last week, a top Pentagon official warned members of the Senate
        Armed Services Committee about an electronic Pearl Harbor by 
        cyberterrorists more likely to go after commercial targets than 
        military ones. 

        Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said he worries increasingly 
        about the vulnerability of commercial and financial interests. 

        "This Pearl Harbor's going to be different," he said last Tuesday.
        "It's not going to be against Navy ships sitting in a Navy shipyard;
         it's going to be against commercial infrastructure, and we don't 
         control that. And there's been little progress on that."

       perhaps a better question would be: why hide information?  not only
       should information be _free_, but people should realize that
       *information* is worthless.  it is only when information is transformed
       into knowledge that it is valuable.  only when companies and governments
       begin to realize that the archaic data model that used to work in the
       industrial age is not relevant to the age of knowledge will a rational
       and realistic definition of *cybercrime* exist...

       i would also question whether ms. reno or anyone in the clinadmin is
       capable of characterizing what is "acceptable online behavior."  they
       don't understand the net and they certainly cannot oversee it...

       Posted 3/17/99 
       
       
       Munich Laser Emits A Beam Of Matter Waves 
       
       
       German scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in
       Garching and the University of Munich have developed a laser that emits a
       continuous heam of matter waves instead of light (to be reported in
       Physical Review Letters). 
       
       
       Such unprecedented control over atomic motion becomes possible by the
       laws of quantum mechanics at very low temperatures, close to absolute
       zero, where the atoms reveal their wave nature. 
       
       
       Atom lasers open new prospects in many areas of science and technology.
       For instance, it should become possible to accurately deposit atoms on
       surfaces and thus to produce tiny nanostructures, as needed in future
       computer circuits. Atom lasers may also lead to extremely precise atomic
       clocks for future navigation and communication systems. 
       
       
       In their experiments, Tilman Esslinger, Immanuel Bloch and Theodor W.
       Hänsch have taken pictures of the shadow cast by their atom laser beam.
       The pencil-like beam contains about half a million rubidium atoms and is
       accelerated downwards by gravity. 
       
       
       Just as a beam of light, an atom laser beam can be focused and reflected
       by using lenses or mirrors consisting of laser light (or of magnets). It
       appears feasible to focus an atom laser beam to a spot size of one
       nanometer, which is a thousand times smaller than the smallest focus of a
       laser beam. 
       
       
       The atom laser is based on Bose- Einstein condensation. If a gas is
       cooled to a few millionth of a degree above absolute zero, the atoms lose
       their identity and behave as a single entity, some kind of "super atom".
       Such a Bose-Einstein condensate was first produced by American scientists
       in 1995. 
       
       
       In the Munich experiment, a dilute gas of rubidium atoms is captured in a
       sophisticated low-power magnetic trap and cooled down to reach
       Bose-Einstein condensation. With the help of a radiofrequency field the
       scientists flip the atomic spin so that atoms are allowed escape from the
       magnetic trap. In vacuum, the atoms are accelerated by gravity and form a
       parallel beam of coherent matter waves. 
       
       
       It the radiofrequency field is turned on before condensation sets in, the
       atom laser can only reach threshold, if there is laser "gain". Unlike a
       Bose-Einstein condensate, such a laser relies on matter wave
       amplification by stimulated elastic scattering of rubidium atoms just as
       an optical laser relies on light amplification by stimulated emission of
       radiation. 
       
       
       Two years ago, a group at MIT demonstrated the first pulsed atom laser.
       The Munich group is the first to produce a continuous matter wave beam
       which can be maintained for a tenth of a second. The wave packet of each
       atom extends over the entire length of this beam, so that a quantum
       object of truly macroscopic dimensions is created. The high brightness
       and coherence of such a matter wave beam opens exciting perspectives for
       the young fields of atom optics and atom interferometry.

       Cracking The Code
       BY CHRIS TAYLOR
       
       
       The dress code is business casual--no jeans allowed, not to 
       mention pierced noses. It's the first day of class--hacking 
       class--and the instructors, smartly attired in matching 
       corporate polo shirts, point at screens full of code and 
       step-by-step directions on how to hack a host computer. 
       "Get this: No username, no password, and we're connected," 
       says one. "I'm starting to get tingles. They're going to be 
       toast pretty quick." Geekspeak, at least, is still de 
       rigueur.
       
       
       In the world of corporate espionage, a company's host 
       computer is the mother lode, which means that protecting it 
       is vital. That's the goal of Extreme Hacking, one of a 
       growing number of counterhacking courses that teach 
       perfectly respectable people the how-tos of cracking their 
       own networks so they can better protect them. "We're kind 
       of wearing the white and black hats at the same time," says 
       Eric Schultze, the Ernst & Young instructor who gets 
       tingles from an exposed password file. 
       
       
       How easy is it to hack? If these guys can teach a novice 
       like me how to break through a firewall, I figure, then all 
       our networks --at least, the ones without encryption keys 
       or extremely alert administrators--are in trouble. Why? 
       Because this is the information age, and the average 
       computer gives up far too much information about itself. 
       Because a network is only as strong as its weakest user. 
       And because the most common log-on password in the world, 
       even in non-English speaking countries, is "password." With 
       users like this, who needs enemies?
       
       
       How big a problem is this in the real world? "Rarely is 
       there a moment when a hacker isn't trying to get into our 
       networks," says a senior Microsoft executive. "People go 
       looking for that weak link." Recently hackers found a 
       backdoor through a user in Europe--an administrator, no 
       less--with a blank password. This allowed the hacker root 
       access--the ability to change everyone else's password, 
       jump onto other systems and mess up the payroll file. 
       
       
       In our first class, we have no problem rooting around in 
       the Web servers of a top Internet company. We find three 
       open ports on the firewall and a vulnerable mail server. 
       "This network is a f___ing mess," says a classmate. "We 
       need to have a word with these people."
       
       
       Over the next few days, any faith I had in the security of 
       the world around me crumbles. Think your password is safe 
       because it isn't "password"? If it's in the dictionary, 
       there is software that will solve it within minutes. If 
       it's a complex combination of letters and numbers, that may 
       take an hour or so. There is software that will hijack your 
       desktop and cursor--and you won't even know about it. 
       Hacking doesn't require much hardware; even a Palm Pilot 
       can do it. What protection do you have? "Minimize 
       enticements," say the teachers. If you don't want to be a 
       victim of information rape, in other words, don't let your 
       network give out so many details to strangers.
       
       
       Old-school hackers scoff at the notion that businesses can 
       stop them. "Corporations can't teach hacking," says 
       Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of the hacker quarterly 2600. 
       "It has to be in you." Perhaps. But if a few more firms 
       learn to avoid becoming toast, that's no bad thing. END

         In the following file, all references made to the name Unix, may also be
       substituted to the Xenix operating system.
       
         Brief history:  Back in the early sixties, during the development of third
       generation computers at MIT, a group of programmers studying the potential of
       computers, discovered their ability of performing two or more tasks
       simultaneously.  Bell Labs, taking notice of this discovery, provided funds for
       their developmental scientists to investigate into this new frontier.  After
       about 2 years of developmental research, they produced an operating system they
       called "Unix".
       
         Sixties to Current:  During this time Bell Systems installed the Unix system
       to provide their computer operators with the ability to multitask so that they
       could become more productive, and efficient.  One of the systems they put on the
       Unix system was called "Elmos".  Through Elmos many tasks (i.e.  billing,and
       installation records) could be done by many people using the same mainframe.
       
         Note:  Cosmos is accessed through the Elmos system.
       
         Current:  Today, with the development of micro computers, such multitasking
       can be achieved by a scaled down version of Unix (but just as powerful).
       Microsoft,seeing this development, opted to develop their own Unix like system
       for the IBM line of PC/XT's.  Their result they called Xenix (pronounced
       zee-nicks).  Both Unix and Xenix can be easily installed on IBM PC's and offer
       the same functions (just 2 different vendors).
       
         Note:  Due to the many different versions of Unix (Berkley Unix, Bell System
       III, and System V the most popular) many commands following may/may not work.  I
       have written them in System V routines.  Unix/Xenix operating systems will be
       considered identical systems below.
       
         How to tell if/if not you are on a Unix system:  Unix systems are quite common
       systems across the country.  Their security appears as such:
       
       Login;     (or login;)
       password:
       
         When hacking on a Unix system it is best to use lowercase because the Unix
       system commands are all done in lower- case.
       
         Login; is a 1-8 character field.  It is usually the name (i.e.  joe or fred)
       of the user, or initials (i.e.  j.jones or f.wilson).  Hints for login names can
       be found trashing the location of the dial-up (use your CN/A to find where the
       computer is).
       
         Password:  is a 1-8 character password assigned by the sysop or chosen by the
       user.
       
             Common default logins
          --------------------------
       
          login;       Password:
       
          root         root,system,etc..
          sys          sys,system
          daemon       daemon
          uucp         uucp
          tty          tty
          test         test
          unix         unix
          bin          bin
          adm          adm
          who          who
          learn        learn
          uuhost       uuhost
          nuucp        nuucp
       
         If you guess a login name and you are not asked for a password, and have
       accessed to the system, then you have what is known as a non-gifted account.  If
       you guess a correct login and pass- word, then you have a user account.  And,
       if you guess the root password, then you have a "super-user" account.  All Unix
       systems have the following installed to their system:  root, sys, bin, daemon,
       uucp, adm
       
         Once you are in the system, you will get a prompt.  Common prompts are:
       
       
       $
       
       %
       
       #
       
       
         But can be just about anything the sysop or user wants it to be.
       
         Things to do when you are in:  Some of the commands that you may want to try
       follow below:
       
         who is on (shows who is currently logged on the system.)
         write name (name is the person you wish to chat with)
         To exit chat mode try ctrl-D.
         EOT=End of Transfer.
         ls -a (list all files in current directory.)
         du -a (checks amount of memory your files use;disk usage)
         cd\name (name is the name of the sub-directory you choose)
         cd\ (brings your home directory to current use)
         cat name (name is a filename either a program or documentation your username
       has written)
       
         Most Unix programs are written in the C language or Pascal since Unix is a
       programmers' environment.
       
         One of the first things done on the system is print up or capture (in a
       buffer) the file containing all user names and accounts.  This can be done by
       doing the following command:
       
       
       
       cat /etc/passwd
       
       
       
         If you are successful you will a list of all accounts on the system.  It
       should look like this:
       
       root:hvnsdcf:0:0:root dir:/:
       joe:majdnfd:1:1:Joe Cool:/bin:/bin/joe
       hal::1:2:Hal Smith:/bin:/bin/hal
       
         The "root" line tells the following info :
       
       login name=root
       hvnsdcf   = encrypted password
       0         = user group number
       0         = user number
       root dir  = name of user
       /         = root directory
       
         In the Joe login, the last part "/bin/joe " tells us which directory is his
       home directory (joe) is.
       
         In the "hal" example the login name is followed by 2 colons, that means that
       there is no password needed to get in using his name.
       
         Conclusion:  I hope that this file will help other novice Unix hackers obtain
       access to the Unix/Xenix systems that they may find.  There is still wide growth
       in the future of Unix, so I hope users will not abuse any systems (Unix or any
       others) that they may happen across on their journey across the electronic
       highways of America.  There is much more to be learned about the Unix system
       that I have not covered.  They may be found by buying a book on the Unix System
       (how I learned) or in the future I may write a part II to this........
       
       
       AFAIK a part two was never released to this, if you know of one let me know so
       I can add it to my collection of old texts... I believe this was a one-off classic
       from the 80's though - Ed

 18.0  Spam is ICQ's latest headache
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
     And you thought you only had to worry about DoS kiddies? well now
     the mass advertising a$$hole$ are after you with spam.
     
     Spam is ICQ's latest headache 
     By Rose Aguilar
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     March 18, 1999, 12:10 p.m. PT 

     Most Netizens think of instant messaging software as a quick way to chat with
     friends and coworkers.

     But as some users of America Online's ICQ chat and instant message client are learning,
     the services also can give marketers an easy way to "seek" them.

     Unlike spam--most of which usually is left unopened or trashed upon receipt--ICQ's
     blinking yellow note, which signals users that a message is waiting, usually is opened
     seconds after it appears.


     Despite campaigns for new laws to curb junk email, most longtime email users have
     come to accept and even tolerate spam. It's almost inevitable with email, but with 
     ICQ, it's a different story. "I've gotten spam twice. Both times it was an invitation 
     to  visit a porn site. And no, I wouldn't keep using ICQ if spam  became a constant
     occurrence," one ICQ user told News.com via email.

     "I received a URL to visit a porn site and was disgusted. Unlike email, I have no 
     idea what the message is about, so  I'm more inclined, even excited, to open it. I'm
     disappointed," wrote another reader, who received her first spam last week after having 
     used the service since it launched back in 1996.

     Ironically, AOL has been one of the most adamant opponents of junk email. It argued in
      several successful lawsuits that spam overburdens its network and received court orders 
     to ban junk  emailers from its service. The company also has worked closely with federal 
     lawmakers to draft legislation targeting spammers.

     ICQ's Terms of Service (TOS) says, "By using the ICQ Software and its privacy and
     security features, you may be subject to various risks, including among others: Spoofing,
     eavesdropping, sniffing, spamming, breaking password, harassment, fraud, and forgery."

     ICQ, which has 28 million registered users and was acquired by AOL last June, says it
     hasn't received enough complaints to ban the use of spam, but it does give users a
     variety of tools to block it. 

     "If you wanted to set your ICQ universe and limit it to three people, you could," said ICQ
     spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer. "You would only hear from those three people and shut the
     rest of the universe out."

     In order to send a message to someone, ICQ users must add recipients to a contact list.
     Spammers can either target specific individuals by typing in their name or email address,
     or they can target random users based on their interests, background, affiliation, phone
     number, or profession.

     Meyers says the best way to block spam is to set your preferences so that a potential
     spammer who wants to add you to the contact list must first receive your authorization.

     "If you don't do that, anybody could add you to their contact list and monitor you all the
     time," said Meyers.

     Users also can block individuals or groups of people from sending messages.

     But what if ICQ spam becomes more prevalent? Meyers says ICQ will "let members
     decide what's right for them."

     Since being acquired by AOL, ICQ has become ensnared in other Net content
     controversies. Earlier this week, it abruptly pulled a "dirty word" content filtering option
     that was pointing users to a list that also barred phrases such as "now.org," the home
     page for the National Organization for Women.

     Some analysts say that as long as blocking tools are available, ICQ probably won't lose
     members.

     As for ICQ spam, William Blair equity analyst Abhishek Gami says it was inevitable.

     "Look at pop-up ads," he said. "Everyone hated AOL for pop-up ads, but now you can't go
     to GeoCities today without seeing a pop-up ad. You close it and move on. It's the price
     you pay for a free product."

     Even more interesting than porn-related and get-rich-quick spam is the marriage of instant
     messages and advertisements, he added.

     "[ICQ is] going to find a way to have people opt in to certain merchants or Web sites and
     let them know that they're interested in receiving messages in real time," said Gami.

     For example, bookseller Barnes & Noble might send out a "50 percent off" sale to a
     massive list of ICQ users who opt in. "[If customers] explicitly come to you and say,
     'Please bug me.' That's a gold mine waiting to happen."

      Teen Accused of Hacking Into AOL 

      Thursday, March 18, 1999; 8:18 p.m. EST

      NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- An 18-year-old high school dropout
      has been charged with computer tampering after hacking into the internal
      computers of America Online and altering some programs. 

      Jay Satiro was arrested and his computer confiscated Wednesday night
      after AOL officials contacted authorities. A complaint filed against Satiro
      said the teen-ager altered AOL data and programs that would cost about
      $50,000 to repair. 

      AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato refused to give details of what was
      altered or how long the intrusion went undetected. He said the intrusion
      ``really should mean absolutely nothing for America Online members.'' 

      Satiro's mother posted $5,000 bail. He did not return telephone messages
      seeking comment Thursday. 

      ``Jay's a genius, but his common sense is a little low,'' said his 15-year-old
      brother, Bobby. 

      First-degree computer tampering carries a maximum sentence of five to
      15 years in prison.

 20.0  Stolen calling card numbers are big business

      Stolen calling card numbers are big big business racking
      up millions of dollars in fraud charges each year.
      Criminals are still using the tried and true method of
      shoulder surfing and the social engineering of corporate
      switchboard operators, but have gone so far as to
      electronically break into corporate PBX's to record
      calling card numbers automatically. Investigators are
      even claiming that organized crime may be involved. 

      Somehow the journalist who wrote this story figures
      that this just must be the work of "Hackers" as he uses
      the term through out the story. Activities such as this
      would be more appropriately attributed to Phreakers but
      I am sure not even they would appreciated being
      labeled as criminals. Exactly when did the word 'hacker'
      become synonymous with criminal?

      Hot Spot in Phone 
      Scam Is On Hold 

      Hustlers who sell black market long-distance calls were lying
      low yesterday  at least by the pay phones at Broadway
      and 50th St.  in the wake of a Daily News probe into the
      $1.8 billion-a-year stolen calling card number business.

      The few regulars working the popular scam site yesterday,
      collecting $10 cash for unlimited calls to Africa or Asia, were
      more discreet in taking cash hand-offs from customers than before
      The News' report.

      The 50th St. pay phones are just one of many illicit outdoor calling
      bazaars throughout the city in which customers are connected to
      friends and relatives overseas at rates far lower than commercially
      available.

      Thousands of calling cards are stolen monthly, many by skilled
      criminal computer hackers.

      Hacker rings up $31,518 in calls

      GTE investigates attack on phone system of Medina
      County firm

      BY DAVID KNOX 
      Beacon Journal staff writer 

      WESTFIELD CENTER: A telephone hacker dialing an 800 number
      managed to break into the telephone system at the headquarters of Westfield
      Companies and rang up $31,518 worth of calls to foreign countries.

      The high-tech fraud occurred over the Feb. 6-7 weekend, according to
      Medina County Sheriff's Detective Tadd Davis.

      Shortly after the break-in, Davis said Westfield officials were notified by
      GTE of ``unusual telephone calls being made'' and took steps to block the
      intruder.

      The company, a 150-year-old regional insurance corporation, alerted the
      sheriff on Tuesday after receiving a GTE phone bill that revealed the full
      extent of the intrusion.

      Scores of phone calls had been charged to the company's account to
      countries in every continent of the globe accept Antarctica.

      In Asia, calls were placed to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Korea, India,
      Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

      In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were called.

      Countries called in Europe included the United Kingdom, Norway and
      Croatia.

      Africa was represented on the bill by Egypt and Senegal, and South
      America by Equador and Peru.

      At least one call was placed to Australia.

      Davis said that the calls went through Westfield's automated phone system at
      all hours of the day and night over the two-day weekend.

      The duration of the calls ranged from a few minutes to more than three
      hours.

      ``I couldn't believe it,'' Davis said. ``I've never before dealt with something
      this sophisticated.''

      Dan Sondles, Westfield's senior vice president for corporate communication,
      said the company's phone system had never been broken into before.

      Sondles said company officials are working with GTE officials to ensure it
      doesn't happen again.

      ``They are trying to get to the bottom of it, just as we are,'' he said.

      Sondles said Westfield officials also are negotiating with GTE over
      responsibility for the huge bill.

      ``I don't know how that will be resolved,'' he said.

      Davis said the case may never be solved because the telephone hacker
      could have called from anywhere in the nation using the corporation's
      toll-free 800 number.

      Because hackers can manipulate the computerized global telephone
      network, Davis said there often is ``no way to trace back to the person
      making the call.''

      Joseph Persichini, assistant special agent in charge at the FBI's Cleveland
      office, said the problem of hackers breaking into telephone systems has
      increased worldwide because of the computerization of the global telephone
      system.

      ``Telephone hacking is computer hacking,'' Persichini said. ``It is not easy to
      accomplish . . . It takes perseverance and knowledge.''

      Persichini declined to speculate on the purpose of the calls placed through
      the Westfield phone system.

      Some hackers break into systems just to show off and share their
      knowledge on the Internet.

      ``There are Web sites and groups that pride themselves on their ability to
      hack into systems,'' he said.

      Another possibility is that the break-in was part of an illegal commercial
      scheme.

      Persichini said a large corporation such as Westfield Companies ``is a good
      target because of the large volume of calls they place and the accessibility of
      their 800 number.''

 21.0 Promail freeware mail agent is really a trojan in disguise
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
        News and security advisories from Aeon Labs. 


        [03.99]

        ProMail v1.21, an advanced freeware mail program for Windows 95/98, is a trojan.
        It has been spread through several worldwide distribution networks (SimTel.net,
        Shareware.com and others) as proml121.zip.

        Upon discovering - through LAN sniffing - that the program would attempt to connect
        to SMTP instead of POP3 when a regular mail check was performed, we
        reverse-engineered the software.

        The executable, which appears to have been created with Borland Delphi, has been
        packed with Petite (a shareware Win32-EXE compressor) and then "hexed" to make
        disassembly harder.

        ProMail v1.21 supports multiple mailboxes; every time a new mailbox is created, an
        "ini" file containing the users full name, passwords, email addresses, servers and
        more is generated.

        Prior to doing any other action, the program performs a check for a valid network
        connection which, if found, allows for the sending of ALL of the personal user data,
        including the user's password in encrypted format, to an account on NetAddress - a
        free email provider.

        Apart from this "feature", the software is 100 % functional and very well done.

 22.0  Hackers taking toll on web sites ...

      Hackers taking toll on Web sites 

      By Steve Fidel
      Deseret News staff writer

       Businesses hanging out an Internet shingle don't like to make a big deal
      of it when their Web site gets hacked. But it happens.
      Hackers break in to Web servers just to show they can. Crackers break in
      to steal money or information. Political activists, known as "hactivists," plant
      political messages or disrupt traffic.
      "There is a problem getting good numbers. Financial institutions, health
       care  they are not going to go public that they were hacked. If they did,
      people wouldn't give them their money," said Todd Neilson, applications sales
      engineer for US WEST.
            In round numbers, the Web security problem cost businesses $6 billion
      last year, Neilson estimates. Most of that loss was not the result of corporate
      espionage or embezzlement but because of lost productivity from disruptions
      hackers caused, he said. "If your server is down for a week because you have
      to go in and fix a problem, that ends up costing a lot of money."
            Promoting awareness and introducing businesses to some of its products
      and business partners are the motives behind a conference on Internet
      security US WEST hosted in Salt Lake City Thursday.
            Neilson is on the circuit preaching Internet security in the major cities in
      US WEST's 14-state territory. He has a professional hacker in the act to
      demonstrate the ways Web security shortcomings are exploited.
            "A firewall that is 99 percent secure is 100 percent vulnerable," Neilson
      said. The biggest problem is finding the technology talent to stay ahead of
      the hackers.
            "The moral of the conference is: If you think that basic security is good
      enough, it really isn't. You really need someone who knows what they're
      talking about" engineering a commercial Web site.

       Subject: Funny as hell crypto-gram     
       
       
       
       A recent 'cryptogram' (by Bruce Schneier) discusses several psuedo-crypto
       companies, their "secure" algorithms, and misimformation...

       Here's a brief protion:
       
       
       "
       Warning Sign #1: Pseudo-mathematical gobbledygook.  
       
       
       In the quote above, notice the "unique in-house developed incremental base
       shift algorithm."  Does anyone have any idea what that means?  Are there
       any academic papers that discuss this concept?  Long noun chains don't
       automatically imply security
       
       
       Meganet <http://www.meganet.com> has a beauty on their Web site: "The base
       of VME is a Virtual Matrix, a matrix of binary values which is infinity in
       size in theory and therefore have no redundant value.  The data to be
       encrypted is compared to the data in the Virtual Matrix.  Once a match is
       found, a set of pointers that indicate how to navigate inside the Virtual
       Matrix is created.  That set of pointers (which is worthless unless
       pointing to the right Virtual Matrix) is then further encrypted in dozens
       other algorithms in different stages to create an avalanche effect. The
       result is an encrypted file that even if decrypted is completely
       meaningless since the decrypted data is not the actual data but rather a
       set of pointers.  Considering that each session of VME has a unique
       different Virtual Matrix and that the data pattern within the Virtual
       Matrix is completely random and non-redundant, there is no way to derive
       the data out of the pointer set."  This makes no sense, even to an expert.
       
       
       US Data Security <http://www.usdsi.com> has another beauty: "From a
       mathematical point of view, the TTM algorithm is intuitively natural and
       less cumbersome to use than methods that are number-theory based."
       SuperKrypt <http://www.superkrypt.com/> tries to impress with an acronym:
       "SuperKrypt products utilize the DNGT bulk encryption method," whatever
       that is.  And Cennoid <http://www.cennoid.com> just doesn't understand
       what
       it's talking about: "Since key length and key structure vary and since the
       encryption engine does not use any mathematical algorithms, reverse
       engineering is impossible and guessing is not an option."

      Local Girl's Website Attacked by 'The Nugget' 
      Contributed by siko
      Friday - March 12, 1999. 06:24PM GMT 

          It seemed like any other day in the Northeast region of the United States.
      But unlike any other day, 'The Nugget' was busy cracking one local girl's
      website. 

      "I went to post some news about myself and .. ", said local girl only known to
      Innerpulse as 'Amy', just before bursting into tears. "I didn't even do anything
      to The Nugget".

      Among the noticable changes to the website, The Nugget made several
      character distinctions in which local authorities hope to use to catch the raving
      tator.

      "We have been able to confirm that this (The) Nugget character likes beer
      and hookers, among other things. We also have a rough sketch of (The)
      Nugget", said Warren Chief of Police John Scranton.

      The young victim has been sent to therapy to relieve stress and damage to her
      upstanding reputation.

      Brazilian hackers ignore Ugly American 
      Contributed by Shredder Sledder
      Wednesday - March 17, 1999. 03:46PM UTC 

          Furthering his attempt to alienate 95% or more of the entire global
      population, John Vranesevich made disparaging comments about a nation of
      millions today. 

      Man on the wire interviews on a larger brazilian IRC network
      (irc.brasnet.org) revealed spirited replies to this unprovoked ugliness: 

      "Who?" rang out 37 times in portugese, a few english, and one spanish reply
      as to the name "John Vranesevich" and/or "JP". 

      When an explanation was provided, along with quoted text, most hackers
      responded with random series of keystrokes signifying disgust and thought
      provoking wisdom. Translated excerpts include: 

      "Come to our country and say that, Fag!", "Skinny White Bitch, I have a
      BS in Computer Science AND I fucked your sister", "hehehe, I'll bet he's
      never seen a topless beach before." & "I don't get it, who did you say he
      was?" 

      Most brazilian hackers quickly ignored the news and went back to discussing
      inconsistencies between the portugese distributions of linux and english
      versions.

      2600 Meeting Ends in Tragedy   
      Contributed by siko
      Wednesday - March 10, 1999. 08:41AM GMT 

          The local 2600 chapter in Hartford, Connecticut, experienced a serious
      disagreement late Tuesday night at the Hartford Civic Center, their meeting
      place.

      "Me and HoBeater were just chillin.. and all of a sudden I heard NetSpud and
      TerDberGER having some sort of disagreement", remembers JehriKirlz, who
      was an eye witness to a fight that broke out. "Next thing I know, punches are
      being thrown".

      "How much of an idiot can you be? He claims that Windows98 is nothing but
      a waste of hard drive space and that Windows95 is more compact. First of
      all, there are too many enhancements in the latest installation of Windows to
      overlook. He deserved it", said NetSpud as he was taken away in cuffs.

      The disagreement over which version of the popular Microsoft OS led to
      what some 2600 members are calling a 'terrible mess'. People passing by at
      the local mall remember the incident only as 'fucking hilarious'. Only two
      punches were thrown, both by NetSpud, landing blows to left ear and another
      to the chin.

      "I tried to grab his hair, there is so much of it. I keep telling that punk to cut
      his hair. Nooooo it makes him look more hackerish. This is a travesty of
      justice. Anyone with a brain knows Windows95 is better than that bloatware
      known as Windows98", said TerDberGER, as he was carried away on a
      stretcher, broken glasses and all.

      Police were called to the scene and immediately settled both parties down,
      but the 2600 meeting was cancelled. 


 HA.HA2 Business at the speed of Drool
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Via HNN who funnily enough had Pastydrone's name down as Patsy Drone (!)
        which is a joke in itself anyways ... moving right along <bah hahahaha>
        sorry..Pasty's a good guy he'll let me off with laughing at that 
        right Pasty? <wink wink> 
        
        
        http://newstrolls.com/news/dev/diva/diva031599.htm
        
        This is a response to the Time story on Bill Gates's new book where
        he prints 12 steps to good business practices... funny stuff - Ed
        
        Business @ the Speed of Drool  by Pasty Drone (Newstrolls)
        
                    Business @ the Speed of Drool as it Oozes from the

                       (Editor's Note: This is humour. If you can't take a joke, click off.) 

                Bill Gates has written a book. It is his second book. It is a nice book and it is
                called Business @ the Speed of Thought and if you must buy it, at least help
                         support NewsTrolls by purchasing it through our link. 

               Time Magazine has an excerpt from the book entitled Bill Gates' New Rules in
               which it excerpts the following 12 rules of business according to Bill...I've added
               my own little insights to Bill's big ones (all caps). I suggest you read the article
                                   first and then come back here. 


                   1 INSIST THAT COMMUNICATION FLOW THROUGH E-MAIL 

               Email will never replace the face-to-face. No one who has been petrified by the
              company lawyer's fire-and-brimstone-lawsuit-lecture is going to put sensitive info
                                           in an email. 

                   2 STUDY SALES DATA ONLINE TO SHARE INSIGHTS EASILY 

              Read: Study sales data online so Microsoft can share you insights...via their nifty
                                         ID mechanics... 

                 3 SHIFT KNOWLEDGE WORKERS INTO HIGH-LEVEL THINKING 

                 Poor Bill...he's still deluded that executives actually READ the charts and
               worksheets of data...the middle managers are usually too busy creating the next
               set of data to analyze an earlier output, and you're lucky if your line employees
                                have junior college under their belt... 

                      4 USE DIGITAL TOOLS TO CREATE VIRTUAL TEAMS 

              Sometimes this works (ala NewsTrolls), most times climbing the corporate ladder
              results in anti-team work. People compete to prove that THEIR way of using the
                digital tools is the best one, and with each new senior mid-management hire,
                  there's a new set of tools for you to feed your data into while the rest get
                                            chucked. 

                  5 CONVERT EVERY PAPER PROCESS TO A DIGITAL PROCESS 

                Bill admits they can't even do it at his place (although they got it down to 60).
               Some things ARE better left on paper or you're just going to spend MILLIONS
                 more on programmer bills because you're updating your Intranet every two
               seconds (and don't even think you can automate THAT process; users refuse to
                                        look at HTML...) 

                    6 USE DIGITAL TOOLS TO ELIMINATE SINGLE-TASK JOBS 

              Here's where Bill really makes $$$ off of you. Where before you had your data in
               a relatively inocuous Excel spreadsheet, now you also get to try and wrangle the
                  same data into MS Project, MS Access, and probably embed it in a MS
                 Powerpoint slide. MS digital tools eliminate Single Task jobs because they
                 replicate the single tasks into more numerous and time-consuming ones... 

                             7 CREATE A DIGITAL FEEDBACK LOOP 

                Well, it's more like a digital PLYBACK loop (same data, new MS program).
                                   Here's a neat quote from Bill: 
              The best projects are those in which people have the customer scenario clearly in
                                             mind... 
              Let's all remember to really think of MICROSOFT when you think of KEEPING
                                  THE CUSTOMER IN MIND... 

                  8 USE DIGITAL SYSTEMS TO ROUTE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS
                                        IMMEDIATELY 

               Honestly I can't believe Bill has the balls to make point #8, but there you go...
               And, does ANYONE read those customer complaint emails? Well, ok...maybe if
               they're really bizarre... Actually in many instances the people who actually DO
               the product design are not native English speakers so having them answer the
                 mail could be rather amusing...and of course that's assuming your product
                              designers aren't in Bombay or elsewhere... 

               9 USE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION TO REDEFINE THE BOUNDARIES 

                 This one could basically be summed up into: Hire more temps (think of the
                         benefits money you'll save). Oh, and then the kicker: 
               In the Web work style, employees can push the freedom the Web provides to its
                                             limits. 
                   In other words, GET USED TO the idea that you won't get benefits... 

                 10 TRANSFORM EVERY BUSINESS PROCESS INTO JUST-IN-TIME
                                          DELIVERY 

                I think Bill meant to say "Barely-There Delivery". Witness Office 2000. And
              HEY!...whereas with paper you often turned in deadline documents the morning of
                an afternoon deadline, now you can wait up to 2:55 for a 3:00 deadline...that's
                                           progress! 

                  11 USE DIGITAL DELIVERY TO ELIMINATE THE MIDDLE MAN 

              Ah, now this is clever Bill at his finest...the subtext on this one is: Stock Brokers,
                Real Estate Agents...don't be scared!...Put your trust in Bill and through his
               products he will allow you to firmly entrench your job so that no one would ever
                         DARE call spreadsheet-shittin' YOU a "middle man". 

              12 USE DIGITAL TOOLS TO HELP CUSTOMERS SOLVE PROBLEMS FOR
                                         THEMSELVES 

              Or, in other words it is better for your customer to get stuck in a phone tree from
              hell than to train a human to help them not panic when they see the Windows Blue
                                        Screen of Death. 

              So let's see Rules 4,6,8,9,11,and 12 all say USE DIGITAL. Rule 7 uses the word
              "create", but could just as easily be "use". And what do all the rules tell you dear
                                            reader? 

                                       BUY MICROSOFT. 
        
        The actual Time story can be found at the following URL or go <koff>
        buy Bills book, god knows he needs the cash for an arboritium ...

 HOW.TO "How To Hack" March 1999 -> Part I (Steps 1 to 4)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               
         
        Intro 
        ~~~~~
         
         This is not coincidentally next to the HA.HA section in the 
        HWA.hax0r.news zine in fact the name itself is a piss-take on the
        "scene" (if you can't take the piss out of yourself you're taking
        things way to seriously and won't survive 2 weeks out here) but its
        a fact that anyone that puts out a zine like this has to  deal with
        and thats the endless messages and questions from 'newbies' asking
        "HOW DO I HACK xxxx OS?" etc, well here's how you do it. I'll warn 
        you up front that i'm not going to be gentle and will be fucking
        blunt with you, if you don't have the balls fuck off now you're dead 
        meat and will be minced and made a laughing stock all over the net, 
        if you think you can handle it then read on, this is an excersize
        that is best learned by doing but do it on your own machine if you
        try any of these things on someone elses box without any experience
        you will end up in jail.
        
        Step 1.
        ~~~~~~~
        
        If you are not running FreeBSD, or a variation thereof or Linux in
        any of its incarnations, the first thing you need to do is either
        partition off 400M or so of your home machine for linux (easiest)
        or get a scrap 386 from somewhere (unix isn't windows and will
        run just fine with 8 or even 4 megs of ram for our purposes) and
        install linux or FreeBSD, I prefer BSD but there are more exploits
        written for linux. Why? because writing to the raw sockets in linux
        is a lot easier than it is in BSD, BSD is closer to *real* unix 
        than Linux is, when linux first came out it was little more than
        a toy shell and was buggy as hell, BSD on the other hand was raped
        of its best parts and incorporated into linux, thats why it has one
        of the best TCP stacks out there, you can thank BSD for that...NT
        also owes its existance to Linux and BSD so by using and learning
        one of these OS's you will be set in good stead for hax0ring your
        way to stardom. Thats what you want isn't it? if thats the case 
        this file is NOT for you. Stardom=recognition=fame or infamy=jail
        time. Are you ready for jail? no? ok maybe you're reading this for
        the humour value or maybe you want to persue or are persuing a
        career in security, cool its a fun job isn't it? you get to hack
        and you're on the side of the good guys. Ok keep reading...
        
        Step 2
        ~~~~~~
        
        Locate all the texts you can that pertain to breaking into systems
        and locate a good source of exploit code, (aka scripts) you don't
        want to become a script kiddie but you do need example code to learn
        from and the best code is usually put out with security in mind but
        can be bent to 'evil' ends by turning it around and using it to enter
        rather than block holes in the system. Some good places to look for
        code are www.rootshell.com (they don't keep up to date as much as
        they used to since they were rewted by hackers using a hole in SSH
        but they still have a good variety of exploit scripts available) for
        up to the minute exploit code PacketStorm Security is probably the
        best site that you will ever find, they are located on the Genocide2600
        servers at http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/ and the site is run
        by Ken Williams a key member of EHAP. Proof that ethical hacking does
        exist.
        
        Step 3
        ~~~~~~
        
        Gather up every FAQ and RFC that you can pertaining to networking and
        network security, yes this means reading and learning new stuph, if 
        this sounds like work, well it is... and you better get used to it since
        staying on top of the daily exploits is key if you want to make sure that
        your system is secure once its on the net. "On the net you ask!?!?" well
        of course, we have to get you on the net to try out some of these mad 
        sploits don't we? unless you have a few machines laying around in which
        case we can do some intranet hacking as well.
        
        Step 4
        ~~~~~~
        
        Set up your network. I will not give you any help with this, I assume 
        you know how to setup a basic network if you don't then you haven't been
        following the steps properly or are plain stupid. Advice: Give up now and
        become a grass cutter, we need more of those the lawns around here are
        terrible.
        
        Step 5 
        ~~~~~~
        
        Breaking in. This is the bit you've all been waiting for, well guess what
        many zines and serials keep users hanging on by posting teasers to keep
        people interested, and shit, i'm no different, we'll continue with step
        5 IN AN UPCOMING ISSUE.

        P.S "Hacking IRC" is still in progress and will also be continued in a 
        further issue of the zine its not forgotten or dead by any means. - Ed
