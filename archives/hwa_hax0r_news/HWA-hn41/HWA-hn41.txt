     The Hacker's Ethic

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

               A Comment on FORMATTING: 
               
               
               Oct'99 - Started 80 column mode format, code is still left
                        untouched since formatting will destroy syntax.               
               
   
               I received an email recently about the formatting of this
               newsletter, suggesting that it be formatted to 75 columns
               in the past I've endevoured to format all text to 80 cols
               except for articles and site statements and urls which are
               posted verbatim, I've decided to continue with this method
               unless more people complain, the zine is best viewed in
               1024x768 mode with UEDIT.... - Ed

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not
    "CC" the bugtraq reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on this list and that
    reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be
     challenged by you, the author.

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa <n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina <http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.
      
      
      * Products. An incredible number of categorized security products
         from over two hundred different vendors.
      
      
      * Services. A large and focused directory of security services offered by
         vendors.
      
      
      * Books, Papers and Articles. A vast number of categorized security
         related books, papers and articles. Available to download directly
         for our servers when possible.
      
      
      * Tools. A large array of free security tools. Categorized and
         available for download.
      
      
      * News: A vast number of security news articles going all the way
         back to 1995.
      
      
      * Security Resources: A directory to other security resources on
         the net.
      
      
      As well as many other things such as an event calendar.
      
      
      For your convenience the home-page can be personalized to display
      only information you may be interested in. You can filter by
      categories, keywords and operating systems, as well as configure
      how much data to display.
      
      
      I'd like to thank the fine folks at NETSPACE for hosting the
      site for as long as they have. Their services have been invaluable.
      
      
      I hope you find these changes for the best and the new services
      useful. I invite you to visit http://www.securityfocus.com/ and
      check it out for yourself. If you have any comments or suggestions
      please feel free to contact me at this address or at

    [ISN] Security list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is a low volume list with lots of informative articles, if I had my
    way i'd reproduce them ALL here, well almost all .... ;-) - Ed

    
    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
      
      --[ New ISN announcement (New!!)
      
      
      Sender:       ISN Mailing List <ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM>
      From:         mea culpa <jericho@DIMENSIONAL.COM>
      Subject:      Where has ISN been?
      Comments: To: InfoSec News <isn@securityfocus.com>
      To:           ISN@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger
              Vanilla Ice is a wigger, The Beastie Boys and rappers speak using
              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN <g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same
             time too, HWA Hax0r News.... HHN is a part of HNN .. and HNN as a proper

            pure shit but if the answer you seek is indeed in the manual then you
            should have RTFM you dumb ass.

         HNN has received an unconfirmed rumor that the host
         of Parse Hack/Phreak, Shamrock was fired for unknown
         reasons. Shamrock along with UglyPig will evidently no
         longer be hosting any Pseudo.com shows. This action
         comes not two weeks after the MTV special in which
         Shamrock manufactured a hoax for the 'documentary'.
         There was no episode of Parse last week and HNN has
         yet to receive official word from Psuedo.com. It will be
         interesting to see if this weeks scheduled episode will
         air. (That show needed a change of format anyway.)

        w00w00 Security Development (WSD) will be releasing many advisories
        depending on vendor's timely responses.
        The severity of each vulnerability will outweigh the previously posted
        one, so keep your eyes out!
        If all goes according to plan, w00giving '99 will close with its largest

      Yeah we have a message board, feel free to use it, remember there are no stupid questions...
      well there are but if you ask something really dumb we'll just laugh at ya, lets give the
      message board a bit more use eh? i'll be using a real message board when the hwa-iwa.org

      well, it seems clear that sometimes a = c, but sometimes not
      changing selected a's yields:
      (c) 1999 cruciphux hwa
      Enn - (a1998 hwa steve
      
      i feel the top line is correct: all these exist as plaintext strings within the newsletter
      (hell, cruciphux writes the damn thing, doesn't he/she/non-gender-specific-pronoun?)
      but the bottom....
      
      try subtracting second from first..
      69:110:100
      - 40:97 :49 :57:57:56:32:104:119:97:32:115:116:101:118:101
      ------------------
      29:3  :51, the first two are unprintable (meaning i don't know them)
      
      
      try adding the two modulus 128 (ascii, right? sure...)
      
      69:110:100
      + 40:97 :49 
      -------------------
      (mod 128) 109:79:21 => mO<unprintable>
      
      try subtracting first from end of second: but that won't work, that will give us unprintables
      ok, so we got three characters. changing three characters at the beginning is not immediately
      obvious what that would give us. changing three characters at the end is somewhat more likely
      because a) st!!! could be a valid word, and b) steve doesn't make much sense, unless steve is
      cruciphux, which i don't know. ok, let's think this through...
      
         [ 28 63 29 20 31 39 39 39 20 63 72 75 63 69 70 68 75 78 20 68 77 61 ]
             [45:6E:64]-[28:63:29:31:39:39:38:20:68:77:61:20:73:74:65:76:65]    
      
      is it coincidence that the three 'mystery' letters line up with three other letters? what can we
      do with those? remember, those seem to be part of a valid string, but the other three could be 
      changed to give something else. (whatever that thought meant...)
      
      63:29:20
      45:6E:64
      
      in decimal 108:102:84 (if E = 3, 3 = E in h@X0r5p3@k, right?) => lfU, which is at least a
      printable string, but not immediately obvious (unless cruciphux attends lower florida university
      or something like that, fuck school pride)
      
      converted from hex to decimal:
      97:41 :32
      69:110:100
      
      added: 166:151:132
      now, the highest letter ascii code is 122 (126 really, forget the tilde for now) and the lowest
      is 65 (33 for punctuation), so we have a spread of 122-65 = 57 characters. given that our added
      string has a spread of 166-132 = 34 characters, we have 23 different permutations of possible
      characters (again, just using letters...) hmmmm.....
      
      ok, this is a little wild, but here goes:
      taking 100 away from each of those leaves 'B3 '
      using that, the bottom line reads as:
      B3 -(a1998 hwa steve
      
      
      let's look at what we have to work with:
      from the 1st part:
      c) 1999 crucphux hwa
      
      from the second part:
      (a) 1999 aruaiphux hwa
      Enn-(a1998 hwa steve
      
      
      or, verbatim:
            [63 29 20 31 39 39 39 20 63 72 75 63 69 70 68 75 78 20 68 77 61 ]
         [ 28 63 29 20 31 39 39 39 20 63 72 75 63 69 70 68 75 78 20 68 77 61 ]
             [45:6E:64]-[28:63:29:31:39:39:38:20:68:77:61:20:73:74:65:76:65]    
      
      they do form lines, but i don't really feel like doing any matrix theory now (especially in
      ascii).
             c) 1999 crucphux hwa
           (a) 1999 aruaiphux hwa
              Enn-(a1998 hwa steve
      
      
      more speculation: if the e were lower case, it would have the same spread as 1 and 9; we would
      have to subtract (166-49=) 117 from at least that first term. doing that to all three yields
      1"<unprintable> - that's not going to work.
      ok, i am thinking too hard. maybe 
      
      
      
      ok, i got it. yes, i was thinking too hard, made a simple mistake at the stop. the last string
      should read (ok, i made a couple of mistakes):
      End-(c)1998 hwa steve
      which makes a lot more sense. and so the moral of the story is:
      check your fuckin work so you don't waste time later on!
      nice puzzle though, keep it up!
      
      (ps - i dunno if you were being facetious, but it's 'encryption', not 'incryption'. you know that
      already, i bet)
      
      
      
      
      
      
      [1] sneaky hex in that it not obviously hex, i.e. no letters... forget it
      keep up the good work

03.0  Fix Available For Very Powerful IIS Exploit 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      contributed by Ender Wiggin 
      The recent spate of defacements of government and
      military sites may be the result of a hole released to
      BugTraq six months ago. This hole can be exploited with
      a simple perl script. A fix for this problem has come from
      a very unlikely source, the United Loan Gunmen.

      CERT has also released an advisory on the issue and
      Microsoft does have an old fix. Considering the number
      of high profile sites that have been defaced because of
      this we suggest you patch your system now.

      Temporary Fix for Remote IIS NT AUTHORITY / SYSTEM Shell
      Spawning Exploits
      11/1/99

                                                  United Loan Gunmen

      Recently, a perl script from Rain Forest Puppy was released, has become a
      favorite amongst script kiddies. The severity of this script allows remote NT
      AUTHORITY/SYSTEM level access, and is a major threat, even to highly
      secured NT networks.

      We have come up with 2 ways of thwarting these types of attacks. Since RFP's
      perl script relies on the use of either cmd.exe or command.com, we feel that a
      temporary fix of renaming cmd.exe shell or command.com shell to something 
      else. Doing this will mostl likely fool 99% of the script kiddies.

      A better temporary idea would be to set permissions of cmd.exe and
      command.com for NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM to that of 'No Access' versus
      'Full Control'. The most noted problem with this is that of using the Schedule
      service, which, by  default, runs as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. In this case, in
      order to still use the  service, Simply open up Services in the Control Panel.
      Select Schedule, then  click the 'Startup...' button. By default, services are run as
      the System  Account. Select the 'This Account:' radio button, and select a
      different user  to run at services  as. If you dont already have a user, create a new
      account.

      NOTE: With NT, we found it is a wise idea to set user access for shells (with
      NT, cmd and command) be different for services. This means that if netinfo.exe is
      run as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM, don't let NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM have
      shell access.

      Should the ability to spawn a shell be possible, having permissions set as the
      above will stop it from happening, even if the hole is still there. 

      We have only provided a temporary fix, as we have not had much time to spend
      dealing with RFP's perl script. Look to Microsoft or a third party to provide a
      real fix.

      Attacks against IIS web servers involving MDAC

      We are receiving reports of IIS web servers being compromised via 
      vulnerabilities in IIS web servers with MS Data Access Components (MDAC)
      installed. This vulnerability has been widely discussed as early as April
      22, 1998. Here are some pointers to information about this vulnerability:

           http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q184/3/75.asp 
           http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms98-004.asp 
           http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-025.asp 

       In incidents reported to us so far, attacks can be identified by looking 
       through the IIS logfiles for POST access to the file "/msadc/msadcs.dll". 
       For example: 

         1999-10-24 20:38:12  - WWW  POST /msadc/msadcs.dll 200 1409 664 782 ACTIVEDATA - -

       If you use Microsoft Remote Data Services (RDS) these POST operations may
       be legitimate.

       We encourage all sites using IIS to carefully follow the steps listed in 
       Microsoft Advisory MS99-025, referenced above, to secure or disable RDS.



       Root Compromised UNIX Systems

       rpc.cmsd, tooltalk, statd/automountd 

       We continue to receive frequent reports of intruders exploiting three 
       different RPC service vulnerabilities to compromise UNIX systems. In 
       many cases, the attacks are widespread and appear to be at least 
       partially automated. 

       For more information about this activity and the vulnerabilities being 
       exploited, please refer to the following CERT/CC documents: 

            IN-99-04, Similar attacks using various RPC services 

            CA-99-08, Buffer overflow in rpc.cmsd 
            CA-99-05, Vulnerability in statd exposes vulnerability in automountd 
            CA-98.11, Vulnerability in ToolTalk RPC service 

            am-utils (amd) 

       We also continue to receive reports of intruder activity involving 
       the am-utils package. 

       For more information about this activity and the vulnerabilities being
       exploited, please refer to the following CERT/CC documents: 

            IN-99-05, Systems Compromised Through a Vulnerability in am-utils 

            CA-99-12, Buffer overflow in amd 



       Distributed Intruder Tools

       Distributed Denial of Service Tools 

       We are receiving an increasing number of reports about intruders
       compromising machines in order to install distributed systems used for
       launching packet flooding denial of service attacks. The systems contain
       a small number of servers and a large number of clients.

       These reports indicate that machines participating in such distributed
       systems are likely to have been root compromised.



       Widespread Scans and Probes

       We continue to receive daily reports of widespread scans and probes. 
       Probe targets continue to include well-known services and a variety of
       registered and unregistered service ports. In some cases, scanning is 
       automated and includes automated exploitation of vulnerabilities. 

       The most frequent reports involve probes for services that have well-known
       vulnerabilities. Hosts continue to be compromised as a result of the 
       vulnerabilities associated with these services. On some operating systems, 
       these services are installed and enabled by default.

       Microsoft has identified a vulnerability in Microsoft Data Access Components 
       (MDAC) that could allow a web site visitor to take unauthorized actions on a
       web site hosted using Internet Information Server.  The vulnerability can be
       eliminated by reconfiguring or removing the affected components of MDAC.
       
       This vulnerability originally was reported in ms98-004.asp Microsoft Security
       Bulletin MS98-004 issued July 17, 1998.  It was re-released on July 19, 1999,
       to remind customers of the need to address the vulnerability.  It was updated
       on July 23, 1999, to discuss the need to remove sample files that are affected
       by the vulnerability, and to clarify that MDAC 2.0 is affected even if deployed
       as a clean installation.
       
       Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at 
       ms99-025faq.asp http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-025faq.asp.
       
       The FAQ contains instructions for eliminating the vulnerability.  
       
       
       The RDS DataFactory object, a component of Microsoft Data Access Components
       (MDAC), exposes unsafe methods. When installed on a system running Internet
       Information Server 3.0 or 4.0, the DataFactory object may permit an otherwise
       unauthorized web user to perform privileged actions, including:
       
        - Allowing unauthorized users to execute shell commands on the IIS system as
          a privileged user.
        - On a multi-homed Internet-connected IIS system, using MDAC to tunnel SQL 
          and other ODBC data requests through the public connection to a private 
          back-end network.
        - Allowing unauthorized accessing to secured, non-published files on the 
          IIS system.
       
       
       Affected Software Versions
       
       The vulnerability affects the Microsoft Data Access Components, when installed
       on a web server running Internet Information Server 3.0 or 4.0.  Specifically:
       
       - MDAC 1.5 and 2.0 are affected
       - MDAC 2.1 is affected if installed as an upgrade from a previous version of 
         MDAC, rather than a clean installation
       - Any version of MDAC is affected if Sample Pages for RDS are installed.
            
       NOTE: Sample Pages for RDS are provided as part of the Windows 4.0 Option Pack 
       and the MDAC 2.0 Software Development Kit.  They are not installed by default 
       in the Option Pack, but are installed by default in the MDAC 2.0 SDK.
       
       NOTE: MDAC 1.5 and IIS are installed by default installations of the Windows 
             NT 4.0 Option Pack.
       
       NOTE: IIS can be installed as part of other Microsoft products, such as 
             Microsoft BackOffice and Microsoft Site Server.  MDAC can be installed
             as part of other Microsoft products, such as Visual C and Microsoft Office.
             
       Patch Availability
       
       This vulnerability requires a configuration change to eliminate it, rather than
       a patch.  Details of the specific changes needed are available at 
       /security/bulletins/ms99-025faq.asp

      NEW YORK (November 1, 1999 9:27 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
      Hackers gained access to the The Associated Press' corporate Web site and 
      displayed a Halloween greeting with a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. 

      The page placed on the AP site Sunday carried the name of the 
      "United Loan Gunmen." That name has appeared on break-ins at six other sites 
      since August, including those of the Drudge Report, C-Span and ABC. The group
      also claimed responsibility for hacking a site for Nasdaq and the American 
      Stock Exchange.

                 In the greenest of our valleys
                   By good angels tenanted,
                 Once a fair and stately palace-
                Radiant palace- reared its head.
               In the monarch Thought's dominion-
                       It stood there!
                  Never seraph spread a pinion
                  Over fabric half so fair! 

                Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
                 On its roof did float and flow,
                (This- all this- was in the olden
                       Time long ago,)
               And every gentle air that dallied,
                     In that sweet day,
              Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
                   A winged odor went away. 

                 Wanderers in that happy valley,
                Through two luminous windows, saw
                   Spirits moving musically,
                  To a lute's well-tuned law,
               Round about a throne where, sitting
                       (Porphyrogene!)
               In state his glory well-befitting,
                The ruler of the realm was seen. 

               And all with pearl and ruby glowing
                   Was the fair palace door,
           Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
                    And sparkling evermore,
               A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
                      Was but to sing,
                 In voices of surpassing beauty,
               The wit and wisdom of their king. 

               But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
               Assailed the monarch's high estate.
               (Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow
                 Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
               And round about his home the glory
                   That blushed and bloomed,
                 Is but a dim-remembered story
                  Of the old time entombed. 

             And travellers, now, within that valley,
               Through the red-litten windows see
               Vast forms, that move fantastically
                    To a discordant melody,
               While, like a ghastly rapid river,
                    Through the pale door
                A hideous throng rush out forever
                 And laugh- but smile no more.

      Jane's Intelligence Review will be hosting a conference

      Terrorist organizations, both domestic and international,
      are looking toward technology to further their goals of
      disrupting your life or even harming you and the people you
      are trying to protect. Terrorists for the first time have the
      ability to affect your life remotely. By using computers 
      and the internet, they can strike from the other side of the
      world, with relative anonymity and free from danger.
      CyberTerrorism requires simple, inexpensive hardware, free
      software and information available over the Internet. 
        
      Awareness to a new state of terrorism is crucial whether
      you are trying to protect your own computer, your
      company's systems or the infrastructure of your city or
      country. It is less the types of hacking incidents and mass
      distribution of viruses that receive media attention that is
      important. The real threat is an insidious form of hard-core
      hacking where the physical and virtual worlds collide. 
        
      Whether you are in the military, government or private
      sector, your vulnerability to terrorist attack is only
      increasing as the world becomes more dependent on
      computer systems­especially in critical infrastructure and
      life affecting industries that are being linked with each other
      across the globe. Now you are not just in alliance with
      other people and nations, but also their communication
      equipment, computers and other technologies. Systems
      that control your finances, power, water, and
      communications as well as those in food and
      pharmaceutical plants, are vulnerable. 
        
      Jane's CyberTerrorism: The Risks and Realities goes
      beyond the threats and issues and focuses on practical
      solutions to real threats to your security:   

      -    You will be guided through ways to develop and
           implement a counter-CyberTerrorism program. 
      -    You will leave the conference with a clear sense of
           direction and a list of feasible steps assess your
           risk and build a program of prevention, detection and
           response. 
      -    You will get plenty of time for questions as well as
           interaction with speaker and colleagues. 
      -    You can put the information you have learned to
           work during a mock CyberTerrorism attack
           wargame.

06.0  Trust Site Solution Released

      As the Federal Trade Commission continues with its
      efforts to decrease webjacking, Inspective Systems is
      set to come out with Trust Site Solution, which is being
      claimed as the first content-certification program. The
      software aims to protect the users and consumers
      against people who use simple HTML tricks to redirect
      traffic from legitimate web sites to fake ones. This can
      lead unsuspecting consumers into giving up their credit
      card numbers and other personal information.

      IT gets tools to thwart Webjackers 

      By Ed Scannell 
      InfoWorld Electric 
    
      Posted at 4:43 PM PT, Oct 29, 1999 
      As millions of IT organizations hurry to get their businesses on-line 
      to cash in on the electronic-commerce gold rush, it is getting more 
      complicated to build trust among users by guaranteeing that Web site
      information is accurate and securely protected. 
    
      The latest challenge to that guarantee is "Webjacking," the nasty business 
      of hackers hijacking legitimate Web pages and redirecting users to 
      anywhere from pornography sites to sites set up for fraudulent business 
      schemes. 

      Some industry observers believe that, if the practice continues to 
      escalate unchecked, it could eventually erode users' buying confidence and 
      negatively affect corporations' e-commerce revenues. 

      But while the bad guys appear to have a technical head start, good guys 
      responsible for coming up with preventative security cures are starting to 
      appear. Inspective Systems, formerly known as Factpoint, a small software 
      company in Burlington, Mass.,       will release by the end of the year 
      its Trustsite Solution, which officials claim is the first 
      content-certification program for Web sites. 

      The solution basically sets up a separate certification server for each 
      Web site and creates a digital fingerprint for each certified page and 
      each piece of content. Another component of the package sets up a 
      validation server that constantly monitors a       site's certified 
      content as each page is loaded. 

      Some observers believe that Inspective's product could play a significant 
      role in softening the anxieties of both corporate users and consumers. 

      "What is interesting about what Factpoint [does, is that it provides] a 
      way to ensure authentication. You can install software on your machine 
      that verifies that what you have is what you think you have,'' said Carol 
      Baroudi, senior strategist for electronic       business at the Hurwitz 
      Group, in Framingham, Mass. 

      "Many people using the Web have no understanding that just because you see 
      it, doesn't mean it is true. [Webjacking] is becoming more and more 
      pervasive as people begin to understand how to manipulate the Web. These 
      incidences will rise       considerably on both corporate and consumer 
      levels," Baroudi said. 

      Still, the practice has become enough of a threat that Federal Trade 
      Commission officials late last month announced that the commission would 
      crack down on Webjackers, saying that it is now looking into its one 
      hundredth related Internet case. 

      Although most analysts believe that tens of millions of dollars have 
      already been hijacked from legitimate sites, none of them are willing to 
      offer estimated figures on the losses. The problem is that few companies 
      are willing to admit they have been       victimized in a fraudulent 
      scheme, either out of embarrassment or in fear of drawing the attention of 
      more hackers. 

      "There is no way you announce to the world that someone has hacked your 
      site. It's like sending out an invitation to 'Hacker Central' to take 
      another whack at you," said one IT executive at a large East Coast 
      publisher. 

      Unfortunately, redirecting traffic from a legitimate Web site is easy to 
      do. In many cases, it involves copying a Web site's opening page. Then, 
      with just a few lines of code, hackers can get all of a site's HTML links 
      to point to an illegitimate site. In other       cases, it is a matter of 
      adding just a few meta tags to a popular search engine used to find Web 
      sites. 

      "Essentially, [hackers] are inserting themselves in the middle. They will 
      gladly pose as legitimate. Eventually, they are hoping you will add things 
      to their site's shopping cart," commented Charles Palmer, manager of 
      network security and cryptography at       IBM's T.J. Watson Research 
      Center, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 

      One result of this could be that hackers can steal credit card numbers 
      from unsuspecting consumers and corporations' buying agents. 

      An even simpler approach for perpetrators is that for less than $100, they 
      can register the name of popular domains. By just changing an "o'' in a 
      Web site name to a zero, they can set up a fraudulent site. Earlier this 
      year, a would-be hacker registered       the domain "Micr0soft,'' but it 
      was discovered before any damage was done. 

      However, there have been a handful of highly publicized cases. Earlier 
      this year, hackers posted a false financial news story about PairGain, a 
      California-based communications company, making it look as if the story 
      appeared on the Bloomberg financial       news service Web site. 

      The bogus story, which said that PairGain was being bought by a well-known 
      telecommunications company, sent PairGain's stock rocketing and then 
      free-falling.

      The Providence Journal takes a stab at trying to define

      Unfortunately they fail miserably. At this point people

      There are enough other words available that can be
      used instead of confusing people with words which
      mean different things to different people.

      Just because someone is a hacker doesn't mean he, or she, is a bad
      person. 
      
      In fact, some people wear the term with pride. They put it on their
      business cards. 
      
      But a cracker is something else entirely. A cracker is a hacker gone bad.
      
      
      A hacker is a computer ace who uses the computer to make the world a
      better place. A cracker is a computer ace who uses the computer for
      evil. 
      
      (And just to make this perfectly clear, when speaking of a ``cracker'' we
      are not referring to a man of the South with a Jesse Helms bumper
      sticker on his pickup and a slow, easy way of making a point.) 
      
      There was a time, maybe a couple of months ago, when ``hacker'' was
      clearly a bad thing to call somebody. A hacker was cheap, devious,
      mediocre. 
      
      But, by some proclamation within the Computer Nation, the hacker is
      now good, not bad. 
      
      It's in all the fan magazines, the ones that have things on their covers like
      the ``all-new iMac with speeds of up to 400MHz.'' 
      
      The conversion of the hacker is reminiscent of that undergone by Randy
      ``Macho Man'' Savage, a villain who became a hero in the World
      Wrestling Federation. That was in all the fan magazines, too. 
      
      Put another way, a hacker is a guy who gets to a firewall and stops. A
      cracker is a guy who gets to a firewall and figures out a way to go
      through it. 
      
      A firewall? You thought it was something to keep a fire from spreading
      through a building? Not anymore. It's something to keep a cracker from
      spreading through a Web site. 
      
      What brought all these tortuous twists in terminology to light is a recent
      case in East Greenwich in which the police reported that they had
      tracked down a 15-year-old high-school student suspected of using a
      home computer to go on the Internet and portray a local teacher as a
      molester of children and animals. 
      
      The student allegedly entered an open, unsecured Web site that teachers
      use to post homework assignments and class notes and refer students to
      other helpful Web sites. And, in a technological way, the student painted
      the teacher ugly. 
      
      The police found the young techno-trespasser easily. They traced him
      through an America Online account right to his front door. 
      
      And that means this kid has zero status among hackers, and probably
      crackers, as well. He just didn't have to do enough to get where he
      wanted to go. And the police didn't have to do enough to catch him. 
      
      In the mad, twitchy passions that fuel Internet addictions, there are clearly
      some showboats. They can go places others can't. And, as surely as
      soaring kings of playground basketball, they need to make it clear that
      there is a big difference between their moves and those of a plodding,
      earthbound kid. 
      
      Those who have put in hundreds of long, lonely hours with a computer
      mouse and a bug-eyed lock on the computer screen might end up a little
      pale and prone to a nervous blink. But they still want to strut their stuff. 
      
      As soon as the story of the East Greenwich Internet abuser became
      public, hackers responded. They didn't want anyone confusing a four- or
      five-click after-school romp on the Internet with the simply amazing
      things they can do with a computer. They clearly resented any implication
      that the kid was even playing the same game. 
      
      ``A simple prank which required very little sophistication to carry out'' is
      what one proud hacker disdainfully called the East Greenwich caper. 
      
      The same hacker also provided the information that anyone with a
      butt-kicking hard drive probably already knew: the hacker is good; the
      cracker is bad. 
      
      It's so difficult to keep pace. You grow up remembering the nasty little
      brute from down the block who beat your arms black and blue during
      pickup basketball games. And you thought of him as one thing, and one
      thing only: a hacker. 
      
      Now, who's to know? The Internet has changed everything. The hacker
      is different from what he used to be. Maybe the hack is, too.

08.0  New Virus Discovered in London 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by nvirB 
      The London Sunday Times is reporting that a new virus
      is spreading throughout London firms and beyond that
      advances a system clock several months. This causes
      time sensitive passwords to expire forcing users to
      reenter them. Somehow the origin of the virus has been
      traced to Bulgaria, Romania and Scandinavia. While this
      is a long article there really isn't much technical
      information supplied the Times seems to just be
      spreading Fear and not valuable information. (If anyone
      has more accurate and verifiable information on this we

      E-virus turns clocks to 2000 
                    Mark Macaskill
     
     
      BRITISH companies are being attacked by mystery hackers
      with a virus that dupes computers into thinking that the
      millennium has already arrived. 
     
      The bug, which forwards internal computer clocks to
      January 1, 2000, is capable of crippling systems for up to
      three days, during which time valuable data can be stolen or
      wiped out. 
     
      Security software experts have been called in to combat the
      threat posed by the virus. They believe it is capable of
      overpowering almost all computers, including Y2K-
      compliant systems which have been deemed ready for the
      rollover to the new millennium. 
     
      D K Matai, managing director of mi2g, a security software
      company which advises many of London's financial
      institutions, said: "Hackers are causing chaos with this code
      because it can immediately shut down computer systems.
      There are not just financial risks to be considered; serious
      safety issues are also involved." 
     
      The virus, known as a clock-forwarding code, has been
      unleashed on companies in America and Europe. Experts
      have traced its origin to Bulgaria, Romania and Scandinavia
      but have been unable to identify the hackers. 
     
      The virus is typically disguised as an e-mail or file and can lie
      undetected in computer systems indefinitely, enabling an
      individual hacker to attack hundreds of companies
      simultaneously, a practice known as "flooding". 
     
      On activation, internal clocks can be forwarded months,
      fooling computers into thinking that software programmes
      and passwords, which in reality are valid, have expired. 
     
      Last month it was detected in Britain for the first time after a
      company reported that it was unable to access 40% of its
      system. It took three hours to resume operations, by which
      time thousands of pounds' worth of damage had been
      caused. 
     
      During a recent conference on electronic security held by
      mi2g, it was revealed that Y2K-compliant systems were also
      under threat. Tests carried out earlier this year on an oil rig
      and car plant, both classified as millennium-compliant, in
      which clocks were forwarded to the millennium date, caused
      up to 40% of computers to fail. 
     
      Small to medium-sized companies, which do not have
      security software to protect their central clocks, are thought
      to be particularly vulnerable.

10.0  RealNetworks Changes Privacy Policy Amid Controversy

      It has been learned that RealNetworks' RealJukebox
      software monitors users and sends the data it collects
      back to the company. The data collected includes user
      listener habits, what file types the user plays, and a
      globally unique identifier (GUID), among other things.
      RealNetworks never informed anybody of these facts,
      but claims that this is not an invasion of privacy.

      Is RealNetworks software keeping tabs on user habits? 
      By Reuters
      Special to CNET News.com
      November 1, 1999, 3:55 a.m. PT 
 
      NEW YORK--RealNetworks' RealJukebox software monitors users' listening 
      habits and some other activities and reports the information and the 
      user's identity to the company, according to reports.
 
      A security expert intercepted and examined information generated from
      the program, and company executives acknowledged that RealJukebox 
      gathers information on what users are playing and recording, the New 
      York Times said.
 
      RealJukebox is used to play compact discs on computers and can copy 
      music to a user's hard drive and download music from the Internet. 
 
      Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer products, 
      told the Times the company gathered the information to customize 
      service for individual users. 
 
      He and other company executives said the practice did not violate 
      consumer privacy because the data was not stored by the company or
      released to other companies, the Times said. 
 
      But privacy advocates and security experts agreed that it was a 
      violation of the privacy of the 13.5 million registered users of
      RealJukebox, the Times said, particularly because RealNetworks has
      not informed consumers they are being identified and monitored. 
 
      Richard Smith, a Brookline, Massachusetts-based independent security
      consultant, said the numbers of songs stored on a user's hard drive,
      the kind of file formats in which the songs are stored, the
      user's preferred genre of music, and the type of portable music player,
      if any, the user has connected to the computer are sent to the company,
      the Times said.  In addition, a personal serial number known as a 
      globally unique identifier, or GUID, is also sent to RealNetworks, 
      the paper said. 
 
      The fact that RealNetworks gathers the information is not mentioned 
      in the privacy policy posted on its Web site, the Times said, or in 
      the licensing agreement users must approve when installing RealJukebox.

      RealNetworks changes privacy policy under scrutiny 
      By Courtney Macavinta
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      November 1, 1999, 10:40 a.m. PT 
 
      update RealNetworks quietly changed its privacy policy this weekend 
      to disclose a controversial practice of tracking Net music listeners 
      through unique identification numbers assigned to its software.

      The practice was reportedly discovered by Richard Smith, a 
      Massachusetts-based independent security consultant, who had examined 
      information generated from RealNetworks' RealJukebox software. The story 
      was first reported       in this morning's editions of the New York Times.

      The company confirmed today that an identifier existed that could be used 
      to keep tabs on what users are playing and recording. Although many Web 
      sites track users' habits, RealNetworks had not previously disclosed its       
      practices in its privacy policy, which is certified by the Web privacy 
      seal program Truste.

      Without explanation this weekend, RealNetworks added a section to its 
      privacy policy stating that users are assigned a "Globally Unique 
      Identifier" (GUID) when they download its RealJukebox software to copy or 
      play digital music                              via their computers. 
      RealNetworks confirmed that the policy was changed and that it would 
      release details about it later today.

      "I don't know when that change took place, but we'll get a response out
      by noon," RealNetworks  chief operating officer Thomas Frank said today. 
      "Any of the information we've been collecting has been designed to make 
      the best experience for the user."

      While writing a letter to Truste calling for an investigation of 
      RealNetworks' privacy practices, Jason Catlett, founder of Junkbusters,
      a clearinghouse for privacy-protection measures, discovered that 
      the policy had been changed. 

      "When I was writing that letter on Sunday night, I found that suddenly
      the GUID was described in their policy, and that wasn't there on Friday,
      because I have a copy of the policy that was there on Friday," Catlett 
      said in an interview.

      The revised privacy policy makes clear how the GUID is used. "We may 
      use GUIDs to understand the interests and needs of our users so that we
      can offer valuable personalized services such as  customized RealPlayer
      channels," the new policy states. "GUIDs also allow us to monitor the 
      growth of the number of users of our products and to predict and plan 
      for future capacity needs for customer support, update servers, and 
      other important customer services."

      Privacy advocates warn that user IDs can be used to build profiles on Net 
      users, combining surfing habits with personal information such as the home 
      addresses and credit card numbers gathered by RealNetworks in its 
      licensing       agreement with RealJukebox users.

      The profiles could be used for marketing, but if they are stored by a 
      company they also could be subpoenaed by law enforcement officials during 
      an investigation.

      Although the policy discloses the practice, Catlett says that the practice 
      is still invasive and that Truste should reprimand the company. "It's 
      shameful and unacceptable that they are tracking people like packages 
      without telling       them," he said. "I have asked Truste to determine 
      whether this is a breach."

      Truste, which licenses out its privacy seals and monitors whether 
      companies are in compliance with their data-collection policies, said 
      today that it will investigate RealNetworks' practices.

      "Anytime the privacy statement changes, it's of critical concern for us 
      because we certify that the practices are in line with the policy," said 
      Dave Steer, Truste's communications manager.

      "We will look at whether they knew what they were doing, why they were 
      doing it, and [whether] they intentionally left it out of their statement 
      until there was public outcry," he added. "We are really concerned about 
      what is going       on, and we're going to look at whether RealNetworks is 
      breaching its contract with Truste."

      Another test for self-regulation       How Truste handles the RealNetworks 
      complaint will be closely watched by privacy advocates, who have long 
      contended that industry guidelines are no substitute for stricter 
      consumer-protection laws.

      Voluntary programs such as Truste have been lauded by the White House and 
      the Net industry as a key solution for protecting consumers' online 
      privacy, but consumer groups argue that they lack enforcement. If a site 
      fails to       comply with its Truste-certified privacy policy, it could 
      have its privacy seal revoked, or in the worst case a complaint could be 
      filed with the Federal Trade Commission.

      But as the RealNetworks privacy policy switch also shows, sometimes the 
      policies themselves are not true reflections of a company's online 
      data-collection practices, or they may not be detailed enough. This is not 
      uncommon,       according to a study released in May by Mary Culnan of 
      Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.

      Culnan's Georgetown Internet Privacy Policy Survey examined 364 ".com" 
      sites that were randomly selected from the 7,500 most-visited Web sites. 
      Although 65.7 percent of the sites have privacy policies or give notice 
      that       personal information has been securely transmitted, only 9.5 
      percent of the sites had an "adequate" privacy policy, the study found.

11.0  JTF-CND Runs CyberWar Simulation

      U.S. Scurries to Erect Cyber-Defenses 
      Security: As threat rises, government task force prepares for Internet combat. 
   
      By BOB DROGIN, Times Staff Writer
   
   
      FT. MEADE, Md.--Distant forests dominate the view from the 
      eighth-floor director's suite at the National Security Agency, 
      America's largest intelligence gathering operation. But the talk 
      inside is of a more troubling horizon: cyberspace. "Think of it as a 
      physical domain, like land, sea and air," said Air Force Lt. Gen. 
      Michael V. Hayden in his first interview since taking the NSA's helm 
      in May. "Now think of America conducting operations in that new 
      domain." These days, many in the U.S. intelligence, law enforcement 
      and national security community are thinking of little else. The 
      Pentagon has stepped up cyber-defense and is planning cyber-combat. 
      The FBI is still struggling to unravel Moonlight Maze, a massive 
      assault on U.S. government computers that has been traced to Russia. 
      Prodded by the White House, other agencies are also scrambling to 
      protect America's electronic infrastructure from a daily digital 
      barrage from around the world. The stakes could not be higher. Put 
      simply, how can an increasingly wired America best defend itself from 
      hostile nations, foreign spies, terrorists or anyone else armed with 
      a computer, an e-mail virus and the Internet? And how can America 
      fight back in the strange new world of warp-speed warfare? The 
      answers so far are not encouraging. "The pace of technological change 
      is rapidly outstripping our existing technical edge in intelligence 
      that has long been one of the pillars of our national security," said 
      CIA Director George J. Tenet. The United States faces "a growing 
      cyber-threat" from "weapons of mass disruption," Tenet said. 
      "Potential targets are not only government computers but the 
      lifelines that we all take for granted: our power grids and our water 
      and transportation systems." That threat is why 50 experts from the 
      NSA, CIA, FBI, Defense Department and other agencies gathered in 
      early October in a drab office building in Falls Church, Va., for a 
      classified war game that was code named Zenith Star. For two days, 
      they huddled behind closed doors to test America's response to a 
      simulated surprise attack by electronic evildoers--the first such 
      effort since a 1997 exercise found the U.S. government almost 
      defenseless in cyber-war. This time, enemy hackers supposedly had 
      triggered blackouts around major military facilities near Chicago, 
      Honolulu and Tampa, Fla. They paralyzed 911 emergency response 
      systems with a flood of computer-generated calls. Then they started 
      disrupting crucial Pentagon computer networks. The mock scenario was 
      "based on actual vulnerabilities," explained Air Force Maj. Gen. John 
      H. Campbell, who ran Zenith Star as head of the Pentagon's new Joint 
      Task Force-Computer Network Defense in Arlington, Va. Although 
      results are not in, Campbell said, he believes coordination and 
      cooperation have improved since Eligible Receiver, the classified 
      1997 war game that found America unprepared for cyber-attack. In that 
      exercise, a team of NSA hackers proved that they could easily disable 
      power, telephones and oil pipelines across the country, as well as 
      Pentagon war-fighting capabilities. The joint task force was one 
      result. Operational since June, it aims to organize defense of the 
      Pentagon's 2.1 million computers, 10,000 local networks and more than 
      100 long-distance networks. The unit formally became part of the 
      Pentagon's combat mission on Oct. 1, when it was attached to U.S. 
      Space Command, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. A separate task force 
      will be established next October to safeguard against computer 
      network attack, Campbell said. Now the computer defense force runs a 
      24-hour operations room that looks like the set of a Hollywood 
      thriller. Inside the Secure Compartmented Information Facility, a 
      dozen experts tend banks of classified and unclassified computers. 
      Red digital clocks on the ceiling show time zones around the world. 
      Three huge screens on one wall monitor major military computer nodes 
      in the United States, Europe and the Pacific. Three other large 
      screens are tuned to TV networks. Campbell, a veteran fighter pilot, 
      sees cyberspace as the wild new yonder. Donning his worn leather 
      flight jacket for an interview in a drafty task force office, he 
      warned that terrorists rely increasingly on computers for planning 
      and communication. "We see more and more terrorist organizations . . 
      . are recruiting computer-smart people and even providing the 
      training for them," Campbell said. Most attacks on U.S. government 
      computers have involved politically motivated vandalism, not 
      terrorism. During the Kosovo conflict last spring, for example, the 
      White House and numerous other government departments and agencies 
      were forced to take down Web sites after hackers defaced them with 
      electronic graffiti. But the hackers are more malicious and more 
      powerful than ever. Despite the increased protection, two unknown 
      groups used multiple simultaneous attacks last week to penetrate and 
      deface 13 government and military sites, including the U.S. Army 
      Reserve Command, the White Sands Missile Range, the National 
      Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the 
      National Defense University and the Naval Coastal Systems Center. To 
      be sure, U.S. officials insisted that no one has stolen military or 
      other national security secrets by penetrating a classified computer 
      system from outside. But it clearly is not for want of trying. 
      Consider the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Center in 
      San Diego, which helps safeguard naval intelligence codes. Its 
      unclassified computer systems, a senior official said, are "under 
      constant attack, more than one a day from outside the country." 
      Spawar, as it is commonly called, has traced hackers this year alone 
      to Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, China, France, Italy, 
      Israel, Japan and Russia. Most use programs to electronically "sweep" 
      the Spawar systems, looking for unguarded access points. "For every 
      protection we put up, they find a way around it," he said. "Many get 
      in, rummage around, package files and send them off. A few gain root 
      access," or complete access to the compromised system. "It's steadily 
      increasing, steadily getting worse." In February, someone even used 
      the Internet to secretly program a new password for a Hewlett-Packard 
      printer at Spawar so that copies would print out in Russia. The 
      intrusion was detected before sensitive files were lost, the official 
      said. In that case, as in most, officials never determined whether a 
      curious teenager, a foreign intelligence agency or someone else was 
      responsible for the intrusion. "Often you don't know what you're 
      dealing with until you're pretty far along in an investigation," said 
      Michael A. Vatis, America's top cyber-cop. "You don't know if you 
      have a single intrusion or a concerted attack." Vatis heads the FBI's 
      National Infrastructure Protection Center, the focal point of the 
      federal government's effort to prevent, detect and prosecute 
      cyber-crimes. The center has 800 pending hacker, virus and intrusion 
      cases, up from 200 two years ago. Most involve disgruntled employees 
      who sabotage computer systems for revenge or crooks who use the 
      Internet for scams and fraud. But Vatis said that he worries most 
      about what he calls "America's Achilles' heel," the growing reliance 
      on computer-controlled systems built for efficiency, not security. 
      "We know other countries are building information warfare 
      technology," he said at the headquarters of the infrastructure 
      protection center, a warren of computer cubicles on the 11th floor of 
      the FBI building in Washington. "We know countries are engaged in 
      espionage and economic espionage." The FBI, for example, has tried to 
      determine if cyber-spies at Moscow's prestigious Russian Academy of 
      Sciences are responsible for Moonlight Maze, the most pervasive 
      assault yet on sensitive U.S. Defense Department and other computer 
      networks. The first Moonlight Maze attack was detected in March 1998. 
      Three months later, U.S. security sleuths were able to monitor a 
      series of intrusions as they occurred and traced them back to seven 
      dial-up Internet connections near Moscow. But the intense attacks 
      continued until at least last May, and the FBI investigation remains 
      open. One reason: U.S. officials are unable to determine if the trail 
      really stops in Moscow or simply appears to. Either way, the 
      Moonlight Maze attack was enormous. U.S. officials said that the 
      intruders systematically ransacked hundreds of essential but 
      unclassified computer networks used by the Pentagon, the Energy 
      Department, NASA, defense contractors and several universities. Vast 
      amounts of technical defense research were illegally downloaded and 
      transferred to Russia. Investigators found that the hackers used 
      workstations running Sun operating systems and routed high-speed 
      calls through U.S. university network servers to hide their tracks. 
      They usually logged into government computer systems with stolen 
      passwords. Attacking from within, they gained root access to numerous 
      systems. The intruders also sometimes created illegal "back doors" to 
      secretly reenter the compromised systems, the evidence showed. They 
      also installed "sniffers," which let them monitor sensitive 
      communication along U.S. government networks, thus sending Russia 
      e-mail as well as other sensitive information stored in compressed 
      data files. One private-sector target was Meganet Corp., which is 
      based in Tarzana and sells 21 versions of commercial encryption 
      software that it bills as "unbreakable." U.S. export controls 
      prohibit sale of the software overseas, the company says. In two 
      overnight attacks in July 1998, Meganet's Web servers were swamped 
      with "tens of thousands" of hits from "Lab 1313," an unknown group 
      that used an Internet connection from the Russian Academy of 
      Sciences, according to Michael Vaknin, the company's general manager. 
      He said that the attackers sought source code for the encryption 
      software but failed because it is kept on a separate system. Not long 
      ago, few Americans outside the secretive National Security Agency 
      were concerned with the esoteric field of encryption or the theft of 
      digital data. The high-tech NSA, which does the government's code 
      making and code breaking, is responsible for the covert collection of 
      signals intelligence, or "Sigint," from around the world. The 
      explosion of new computer and communications technology has given the 
      intelligence agency powerful new tools--but it has also made the 
      agency's job much more difficult. Hayden, the NSA director, conceded, 
      "It was easier to be top dog before."

      Y2K State Surveys Security Hole
      By Mike of NetworkCommand
 
      Overview:
      =========
      Y2K information subject to exaggeration or gross understatement. 
 
      Issue:
      ======
      Because no one is really sure what to expect, be sure to expect the unexpected.
 
      Platform Effected:
      ==================
      Earth.
 
      Summary:
      ========
      Currently, a State Government web site is providing Y2K Preparedness 
      information to the general public. You, as a citizen, may go and review
      this information. You can view the status of Public Utilities (gas, water,
      power), Health Care Providers, the 911 system, Telecommunications, etc. You
      can read what you might expect:
 
      -We're almost done. 
      -We do not impact essential functions.
 
      You can read what you might not expect:
      2) Do you have, manufacture, or distribute any equipment controlled by 
         computers? NO 
      3) If you answered "yes" to the above question, can failure of computer
         controlled equipment cause untreated sewage to be released to the 
         environment or an interruption of service? YES 
 
      So, does this company have any computers? Or, could the failure of those 
      computers they don't have cause the the untreated sewage to be released?
 
      Even more, this one from a Natural Gas Company:
      3) What is the date that the Y2K project started? (mm/dd/yyyy) 11/1998
      Contingency Plan Development Start Date (mm/dd/yyyy) 12/1997
 
      Aren't those backwards? Don't you have to start the project before you 
      make a Contingency Plan? Are you guessing?
 
      Anyway, as you can see I'm not sure these people can be trusted with
      paperwork. 
 
      Now here's the kicker.
 
      These Preparedness statements are available online. If you're a company, 
      you can fill one out. If you're a citizen, you can review them. 
 
      However, due to an error in the web sites code, if you can find an org_id,
      you can submit a Preparedness statement. An org_id looks like this: 
      view.cgi?org_id=14633927754506433&round=2 And guess what they are using 
      for authenication? You got it, the org_id. Someone who wanted to modify
      these statements could get the org_id and click the button called "Submit 
      Preparedness Statement." They could then change an existing statement or 
      send in a new one. 
 
      Please bear in mind, this is all in accordance with a state law.
 
      At this time multiple attempts have been made to contact the administrators
      of this web site and inform them of the problem. 
 
      Hopefully no one will modify these documents in the meantime. I doubt 
      they have any tape backups.
 
      The moral of this story? 
 
      If I have to spell it out, it wouldn't make sense to you anyway...

13.0  Clinton Privacy Plan: Is it Enough? 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Maggie 
      President Clinton has unveiled a privacy plan aimed at
      protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health
      information. The plan would require health plans to get
      consent before releasing electronic medical records,
      requires patient notification of use of records, and it
      would let patients view and correct their records. The
      rules are slated to go into effect on Feb. 21, 2000, after
      public comment on the issue. (This is at least a first
      step. There is so much further to go.)

      Clinton privacy plan: only a first step
      By Lisa M. Bowman, ZDNN
      October 29, 1999 4:18 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      In an attempt to prevent strangers from snooping at your online medical records, President Clinton
      Friday unveiled a plan that would place restrictions on how electronic medical information is used.
      
      The plan would require health plans to get consent before releasing electronic medical records in
      most cases, and requires them to notify patients about how their records are used. It also would
      let patients view and correct their records. The rules are slated to go into effect on Feb. 21, 2000,
      after public comment on the issue.
      
      During his speech introducing the plan, Clinton acknowledged that electronic medical records can
      help save lives and lower costs. But he said that shouldn't be at the expense of privacy.
      
      Horror stories
      "Every American has a right to know that his or her medical records are protected at all times
      from falling into the wrong hands," Clinton said in a prepared statement from the Oval Office. "As
      they have been stored electronically, the threats to our privacy have substantially increased."
      
      As more and more records have been transferred into electronic form, horror stories about the
      release of medical records have alarmed consumers and privacy advocates. During his speech,
      Clinton cited a survey showing that one-third of all Fortune 500 companies check medical records
      before they hire or promote people.
      
      "This is wrong," he said. "Americans should never have to worry that their employers are looking
      at the medications they take or the ailments they've had."
      
      Hacker attack
      In September, hackers circulated a phone number that allowed anyone to access a database of
      private medical records stored at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan. The hospital
      had been using a digital system that let doctors dictate medical records.
      
      Congress does not need to pass the Clinton plan because it missed a self-imposed August
      deadline requiring it to address online privacy or cede decisions on the issue to the secretary of
      health and human services.
      
      Praise from privacy advocates
      Privacy advocates and medical community members lauded the proposed rules as a first step
      toward ensuring that online medical records won't fall into the hands of marketers, corporate Big
      Brother types or the merely nosy. But they said the rules are only the first in a series of measures
      needed to truly protect the records.
      
      "This is a wonderful start," said Dr. Michael Rozen, Director of Health Record Security for
      WellMed Inc. "With all of its limitations -- it only covers electronic records, it doesn't really
      protect consumers surfing sites -- the bottom line is this is more protection than we've ever seen,"
      he said. Rosen said his company, which makes software that lets people access health information,
      already is more strict with medical data than would be required under the Clinton plan.
      
      While the Clinton rules outline how health care sites and the medical community must deal with
      electronic records, they don't address scenarios when law enforcement is seeking access to them.
      They only apply to electronic, not paper, records. And they also don't restrict general health sites
      from sharing information about their visitors. For example, a health site containing information
      about AIDS or drug addiction can still freely release information about people who visit those
      sections.
      
      Nevertheless, Rozen said the Clinton plan should boost consumer confidence in medical sites
      because people can rest assured their medical records are safe. "It will do a great deal to provide
      consumers some protections for their medical records in electronic form," Rozen said.
      
      The new rules come as major players in the tech industry are jumping into the medical market.
      Two weeks ago Intel Corp. joined American Medical Association on a project that will let
      doctors and consumers exchange online medical records. That plan includes digital credentials for
      doctors exchanging information over the Internet.

      Eavesdropping On the Electromagnetic Emanations of Digital Equipment: 
      The Laws of Canada, England and the United States 
 
      Christopher J. Seline 
      
      
      This document is a rough draft. The Legal Sections are overviews. They 
      will be significantly expanded in the next version. 

           We in this country, in this generation, are -- by destiny rather than 
           choice -- the watchmen on the walls of freedom.[1] - President John 
           F. Kennedy 

      In the novel 1984, George Orwell foretold a future where individuals had 
      no expectation of privacy because the state monopolized the technology of 
      spying.  The government watched the actions of its subjects from birth to 
      death. No one could protect himself       because surveillance and 
      counter-surveillance technology was controlled by the government. This 
      note explores the legal status of a surveillance technology ruefully known 
      as TEMPEST. 

      Using TEMPEST technology the information in any digital device may be 
      intercepted and reconstructed into useful intelligence without the 
      operative ever having to come near his target. The technology is 
      especially useful in the interception of information stored in       
      digital computers or displayed on computer terminals. 

      The use of TEMPEST is not illegal under the laws of the United States, or 
      England. Canada has specific laws criminalizing TEMPEST eavesdropping but 
      the laws do more to hinder surveillance countermeasures than to prevent 
      TEMPEST surveillance. 

      In the United States it is illegal for an individual to take effective 
      countermeasures against TEMPEST surveillance. This leads to the conundrum 
      that it is legal for individuals and the government to invade the privacy 
      of others but illegal for individuals to take steps       to protect their 
      privacy. 

      I. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING 

      Spying is divided by professionals into two main types: human intelligence 
      gathering (HUMINT) and electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT).  As the 
      names imply, HUMINT relies on human operatives, and ELINT relies on 
      technological operatives. In the past       HUMINT was the sole method for 
      collecting intelligence. The HUMINT operative would steal important 
      papers, observe troop and weapon movements, lure people into his 
      confidences to extract secrets, and stand under the eavesdrip of houses, 
      eavesdropping on the occupants. 
      
      As technology has progressed, tasks that once could only be performed by 
      humans have been taken over by machines. So it has been with spying.  
      Modern satellite technology allows troop and weapons movements to be 
      observed with greater precision and from greater distances than a human 
      spy could ever hope to accomplish. 

      The theft of documents and eavesdropping on conversations may now be 
      performed electronically. This means greater safety for the human 
      operative, whose only involvement may be the placing of the initial ELINT 
      devices. This has led to the ascendancy of       ELINT over HUMINT because 
      the placement and monitoring of ELINT devices may be performed by a 
      technician who has no training in the art of spying. The gathered 
      intelligence may be processed by an intelligence expert, perhaps thousands 
      of miles away, with no need of field experience. ELINT has a number of 
      other advantages over HUMINT. 

      If a spy is caught his existence could embarrass his employing state and 
      he could be forced into giving up the identities of his compatriots or 
      other important information. By its very nature, a discovered ELINT device 
      (bug) cannot give up any information; and the       ubiquitous nature of 
      bugs provides the principle state with the ability to plausibly deny 
      ownership or involvement. 

      ELINT devices fall into two broad categories:  trespassatory and 
      non-trespassatory. Trespassatory bugs require some type of trespass in 
      order for them to function. A transmitter might require the physical 
      invasion of the target premises for placement, or a       microphone might 
      be surreptitiously attached to the outside of a window. 

      A telephone transmitter can be placed anywhere on the phone line, 
      including at the central switch. The trespass comes either when it is 
      physically attached to the phone line, or if it is inductive, when placed 
      in close proximity to the phone line. Even microwave       bugs require 
      the placement of the resonator cone within the target premises.  
      Non-trespassatory ELINT devices work by receiving electromagnetic 
      radiation (EMR) as it radiates through the ether, and do not require the 
      placement of bugs. Methods include intercepting information transmitted by 
      satellite, microwave, and radio, including mobile and cellular phone 
      transmissions. This information was purposely transmitted with the intent 
      that some intended person or persons would receive it. 

      Non-trespassatory ELINT also includes the interception of information that 
      was never intended to be transmitted. All electronic devices emit 
      electromagnetic radiation. Some of the radiation, as with radio waves, is 
      intended to transmit information. Much of this       radiation is not 
      intended to transmit information and is merely incidental to whatever work 
      the target device is performing.  This information can be intercepted and 
      reconstructed into a coherent form. With current TEMPEST technology it is 
      possible to reconstruct the contents of computer video display terminal 
      (VDU) screens from up to a kilometer distant; reconstructing the contents 
      of a computer's memory. 

      For a discussion of the TEMPEST ELINT threat See e.g., Memory Bank, 
      AMERICAN BANKER 20 (Apr 1 1985); Emissions from Bank Computer Systems Make 
      Eavesdropping Easy, Expert Says, AMERICAN BANKER 1 (Mar 26 1985); CRT 
      spying:       a threat to corporate security, PC WEEK (Mar 10 1987). 

      By selectively firing the gun as it scans across the face of the CRT, the 
      pixels form characters on the CRT screen. 

      ELINT is not limited to governments. It is routinely used by individuals 
      for their own purposes. Almost all forms of ELINT are available to the 
      individual with either the technological expertise or the money to hire 
      someone with the expertise. Governments have       attempted to 
      criminalize all use of ELINT by their subjects --to protect the privacy of 
      both the government and the population. 

      II. UNITED STATES LAW 

      In the United States, Title III of the Omnibus Streets and Crimes Act of 
      1968 criminalizes trespassatory ELINT as the intentional interception of 
      wire communications.   As originally passed, Title III did not prohibit 
      non-trespassatory ELINT, because courts       found that non-wire 
      communication lacked any expectation of privacy.  The Electronic 
      Communications Privacy Act of 1986 amended Title III to include non-wire 
      communication. 

      ECPA was specifically designed to include electronic mail, inter computer 
      communications, and cellular telephones. To accomplish this, the 
      expectation of privacy test was eliminated.  As amended, Title III still 
      outlaws the electronic interception of       communications.  The word 
      "communications" indicates that someone is attempting to communicate 
      something to someone; it does not refer to the inadvertent transmission of 
      information. The reception and reconstruction of emanated transient 
      electromagnetic pulses (ETEP), however, is based on obtaining information 
      that the target does not mean to transmit. If the ETEP is not intended as 
      communication, and is therefore not transmitted in a form approaching 
      current communications protocols, then it can not be
      considered communications as contemplated by Congress when it amended 
      Title III.  Reception, or interception, of emanated transient 
      electromagnetic pulses is not criminalized by Title III as amended. 

      III. ENGLISH LAW 

      In England the Interception of Communications Act 1985 criminalizes the 
      tapping of communications sent over public telecommunications lines. 

      The interception of communications on a telecommunication line can take 
      place with a physical tap on the line, or the passive interception of 
      microwave or satellite links.  These forms of passive interception differ 
      from TEMPEST ELINT because they are       intercepting intended 
      communication; TEMPEST ELINT intercepts unintended communication. 

      Eavesdropping on the emanations of computers does not in any way comport 
      to tapping a telecommunication line and therefore falls outside the scope 
      of the statute. 

      IV. CANADIAN LAW 

      Canada has taken direct steps to limit eavesdropping on computers.The 
      Canadian Criminal Amendment Act of 1985 criminalized indirect access to a 
      computer service.  The specific reference to an "electromagnetic device" 
      clearly shows the intent of the       legislature to include the use of 
      TEMPEST ELINT equipment within the ambit of the legislation. 

      The limitation of obtaining "any computer service" does lead to some 
      confusion. 

      The Canadian legislature has not made it clear whether "computer service" 
      refers to a computer service bureau or merely the services of a computer.  
      If the Canadians had meant access to any computer, why did they refer to 
      any "computer service". This is       especially confusing considering the 
      all-encompassing language of (b) 'any function of a computer system'.  
      Even if the Canadian legislation criminalizes eavesdropping on all 
      computers, it does not solve the problem of protecting the privacy of 
      information. The purpose of criminal law is to control crime. 

      Merely making TEMPEST ELINT illegal will not control its use. First, 
      because it is an inherently passive crime it is impossible to detect and 
      hence punish.  Second, making this form of eavesdropping illegal without 
      taking a proactive stance in controlling       compromising emanations 
      gives the public a false sense of security. Third, criminalizing the 
      possession of a TEMPEST ELINT device prevents public sector research into 
      countermeasures. Finally, the law will not prevent eavesdropping on 
      private information held in company computers unless disincentives are 
      given for companies that do not take sufficient precautions against 
      eavesdropping and simple, more common, information crimes. 

      V. SOLUTIONS 

      TEMPEST ELINT is passive. The computer or terminal emanates compromising 
      radiation which is intercepted by the TEMPEST device and reconstructed 
      into useful information. Unlike conventional ELINT there is no need to 
      physically trespass or even come       near the target.  Eavesdropping can 
      be performed from a nearby office or even a van parked within a reasonable 
      distance. 

      This means that there is no classic scene of the crime; and little or no 
      chance of the criminal being discovered in the act.  If the crime is 
      discovered it will be ancillary to some other investigation. For example, 
      if an individual is investigated for insider trading a       search of his 
      residence may yield a TEMPEST ELINT device. 

      The device would explain how the defendant was obtaining insider 
      information; but it was the insider trading, not the device, that gave 
      away the crime.  This is especially true for illegal TEMPEST ELINT 
      performed by the state. 

      Unless the perpetrators are caught in the act there is little evidence of 
      their spying. A trespassatory bug can be detected and located; further, 
      once found it provides tangible evidence that a crime took place. A 
      TEMPEST ELINT device by its inherent passive       nature leaves nothing 
      to detect. Since the government is less likely to commit an ancillary 
      crime which might be detected there is a very small chance that the spying 
      will ever be discovered. 

      The only way to prevent eavesdropping is to encourage the use of 
      countermeasures TEMPEST Certified computers and terminals.  In merely 
      making TEMPEST ELINT illegal the public is given the false impression of 
      security; they are lulled into believing the       problem has been 
      solved. 

      Making certain actions illegal does not prevent them from occurring. This 
      is especially true for a TEMPEST ELINT because it is undetectable. 
      
      Punishment is an empty threat if there is no chance of being detected; 
      without detection there can be no apprehension and conviction. 

      The only way to prevent some entity from eavesdropping on one's computer 
      or computer terminal is for the equipment not to give off compromising 
      emanation; it must be TEMPEST Certified. The United States can solve this 
      problem by taking a proactive       stance on compromising emanations. The 
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in charge of 
      setting forth standards of computer security for the private sector. 

      NIST is also charged with doing basic research to advance the art of 
      computer security. Currently NIST does not discuss TEMPEST with the 
      private sector.  For privacy's sake, this policy must be changed to a 
      proactive one.  The NIST should publicize the       TEMPEST ELINT threat 
      to computer security and should set up a rating system for level of 
      emanations produced by computer equipment.  Further, legislation should be 
      enacted to require the labeling of all computer equipment with its level 
      of emanations and whether it is TEMPEST Certified. Only if the public 
      knows of the problem can it begin to take steps to solve it. 

      Title III makes possession of a surveillance device a crime, unless it is 
      produced under contract to the government. This means that research into 
      surveillance and counter-surveillance equipment is monopolized by the 
      government and a few companies working       under contract with NACSIM 
      5100A is classified, as are all details of TEMPEST. To obtain access to 
      it, contractor must prove that there is demand within the government for 
      the specific type of equipment that intend to certify. Since the standard 
      is classified, the contractors can not sell the equipment to non-secure 
      governmental agencies or the public. This prevents reverse engineering of 
      the standard for its physical embodiment, the Certified equipment. By 
      preventing the private sector from owning this anti-eavesdropping 
      equipment, the NSA has effectively prevented the them from protecting the 
      information in their computers. 

      If TEMPEST eavesdropping is criminalized, then possession of TEMPEST ELINT 
      equipment will be criminal. Unfortunately,this does not solve the problem. 
      Simple TEMPEST ELINT equipment is easy to make. For just a few dollars 
      many older television sets       can be modified to receive and 
      reconstruct EMR. For less than a hundred dollars a more sophisticated 
      TEMPEST ELINT receiver can be produced.  The problem with criminalizing 
      the possession of TEMPEST ELINT equipment is not just that the law will 
      have little effect on the use of such equipment, but that it will have a 
      negative effect on countermeasures research. To successfully design 
      countermeasures to a particular surveillance technique it is vital to have 
      a complete empirical understanding of how that technique works. Without 
      the right to legally manufacture a surveillance device there is no 
      possible way for a researcher to have the knowledge to produce an 
      effective countermeasures device. It is axiomatic: without a surveillance 
      device, it is impossible to test a countermeasures device. 

      A number of companies produce devices to measure the emanations from 
      electrical equipment. Some of these devices are specifically designed for 
      bench marking TEMPEST Certified equipment. This does not solve the 
      problem.  The question arises: how much       radiation at a particular 
      frequency is compromising? The current answer is to refer to NACSIM 5100A. 

      This document specifies the emanations levels suitable for Certification.  
      The document is only available to United States contractors having 
      sufficient security clearance and an ongoing contract to produce TEMPEST 
      Certified computers for the government.       Further, the correct levels 
      are specified by the NSA and there is no assurance that, while these 
      levels are sufficient to prevent eavesdropping by unfriendly operatives, 
      equipment certified under NACSIM 5100A will have levels low enough to 
      prevent eavesdropping by the NSA itself. 

      The accessibility of supposedly correct emanations levels does not solve 
      the problem of preventing TEMPEST eavesdropping. Access to NACSIM 5100A 
      limits the manufacturer to selling the equipment only to United States 
      governmental agencies with the       need to process secret information.  
      Without the right to possess TEMPEST ELINT equipment manufacturers who 
      wish to sell to the public sector cannot determine what a safe level of 
      emanations is.  Further those manufacturers with access to NACSIM 5100A 
      should want to verify that the levels set out in the document are, in 
      fact, low enough to prevent interception. 

      Without an actual eavesdropping device with which to test, no manufacturer 
      will be able to produce genuinely uncompromising equipment. 

      Even if the laws allow ownership of TEMPEST Certified equipment by the 
      public, and even if the public is informed of TEMPEST's threat to privacy, 
      individuals' private information will not necessarily by protected. 
      Individuals may choose to protect their own
      information on their own computers. Companies may choose whether to 
      protect their own private information.  But companies that hold the 
      private information of individuals must be forced to take steps to protect 
      that information. 

      In England the Data Protection Act 1984 imposes sanctions against anyone 
      who stores the personal information on a computer and fails to take 
      reasonable measures to prevent disclosure of that information. The act 
      mandates that personal data may not be       stored in any computer unless 
      the computer bureau or data user has registered under the act. This 
      provides for a central registry and the tracking of which companies or 
      persons maintain databases of personal information. Data users and bureaus 
      must demonstrate a need and purpose behind their possession of personal 
      data. 

      The act provides tort remedies to any person who is damaged by disclosure 
      of the personal data.   Reasonable care to prevent the disclosure is a 
      defense.  English courts have not yet ruled what level of computer 
      security measures constitute reasonable care.       Considering the 
      magnitude of invasion possible with TEMPEST ELINT it should be clear by 
      now that failure to use TEMPEST Certified equipment is prima facie 
      unreasonable care. 

      The Remedies section of the act provides incentive for these entities to 
      provide successful protection of person data from disclosure or illicit 
      access. Failure to protect the data will result in monetary loss.  This 
      may be looked at from the economic efficiency       viewpoint as 
      allocating the cost of disclosure the persons most able to bear those 
      costs, and also most able to prevent disclosure. Data users that store 
      personal data would use TEMPEST Certified equipment as part of their 
      computer security plan, thwarting would-be eavesdroppers. The Data 
      Protection Act 1984 allocates risk to those who can bear it best and 
      provides an incentive for them to keep other individuals' data private. 
      This act should be adopted by the United States as part of a full-spectrum 
      plan to combat TEMPEST eavesdropping. 

      Data users are in the best position to prevent disclosure through proper 
      computer security. Only by making them liable for failures in security can 
      we begin to rein in TEMPEST ELINT. 

      VII Recommendations 

      Do not criminalize TEMPEST ELINT. Most crimes that TEMPEST ELINT would 
      aid, such a insider trading, are already illegal; the current laws are 
      adequate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology should 
      immediately begin a program to educate       the private sector about 
      TEMPEST. Only if individuals are aware of the threat can they take 
      appropriate precautions or decide whether any precautions are necessary. 

      Legislation should be enacted to require all electronic equipment to 
      prominently display its level of emanations and whether it is TEMPEST 
      Certified. If individuals are to choose to protect themselves they must be 
      able to make a informed decision regarding how       much protection is 
      enough. 

      TEMPEST Certified equipment should be available to the private sector.  
      The current ban on selling to non-governmental agencies prevents 
      individuals who need to protect information from having the technology to 
      do so. 

      Possession of TEMPEST ELINT equipment should not be made illegal. The 
      inherently passive nature and simple design of TEMPEST ELINT equipment 
      means that making its possession illegal will not deter crime; the units 
      can be easily manufactured and are       impossible to detect. Limiting 
      their availability serves only to monopolize the countermeasures research, 
      information, and equipment for the government; this prevents the testing, 
      design and manufacture of countermeasures by the private sector. 

      Legislation mirroring England's Data Protection Act 1984 should be 
      enacted.  Preventing disclosure of personal data can only be accomplished 
      by giving those companies holding the data a reason to protect it. If data 
      users are held liable for their failure to take       reasonable security 
      precautions they will begin to take reasonable security precautions, 
      including the use of TEMPEST Certified equipment.

      2. TEMPEST is an acronym for Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation 
      Standard. 

      This standard sets forth the official views of the United States on the 
      amount of electromagnetic radiation that a device may emit without 
      compromising the information it is processing. TEMPEST is a defensive 
      standard; a device which conforms to this standard       is referred to as 
      TEMPEST Certified. 

      The United States government has refused to declassify the acronym for 
      devices used to intercept the electromagnetic information of non-TEMPEST 
      Certified devices. For this note, these devices and the technology behind 
      them will also be referred to as TEMPEST; in which case, TEMPEST stands 
      for Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Surveillance Technology. 

      The United States government refuses to release details regarding TEMPEST 
      and continues an organized effort to censor the dissemination of 
      information about it. For example the NSA succeeded in shutting down a 
      Wang Laboratories presentation on       TEMPEST Certified equipment by 
      classifying the contents of the speech and threatening to prosecute the 
      speaker with revealing classified information. 

      The pixels glow for only a very short time and must be routinely struck by 
      the electron beam to stay lit. To maintain the light output of all the 
      pixels that are supposed to be lit, the electron beam traverses the entire 
      CRT screen sixty times a second. Every time the       beam fires it causes 
      a high voltage EMR emission.  This EMR can be used to reconstruct the 
      contents of the target CRT screen.  TEMPEST ELINT equipment designed to 
      reconstruct the information synchronizes its CRT with the target CRT. 
      First, it uses the EMR to synchronize its electron gun with the electron 
      gun in the target CRT. Then, when the TEMPEST ELINT unit detects EMR 
      indicating that the target CRT fired on a pixel, the TEMPEST ELINT unit 
      fires the electron gun of its CRT. The ELINT CRT is in perfect synchronism 
      with the target CRT; when the target lights a pixel, a corresponding pixel 
      on the TEMPEST ELINT CRT is lit. The exact picture on the target CRT will 
      appear on the TEMPEST ELINT CRT. Any changes on the target screen will be 
      instantly reflected in the TEMPEST ELINT screen. TEMPEST Certified 
      equipment gives off emissions levels that are too faint to be readily 
      detected. Certification levels are set out in National Communications 
      Security Information Memorandum 5100A (NACSIM 5100A). "Emission levels are 
      expressed in the time and frequency domain, broadband or narrow band in 
      terms of the frequency domain, and in terms of conducted or radiated 
      emissions." White, supra, note 9, 10.1.

      Requirement under the United States Constitution. Nor will it discuss the 
      Constitutional exclusion of foreign nationals from the Warrant 
      Requirement.  Protecting privacy under TEMPEST       should be made freely 
      available; TEMPEST Certified equipment should be legally available; and 
      organizations possessing private information should be required by law to 
      protect that information through good computer security practices and the 
      use of TEMPEST Certified equipment. 

      4. HUMINT has been used by the United States since the Revolution.  "The 
      necessity of procuring good intelligence is apparent & need not be further 
      urged -- All that remains for me to add is, that you keep the whole matter 
      as secret as possible. For upon       Secrecy, Success depends in Most 
      Enterprises of the kind, and for want of it, they are generally defeated, 
      however well planned & promising a favorable issue." Letter of George 
      Washington (Jul. 26, 1777).

      trusty persons to Staten Island in whom you can confide, to obtain

      they are, and what Guards they have -- their       strength & where

      6. Eavesdrip is an Anglo-Saxon word, and refers to the wide overhanging 
      eaves used to prevent rain from falling close to a house's foundation.  
      The eavesdrip provided "a sheltered place where one could hide to listen 
      clandestinely to conversation within the       house."  W. MORRIS & M.

      8. Interception is an espionage term of art and should be differentiated 
      from its more common usage. When information is intercepted, the 
      interceptor as well as the intended recipient receive the information. 
      Interception when not used as a term of art refers to       one person 
      receiving something intended for someone else; the intended recipient 
      never receives what he was intended to receive. 

      9. There are two types of emissions, conducted and radiated. Radiated 
      emissions are formed when components or cables act as antennas for 
      transmitting the EMR; when radiation is conducted along cables or other 
      connections but not radiated it is referred to       as "conducted". 
      Sources include cables, the ground loop, printed circuit boards, internal 
      wires, the power supply to power line coupling, the cable to cable 
      coupling, switching transistors, and high-power amplifiers. WHITE & M. 
      MARDIGUIAN, EMI CONTROL METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES, 10.1 (1985). "[C]ables 
      may act as an antenna to transmit the signals directly or even both 
      receive the signals and re-emit them further away from the source 
      equipment. It is possible that cables acting as an antenna in such a 
      manner could transmit the signals much more efficiently than the equipment 
      itself...A similar effect may occur with metal pipes such as those for 
      domestic water supplies. ... If an earthing [(grounding)] system is not 
      installed correctly such that there is a path in the circuit with a very 
      high resistance (for example where paint prevents conduction and is acting 
      as an insulator), then the whole earthing system could well act in a 
      similar fashion to an antenna. ... [For a VDU] the strongest signals, or 
      harmonics thereof, are usually between 60-250 MHz approximately. 

      There have however been noticeable exception of extremely strong emissions 
      in the television bands and at higher frequencies between 450-800 MHz. 
      Potts, Emission Security, 3 COMPUTER LAW AND SECURITY REPORT 27 (1988). 

      10. The TEMPEST ELINT operator can distinguish between different VDUs in 
      the same room because of the different EMR characteristics of both homo 
      and heterogeneous units. "There is little comparison between EMR 
      characteristics from otherwise comparable equipment. Only if the VDU was 
      made with exactly the same components is there any similarity. If some of 
      the components have come from a different batch, have been updated in some 
      way, and especially if they are from a different manufacturer, then 
      completely different results are obtained. In this way a different mark or 
      version of the same [VDU] will emit different signals. Additionally 
      because of the variation of manufacturing standards between counties, two 
      VDUs made by the same company but sourced from different counties will 
      have entirely different EMR signal characteristics...From this it way be 
      thought that there is such a jumble of emissions around, that it would not 
      be possible to isolate those from any one particular source. Again, this 
      is not the case. 

      Most received signals have memory or the contents of its mass storage 
      devices is more complicated and must be performed from a closer distance. 
      The reconstruction of information via EMR, a process for which the United 
      States government refuses to       declassify either the exact technique 
      or even its name, is not limited to computers and digital devices but is 
      applicable to all devices that generate electromagnetic radiation. TEMPEST 
      is especially effective against VDUs because they produce a very high 
      level of EMR, a different line synchronization, due to design, reflection, 
      interference or variation of component tolerances. So that if for instance 
      there are three different signals on the same frequency ... by fine tuning 
      of the RF receiver, antenna manipulation and modification of line 
      synchronization, it is possible to lock onto each of the three signals 
      separately and so read the screen information. By similar techniques, it 
      is entirely possible to discriminate between individual items of equipment 
      in the same room."  Potts, supra note 9. 

      11. TEMPEST is concerned with the transient electromagnetic pulses formed 
      by digital equipment. All electronic equipment radiates EMR which may be 
      reconstructed. Digital equipment processes information as 1's and 0's -- 
      on's or off's. Because of this,       digital equipment gives off pulses 
      of EMR. These pulses are easier to reconstruct at a distance than the 
      non-pulse EMR given off by analog equipment. For a thorough discussion the 
      radiation problems of broadband digital information see e.g. military 
      standard MIL-STD-461 REO2; White supra note 9, 10.2. 

      12. See supra note 2. 

      13. Of special interest to ELINT collectors are EMR from computers, 
      communications centers and avionics. Schultz, Defeating Ivan with TEMPEST, 
      DEFENSE ELECTRONICS 64 (June 1983). 

      14. The picture on a CRT screen is built up of picture elements (pixels) 
      organized in lines across the screen. The pixels are made of material that 
      fluoresces when struck with energy. The energy is produced by a beam of 
      electrons fired from an electron gun in the       back of the picture 
      tube. The electron beam scans the screen of the CRT in a regular 
      repetitive manner. When the voltage of the beam is high then the pixel it 
      is focused upon emits photons and appears as a dot on the screen.

      23. Tapping (aka trespassatory eavesdropping) is patently in violation of 
      the statute. "The offense created by section 1 of the Interception of 
      Communications Act 1985 covers those forms of eavesdropping on computer 
      communications which involve "tapping"       the wires along which 
      messages are being passed. One problem which may arise, however, is the 
      question of whether the communication in question was intercepted in the 
      course of its transmission by means of a public telecommunications system. 
      It is technically possible to intercept a communication at several stages 
      in its transmission, and it may be a question of fact to decide the stage 
      at which it enters the "public" realm.  THE LAW COMMISSION,WORKING PAPER

      display whatever appears on the       legitimate user's screen on the 
      eavesdropper's screen. This activity would not seem to constitute any 
      criminal offence..."  THE LAW COMMISSION, WORKING PAPER NO. 110: COMPUTER

      25. 301.2(1) of the Canadian criminal code states that anyone who:   ... 
      without color of right, (a) obtains, directly or indirectly, any computer 
      service, (b) by means of an electromagnetic ... or other device, 
      intercepts or causes to be intercepted, either directly or
      indirectly, any function of a computer system ... [is guilty of an 
      indictable offence].

      (1988) (Principles Governing the Redrafting of the Preliminary Guidelines 
      "g." (at an unknown page)) 

      27. There has been great debate over what exactly is a computer crime.  
      There are several schools of thought. The more articulate school, and the 
      one to which the author adheres holds that the category computer crime 
      should be limited to crimes directed       against computers; for example, 
      a terrorist destroying a computer with explosives would fall into this 
      category. Crimes such as putting ghost employees on a payroll computer and 
      collecting their pay are merely age-old accounting frauds; today the fraud 
      involves a computer because the records are kept on a computer. The 
      computer is merely ancillary to the crime. This has been mislabeled 
      computer crime and should merely be referred to as a fraud perpetrated 
      with the aid of a computer. 

      Finally, there are information crimes. These are crimes related to the 
      purloining or alteration of information. These crimes are more common and 
      more profitable due to the computer's ability to hold and access great 
      amounts of information. TEMPEST ELINT       can best be categorized as a 
      information crime. 

      28. Compare, for example, the Watergate break-in in which the burglars 
      were discovered when they returned to move a poorly placed spread spectrum 
      bug. 

      29. TEMPEST Certified refers to the equipment having passed a testing and 
      emanations regime specified in NACSIM 5100A. This classified document sets 
      forth the emanations levels that the NSA believes digital equipment can 
      give off without compromising       the information it is processing. 
      TEMPEST Certified equipment is theoretically secure against TEMPEST 
      eavesdropping. 

      30. Previously the Bureau of Standards. The NIST is a division of the 
      Commerce Department. 

      31. In this case computer equipment would include all peripheral computer 
      equipment. There is no use is using a TEMPEST Certified computer if the 
      printer or the modem are not Certified. 

      32. The NSA has tried to limit the availability of TEMPEST information to 
      prevent the spread of the devices. For a discussion of the First Amendment 
      and prior restraint See, e.g. The United States of America v. Progressive, 
      Inc. 467 F.Supp 990 (1979, WD       Wis.) (magazine intended to publish 
      plans for nuclear weapon; prior restraint injunction issued), reh. den.

      33. For example, the NSA has just recently allowed the Drug Enforcement 
      Agency (DEA) to purchase TEMPEST Certified computer equipment. The DEA 
      wanted secure computer equipment because wealthy drug lords had were using 
      TEMPEST       eavesdropping equipment.

      Trick: Logs every keystroke in Windows.
      Treat: Your enemy has a record of every email message and document you type. 
                      
      If you have to leave your computer unattended and want to make sure that 
      no one tampers with it, install Invisible KeyLogger 97 (IK97). It silently 
      grabs every Windows keystroke and adds it to a log file, essentially 
      recording everything that happens while you're away. You can also use IK97 
      to monitor your children's PC use and to provide backup copies of 
      everything that you type. 

      This is a great tool, but what if someone else were to secretly install 
      IK97 on your PC and monitor you? If you share a workstation, or if someone 
      gets to your system when it's unattended, IK97 can be used to steal your 
      passwords and record your private email and documents. Remember that 
      message you sent about your boss's ugly hairdo? You deleted it from your 
      out-box, but IK97 still has a copy of it. 

      To find out if IK97 is running on your system, hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete. If you 
      see a program called ik in the Close Program dialog box, that's Invisible 
      KeyLogger 97, and you can stop it by selecting End Task. Unfortunately, 
      however, IK97 has a sibling called Invisible KeyLogger Stealth (IKS) that 
      doesn't show up in the dialog box since it's a virtual device driver (VxD) 
      and not an application. So, if it's watching you, you're out of luck. 

      To make sure you don't get spied on, change your passwords frequently, and 
      work on confidential or incriminating files on your home PC. IK97 might be 
      watching.

19.0  Australia Admits to Echelon 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by no-one 
      The Inspector General of Intelligence and Security for
      Australia, Bill Blick, has told the BBC that Australia's
      Defense Signals Directorate (DSD) is indeed part of the
      global eavesdropping network known as Echelon. Both
      the US and Britain still deny the existence of this
      network. 

      BBC       
      http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/newsid_503000/503224.stm
      
      World

      Global spy network revealed


      Listening in to your phone calls and reading your emails 

      By Andrew Bomford of BBC Radio 4's PM
      programme 

      Imagine a global spying network that can eavesdrop on
      every single phone call, fax or e-mail, anywhere on the
      planet. 

      It sounds like science fiction, but it's true. 

      Two of the chief protagonists - Britain and America -
      officially deny its existence. But the BBC has
      confirmation from the Australian Government that such a
      network really does exist and politicians on both sides of
      the Atlantic are calling for an inquiry. 

      On the North Yorkshire moors above Harrogate they can
      be seen for miles, but still they are shrouded in secrecy.
      Around 30 giant golf balls, known as radomes, rise from
      the US military base at Menwith Hill. 

      Linked to the NSA 

      Inside is the world's most sophisticated eavesdropping
      technology, capable of listening-in to satellites high
      above the earth. 


      The base is linked directly to the headquarters of the US
      National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Mead in Maryland, 
      and it is also linked to a series of other listening 
      posts scattered across the world, like Britain's own GCHQ. 

      The power of the network,  codenamed Echelon, is
      astounding. 

      Every international telephone call, fax, e-mail, or radio
      transmission can be listened to by powerful computers
      capable of voice recognition. They home in on a long list
      of key words, or patterns of messages. They are looking
      for evidence of international crime, like terrorism. 

      Open Oz 

      The network is so secret that the British and American
      Governments refuse to admit that Echelon even exists.
      But another ally, Australia, has decided not to be so
      coy. 

      The man who oversees Australia's security services,
      Inspector General of Intelligence and Security Bill Blick,
      has confirmed to the BBC that their Defence Signals
      Directorate (DSD) does form part of the network. 

      "As you would expect there are a large amount of radio
      communications floating around in the atmosphere, and
      agencies such as DSD collect those communications in
      the interests of their national security", he said. 

      Asked if they are then passed on to countries like Britain
      and America, he said: "They might be in certain
      circumstances." 

      But the system is so widespread all sorts of private
      communications, often of a sensitive commercial nature,
      are hoovered up and analysed. 

      Journalist Duncan Campbell has spent much of his life
      investigating Echelon. In a report commissioned by the
      European Parliament he produced evidence that the
      NSA snooped on phone calls from a French firm bidding
      for a contract in Brazil. They passed the information on
      to an American competitor, which won the contract. 

      "There's no safeguards, no remedies, " he said, "There's
      nowhere you can go to say that they've been snooping
      on your international communications. Its a totally
      lawless world." 

      Breaking the silence 

      Both Britain and America deny allegations like this,
      though they refuse to comment further. But one former
      US army intelligence officer has broken the code of
      silence. 

      Colonel Dan Smith told the BBC that while this is
      feasible, it is not official policy: "Technically they can
      scoop all this information up, sort through it, and find
      what it is that might be asked for," he said. "But there is
      no policy to do this specifically in response to a
      particular company's interests." 

      Legislators on both sides of the Atlantic are beginning to
      sit up and take notice. Republican Congressman Bob

20.0  DVD Copy Protection Broken 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
      
      contributed by Weld Pond 
      Because developers implemented the copy protection
      scheme of DVD disks improperly it was easily broken.
      One DVD content publisher failed to encrypt the
      decryption key on their disks. This allowed the Masters
      of Reverse Engineering (MoRE) from Norway, to 'guess'
      other publishers keys. They then developed the DeCSS
      utility that can copy a DVD movie.

      Why the DVD Hack Was a Cinch 
      by Andy Patrizio 
      
      2:15 p.m. 2.Nov.1999 PST 
      The anonymous developers of the decryption program that removes DVD copy 
      protection had an easy time doing it, thanks to a gaffe by a software 
      developer and the surprising weakness of the encryption technology. 

      Essentially, the two European hackers who developed the DeCSS utility that 
      copies a DVD movie disc were able to break the code because one of the 
      product's licensees inadvertently neglected to encrypt the decryption key. 

      Industry experts were stunned by the hack because DVD as a movie-playing 
      format is supposed to be copy-proof. In fact, DVD would not be on the 
      market today without the permission of the motion picture industry which, 
      sources       say, is reeling from this development. 

      Breaking DVD's encryption was considered extremely difficult, but once the 
      first key was discovered, the rest fell with ease, since the crackers were 
      able to use their original, valid key as a launch point to find more valid 
      decryption       keys. 

      DeCSS is a tiny (60 KB) utility that copies the encrypted DVD video file, 
      which has a .VOB extension, and saves it to the hard disc without 
      encryption. 

      Since DVD movies can range in size from 4.7 GB to 9.4 GB and recordable 
      DVD has at best 2.5 capacity (or 5.2GB for double-sided discs), direct DVD 
      copying is unfeasible. But starting next year, 4.7 GB recordable DVD 
      drives will hit       the market, making duplication of DVD discs much 
      easier. 

      DVD uses a security method called the Content Scrambling System. CSS is a 
      form of data encryption used to discourage reading media files directly 
      from the disc without a decryption key. To descramble the video and audio, 
      a 5-byte       (40-bit) key is needed. Every player -- including consoles 
      from Sony, Toshiba, and other consumer electronics vendors, as well as 
      software vendors for PCs like WinDVD and ATI DVD -- has its own unique 
      unlock key. Every DVD disc, in turn, has 400 of these 5-byte keys stamped 
      onto the disc. That way, the unlock key from every licensee, be it WinDVD 
      or a Pioneer DV-525 unit, will read the disc. 

      All licensees of DVD technology have to encrypt their decryption key so no 
      one can reverse-engineer the playback software and extract the key. 

      Well, one licensee didn't encrypt their key. The developers of DeCSS, a 
      Norwegian group called MoRE (Masters of Reverse Engineering) got a key by 
      reverse-engineering the XingDVD player, from Xing Technologies, a 
      subsidiary of       RealNetworks. 

      "We found that one of the companies had not encrypted their CSS decryption 
      code, which made it very easy for us," said Jon Johansen, a founder of 
      MoRE, in Norway. "We didn't think it would be that easy, in fact." 

      RealNetworks did not return repeated calls requesting comment. 

      Because the unlock key is 5 bytes long, Johansen and his two partners, who 
      wish to remain anonymous, were able to guess a whole slew of other keys. 
      So even if all future DVD movies remove the Xing key, DeCSS has a plethora 
      of       other keys to choose from. 

      Johansen and his partners were able to guess more than 170 working keys by 
      trial and error before finally just giving up to go do something else. "I 
      wonder how much they paid for someone to actually develop that weak 
      algorithm,"       said Johansen. "It's a very weak encryption algorithm." 

      Leaving such a weak link in the security chain surprised industry people. 
      "I am really surprised that they made it that easy to break into," said 
      Kevin Hause, senior analyst with International Data Corp. "One of the key 
      concerns about       DVD was security." 

      "I don't think it's the end of the world, but it'll be interesting to see 
      what steps the industry takes now, whether they start delaying the 
      releases of certain titles," said Bill Hunt, webmaster of The Digital 
      Bits, a DVD news site. 

      "I would expect it could also delay the advent of recordable DVD, because 
      it'll give people a medium to write these hacked video files." 

      Others aren't so talkative. The Motion Picture Association of America 
      (MPAA) declined to comment. The DVD Forum, based in Japan, was unreachable 
      due to a national holiday, but it did issue a carefully worded statement. 

      "The circulation through the Internet of the illegal and inappropriate 
      software is against the stream of copyright protection. Toshiba, which has 
      led the establishment of the DVD format and is the chair-company of the 
      DVD Forum, feels       it is a great pity," wrote Masaki Mikura, manager 
      of the strategic partnership and licensing division at Toshiba Ltd. 

      "In the future, the laboratories will be more actively conducting strict 
      surveillance and take counter measures against illegal, inappropriate 
      software and hardware in the market. Moreover, we believe that, based on 
      the recent
      legislation, legal measures and steps will be taken by copyright holders 
      against such violation of intellectual properties," Mikura wrote.

21.0  Optus in Australia Compromised

      Cable and Wireless Optus/Microplex in Australia suffered
      what they called an "unauthorized intrusion" at 4:30am
      AEST Nov, 3rd. According to a press release on the
      matter, the intruders had "limited access to details of
      Optus and Microplex customers [but] did not include
      access to any customers' financial information". Tech
      support staff indicated that a username/password list
      was posted to a Usenet group. 

      Rumours suggest that the targeting of Optus may have
      been inspired by the upcoming Republic referendum in
      Australia, and it is unclear if the incident is related to
      the Cable and Wireless breach in October.

      Optus calls police after ISP breached 

      One of Australia's largest Internet service providers has
      been forced to advise all customers to change their
      passwords after a major security breach was uncovered
      this morning.

      Cable and Wireless Optus called in police after what it

      customers say the breach was the company's own fault.

      The company operates under the Optusnet, Microplex and
      DingoBlue banners, and a huge file containing all the login
      passwords was made available to anyone who wanted
      them.

      Optus says as soon as its staff were made aware of the
      breach, it moved to close the security loophole.

      However, it took the company nearly 18 hours before it
      alerted its 100,000 customers via an email that their
      passwords could no longer be considered secret and
      should be changed immediately.

      November 05, 1999
 
      The Internet service provider (ISP) network of Australia's second
      largest telecommunications provider Cable & Wireless Optus
      Ltd [AUS:CWO] suffered a major security breach on
      Wednesday, with customer account details posted on the
      Internet.
 
      The attack occurred at 4.30am Australian Eastern Daylight
      Time (AEDT), with user names and passwords of OptusNet and
      Microplex ISP customers posted on a Usenet news group.
      Cable & Wireless Optus said that no customer credit card
      details were made available.
 
      The telco informed the police, but according to local media
      reports failed to alert its 100,000 or more customers that their
      passwords had been compromised and should be changed until
      18 hours later.
 
      Commenting on the delay, Tony Hill, executive director of the
      Internet Society of Australia (ISOC-AU), said the Internet user
      group was concerned, and that Cable & Wireless Optus
      claimed that every effort was made to inform customers once
      the breach was repaired and police were notified.
 
      "ISOC-AU is concerned at reports that there may have been a
      delay in advising customers of the intrusion," Hill told
      Newsbytes. "Early advice to Internet users in this circumstance
      is paramount so that they can take action to protect their
      passwords, accounts and personal information."
 
      Cable & Wireless Optus said in a statement that it immediately
      closed the breach and is now reviewing and stepping up
      security procedures.
 
      "Although this intrusion has caused only minimal customer
      impact, Cable & Wireless Optus is continuing to assess the
      position to ensure customers are not in any way

      The Web site last weekend showed a tax on "silliness" that varied

      site said, monthly wages of as much as 1 million lei ($59.14) would be 
      taxed 100 percent. It also changed the official exchange rate of the leu 
      to 0.5 per dollar from 16,870 per dollar. 

      The ministry "took immediate measures to restore the Web site's contents

      Moscow hackers gain access to Reuters data base (adds)

      
      Story Filed: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 4:15 PM EST 
      
      MOSCOW, November 2 (Itar-Tass) -- The Russian Interior Ministry's 
      department for struggle against economic crime in the sphere of 
      intellectual property has exposed a criminal group reported to have gained 
      illegal access to the data base of Britain's Reuters news agency, press 
      secretary of the Russian Chief Administration for Struggle against 
      Economic Crime Alexander Vorobyov told Tass on Tuesday. The so-called 
      Kentavr dealing centre was based on a computer class of a Moscow school. 

      A former Reuters employee has been reported to be involved in the crime. 
      The Russian law-enforcement bodies have already informed the British 
      agency about Kentavr having picked the safety software locks and used the 
      information of the agency to their own       advantage. 

      Head of the Russian department for struggle against crime in the sphere of 
      intellectual property Mikhail Sukhodolsky told Tass that about a year ago, 
      Kentavr had signed a contract with the economic department of Reuters, and 
      under the contract was granted       computer hardware and software, 
      including the passwords to the agency's data base. Later, the company 
      misappropriated the computer equipment and "disappeared" having stopped 
      paying for the Reuters' information. Kentavr then "picked" the safety 
      locks of the agency and gained illegal satellite-supported access to 
      stock-exchange automated quotations and facilities of Reuters. 

      Kentavr was reported to have rented a floor in a Moscow school. The 
      company entered into criminal collusion with the school administration, 
      which helped to misappropriate 40 personal computers originally bought to 
      equip a computer class at the school. 

      The dealing centre then advertised in the media that it would provide for 
      low-price access to Reuters network. The police are now after natural and 
      law persons having signed contracts with Kentavr. 

      According to Reuters security service, the damage done by Kentavr has 
      exceeded 3 million dollars. 

      According to Vorobyov, the so called dealing centre had been operating 
      without even having registered as a law person. At the same time, the 
      law-enforcement officers were reported to have found documents providing 
      ample evidence of the company having its own       bank operating 
      underground, and evading taxes. 

      The Russian Interior Ministry has qualified that criminal case as a major 
      and most sophisticated crime recently committed in Russia in the sphere of 
      economic crimes against intellectual property.

      Story Filed: Tuesday, November 02, 1999 3:37 PM EST 
      
      TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- In five years, China could be able to use computer 
      viruses, hackers and other types of cyber warfare to break down Taiwan's 
      defenses and prepare for an invasion, the Taiwanese military said Tuesday. 

      Taiwan's economy, government and military are highly dependent on 
      computers and could be vulnerable to a high-tech assault, the official 
      Central News Agency quoted Chang Jia-sheng of the Defense Ministry as 
      saying. 

      Chang said Taiwan should form a team of experts to prepare the island for 
      possible cyber warfare, the agency reported. 

      China's cyber arsenal could include computer viruses, hackers and 
      electromagnetic pulses that would disrupt communication networks and 
      create chaos, he said. 

      The high-tech weapons could quickly take out their targets without much 
      expense or loss of life, Chang said. They could destroy public morale, 
      spread disinformation and cause instability, giving China an excuse to 
      move in and take over the island, he said. 

      Chang said that although China is technologically backward, it has been 
      able to ``leap frog'' in the past and quickly acquire technology for 
      nuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles and satellites. 

      Acquiring the ability to use cyber warfare against Taiwan by 2005 is 
      within China's reach, he said. 

      China and Taiwan have been ruled by separate governments since they split 
      during a civil war in 1949. Beijing considers the island to be a breakaway 
      province and has repeatedly threatened to use force to reunify the two 
      sides if Taipei seeks formal independence. 

      Taipei has said it will gradually reunify with China once the mainland 
      becomes democratic and more economically developed.

      Happy New Year: Y2K viruses ready
      By Reuters 
      November 2, 1999 12:34 PM PT

      More than 30,000 threats from computer hackers and virus writers who say 
      they will release new viruses to herald the new year and the new 
      millennium have been logged by the FBI and other law enforcement groups, 
      said Lou Marcoccio, worldwide research director at the technology 
      consulting firm Gartner Group.

      "Most of these threats will probably amount to nothing,'' Marcoccio told 
      Reuters        after addressing a community banking industry convention in 
      Orlando.

      "But if just five or 10 viruses are released at the same time, that would 
      overwhelm       the ability of ... companies that produce the fixes. It 
      could cause substantial productivity losses.''

      In the case of the Melissa virus earlier this year, most computer users, 
      whether individuals or       corporations, were able to protect their 
      e-mail and messaging systems because code writers could replicate the 
      virus and distribute the fixes before the virus' release date.

      "But these companies can't work on 10 fixes at once,'' Marcoccio said.

      Most computer viruses are the work of amateur hackers who are known to one 
      another and gain       status by releasing new and successful viruses, he 
      said.

      Jan. 1 an appealing target       The date Jan. 1, 2000, presents a very 
      appealing target date for such viruses.

      "A lot of these guys don't even care if they get arrested. They just want 
      to be remembered,''       Marcoccio said.

      Marcoccio was in Orlando to speak to the America's Community Bankers 
      annual convention. He       told the group that a Gartner Group survey of 
      14,000 people showed that 67 percent of all Americans say they plan to buy 
      seven to 18 days of worth of food and other supplies within three days of 
      Jan. 1.

      Public anxiety is way ahead of the actual Y2K threat, according to the 
      assessment of Gartner Group       researchers and most other experts.

      They expect computer problems to be minor, for the most part, with many 
      Y2K problems detected in       November and December of this year as 
      date-forward transactions begin to uncover gaps in system
      protections.

26.0  Stupid User Mistakes (are a) Bigger Problem than Viruses

      User Errors Are Key Reason For Data Loss
      By Mitch Wagner, InternetWeek
      Oct 29, 1999 (10:46 AM)
      URL: http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB19991029S0008 
      
      Accidental deletions are the chief cause of lost data, far exceeding 
      viruses as a cause of bygone bits, a survey found. "The vast majority of 
      the systems managers' data loss occurs because of accidental deletions, 
      not viruses, not systems crashes," said Phil Proffit, an analyst at 
      Broadcasters Network International, the analyst company that conducted the 
      research. 

      In a sample of 300 Windows NT systems managers, 88 percent said accidental 
      deletions were the leading cause of lost data, followed by 7 percent 
      blaming intentional deletions, and a scant 3 percent blaming viruses. Most 
      IT managers said they had suffered a critical       loss of data as a 
      result of an accidental deletion (69 percent).

      "I believe it," said Todd Dion, vice president of technology at Tutor 
      Time, a chain of child care centers that hosts its systems on Windows NT 
      servers. 

      Dion said he's encountered viruses a handful of times, but lost data as a 
      result of user error is a regular occurrence. 

      For example, one employee in Tutor Time's accounting department regularly 
      copies reports to a floppy and then immediately copies them back to the 
      hard disk, and about once a month, copies the old version on the floppy 
      over the new version on the hard disk, and,       ultimately, needs 
      rescuing. In another instance, a consultant upgrading accounting systems 
      erased an entire folder of records and then overwrote the folder with old 
      data. 

      "The CFO called me in at 11:30 on Friday night, and I swear, I expected to 
      find his hands around the consultant's throat," Dion said.

      While many systems managers seek to avoid such problems by routinely 
      backing up user data, IT managers were evenly split on whether that 
      provides complete protection against data loss. 

      Of the 48 percent who said backups provide incomplete protection, a bit 
      more than half said the reason is data can be lost between backups (55 
      percent). Another source of problems is backups are not always reliable 
      and sometimes do not work properly (26 percent).       But a good regimen 
      of backups can minimize risk, Proffit said. 

      IT managers should install and use backup products, such as Veritas' 
      Backup Exec and Computer Associates' ARCserve IT. Both can be managed by 
      the IT manager rather than trusting the user to make a backup, because the 
      user is not likely to do it. IT managers should also install "undelete" 
      products for NT, such as Symantec Norton Utilities 2.0 for Windows NT and
      Undelete for Windows NT from Executive Software.

      FTC commissioner: No privacy regs
      By Lisa M. Bowman, ZDNN
      November 3, 1999 12:59 PM PT

      Don't expect the Federal Trade Commission to jump in anytime soon to 
      prevent debacles such as the RealNetworks Inc. privacy snafu -- not if 
      commissioner Orson Swindle has his way.

      Swindle, one of four commissioners on the agency that enforces consumer 
      protection laws, said he       would be "leading the charge" to prevent 
      regulation regarding privacy, even though RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK) 
      angered many customers after a security expert discovered it was tracking 
      users' music listening habits without their knowledge. 

      "The consumer ultimately is the guard of his own privacy," said Swindle, 
      speaking before a group of       Silicon Valley attorneys at an event 
      sponsored by law firm Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, 
      Calif. "The government cannot take care of everybody." 

      In July, the FTC approved a report recommending that Congress not regulate 
      collection of private       data, and Swindle said that stance should 
      remain the same. "The private sector has the motivation: Good privacy 
      practice is good business," he said. 

      FTC regs confined to children       The only Internet privacy issue the 
      FTC has embraced so far has involved children under 13 years of age.

      Two weeks ago, the commission issued a set of rules that require sites to 
      get parental permission if       they want to sell or share personal 
      information to other companies.

      Swindle, who's known to oppose many kinds of regulation, surprised people 
      by jumping behind the       unanimous vote supporting the new rules. 
      However, under the guidelines, the sites still are free to collect 
      personal information of all kinds if they only plan to use it internally. 

      U.S. companies are facing somewhat of a conundrum as they try to do 
      business with companies in       the European Union, which holds 
      individual privacy in much higher regard. 

      Swindle, who was held as a POW in Vietnam for six years and also served as 
      a spokesman during       Ross Perot's 1992 presidential bid, embraces the 
      same hands-off policy for Internet taxation that he does for privacy. 

      During his speech he told audience members, many of them tax attorneys, 
      that adding special taxes       to Internet transactions could slow down 
      the tech economy, which he said is "roaring like a house afire." 

      "Any misstep on our part will have great consequences," he said. "It could 
      literally choke off       innovation." 

      Swindle supports McCain bill       The Clinton administration took a 
      similar stance last year. In October 1998, President Clinton signed a bill 
      that, among other things, placed a three-year moratorium on Internet 
      taxes. 

      In particular, Swindle said he supports a bill by presidential candidate 
      Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,       that would permanently ban Internet sales 
      taxes and urge the World Trade Organization to adopt a global moratorium 
      on them. 

      Swindle did raise concerns about privacy at one point, but he tied them to 
      taxation. He said       consumer privacy could be violated by huge 
      databases that would be required to keep track of
      people's purchases as the goods that they buy move through various taxing 
      authorities.

      After posting our rumor yesterday HNN received this
      email:
      "After a year and a half, Parse and its host Shamrock
      have parted ways. The split was amicable. Within the
      next few weeks, Pseudo will be launching
      "ParseTV.com", the digital subCULTure channel. As we
      prepare programming for Parsetv, we are committed to
      working with hosts and producers who can devote the
      time necessary to make Parse a top resource for
      hacking culture and technical information related to
      hacking and security. Unfortunately, Shamrock was
      unable to make such a commitment at this time. 

      I myself, still believe that Shamrock has a very valuable
      role to play in hacker media. His outspokenness and
      pranks were refreshing to the community. Perhaps down
      the road, he might return to Parse in an undetermined
      role, but that will have to be worked out at some later
      date. Additionally, I want to state that his departure so

      Hi. I'm not going to write a mad big introduction to this article, because
      I dont feel their is a need for one. All I want to say here is that this
      article is intended for the more "hardcore" phreak, yes, hardcore phreak, not
      for lame ass calling card leeching kiddies who call themsleves phreaks. If
      you are intersted in hacking telephony switches, and you have prior/prefixed
      knowledge of Meridian, read on..
      
      Through my experience, I've seen alot of meridian admins go through many
      different and sometimes repetitive lengths to supposidly secure an internal
      PSTN connected PABX. In this article I'm going to share my knowledge of
      PBX switch hacking, and enlighten you to the intricate techneques that can
      be used to "trunk hop" etc. The information provided in this article has been
      obtained from my own personal accounts of hacking telephony switches, which
      I'd like to state, I don't participate in anymore.
      
      Now, for the sake of timesaving, I'll setup a possible scenario.. Consider
      the following:
      
              o You have stumbled accross a nice Meridian Mail system, which you
                have already compromised by finding yourself a few boxdes in their.
                You discover that the Meridian Mail system you have gained access
                to belongs to a certain telco, and is used for internal
                communication between emloyees high up in the hierarchial chain.
      
      Now, any "normal" phreak would gradually take over the system by finding as
      many free boxes as possible and hnading them over to friends, or would keep
      the nice lil' system to themselves as a means of obtaining information about
      the telco that owns the PBX, via the the means of eavesdroping on used
      voicemail boxes. This is a very primitive form of remote eavesdroping, which
      this file is not designed to illistrate.
      
      Meridian PBX systems are all administered by a primary system console, which
      can be remotely accessed by many different protocols. The most popular of
      which is remote dialup via assigned extensions. If the companys main switch
      is centrex based, it is likely that the meridian admin console is accessable
      via IP on the companys intranet. If you manage to gain access to the
      actual switching conponment, you are likely to have the following privalges
      on the meridian based network:
      
              o 100% control over every single inbound/outbound trunk group
              o Access to every single voicemail box on the switch
              o Access to trunk/group/node administration
      
      Basically, the meridian administration module is designed to make the admin
      (or whoever has access to it) GOD over the entire system, I say GOD because
      you could do anything you wanted, as far as your telephony derived
      imagination extends. OK, enough of this.. I'm just going to stop going on
      about what if's for the time being, now I'm going to concentrate on the
      factual based information, and how one would go about accessing such a
      switch.
      
      The simpilist way to find the internal dialup to a meridian switch is to
      scan the internal extensions which the switch controls. It's generaly a
      good idea to begin scanning network/node extensions such as 00,01,02,03[xx]
      etc. What you are looking for is a modem carrier, which when you connect
      should ask you for a singular password, which in most cases is bypassed
      by hitting control-SD. Once you are in, you should recieve the switches
      command line prompt, somthing similar to this:
      
      >
      
      or
      
      SWITCH0>
      
      OMG, I hear you think.. It looks like a DMS switch prompt.. Well, it is, in
      a funny kind of way. Meridian switches are designed to emualte certain levels
      of DMS-100 O/S types, so you'll find that many of the BCS leveled commands
      that you know from DMS will be usefull here. The information that follows
      has been obtained from public Meridian Mail Administration sources on the
      net..

               taking over all the trunks in your phone system."
      
      An audit of the Meridian 1 telephone system will ensure that every possible
      "system" precaution has been made to prevent fraud. The first step involves
      querying data from the system in the form of printouts (or "capturing" the
      data to a file in a PC). The next step is to analyze the data and confirm the
      reason for each entry. Please be advised that this procedure is not designed
      for all "networked" Meridian 1 systems, however, most of the items apply to
      all systems. Use at your own risk.
      
      PRINTOUTS REQUIRED FOR SECURITY AUDIT: It is suggested that you "capture" all
      of the data from these printouts to separate files. This can be accomplished
      with a PC and communications program. For the BARS LD90 NET printout, try
      this file. (enclosed in faith10.zip barparse.zip)

      CDB - Customer          Verify that CFTA (call forward to trunk access code)
      Data Block              is set to NO. Verify NCOS level of console. Verify
                              that NIT1 through NIT4 (or other night numbers) are
                              pointing to valid numbers. EXTT prompt should be NO
                              to work in conjunction with trunk route disconnect
                              controls (See RDB)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      RDB - Trunk Route       Verify that every route has a TARG assigned. Confirm
      Data Block              that FEDC and NEDC are set correctly. ETH is typical,
                              however for maximum security in blocking trunk to
                              trunk connections, set NEDC to ORG and FEDC to JNT
                              Confirm that ACCD's are a minimum of four digits long
                              (unless for paging). If ESN signaling is active on
                              trunk routes, verify that it needs to be. ESN
                              signaling, if not required, should be avoided. NOTES

                              suggests that sets be a "TGAR 1". The only
                              requirement for TGAR is that it match one of the TARG
                              numbers assigned in the Route Data Block

      Access
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ESN - Electronic        AC1 is typically "9". If there is an AC2 assigned,
      Switched Network        verify its use. If TOD or ETOD is used - verify what
                              NCOS levels are changed, when they are changed and
                              why they are changed. Apply FLEN to your SPNs to
                              insure nobody is ever allowed to be transferred to a
                              partially dialed number, like "Transfer me to 91800"
                              Study EQAR (Equal Access Restriction) to insure that
                              users can only follow a "Carrier Access Code" with a
                              zero rather than a one:   (1010321-1-414-555-1212 is
                              blocked but 1010321-0-414-555-1212 is allowed with
                              EQAR)

      NCTL - Network          Use LD81 FEAT PRINT to verify all NCOS being used.
      Control                 Does NCOS 0 = FRL 0? Does NCOS X always equal FRL X
                              in the NCTL? Does FRL 0 have any capabilities? - It
                              should not be able to dial anything. 
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      FCAS - Free Call        Confirm the need to use FCAS and remove it if
      Screening               possible. FCAS is usually a waste of system memory
                              and complicates the system without saving money. 
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      DGT (DMI) - Digit       Confirm all numbers referenced in the "insert"
      Manipulation            section of each DMI table.

      RLB - BARS Route        Are any RLB ENTR'S assigned FRL 0 - typically, only
      List Block              the RLB that handles 911 calls should have an FRL 0.
                              If DMI is in use, confirm all "inserted" numbers. 
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      CDP - BARS              Are all CDP numbers valid? Check the RLBs they point
      Coordinated             to and see what the DMI value is. Confirm insertions.
      Dialing Plan
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      NET - ALL - BARS        Add 000,001,002,003,004,005,006,007,008,009 as SPNs
      Network Numbers         pointing to a route list block that is set to LTER
                              YES. These entries block transfers to "ext. 9000" and
                              similar numbers. Point SPN "0" to a RLI with a high
                              FRL, then consider adding new SPNs of 02, 03, 04, 05,
                              06, 07, 08, 09 to point to a RLI with a lower FRL so
                              that users cannot dial "0", but can dial "0+NPA
                              credit card calls. Check FRL of 0, 00, 011 and
                              confirm that each is pointed to separate NET entry
                              requiring a high FRL. Remove all of shore NPAs (Like
                              1-809 Dominican Republic) if possible. Regulations
                              are almost non-existent in some of those areas and
                              they are hot fraud targets. Verify blocking 900 and
                              976 access. Also consider blocking the NXX of your
                              local radio station contest lines. Users will go nuts
                              calling a radio station to win a free toaster, taking
                              over all the trunks in your phone system. Restrict
                              the main numbers and DID range within the BARS
                              system. There is no need to call from an outgoing to
                              an incoming line at the same location.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      TRUNKS                  Confirm that all trunks have TGAR assigned. Confirm
                              that all incoming and TIE trunks have class of
                              service SRE assigned. (caution on networked systems) 
                              Confirm that all trunks have an NCOS of zero. 
                              NOTES ON TGAR: For demonstration purposes, this
                              document suggests that sets be a "TGAR 1". The only

      SETS-PHONES             Does every phone have a TGAR of 1 assigned? (This
                              must be checked set by set, TN by TN). Can you change

                              PRINT to find out the UNR sets. CTD class of service
                              is explained below. Confirm that all sets are
                              assigned CLS CFXD? Confirm that the NCOS is
                              appropriate on each set. In Release 20 or above,
                              removing transfer feature may be appropriate. Confirm
                              that all sets CFW digit length is set to the system
                              DN length. NOTES ON TGAR: For demonstration purposes,
                              this document suggests that sets be a "TGAR 1". The
                              only requirement for TGAR is that it match one of the

                              restrictions are done on a set by set basis and allow
                              or deny the ability to transfer incoming calls out of
                              the facility.

      CLASS OF SERVICE AND TRUNK GROUP ACCESS RESTRICTIONS:
      -----------------------------------------------------
      EXPLANATION OF CLASS OF SERVICE SRE: 
      ------------------------------------
      NTP DEFINITION: Allowed to receive calls from the exchange network.
      Restricted from all dial access to the exchange network. Allowed to access
      the exchange network through an attendant or an unrestricted telephone only.
      Essentially, an SRE set can do nothing on it's own except dial internal and
      TIE line extensions. If a trunk is SRE - it will work normally and allow
      conference calls and transfers. 
      
      EXAMPLES OF 'SRE' IN USE: 
      -------------------------
      Voice Mail cannot connect to an outgoing line, but can receive incoming
      calls. Callers on the far end of a TIE line cannot call out through your end
      (for their sake, both ends should be SRE). 
      
      EXPLANATION OF CLASS OF SERVICE CTD: 
      ------------------------------------
      If a route access code is accessed (if there was no match between the TGAR
      and TARG), the caller cannot dial 1 or 0 as the leading digits. If the caller
      makes a "dial 9" BARS call, the NCOS will control the call.
      
      EXPLANATION OF TGAR AND TARG: 
      -----------------------------
      The best restriction is to have all trunk routes TARG'd to 1 and all TNs
      (including actual trunk TNs) TGAR'd to 1. This will block all access to
      direct trunk route selection. 
      
      BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING THESE SECURITY RESTRICTIONS 
      ----------------------------------------------------
      No incoming caller will have access to an outside line unless physically
      transferred or conferenced by an internal party. If voice mail ports are SRE
      and NCOS 0 and have a TGAR matching the TARG - they will not be able to
      transfer a call out of the system, regardless of the voice mail system's
      resident restrictions assigned. No phone will be able to dial a trunk route
      access code. Consider allowing telecom staff this ability for testing. 
      
      Layered security:
      -----------------
      If in phone programming, TGAR was overlooked on a phone, the CTD class of
      service would block the user from dialing a 0 or 1 if they stumble upon a
      route access code. If in programming, the CTD class of service was
      overlooked, both TGAR and NCOS would maintain the restrictions. If in
      programming, the NCOS is overlooked, it will defaults to zero, which is
      totally restricted if NCTL and RLBs are set up correctly.
      
      
      Quick Tour of a Simple Meridian 1 BARS Call
      -------------------------------------------
      Basic Automatic Route Selection. If you dial "9", you are accessing BARS.
      "9" is the "BARS Access Code" 
      
         1. A telephone dials "9" - BARS activates. 
         2. The telephone calls a number - Example: 1-312-XXX-XXXX 
         3. The PBX hold the digits while it looks up "1-312" to figure out what
            Route List to use for processing the call. 
         4. The Route List determines the possible trunk routes that can be used. 
         5. The Route List checks the facility restriction level of the telephone
            and compares it to its own required facility restriction level. 
         6. The Route List checks to see if any special digit manipulation should
            be performed.
      
      LD90 NET
      --------
      The LD90 Network overlay is where area codes and exchanges are defined. If a
      prefix is not entered into LD90, it cannot be dialed through BARS. Each area
      code or exchange refers to a "Route List" or RLI which contains the
      instructions for routing the call.

      LD86 RLB (or RLI)
      -----------------
      The RLB is a "list" of possible trunk routes that an area code or exchange
      can be dialed over. Each "ENTR" or list entry contains a trunk route. Each
      entry also has a "minimum Facility Restriction Level" or "FRL" that must be
      met before a phone can access that entry. In the following example, the first
      entry can be accessed by phones whose NCOS equals an FRL of 3 or above. The
      second entry can only be accessed by phones whose NCOS equals an FRL of 6 or
      above. Along with the trunk route and the FRL, you can apply specific "digit
      manipulation" with the DMI entry. The DMI entries are explained here.

      LD87 NCTL
      ---------
      The FRL to NCOS "relationship" is built in the NCTL data block. The FRL and
      the NCOS do not necessarily have the equal one another, however they usually
      do. A higher FRL/NCOS has more capability than a lower FRL/NCOS. For an NCOS
      number to have any capability, it must first be defined in the NCTL data
      block.

      LD86 Digit Manipulation
      -----------------------
      The Digit Manipulation data blocks are where special prefixes are entered
      before numbers are sent out over trunks. An example of digit manipulation is
      where a 1010XXX carrier access code must be inserted before a number is
      processed over a trunk.

      Little Known Meridian 1 Features And Programming Tricks
      =======================================================
      HELP and Error Lookup 
      
           HELP - Type " ? " at many prompts 
           LOOKUP - At " > " sign, type 
           ERR AUD028 to find out what AUD028 indicates. 
           At any other prompt, type " ! ", then you will receive " > "
           symbol for getting ERR lookup. 
      
      Find Sets with a Certain Feature
      ================================
           LD81 
           REQ LST 
           FEAT CFXA 
           FEAT UNR 
      
                Lists all sets that have the "Call Forward External Allow"
                feature, then lists all UNR sets. 
      
      Inventory and Identification Commands

           IDU l s c u (or) IDC l s c 
           LD22 
           CINV (and) ISSP

           UNTT l s c u 
      
      Speed Call Stuff 
      ================
      Create many Speed Call lists at once. LD18 REQ: NEW 100 - Creates 100 lists.
      When memory is plentiful, make Speed Call list number the same as the persons
      DN. Need to increase MSCL in LD17 Find a "Controller" in LD81 by: REQ:LST,
      FEAT:SCC, then the Speed List Number 
      
      Allow Restricted Sets to Dial Certain Long Distance Numbers. 
      ============================================================
      Add the numbers to a System Speed Call List. Assign an NCOS to the "List"
      that replaces the users NCOS during the call. Alternate: Add the suffix of
      the telephone number to an ARRN list in the prefixes RLI. This will point
      only that number to a new RLI with a lower (or higher if you choose) FRL.
      Look up ARRN in LD86

      1 Single LineTelephone, 3 DNs, 3 Users, 3 Mailboxes? How? 
      =========================================================
      Create one 2500 set with one of the three DNs. Create 2 Phantom TNs, each one
      with a new DN and DCFW each of them to the 2500 sets DN (from above) Add the
      three mailboxesnow any of the three numbers will ring the one set, but
      messages will be separated!
      
      Change An NCOS After Hours
      ==========================
      Here's an excerpt from the LD86 ESN data block that has NCOS 3 & 4 change to
      NCOS 2 after 4:30PM and all day on weekends

           <snip>
      
      Oops..the Console Went Into NITE...During the DAY! 
      ==================================================
      Use NITE entries that are based on "Time of Day". See Night Service in
      Features Book If the console goes into NITE during the day, send them to
      either a set of DNs next to the console, or a voice menu/thru-dialer
      explaining that there are "technical difficulties". After hours, NITE calls
      goes to where they should.
      
      Just Two Security Tricks 
      ========================
      Create SPNs in BARS of: 000 thru 009 and create a Route List Block for them
      with LTER=YES  Now when Phreakers ask for extn 9000, they get nobody. Use the
      FLEN entry on SPNs 0, 00, 011 so that nobody can transfer a caller to 9011,
      90, etc.
      
      Break Into Meridian Mailbox? 
      ============================
      Simply make the mailbox "Auto-logon". For remote access, add their DN to your
      set. Convenient if you need to access an employees mailbox without changing
      their password. Useful for modifying greetings of an absent employees or
      allowing a temporary employee access to a mailbox without divulging the
      regular employees password.
      
      Tracing Phone Calls 
      ===================
      TRAC 0 XXXX (X=extension) 
      TRAC l s c u 
      TRAC l s c u DEV (Adds BARS info) 
      TRAT 0 X (X=Console number) 
      TRAD (see book, traces T1 channels) 
      ENTC (see book, traces TN continuously - up to 3 TNs at a time ! ) 
      
      Forgot your M3000 Directory Password? 
      =====================================
           LD32 
           CPWD l s c u 
      
      Another Idea 
      ============
      Use a PC to log into your PBX, then activate the "capture file". Now run a
      TNB and keep it as a file rather than on paper. If your TNB file is large,
      try a high power text editor, which can open even 20meg files in seconds.
      Search the Internet "Text Editor" Keep copies so you can go back and see how
      a set was programmed when you out it by mistake. 
      
      */
      
      Using the above information you could sucessfully do the following:
      
      a) Setup your own trunk configurations that allow outgoing calls.
      b) Reset lines and trunks, reconfugure lines and trunks.
      c) Set an internal extension(s) to share the same multiplexed trunk as you
         so you can effectivly listen in on any incomming/outgoing phone call
         made on that extension.
      d) Set up calls that don't exist with no trunk assignment.
      e) Set any users voicemail box with auto-logon paremters temporarily.
      f) Close down the entire network
      g) Set every phone in the company to ring forever...
      h) Re-route incomming/outgoing trunk calls to any destination.
      i) Park your own incomming line as "on console" so you can answer calls made
         to a pre-set extension.
      j) Make yourself the company oprtator.
      k) Trace phonecalls, audit logs etc.
      l) Set all trunks to loopback on one another.
      m) Anything you want?
      
      Thats just a few ideas. But before you do ANYTHING, you should be aware that
      anything you do could have devestating impact on the companys phone switch.
      For example, say you accidently commanded the system to shut down.. You would
      effectivly be killing 6000+ peoples phone lines, which would yield colosal
      financial burden/loss onto the company. Generaly I'm just saying, be nice..
      Just because you have the power to do such things, it doesnt mean you have to
      do it. :)
      
      A final note: In the aftermath of obtaining access to a merdian switch, it is
      generaly advisable to erase all trace of you ever being on there. This can
      be achived by reseting trunk audit logs, and erasing any log of your incoming
      trunk setups. Therefore, if the real admin decided to track what was going on
      he/she would get nowhere because the lines you used to initially call into
      the system DO NOT EXIST. Its just a case of using your imagination. Don't be
      destructive, Don't alter anything that would be noticed, Generally don't be
      a f00l.. Thats the end of this file, I hope you enjoed it. Take it easy.

      Software Pirates 11/03/99 

      SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1999 NOV 3 (Newsbytes) -- By Sherman 
      Fridman, Newsbytes. Two alleged software pirates are about to walk the 
      judicial plank as a result of a Federal indictment that was announced 
      today. 

      Ralph Gussie Sumlin, Jr. and Elizabeth Jean Sumlin, both of Farmington, 
      W.Va., were charged in one-count indictments alleging that they willfully 
      infringed on copyrights owned by Adobe Systems Inc. [NASDAQ:ADBE]. The 
      indictments said that the copyright violations occurred when the Sumlins 
      attempted to auction what is believed to be pirated Adobe software on 
      eBay's online auction site. 

      In an announcement made by Adobe Systems after the indictments were handed 
      out, Batur Oktay, corporate counsel for Adobe is reported to have said, 
      "Based on our investigations, we have found that the vast majority of 
      Adobe software sold on these sites is pirated." He also said that, "Adobe 
      will continue its aggressive campaign against Internet piracy." 

      Adobe Systems reportedly worked in close collaboration with the FBI, 
      Postal Inspection Service, and the Fairmont, Calif., police department in 
      this case. 

      In an ongoing effort to enforce copyright compliance, Adobe has partnered 
      with anti-piracy organizations such as The Business Software Alliance 
      (BSA) and the Software Publisher's Association (SPA) to investigate and 
      sue end-users and resellers of pirated software. 

      In addition, Adobe is encouraging consumers to report sellers of 
      counterfeit Adobe products, and has established the e-mail address 
      piracy@adobe.com for this purpose.

      WASHINGTON -- So far, as many as 23 countries are believed to have the 
      capacity to engage in state-sponsored, surreptitious electronic raids. 
      Among the most sophisticated: India, Syria and Iran, experts say. Some 
      nations already have taken the leap: Indonesia: Its government in January 
      was identified as being behind a coordinated assault on Ireland's Internet 
      service provider, which hosted a Web site advocating independence for the 
      province of East Timor. Russia: Hackers working for the Russian government 
      targeted Pentagon computer networks between January and May, apparently in 
      search of naval codes and missile guidance data. Pentagon officials say 
      the attacks failed to penetrate classified systems. China: It launched an 
      assault an array of U.S. government Web sites, including those of the 
      departments of Energy and Interior and the White House's public site, 
      which was knocked out of commission three times. These occurred after a 
      U.S. bomb accidentally struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 
      during the conflict with Yugoslavia. The assault was triggered by outraged 
      Chinese government operatives, apparently letting their emotions get the 
      better of them. They lobbed a fusillade of electrons but, by doing so, 
      also revealed an astonishing 3,000 to 4,000 "back doors" into U.S. 
      computer systems that had been created by China, according to Jay 
      Valentine, head of Infoglide Corp., an Austin, Texas, company that 
      investigates computer security breaches for the U.S. government. Valentine 
      estimates that number of secret passages amounts to only about 5 percent 
      of those China has managed to establish in both government and private 
      industry systems. Even more sobering is the public discussion now going on 
      within China's top military leadership circles about the desirability of 
      developing a "dirty war" strategy, in which computer viruses would be used 
      against the West. Revelations such as these are adding urgency to the 
      Pentagon's efforts to fortify its systems against incursions and cobble 
      together a war-fighting doctrine to guide its own conduct of cyber combat. 
      Defense leaders have designated the U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs,
      Colo., as the headquarters for both offensive and defensive cyber war, 
      although it won't come online until next October.

      Probe into hack at S'pore Govt website 

      THE National Computer Board is investigating Sunday's possible hacking 
      into the Singapore Government website. 

      Asked about the incident yesterday, Minister for Communications and 
      Information Yeo Cheow Tong said the incident showed the risk all countries 
      face. 

      He said that adding safeguards may prove to be a temporary solution. 

      "Each time you come up with some safeguards, we find that somebody else 
      will come up with an equally innovative way to bypass our safeguards. 

      "It's a continuing process we have to cope with," he said. 

      He was speaking to reporters after his keynote address at the trade show, 
      Sapphire '99 Singapore. 

      In Sunday's incident, the contents of the page were reportedly removed and 
      replaced with a message from a hacker. 

      This was temporary and checks showed that the site was back to normal on 
      Sunday itself. 

      The hacker is said to be a foreigner and the National Computer Board 
      yesterday said that the law here treated foreign hackers no different from 
      local ones. 

      It said: "Regardless of the nationalities of the alleged hackers, the 
      Singapore police will work closely with their foreign counterparts to

      Four US '.mil' Web Sites Invaded By Cracker Group 
   
      By Bob Woods, Newsbytes
      WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 
      02 Nov 1999, 1:12 PM CST

      A group of hackers - more accurately known as "crackers" - hit at least 
      four US military Web sites sometime on Monday, according to a Web site 
      that tracks such infiltrations. As Web site crackings go, though, three of 
      the four invasions were relatively benign. 

      The group "hV2k" claimed responsibility for the invasions, through text 
      left behind at each site, according to copies or "mirrors" of the sites 
      stored at Attrition.org. 

      HV2k completely replaced the framed main page at the Navy Crane Center's 
      (http://ncc.navfac.navy.mil ) Web site with the message, "Hi Mr DOD Admin, 
      guess what.. YER SEKURITY SUCKS, oh and hV2k owns you. *kiss*" 

      The group's infiltration of the AEGIS Training and Readiness Center 
      Detachment in Norfolk, Va. (http://www.norfolk.atrc.navy.mil ) and the 
      Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, Japan (http://www.iwakuni.usmc.mil ) 
      were not as bold. Neither page was greatly altered, save for a line at the 
      bottom of each site. The note at the Marine Corps site said, "Hi kids, 
      SLiPY of hV2k here just bitching about NT and how bad it sucks. Greets to 
      NukeLear and Bleeding Angel." And "hi hV2k here" was left by the 
      infiltrators at the AEGIS site. 

      As of 1:40 PM EST today, the Iwakuni Web site was down, according to an 
      automatically generated prompt at the site. 

      HV2k's cracking of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) 
      at Webster Field, Md. (http://www.webster.webfld.navy.mil ) was much more 
      subtle. The group inserted the message, "Hi! kiddies, no its not santa, 
      its me, SliPY. hV2k" as black text on an otherwise undefaced page that has 
      a black background. The message can be seen only if the page source is 
      viewed through the Web browser, or if the bottom of the page where the 
      text is located is highlighted. 

      US military forces were not alone in facing hV2k's wrath. The official Web 
      site of Canada's Department of National Defense and the Canadian Forces 
      (http://www.dnd.ca ) was also defaced by the group sometime Monday. The 
      group took the minimalist approach with this infiltration, simply writing 
      at the bottom of the site's main page, "hi slipy and hv2k own."

35.0  Emergency FidNet Funding Canceled 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by Evilwench 
      After the the House Appropriations Committee eliminated
      funding for the proposed Federal Intrusion Detection
      surveillance system (FIDNet), the White House found
      other funding through a $611 million mid-year fiscal 2000
      budget amendment. Now less than one week before the
      Clinton Administration's proposed network security plan
      is slated to be unveiled, Congress has refused the
      request to provide the $39 million to fund the project.
      The proposed FIDNet system will be run by the General
      Services Administration who hopes that supplemental
      funding for FIDNet will be found by January but will go
      ahead with the plan regardless if specific money is
      allocated.

      DAILY BRIEFING

      Congress refuses to fund
      security network

      By Drew Clark, National Journal's Technology Daily

      Less than one week before the Clinton Administration's
      proposed network security plan is slated to be unveiled and
      discussed, Congress has refused a last-minute request to
      provide $39 million in fundsincluding $8.4 million for the
      controversial Federal Intrusion Detection Network
      (FIDNet)until at least January. 

      Although House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas,
      has raised a number of questions about the privacy implications
      of FIDNet, the principal objection seems to be money. And
      with the House unwilling to dip into other sources to
      accommodate the administration's computer security proposal,
      the lack of funding could further delay the full-scale rollout of
      critical infrastructure plans. 

      "The request came as an amendment to the Treasury-Postal
      appropriations bill after it had been signed into law," said John
      Scofield, a spokesman for House Appropriations Committee
      Chairman C.W. "Bill" Young, R-FL. "We didn't have time to
      give it consideration and will look at it next year." 

      The administration had proposed funding the programs by
      using the counter-terrorism fund of the Department of Justice,
      Scofield said. But he said a Department of Justice program
      "shouldn't be used as a funding mechanism for something that is
      administration wide." 

      Besides money for FIDNet, the request included $17 million
      for a program to train and recruit students in cyber-security; $2
      million for the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export
      Administration to support Information Sharing and Assessment
      Centers (ISACs), a public-private partnership to protect
      critical infrastructure; $5 million for computer security projects
      to be run by the National Institute of Standards and
      Technology; and $7 million for the Department of Treasury to
      help federal agencies establish public key infrastructures to
      conduct electronic transactions. 

      Officials at the General Services Administration said they were
      prepared to continue bare-bones funding for FIDNet out of
      operating revenuesomething they have done for the related
      Federal Computer Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC),
      a program the agency inherited from the Department of
      Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology
      last year. The agency hopes to that supplemental funding for
      FIDNet will be found by January. 

      Without funding, "we can go ahead with the minimum activity
      as we have for the last several months," said Sallie McDonald,
      deputy assistant commissioner at GSA's office of information
      security. 

      The administration's critical infrastructure plan is expected to be
      unveiled at a conference next Tuesday. But a pre-release
      summit involving officials from industry, government, and
      privacy advocates is planned for Thursday at the State
      Department, said a panelist for the event.

      Cyberattacks against DOD up 300 percent this
      year

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      Atlantic City -- The number of cyberattacks reported this year against the
      Defense Department's information networks has more than tripled compared
      with last year, according to the director of the Defense Information Systems
      Agency.

      The number of reported cyberattacks or unauthorized intrusions into DOD
      networks and systems skyrocketed from 5,844 in 1998 to 18,433 so far
      during 1999, according to Lt. Gen. David Kelley, director of DISA and
      manager of the National Communications System. Because not all attacks and
      intrusions are detected or reported by local system administrators and security
      officials, that number could be significantly higher.

      Speaking on Nov. 1 at the MILCOM 1999 conference, a three-day
      symposium focusing in military communications issues in the 21st century,
      Kelley said a look at the past five years indicates that cybersecurity and
      cyberwarfare is a "growth industry." According to Kelley, DOD organizations
      in 1994 reported only 225 attacks or unauthorized network intrusions --
      roughly 1 percent of the number reported so far in 1999.

      "We need smarter systems that can help heal themselves," Kelley said,
      outlining his ideas for a departmentwide information assurance program.
      "Hope is not a strategy," he said. "With 100 percent certainty, this nation will
      face an information attack...[and] a serious one. We've got to get prepared."

      A sustained and coordinated intrusion into DOD networks that took place
      between January and March remains under investigation by the FBI [FCW,
      March 8]. The high-profile incident has led investigators to believe the hackers
      launched their attack using systems residing in Russia. However, no evidence
      has been released that indicates the Russian government in the attack.

      U.S. vulnerable to cyber attacks, White House official says

      WASHINGTON (November 4, 1999 9:50 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
      Reliance on the Internet has made the nation vulnerable to attacks by 
      terrorists who strike through computers rather than with bombs or bullets, 
      a White House security adviser said Thursday. 

      "We could wake one morning and find a city, or a sector of the country, or 
      the whole country have an electric power problem, a transportation problem 
      or a telecommunication problem because there was a surprise attack using       
      information warfare," said Richard Clarke, the National Security Council 
      adviser who heads counterterrorism efforts. 

      Clarke, speaking at a cyberthreat summit, said most Americans fail to 
      realize how dependent they have become on computers - not only at home or 
      at the office, but also to run their electricity, telephone, 
      transportation and other       infrastructure systems. Clarke compared the 
      reliance to former drug addicts enrolled in a recovery program. 

      "We need to take a lesson from that - at least they know they have a 
      dependency problem. Many of you are still in denial," he told his audience 
      during his keynote address. "Many people in the United States are still in 
      denial." 

      The summit, intended to raise awareness about computer security awareness, 
      follows a string of electronic attacks launched against federal government 
      Web sites, including those run by the White House, the Senate, the FBI and 
      the       U.S. Army's main Internet site. 

      Last month, the head of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection 
      Center testified before Congress about the agency's struggle to keep up 
      its battle against threats posed by computer-savvy terrorists and hackers 
      trying to break       into the government's most sensitive data networks. 

      And, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
      released a report warning that computer systems at the Defense Department, 
      law enforcement and private industries are at risk because of poor 
      management and       lax oversight. 

      Clarke said the nation's frenzy over the Y2K computer bug has made it even 
      more vulnerable to cyber attacks. He said technicians hired to make a 
      company's computer system Y2K compliant could easily slip "a little Trojan 
      horse or       malicious code" into the system instead. 

      Clarke's warning echoed one issued by Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, during 
      a recent speech at the National Press Club. Bennett, chairman of the 
      Senate's Year 2000 Committee, said he wouldn't be surprised to see his 
      panel continue       work next year on problems uncovered by the Y2K bug - 
      mainly security and reliability. 

      "We expect that (terrorists) will attempt to use Y2K as a cover for 
      putting some kind of attack into a vulnerable place," Bennett said. "That 
      is, when a Y2K solution goes in, they will fly underneath that with an 
      attack of their own that       will shut the system down and then you 
      won't know whether the system shutdown was because of a terrorists attack 
      or because of a Y2K accident." 

      Clarke said the government has taken numerous steps to counter potential 
      cyber attacks, including stepping up intelligence efforts, improving 
      systems to detect intrusions and working with the private industries to 
      come up with solutions.

      Moscow Said To Withhold Full Help On Cyber-Blitz

                                           Updated 3:42 PM ET November 4, 1999
    
      By Jim Wolf
    
      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian authorities have withheld full cooperation 
      in a multinational probe of computer heists from sensitive Defense 
      Department and other U.S. networks, a top National Security Agency 
      official said.

      "They haven't been fully forthcoming about what's happened on the Net," 
      John Nagengast, assistant deputy director for information systems 
      security, said late Wednesday.

      U.S. authorities are not yet sure whether electronic back doors may have 
      been secretly crafted as part of the intrusions dubbed Moonlight Maze, he 
      said in an interview with Reuters.

      "Did they leave behind a port for future access?" Nagengast asked 
      rhetorically. "There's no conclusion you can draw and say 'It's finished. 
      It's over'."

      Nagengast spoke after outlining cyber threats to the Overseas Security 
      Advisory Council, a State Department-led group that feeds security-related 
      information to more than 1,700 U.S. companies with overseas interests.

      U.S. government computer experts have traced the Moonlight Maze blitz to 
      Internet service providers linked to Russia's Academy of Sciences, a 
      government-funded group involved in research projects with military and       
      civilian applications.

      "About the furthest I can go is to say the intrusions appear to originate 
      in Russia," Michael Vatis, the top U.S. "cyber cop" told Congress last 
      month in the first public rundown on the investigation by an executive 
      branch       official.

      Vatis, who heads the FBI-led National Infrastructure Protection Center, 
      said intruders had stolen "unclassified but still-sensitive information 
      about essentially defense technical research matters."

      Nagengast said Vatis had gone to Russia to pursue the case but had come 
      back without having been able to obtain all the records he would have 
      liked to help trace the culprits.

      "Some of the feedback we've gotten is 'we just don't have good audit logs 
      -- so we don't know where these things could have come from'," Nagengast 
      said, paraphrasing the Russian response.

      A spokeswoman for Vatis declined comment.

      Nagengast said it was premature to conclude that the cyber blitz, first 
      detected in March 1998, was carried out by anyone in Russia just because 
      it was routed through a given Internet service provider.

      "Was this a kiddie training exercise" by the Russian Academy of Sciences?, 
      Nagengast said rhetorically. "Nobody knows at this point in time," he 
      said. He added that the decline of known Moonlight Maze attacks could       
      mean the intruders were "getting smarter and harder to see" or that they 
      had "lost interest."

      Michael Peters, the National Security Agency's technical director for 
      operations, readiness and assessments, told the meeting on cyber threats 
      that a multinational "hacking" group called the "Enforcers" might be 
      involved in       the intrusions.

      He said the Enforcers counted members from the United States, Israel, 
      Australia, Brazil and Russia. The group first made itself known when the 
      U.S. government began to prosecute two youths from California for a series       
      of February, 1998, cyber break-ins to Defense Department systems.

      Nagengast said some of the Moonlight Maze "hacks" had come through 
      computer "hosts" in Britain. "And of course, they (the British) are fully 
      cooperative with us."

      The National Security Agency is the Pentagon arm responsible for the 
      computer security of U.S. national security organizations. The most costly 
      and secretive intelligence agency, it eavesdrops on global communications       
      and provides a steady stream of intercepted electronic data on topics of 
      interest to the U.S. government.

      Vatis's organization -- the infrastructure protection center at the FBI -- 
      leads the U.S. effort to prevent, detect and prosecute cyber crime.

      Sen. Robert Bennett, who has received classified briefings on "information 
      warfare" as chairman of the special committee on the Year 2000 problem, 
      told Reuters in an interview last month the intruders had vacuumed up       
      vast amounts of publicly available data.

      Susan Hansen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Thursday that the Defense 
      Department knew of no classified information that had been jeopardized in 
      the Moonlight Maze intrusions.

      The Internet's 'Living Treasure' 
      by Leander Kahney 
      
      2:15 p.m. 2.Nov.1999 PST 
      Whenever you read about an egregious invasion of consumer privacy on the 
      Internet, one name keeps popping up: Richard Smith. 

      Smith fingered the author of the Melissa virus. He uncovered Microsoft's 
      suspicious registration practices, and he discovered the presence of 
      unique identifying numbers in the majority of digital documents. This 
      week, he revealed       RealNetworks' sneaky data-gathering practices. 

      Smith has been at the center of half-a-dozen of the biggest technology 
      stories this summer -- stories reported around the globe. 

      And he does it for love, not money. 

      "The man's a living, national treasure for the Internet age," said privacy 
      advocate Jason Catlett, founder of Junkbusters. "He's doing wonderful 
      things. Richard's not a privacy zealot. He wants to find the consequences 
      of things. 

      "He's independent of money and he's independent of politics," Catlett 
      said. "He's very good at thinking through intrusive data gathering. If 
      there were a dozen people like him, the Internet would be a very different 
      place." 

      A 45-year-old veteran programmer, Smith retired a couple of months ago 
      from Phar Lap, the software company he helped build and still owns but no 
      longer runs. 

      He started looking at Internet security issues as a hobby about three 
      years ago, uncovering bugs and security holes in email clients and 
      browsers. 

      A year ago he turned his attention to privacy on the Internet. 

      "We are moving our lives more and more onto the Internet and it's very 
      good at watching what we do," Smith said from his home in Brookline, 
      Massachusetts, where he lives with his wife. "It's like a VCR recording 
      your whole life. It can       easily be rewound." 

      Smith said he's worried that the lack of Internet privacy is a tremendous 
      boon for the direct marketing industry and that personal data will come 
      back to haunt consumers in legal proceedings. 

      For example, Smith noted that Newt Gingrich's divorce lawyers are trying 
      to keep purportedly sensitive emails out of the hands of his wife's 
      lawyers. In a separate instance, a court ruled this week that telephone 
      companies could sell       customers' telephone logs to direct marketers, 
      who can mine the data to determine individual consumer preferences. 

      "We're going to get more and more junk mail," he said. "The noise level is 
      going to go up and up. Maybe we'll get used to it, but I doubt it." 

      Smith tapped into the issue of RealNetwork's underhanded data gathering 
      practices while looking for material for a speech. He wanted something 
      fresh to talk about and remembered an inconclusive report he'd read in an 
      April edition of       the Seattle Weekly about RealNetworks using secret 
      serial numbers. He downloaded RealJukebox and loaded up a piece of 
      software, called a packet sniffer, that decodes the stream of information 
      his computer sent out over the Internet. 

      The first thing he noticed was that every time he used it to play a CD, 
      the software sent the CD's title and playlist to RealNetworks. He also 
      noticed that it encrypted some information, so he enlisted a friend in 
      Australia to break the       code and unlock the data. It turned out to be 
      a GUID, or unique identifying number, that can be used to identify who is 
      using the software as effectively as a Social Security number. 

      Smith said the whole thing took about half an hour, and that most of the 
      time was spent figuring out how to use the RealJukebox software. 

      He's started looking at other user-monitoring systems. For example, he 
      said he's discovered that some junk email, when read, secretly sends out 
      information about the user. Through banner ads, many high-profile Web 
      sites are sending       confidential user registration information to 
      direct marketers without even knowing it. 

      Smith looks mainly at popular software "so when it hits the press people 
      say 'that affects me. I use that product.'" 

      He does it for fun and out of curiosity, he said, though he's starting to 
      "pre-consult" for some of the companies he's investigating, opening up the 
      possibility of turning his hobby into a commercial enterprise. 

      Smith's life hasn't changed much in light of all the publicity he's 
      generated. 

      "I talk to a lot of people I hadn't known before," he said. "I have a 
      different crowd of people I go around with now." 

      When he discovers a dodgy practice, Smith said the first thing he does is 
      inform the company before writing it up for his Web site. 

      Sometimes he tells the press before the company. At least, that's what 
      Richard Purcell, the man in charge of Microsoft's data gathering policies, 
      says. 

      "It would be nice to answer an inquiry before doing it in a public forum," 
      Purcell said. "This is what we call fairness." 

      Although he may have caused Microsoft some embarrassing public relations 
      headaches, Purcell said he bears no malice toward Smith. In fact, Purcell 
      invited him up to Redmond afterwards to meet a number of the company's 
      product       people and flesh out some outstanding privacy issues. 

      "He's a very talented technologist," Purcell said. "I like him."

      National Defence Internet site falls prey to attack by hacker
      No sensitive information revealed
      despite security breach, DND says

      Wednesday, November 3, 1999

      Toronto -- Computer hackers broke into the Department of National Defence 
      Web site on Monday night, the latest in a recent series of security 
      breaches on federal, provincial and municipal Web sites in Canada.

      DND spokesman Captain André Berdais said the attack was the first major 
      hacking incident on the department's Web site, and that the National 
      Investigative Service is trying to track down who breached the site -- and 
      how they did it.

      "We're dealing with this as if it's an act of vandalism," Capt. Berdais 
      said.

      He said the breach occurred at about 6 p.m. Monday evening, and that an 
      incident-response team discovered the breach and shut down the site at 
      about 8 p.m.

      "There was no sensitive information [accessed]," he said. "What was 
      breached was our Web site that passes information to the public. None of 
      the other internal computer systems have been hit."

      This isn't the first time the DND's Web security policies have been the 
      subject of controversy. In September, it was discovered that the resumés 
      of at least five former and current eavesdroppers had been posted on its 
      site, including detailed information about the classified equipment they 
      used and the restricted areas they had access to.

      Monday's breach, however, represents the first time a hacker was able to 
      access and manipulate the department's Web site.

      Similar attacks have occurred recently on provincial and municipal 
      government Web sites. The City of Mississauga and Peel Board of Education 
      sites were hacked last week, and in August the Web site of Ontario's 
      Ministry of Northern Development and Mines was breached and various 
      network passwords were stolen.

      In the latter case, the culprit littered the site with South Park cartoon 
      graffiti and warned the government of its security flaw -- no major 
      information was taken or damage done.

      Still, such breaches illustrate how easy it is for hackers to meddle with 
      computer systems -- even those belonging to the federal department in 
      charge of the nation's security -- and how seemingly harmless acts of 
      vandalism can escalate into calculated terrorism.

      The Canadian Security Intelligence Service issued a report in August 
      warning that cyberterrorism and Internet vandalism are becoming a major 
      concern for societies that depend on computer-based communications.

      Dave Cosgrave, an Internet expert with the Alliance for Converging 
      Technologies in Toronto, said governments around the world are at the 
      stage of weighing the efficiencies and cost savings associated with the 
      Internet with the potential risks of going on-line.

      "Certainly, the more you open up government services and information to 
      on-line avenues, [the more] you expose yourself to risk," he said. "But I 
      don't think there's a compelling argument in telling governments to sit 
      back and wait."

      Canada has been moving aggressively to bring more public services to the 
      Internet.

      For example, Canada Post Corp. recently launched an electronic post office 
      to carry the nation's bills, documents and letters in digital form over 
      the Internet. A successful breach of that site might conceivably give a 
      hacker instant access to the nation's mail system.

      "I'm not going to say it doesn't bother us, but it's part of business when 
      you have business on the Internet," Capt. Berdais said. "Like everything 
      else in the military, there's lessons learned from any type of incident . 
      . . because it's the Internet, it's not unexpected. And we do have 
      measures to deal with it."

      An investigation into the latest attack on South Africa's
      Statistics web site has revealed that the assault
      originated from a dial-up user in the US in the early
      hours of Wednesday morning. This is the second time in
      two months the site has been defaced, despite the fact
      that a private company was called in to provide a

      Statistics website hacked again despite surveillance

      Johannesburg - An investigation into the latest attack on Statistics
      SA's website has revealed that the hack originated from a dial-up
      user in the US in the early hours of yesterday morning.
 
      This is the second time the website has been hacked into in two
      months, despite Statistics SA contracting a private sector company
      to provide a firewall and surveillance.
 
      Statistics SA head Mark Orkin said: "This hack is completely
      unrelated to the previous one a few weeks ago."
 
      An intrusion detection signal was recorded, but before it was picked
      up the hacker managed to bypass the administrative protection on
      the server." While investigating the hack, it was discovered that
      government sites worldwide are broken into at least 200 times a
      day. The logs of government websites in SA show these are hacked
      into two to three times a day.
 
      There was a trade-off between security and accessibility, Orkin
      said. "We need to offer convenient access for hundreds of genuine
      visits daily, so we have tried to increase security without obstructing
      visitors."
 
      The organisation is investigating extra security and will keep the
      website disconnected from its core systems. The site is hosted on a
      stand-alone server "so no core databases or archives were
      affected".

      PART I (Introduction to BT managment on the PSTN)
      
      Introduction
      
      The technology within the network has advanced through digitalisation of
      both transmission and switching, and the introduction of computer contolled
      network elements. The greater reliability of this technology and the ability
      to manage and configure the elements remotely has created new opportunities
      for efficiant managment of the network.
      
      These opotunitys have been translated into a vision for the future operation
      and managment of the network, initially through the Network Administration
      Task Force (NATF) and subseqent refinements in terms of architecture (Network
      Managment Architecture), and process (Strategic Systems Plan (SSP)).
      
      THE VISI0N
      
      The vision can be summerised as:
      
      -+ end-to-end network managment
      -+ functioncal coverage of the whole network life cycle
      -+ fully integrated functionality
      -+ high levels of automation/decision support
      -+ conformant to architectual objectives:
              a) network managment hierarchy
              b) co-operative network architecture
              c) open systems platform
      
      End-to-End managment
      
      It is essential to be able to manage networks made up of elements from
      different vendors and different generations of equipment in a consistant
      manner, so that the network can be viewed as a complete entity which provides
      a managed service platform.
      
      Whole Life Cycle
      
      Networks and services must be managhed from 'cradle to grave' (figure 1),
      covering:
      
      -+ forecasting
      -+ requirments analysis
      -+ detailed dimensioning and project planning
      -+ data building
      -+ installation and commisioning
      -+ maintenance/billing/traffic managment
      -+ repair
      -+ performance
      -+ enhancment/withdrawal

      Hands free operation
      
      It is essensial to give network managers a high level of automation in order
      to eneable them to cope with the levels of complexity involved, vast amounts
      of data, apparently random nature of problems, and the need for speed,
      accuracy and consistancy in decision making. This requires:
      
      -+ incidents to be analyised automatically with the manager's concurance
         being sought to the solution offered;
      
      -+ automatic restoration of service to be achived whenever possible;
      
      -+ jobs depached to the workforce based on an optimum approach to jeopardy,
         costs, tactics and company image.
      
      -+ customers notification of service affected generated automaticaly to the
         approproate customer-facing unit; and
      
      -+ performanace statistics kept and analysed on all key proccesses.
      
      
      Development challenges
      
      The challenge for the system developers is to be responsive and meet new
      requirments quickly, while producing enduring systems which fit within an
      integrated set-the jigsaw-- the whole evolving towards the Network
      Administration Implementation Program (NAIP) and SSP vision in a cost
      effective manner.
      
      The developers have to move from a possision of well over 200 systems, most
      of which do not interwork, and many of which no longer offer all the
      essensial fucnctions, to a set of around 40 fully integrated high
      functionality key systems.
      
      Functions must be brought into line with the required buisness proccesses and
      must evolve to match the demands of new network technologys, for instance,
      planning rules for fibre systems must be continually reviwed to encompass
      increasing capacities and repeaterless operation.
      
      Systems must also take account of the changing operational organaisations
      and procedures, framework which can evolve without damaging the software
      investment already made. Solutions have to be achived within four planes of
      change as illustrated in figure 2.

      PART II (Adminstration of BT Network layers) ohday.
      
      -+ Interface Architecture
      
      The interface architecture provides the means to link all the pieces of the
      jigsaw together. By a mix of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) products and
      pragmatic proprietry products, (for example, SNA, DECNET), a communications
      infastructure will be deployed to connect users to systems, systems to other
      systems for information sharing, and systems to the network elements they are
      managing. Key standards for these interfaces are being defined in the Co-
      Operative Networking Architecture (CNA-M) prgramme.
      
      -+ Data Architecture
      
      Data architecture offers the ability to standardise what the processes need
      to talk about. Defining the structure and format of the key information
      items provides a common currency which may be shared by the complete family
      of support systems. The object orientated style of the CNA-Managment
      communications protocols will ofrce the standardisation of objects as well
      as simple data structures in the CNA-M programme and external standards
      bodies like ISO, CCITT and the OSI Network Managment Forum.
      
      -+ System (Computing) Architecture
      
      The system architecture defines how a particular system is constructed,
      rather than the fucntional role it plays within the jigsaw. This deals with
      the following main conponments.
      
      -+ computer hardware
      -+ operating system
      -+ database managment system
      -+ transaction proccessing
      -+ communications drivers
      -+ man -- machine interfacing (MMI), and
      -+ application programming interface (API).
      
      There is a drive by the computing industry to create standard open interfaces
      to these elements, based on UNIX/POSIX and X Open standards to produce the
      open platform. The system developers are also driving towards reusable sub-
      functions and utilities. These two initiiatives are being bought together
      in the Generic Systems Architecture (GSA).
      
      -+ Integration and evolution
      
      SSP, ONA-M, Generic Systems Architecture and the Network Control Architecture
      Board (NCAB) 5 year vision for support systems evolution have all
      contibuted to creating a clear picture of how support systems will look in
      the future. It is important, however, that a very pragmatic approach is taken
      to realising this vision.
      
      -+ SWITCH MANAGMENT
      
      BT switch managment is carried out by the OMC (Operations Maintanace
      Center) for local exchanges and the operations and maintanance unit support
      system (OMUSS) (an OMC derivative) for trunk exchanges. This system has
      clocked up over 3000 system months of reliable service sinse its introduction
      n 1984. As the first majour network managment system, it has paved the way
      for the NACC/NOU structure.

      The system is based on a VAX/VMS platform with Oracle relational database,
      its pwn basic forms/menus man --machine interface and X.25/V.24
      communications drivers. The Exchange interfaces are conrolled through
      flexable data-driven translators and the basic structure of the system is
      highly modular. The priority evolution steps for OMC are:
      
      -+ interoperability with CSS, the transmission network survailance (TNS)
         system and workforce managment (NOMS2)
      -+ additional exchange interfaces for advanced services unit (ASU) etc.,
      -+ adoption of advanced workstation (NMW2) man --machine interfacing
      -+ donation of functions to Generic Event Managment (GEMS).
      
      
      -+ Transmission Managment
      
      The transmission monitoring system (TMS) provides a comprehensive survailence
      system for the transmission aspects of the network. While the OMC manages a
      smaller set of complex network elements, the TMS faces the challenge of
      collecting, collating and displaying information from a vast array of
      physically dispersed conponments. After field-trial stages and recent
      product trials in London, the TMS is now being rolled out into the three
      pilot NOU catchment areas. The major TNS functions are:
      
      -+ alarm reception, display, filing, retrival and archiving
      -+ alarm association and comparason;
      -+ performance data proccessing and display
      -+ access to other systems (for example, the junction network system (JNS)
         database)).
      
      
      -+ Local Access Managment
      
      The flexible access system (FAS) is a system which has been developed to
      manage fibre in the local loop. Systems have been installed for the City
      Fibre Network and Docklands. The support system, the service access control
      center (SACC), once more shares a common lineage and technology platform with
      OMC combined with the ICENI database produced by NMD, and used as an
      element in the service desk and facilies managment systems. FAS was the first
      system to attempt to adopt the network managment hierarchy, with well
      defined interfaces between the service access control center (SACC) (network
      level controller) and element managers developed by equipment supplyers. It
      also adopted the network managment workstation (NMW1) to remove a multitude
      of various terminals.
      
      Until the future of the FAS is fully determined, the SACC will not be
      enhanced and evolved. However, the structure of future advanced local access
      managment is being considered based on experience of FAS, LLOFT (the local
      loop optical fibre trial) and cable TV managment.
      
      
      -+ Data managment and performance analysis
      
      The digital exchange support system (DESS) consists of many applications
      which are grouped together under a single code name. Some of the functions
      these appications perform are:
      
      -+ data build for new exchanges and major upgrades
      -+ generic network performance statistics by analysiing the large volume of
         data generated bt switches
      -+ providing national reference source for charging information, and
         associated validation tools to ensure charging integrety
      -+ provding a database and tracking mechanism for all exchange insident
         reports; and
      -+ a register of the hardware and software build levels for all exchanges in
         the network.
      
      DESS is a major system which runs on the largest VAX cluster configurations
      in the world. It supports a population of 2000 users, 140 of which may be
      similtaniously logged into the system. A typical daily workload for DESS
      would be analysing 1-4 Gigs of exchange generated data, producing 35
      thousand pages of printout, and writing or reading 1500 exchange cartridges.

      quick disclaimer: I do not encourage any of the information provided in this
      file. I, or f41th cannot be held responcerble for your use of the information
      provided in this article, it has been provided for informational purposes

      (introduction)
      
      CallerID (CID) or CND (Calling Number Delivery), is an extension to the
      widley used ANI (Automatic Number Identification) system. The telcos use ANI
      as a means for billing information when you make a toll-call, however dispite
      what alot of people think, ANI is not used as part of the CID system, it was
      the first system used to allow the recieving party know who was calling and
      was widely used before the advent of the SS7 telephony protocol, but sinse
      the implementation of SS7 CID/CND has become popular, both in residential
      subscriber loops, and commercial lines. In this file I am going to show how
      the CID/CND system works, specific to different *bell specifications aswell
      as the differences in other countrys, such as the UK. Before we go any
      further, you need to know the basics of the *bell CID protocol;
      
      CID information (data) is transmitted on the subscriber loop using a method
      known as FSK (Frequency Shift Keyed) modem tones. This data is transmitted in
      ASCII format and contains the information needed to display the CID mesage at
      the terminating line. The actual data burst occurs between the first and
      second ring of the line, and contains basic information about the originating
      point of the call, such as the date, time, and of course the calling number.
      On more upto date systems, or in a local area, the name of the caller will be
      displayed next to their number aswell. Further advances in CID include a new
      system called CIDCW or (CID on Call Waiting), where the call waiting tone is
      heard and the CID of the second calling person is exposed. 
      
      (definition)
      
      As I said before, Caller ID is the identification of the originating
      subscriber line. For example, say you had a line installed under your own
      name, your details would be stored alongside your line information in your
      telcos directory listings. So when you call someone with a CID unit that
      displays the calling partys name, your name would be displayed alongside the
      number, or whoever pays the bill for the line. Obviously the telco has no
      real way of knowing just _who_ is making the call, so the term Caller ID
      would be inapropriate, and should technically be refered to as Calling Number
      Identification because it is the name of the person associate with the line
      rental, and not your docs that are transmitted. The actual CID information is
      transmitted to the terminating subscriber loop, as I said before, between
      the first and second ring implementing a bell202 type modem specification.
      There are 2 tones that are tranmitted, one of them contains the mark
      transmission (logic 1) and the other contains the space transmmision (logic
      0), mark and space. The transmitted message contains a channel seizure string
      and then a mark string followed by the actual caller information. If the
      recieving line only has basic CID information installed (where they only
      recieve the date, time and number of the caller) SDMF (Single Data Message
      Format) is used in the CID data burst. If however, the recieving person has
      a more advanced version of CID where they can see the name of the person
      calling, MDMF (Multiple Data Message Format) is used in the data burst. If
      the MDMF method is used, and you have withheld your CID, the recieving line
      will only see a message saying the information was blocked by the caller, or
      is unavailable. Later I will discuss ways of making your line information
      completly unavailable to the called party.
      
      In New Jersey 1987, the first CID service was offered to subscribers of
      NJBell because NJBell where at that time implementing new high-speed networks
      and wanted to rake in a little more money by offering this new service to its
      customers. Before SS7 ANI was used as a means of obtaining the calling number
      info as a means for billing purposes on certain lines. Before SS7, your ANI
      would go no furthur than your central office, and would not be forwarded to
      international calls. However, that was then and this is now, SS7 has been
      implemented big time over the international/national PSTN (Public Switched
      Telephone Network) and ANI can be a phreaks worst enemy. These days ANI
      information can be transmitted internationaly, and in some cases globably,
      depending on the similaritys of the concerned signalling/switching systems.
      Numbers that are renowned for implementing full ANI capture are 800 and 900
      services (full SS7 based) aswell as operator services, and of course 911.
      ANI is _completly_ different from CID, so if you call a line that has an ANI
      service installed, you will not be able to block your line information from
      going through as ANI works on a different protocol than CID, ie, the *
      services used to withhold your CID wont work on an ANI system because they
      are designed _only_ for blocking of CID _not_ ANI, remember they are
      completly different things. There are alot of rumours that I have heard from
      people about ANI, such as its supposid ability to capture your line
      information, which ever method you use to call a number. The fact is, ANI is
      dependant on SS7, which in turn is dependant on translation tables, who says
      you have to use the SS7 network to call someone ;> I'll go into this further
      later in this file.
      
      Now, back to CID; Because of the mass implementation of the SS7 protocol, CID
      informaion is transmitted to the called party's central office. This is done
      using SS7, and is called CPNM or (Calling Party Number Message). Now, heres
      the bitch of SS7; when you call someone, your line informaion is sent to the
      persons central office _regardless_ of the fact that you may have reqested
      that your line informaion is withheld. If you have withheld your CID, the
      remote person's central office still get your line information, but notices
      that you reqested that your info is withheld (UNLESS the person you are
      calling has a deal with their local telco to expose any CID information held
      at their central office to be automaticaly transmited to their CID unit,
      Thats where things begin to get nasty (at the end of the day, the telcos are
      more concerned about the money they are recieving for providing _full_ CID
      services to people, and could'nt care less if you reqested your line
      informaion remains private). 
      
      (lets get technical) -- exphunged from CallerID specifications
                              by Michael W. Slawson
      
      Eventually standard CID (SDMF) where only the calling number and date etc are
      displayed will be completly phased out and replace by the enhanced CNAM
      (Calling Name Delivery) where the MDMF data burst transmission is used.
      
      The CID information is sent serially at a rate of 1200 bits per second using
      continuous-phase binary frequency shift keying for modulation. The two
      frequencies used to represent the binary states are 1200 Hz for the Mark
      (logic 1) and 2200 Hz for the Space (logic 0). The data is sent
      asynchronously between the first and second ring at a signal level of -13.5
      dBm. The level is measured at the central office across a 900 ohm test
      termination.
      
      Following a minimum of 500 ms after the end of the first ring, the sequence
      of transmission begins with a Channel Seizure. The Channel Seizure is a
      string of 300 continuous bits (250 ms) of alternating "0"s and "1"s. This
      string starts with a "0" and ends with a "1". A Mark Signal of 180 mark bits
      (150 ms) is sent immediately following the Channel Seizure Signal. The
      purpose of the Channel Seizure Signal and the Mark Signal is to prepare the
      data receiver in the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) for the reception of
      the actual CID transmission.
      
      Once the Channel Seizure and Mark Signals have been sent the CID information
      is then transmitted starting with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the most
      significant character. This is true for both SDMF and MDMF. Each character
      in the message consists of 8 bits. For displayable characters these bits
      represent a code defined by the American Standard Code for Information
      Interchange. When transmitted the character's 8 bits are preceded by a start
      bit (space) and followed by a stop bit (mark) giving a total of 10 bits sent
      for each character. The CID information is followed by a checksum for error
      detection. Figure 1 shows a visual layout depicting the association of the
      1st Ring, Channel Seizure Signal, Mark Signal, Caller ID information,
      Checksum, and the 2nd Ring.
      
      The checksum word is a twos complement of the modulo 256 sum of each bit in
      the other words of the message. The Channel Seizure and Mark Signals are not
      included in this checksum. When the message is received by the CPE it checks
      for errors by taking the received checksum word and adding the modulo 256 sum
      of all of the other words received in the message. The addition done by the
      CPE does not include the Channel Seizure and Mark Signals, nor does it
      include the received checksum word. The result of this addition should be
      zero to indicate that no errors have been detected.
         
      Figure 2 shows a CID message in SDMF. For ease in describing the process of
      determining the checksum, the decimal values will be used for the
      calculations.

      The first step is to add up the values of all of the fields (not including
      the checksum). In this example the total would be 945. This total is then
      divided by 256. The quotient is discarded and the remainder (177) is the
      modulo 256 sum. The binary equivalent of 177 is 10110001. To get the twos
      compliment start with the ones compliment (01001110), which is obtained by
      inverting each bit, and add 1. The twos compliment of a binary 10110001 is
      01001111 (decimal 79). This is the checksum that is sent at the end of the
      CID information. When the CPE receives the CID message it also does a modulo
      256 sum of the fields, however it does not do a twos complement. If the twos
      complement of the modulo 256 sum (01001111) is added to just the modulo 256
      sum (10110001) the result will be zero.
         
      If the result is not zero then the message is discarded. It is important to
      note that there is no error correction in this method. Even if the CPE were
      to notify the central office of errors, the central office will not
      retransmit the information. If an error is detected, the CPE receiving the
      message should display an error message or nothing at all. Although Bellcore
      SR-TSV-002476 recommends that the CPE display an error message if erroneous
      data is received, most CPE manufacturers have elected to just ignore the
      errored message.
         
      The content of the CID message itself depends on whether it is in SDMF or
      MDMF. A message in SDMF includes a Message Type word, a Message Length word,
      and the actual Message words. A message in MDMF also includes a Message Type
      word, a Message Length word, and the actual Message words, but additionally
      includes Parameter Type and Parameter Length words. There are certain points
      within these messages where up to 10 Mark bits may be inserted to allow for
      equipment delays in the central office. These Stuffed Mark bits are generally
      not necessary.
         
      The Message Type word defines whether the message is in SDMF or MDMF. It will
      be a binary 00000100 (decimal 4) for SDMF or a binary 10000000 (decimal 128)
      for MDMF. The Message Length will include the number of characters in the
      message. This length does not include the checksum at the end of the message.
      For SDMF the minimum length will be 9 characters. The minimum length for MDMF
      will depend on whether the customer has subscribed to CNAM service as well as
      CND. In the case of CND only the minimum length will be 13 characters. If the
      customer also has CNAM then the minimum will be 16 characters. In all three
      of the minimums mentioned there will be no actual number or name delivered.
      The field will be marked either "O" (Out of area) or "P" (Private).
         
      Figure 3 shows an example of a minimum message layout for SDMF. The number
      will not be delivered because it has been blocked by the calling party. The
      CPE will receive the date, time, and a "P" to indicate that the caller's
      identification has been blocked at the caller's request.

      In Figure 4, if the number and name had not been included then the parameter
      types for those fields would be different. These alternate parameter types
      are used to signify that the data contained in that parameter is the reason
      for its absence. The parameter type for the number section would have been a
      binary 00000100 (decimal 4) and the parameter type for the name section would
      have been a binary 00001000 (decimal 8). When the parameter type signifies
      that the data contained is the reason for that fields absence, the parameter
      length is always a binary 00000001 (decimal 1). If the reason for absence is
      that the calling party does not want their number/name displayed then the
      parameter data would be a binary 01010000 (ASCII "P") for Private. If the
      reason for absence is that the information is just not available then the
      parameter data would be a binary 01001111 (ASCII "O") for Out of area. The
      number/name may not be available if the calling party is not served by a
      central office capable of relaying the information on through the network.
      
      (lets talk d1rty)
      
      The above specifications are relevant to the US CID system, and not to the
      UK specification. Enough of the technical stuff for now though, its time to
      look at CID systems from an attack and deffense point of view. First the
      real basics; if you are in US you can reqest that your CID is withheld by
      using *67 as a prefix when dialing a number. As I said before though, this is
      absolutly usless in completly withholding your CID because we know that CID
      information is passed onto the called party's central office regardless of
      *67 via implementation of the SS7 network. If you are in the UK you would
      prefix your call with 141, but again our nice systemX digital exchanges a
      real bitches at passing on our CID information to _other_ exchanges, so in
      essance your call routing is loged as it passes through exchange boundarys on
      the PSTN. So here I am going to discuss different techniques that can be used
      to completly render your CID information useless as it is transmitted through
      various excahanges and offices.
      
      I'm going to begin with some basic concepts so you can understand the more
      advanced techniques better. Now, lets consider this scenario for the
      following techniques; You are in Texas (RBOC: SWBell) and you want to set-up
      a call to someone in Chicago (Ameritech). Obviously, you know that *67 wont
      help you if the person you are calling has full CID (or has access to there
      central office ;>) so you consider the following techniques and call-setup
      examples.
      
      [ example A: simple diverting ]
      
      Here you can use a host that will be traced back to in the advent that the
      person has full CID. In other words, its real simple, you use a PBX
      (preferably a long distance one located in another RBOC). This is very self
      explanitory, but alot of people get it wrong. Heres how the call setup would
      look in a metaphorical diagram:
      
      
                ______                ______          ______
               |      |              |      |        |      | (800)XXX-XXXX
               |  CO  |------------->|  CO  |------->| PBX  | POTS:(123)456-7890
               |______|              |______|<-------|______|
                  |                     |
                  |                     |
                  |                   __|___
               ( you )               |      |
                                     |  CO  |----------------------> ( them )
                                     |______|
      
      
      Now, whats happening here is you are calling the PBX at *671800XXXXXXX, you
      then login to the PBX and from there you dial the person you want to call.
      When the person checks there CID unit, they will see the number of the PBX
      you are calling from instead of your actuall originating number. Now, this is
      OK for very very very simple CID spoofing, but if the person you are calling
      is resoursefull, they could very easily have words with the host from which
      you where calling from (who would have your ANI -its an 800 number) The CO of
      the PBX would also have the time, date, and trunk setup information for when
      you called the PBX etc, so this example is still not quite as effective as
      you would imagine it to be. 
      
      Now, to make a long story short, we can enhacne the above method by
      implementing our _own_ CID blocking methods along the above routing example.
      Look at the diagram in detail, and you will realise that there can be many
      different alterations made that can make the routing alot safer, and _alot_
      more hastle for them to pin-point your OCP, or originating point.
      
      First we take into account the call we make to the PBX. For starters, you can
      op-divert to the 800 number (depending on where you live) so the 800 PBX
      recieves operator assisted call ANI instead of yours. This can be done very
      easily, and involves you calling your local operator and asking them to call
      the number for you. The central office located near to the PBX then has the
      OPC of your operator, rather than you.
      
      Now, the PBX host is your safgaurd when it comes to hiding your CID. For
      those of you who dont know, all PBXs or privatly owned switching and trunking
      mechanisms/systems log incomming and outgoing trunk setups for billing
      purposses etc. These days, most PBX exchanges have administration modules
      that deal with call routing. The call-setups are stored in the databases of
      the PBXs and can be intercepted. Most of the time, a PBX will have 1 if not
      several dialin modems that connect to the PBX administration modules for
      remote maintanance. Its simply a case of internally scanning the extensions
      of the remote PBX for a carrier, and checking out each one until you find
      what you are looking for. Once you have access, you could do _many_ things
      depending on how advanced the system is. For example, you could erase any log
      of your connection to the PBX (aswell as any furture connections), you can
      set up incomming and outgoing trunks on the PBX exchange that dont even
      exist, you can also select which trunk you wish to call your party with and
      therefore selecting which number you wish to be displayed to the called
      party. I wont go into to much detail here, you get the picture right?
      
      So now we are using a host to call through that will not log anything that
      could point towards you, with the exeption of the timestamping at the central
      officess along the routing path. (again, that could be delt with in a similar
      fashion). You could also implement op-diverting from the PBX to the dialed
      person, or triple the amount of hosts you use to place the call at the same
      time using the above methods, but via more PBXs and operators.
      
      In my opinion though, the above method is no way near as secure as you need
      it to be, so in the next examples, we take adavntage of ld-carriers, and
      global PSTN networks that do not co-operate with each other, ie: calling
      party data is not translatable or transmitable (electromechanical).
      
      Now, to really throw someone off track in the advent of a trace (realtime or
      aftermath) we take advantage of one of the biggest flaws in the PSTN known
      today: new digital exchange units such as digital ESS, systemX etc cannot
      effectivly communicate with older lesser implemented electromechanical
      exchanges such as crossbar, and CCITT#5 protocols implemented in lesser
      developed countrys such as Indonisia, Libia etc. The worlds telcos are also
      very lazy when it comes to passing on originating calling party information
      from country to country, simply because it is to much hastle for them, time
      and money runs into the picture once more. So ld call setups become a good
      counter defense when it comes to routing un-traceable calls. Now, I can think
      of literaly 100s of methods that could be implemented here, but I'm going to
      discuss the structure of how this type of call would be setup, I'll leave the
      rest to your imagination (if you have one)
      
      [ example B: international routing ]
      
      Now, consider the previous call setup example, and imagine how it would be
      trunked if you placed a long distance barrier in-between. Here we will
      imagine we have 2 PBXs, one in the US and one in the UK. Again, you are in
      Texas and want to setup a call to someone in Chicago without revealing your
      identity. The basic call setup would appear like this:

      So here you have op diverted                       :
      to the US PBX, then from the                       :

      The problem with this kind of routing example is that you are costing the 2
      PBX exchanges involved big bux, and is generaly not a very nice thing to do,
      heh. Again, as in the previous example, you can implement the PBX
      administration for extra security, the above diagram could be used vise-versa
      whether your origionating point was the UK or US. It is howver inconvinient,
      both for you, and for the poor owners of the PBXs who have to falk out for
      your toll-fraud adventures. There are however other ways of implementing the
      above techniques. 
      
      Now, probably the most favourable technique to use would be to box your way
      out of a country that runs C5, and from there re-route a call back to the US
      and even implement a few PBXs along the way, therefore you would have [ 0 ]
      CID worrys. A more advanced technique involves the forwarding of subscriber
      lines to a designated number (A C5 country direct, PBX etc). Now, if you are
      in the US, you could be super lame and simply have another US line forwarded
      to another number via the means of posing to the forwarded lines co as a
      field engineer requesting a line be forwarded to xxx while you carry out
      field 'maintanance' on it, _or_ if you wanna stay away from the lameness, you
      could so this:
      
      Lets take Indonisia for example. You can remotely forward an Indonisian
      residential line to anywhere you want (providing you can find an english
      speaking exchange). Indonisia is just an example, but like the US method of
      forwarding lines you have 2 options. You could a) pose a local field
      engineer, or if the country has a DMS[+] architecture you could forward the
      lines via the means of remote switch access. (Thats another file, but you get
      the general idea). So, when it comes down to it, its all about having the
      ability to route calls, not spoof them.
      
      So, there you have it, a brief guide to CID blocking (the effective way), its
      your choice, *67 (blah) or *67,00-->1800XXXXXXX-->*67,00-->1800XXXXXX(CD)-->

45.0  A buffer overflow exists on the VirusWall smtp gateway
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by duro
      

      A buffer overflow exists on the VirusWall smtp gateway - by sending a long
      HELO command you can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
      Example code has been written which will spawn a command prompt on a port
      you specify.
      
      Before you shrug this one off, take a look:

      The ironic thing here is, VirusWall was designed to prevent viruses and
      'malicious code'.
      
      Obviously not a lot of thought was taken before laying their trust into
      3rd party 'security' products.
     
      A quick note to the millions out there who would give their right arm to
      compromise microsofts network - sorry, their firewall would prevent the
      payload from spawning a remote shell.. unless of course it was modified to
      stop an existing service to open a port :)

46.0  The Xnews guid
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From the home page http://xnews.3dnews.net/
      
      
      
      All the talks about the PIII's ID code and Win98's Global Unique ID remind 
      me of Xnews' own IDToken. From the manual: This is a string Xnews embeds 
      in Message-ID in order to track your posts and alert you to replies to 
      your articles. You can use any string of letters and numbers. I use my 
      email without the @ and . luutrangeocities. The idea is to use a string 
      that noone else is likely to use. 

      By default, I generate this string by taking your email address and strip 
      out the . and @. In retrospect, maybe this was not such a good idea as 
      some users who go through great length to hide their email may not 
      appreciate having it embedded inside Message-ID and References headers 
      (albeit in an altered form). But, you can change this to anything you 
      like, including using a seemingly random string of letters and numbers. 
      And if you're really paranoid, just delete it (just use empty string). 
      You'll lose the convenience of having Xnews flag replies to your posts, of 
      course. [By the way, if your news server does not accept client-generated 
      message ids, this entire discussion is moot.] 

      Anyway, I just want Xnews users to be aware of this issue. I don't want 
      people to be caught by surprise then flaming me. This is really a feature 
      designed to help you, not some lame corporate
      attempt to track you for marketing purposes.

47.0  BUFFER OVERFLOW IN IMG VIEWER
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNS http://www.net-security.org/      


      by BHZ Monday 6th November 1999 on 11:02 pm CET
      The popular Image viewer "Irfan View32" contains the buffer overflow
      problem, this problem exists in the handling of Adobe Photoshop
      image file. Irfan view checks the image type by the image header, if
      "8BPS" pattern is found in the header, Irfan view judges this file as
      Photo Shop image. The overflow happens at the handling of reading
      this marker. Cool one, isn't it:).

      The popular Image viewer "Irfan View32" contains the buffer overflow
      problem, this problem exists in the handling of  Adobe Photoshop image
      file. Irfan view checks the image type by the image header, if "8BPS"
      pattern is found in the header, Irfan view judges this file as Photo
      Shop image. We think the overflow happens at the handling of reading 
      this marker.
      
      You can see the GPF dialog box by the following file.
      
      8BPSaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .... long 'a'
      
      #You can make this file by notepad.exe
      
      This overflow is exploitable if the appropriate value is stored in the
      stack area, any codes such as virus, trojans, destruction code, which is
      stored in the image file can be executed.  
      
      This fact means that the danger also exists on downloding the image
      files and viewing them. Of course, there is a possibility of such danger
      also in other software such as movie players, audio players. We coded
      the following sample codes. This code generates the jpg file which
      contains the exploit code that generates "exp.com" in "c:\" and executes
      it("exp.com" is a simple demo program, there is no danger).
      
      This is tested on Japanese Windows98 only.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      My website has been launched!  Up to the minute advisories, tools, (and
      code fixes...heh) are available from http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/
      
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      ----[ 1. Problem
      
              Interesting on how things go around/come around.  Recently Luke 
      Kenneth Casson Leighton posted a message on NTBugtraq in response to SP6
      not fixing the LSA denial of service.  He states that this problem is
      essentially "due to marshalling/unmarshalling MSRPC code being unable to
      cope with a NULL policy handle."  He also states that they reported this
      problem to Microsoft around February 1999.
      
              Well, no, I did not 'rediscover' the LSA denial of service (ala
      the AEDebug advisory earlier this month).  I did, however, discover a
      different denial of service based out of services.exe.  When sent a
      specific packet, it's possible to get srvsvc.dll to choke, and cause
      services.exe to reference a bad memory location.  For those geeks in the
      crowd, essentially srvsvc_netrshareenum in srvsvc.dll uses
      rpcrt4_ndrcomplexstructunmarshall to tweak a string, but returns a NULL.
      srvsvc_netrshareenum doesn't check for return value, adds four to the
      pointer, and passes it up a function stack until finally that memory is
      read (address 00000004).  Blam...Dr. Watson. 
      
              So we have another problem due to marshalling/unmarshalling MSRPC
      code.  This was found independantly of Luke's info and the LSA
      vulnerability.
      
              The impact is pretty severe.  Services.exe handles named pipes for
      the system.  Once this crashes, everything named-pipe-based goes with it.
      This means logons, logouts, remote system access (registry, server
      functions, etc), local server management, IIS, file sharing, etc...all go
      down the tube.  However, the box will, for the most part, appear to
      function normally on the local side, until you do something involving a
      named pipe service.  The only fix is to reboot...however, the shutdown
      procedure waits for every (non-existant) service to respond to shutdown,
      and timeout.  On a typical box this could cause the full shutdown
      procedure to push over a half-hour; therefore, hard reset is most likely
      needed.  Also, once in a great while the bug will 'survive' during a
      reset.  It may take two reboots to get the system back in order.  Strange,
      yes.  How, I'm not sure.  But it's happened over a half dozen times across
      four separate boxes I've tested on.
      
              Now, I'm sure some of you are thinking "well, denial of services
      suck.  How can I own .gov and .mil websites with this?" (hi flipz and
      fuqrag)
      
              Well, let's go back to David LeBlanc's response to RFP9903
      (AEDebug advisory).  He states, for AEDebug to really be a problem, you
      have to "make something crash that has higher access rights than you do." 
      He also states "you've got to make a service go down that won't kill the
      machine."  
      
              Bingo, this fits the bill.  If we have access to change the
      AEDebug registry key, we can set what programs to run on crash, set
      autorun to True, and then crash services.exe.  Our programs run as
      Local_System, the box is still alive (TCP/IP-wise) and usable via netcat
      and whatnot.  A much more useful situation for a denial of service, don't
      you think?
      
              Also, Eric Schultze has detailed out many situations where someone
      could have access to your AEDebug key.  I suggest you read his tidbit.
      It's posted as document 11 in the knowledge base on my website, available
      at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/
      
              So far, I have been able to use this exploit on NT 4.0 server and
      workstation, with various levels of SP 1, 3, 5, and 6 service packs
      installed.  I even tried applying SP 5 with the following hotfixes (in the
      following order): lsareq, ipsrfix, csrssfx, ioctlfx, and igmpfix.  I've
      also tried using the Security Configuration Editor on various different
      'secure' system profiles, testing to see if perhaps a registry key
      affected it.  After all modifications, the systems were still susceptible.
      HOWEVER, I do have reports of two boxes *NOT* being susceptible.  The
      reason for this, however, is unfound.  Information will be released when
      it is found.  If you come across a situation where a box is impervious to
      the exploit, PLEASE EMAIL ME.  I would really appreciate the entire
      install history of that particular system.  Email to rfp@wiretrip.net.
      
      
      ----[ 2. Solution
      
              Well, as previously stated, Luke and ISS informed Microsoft of the
      LSA vulnerability in February 1999.  To be fair, I also reported this
      exact bug, along with the working exploit, to Microsoft on Oct 25th.  Have
      not hear a word.  So, in the meantime, I can recommend two things:
      
      - Block port 139 on your firewall.  This, however, does not stop internal
      attack.
      
      - Turn off the Server service.  While inconvenient, this should be deemed
      as a temporary solution until Microsoft releases a patch.  Just for
      reference, shutting off the Server service will also shut down the
      Computer Browser service.  Glitch, a fellow Wiretrip member, describes the
      functions of these services as follows:
      
      SERVER: Used as the key to all server-side NetBIOS applications, this
      service is somewhat needed. Without this service, some of the
      administrative tools, such as Server Manager, could not be used. If remote
      administration is not needed, I highly recommend disabling this service.
      Contrary to popular belief, this service is NOT needed on a webserver.
      
      COMPUTER BROWSER: The Computer Browser service is a function within
      Microsoft networking for gathering and distributing resource information.
      When active on a server, the server will register its name through a
      NetBIOS broadcast or directly to a WINS server. 
      
      So you should note that turning these services off will disable the server
      from participating in NetBIOS-related functions, including file sharing
      and remote management.  But realistically, how many servers need this?
      Alternate means of content publishing (for webservers) exist (FTP and
      -ugh- FrontPage).  Of course this leaves the myriad of other services
      though.  I'd be interested to see how MS SQL fairs.
      
      It's hoped that between the services.exe and the lsass.exe denial of
      services, both based on bad RPC code, Microsoft will find this problem
      worthy of fixing.
      
      Now we wait...
      
      
      ----[ 3. Where to Get This Weapon of Mass Destruction
      
              I use this title jokingly.  But trust me, I have gone back and
      forth about the release of this exploit.  However, as a proponent of full
      disclosure, I definately will release a working exploit.  But I do so with
      conditions:
      
      - I will only release a Windows executable.
      
      - The windows executable is coded to reboot (NT) or crash (9x) upon
      successful execution.  If you blow something up, you blow up too.
      
      - A few checks that keep the program from running if you run in a user
      context that does not allow the above 'safety features' to work.
      
      But it is a working executable.  I'm hoping this will at least curb the
      script kiddie activity.  Of course, I'm sure this program will be reversed
      and a new version made within 6 hours of posting--but that's not my
      problem.  This should be more than enough to verify/test the exploit, and
      I've provided the details of how it works and the solutions necessary for
      stopping it.  The skilled will be able to go off this, and the, well, the
      abusers will hit the glass ceiling as intended.  Thanks to Vacuum for
      helping me come up with a responsible solution.
      
      Also, I want to make it very clear, before I tell you where to get the
      executable....
      
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
      
      oh, and
      
                             DO NOT ASK ME FOR SOURCE.
      
      
      I don't care who you are.  All email asking for source will be instantly
      deleted.  I don't care if you send me the secret to life--if it has "p.s.
      can I get the source?" I will pipe that thing to /dev/null, along with
      whatever goodies you may have sent me.  Don't even joke; you won't get a
      reply.
      
              Now that that's established, you can download RFPoison.exe from my
      website (of course) at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/
      
      
      
      ----[ 4. Miscellaneous Updates (Important stuff!)
      
      
      - whisker 1.2.0 has been released!  Includes the ability to bounce scans
      off of AltaVista (thanks to Philip Stoev) Plus some new feature additions,
      and new scan scripts, including a comprehensive script for scanning
      FrontPage (thanks to Sozni).
      
      - flipz and fuqrag have been busy hacking .gov and .mil sites.  Turns out
      they're using a vanilla copy of msadc2.pl.  Check out msadc2.pl (their
      exploit) at my website.
      
      - Zeus Technologies had an outstanding response to RFP9905.  In under 12
      hours they had a patched version available, and were all-around terrific in
      their private and public response.  As an indication of how they do
      business, I would recommend Zeus Technologies as a vendor to anyone.  Kudos
      for them.
      
      - technotronic and rfp.labs have teamed up!  We're going to combine a couple
      of resources--starting with the mailing list.  Technotronic already puts out
      some good info on his list...now I'll be giving the same list up to date
      information on rfp.labs advisories, information, and other various cool
      info.  If you're not on it already, you may consider joining.  Signup at
      www.technotronic.com
      
      - with the (sad?) end of octoberfest, I'm also pleased to see w00w00 take
      over with 'w00giving'--all through the month of November w00w00 will be
      releasing some more stuff!  You can start looking for the first (of many)
      advisories today (Nov 1st).
      
      Special greetings to Simple Nomad (and others) on this special day where
      the wheel finishes its cycle and starts its revolution anew.

      Advisory Code:
      
      AD11041999
      
      Description:
      
      It was a typical day in eEye land... the beer was cold, the day was long,
      the exploit... well the exploit was a joke started by a client. "The day you
      guys can hack my network via it's printer is the day I call it quits." A
      joke at first... the ability to remotely and locally compromise an NT
      network via a printer. What started off as a joke was going to turn into
      reality. Ten or so minutes after taking a look at the NT printer service we
      had already found a way to compromise any windows NT server or workstation
      that had a printer attached to it or the ability to print to a network
      printer.
      
      The Windows NT Spooler service (Spoolss.exe), (used for various printing
      activities), contains a number of security holes that allow for data
      overflows. These vulnerabilities are evident when someone passes data to
      various spooler service API's and spoolss.exe does not check the size of the
      receiving buffer to make sure it can hold the incoming
      data. The API, explained in more detail below, can only be exploited
      locally. However, some of the overflows could be exploited remotely.
      
      Example of one of the exploitable API's:
      
      First thing to note about the API in question is that it can only be
      executed if you are a "Power User". So for this example, if you were to
      write exploit code for this API overflow you could only elevate your access
      from a Power User to SYSTEM level. Which is still a very bad thing. However,
      as explained earlier, there are other places where the spooler service
      overflows and cases that do not require you to be at the power user level.
      
      ----spoolss.c----
      #include <windows.h>
      #include <winspool.h>
      
      int main()
      {
      char bigbuffer[3000];
      int i;
      
      strcpy(bigbuffer,"\\\\");
      for(i=0;i<2000;i++)
        strcat(bigbuffer,"A");
      AddPrintProcessor(NULL,NULL,bigbuffer,bigbuffer);
      return(0);
      
      }
      ----spoolss.c----
      
      In this example, the overflow is in AddPrintProcessor. When "bigbuffer" is
      passed to the spooler service, it tries to stuff 2000 instances of the
      character "A" into a buffer that cannot handle an amount of data that size
      and therefore overflows. Also you will notice when it overflows that EIP is
      00410041. This is because the bytes have been changed into wide byte
      (Unicode) format. Do not be deceived by this... it is still exploitable. :-]
      
      There exists another vulnerability in the spooler service that allows any
      local user to load their own dll's and have them executed by the spooler
      service with SYSTEM level access therefore allowing any local user to gain
      total control of the local machine.
      
      The vulnerability is in AddPrintProvidor(). Microsoft has a very good
      description in their advisory of what a print provider is and why the
      vulnerability exists and other detailed information. So instead of
      regurgitating that information we will give you detailed information on
      exploiting the hole and an example exploit including source.

      A brief word about w00giving:
      w00giving is being put on by none other then the security team w00w00.
      w00giving is a joint effort of various security groups and individuals who
      are going to be releasing advisories,exploits and tools through out November
      and into December. eEye is participating in w00giving so over the next few
      weeks of November we plan to release either an advisory or tool once a week.
      This printer advisory is our first offering and we hope you enjoy it.

       * Intel exploitation is pretty straightforward.. should give you a remote
       * shell. The shellcode will break chroot, do a getpeername on all open
       * sockets, and dup to the first one that returns AFINET. It also forks and
       * runs a command in case the fd duping doesn't go well.  Solaris/SPARC is a
       * bit more complicated.. we are going through a well trodden part of the
       * code, so we don't get the context switch we need to have it populate the
       * register windows from the stack. However, if you just hammer the service
       * with requests, you will quickly get a context switch at the right time.
       * Thus, the SPARC shellcode currently only breaks chroot, closes current
       * fd's and runs a command.
       * Also, the NetBSD shellcode doesn't break chroot because they stop the
       * dir tricks. Of course, they allow mknods in chrooted environments, so
       * if named is running as root, then it still might be expoitable.
       * The non-exec stack patch version returns into a malloc'ed buffer, whose
       * address can vary quite alot. Thus, it may not be as reliable as the other
       * versions..
       *
       * We broke this just a little in order to raise the bar on using it

       * thanks to stran9er for sdnsofw.c
       *
       * Intel exploitation is pretty straightforward.. should give you a remote
       * shell. The shellcode will break chroot, do a getpeername on all open
       * sockets, and dup to the first one that returns AFINET. It also forks and
       * runs a command in case the fd duping doesn't go well.  Solaris/SPARC is a
       * bit more complicated.. we are going through a well trodden part of the
       * code, so we don't get the context switch we need to have it populate the
       * register windows from the stack. However, if you just hammer the service
       * with requests, you will quickly get a context switch at the right time.
       * Thus, the SPARC shellcode currently only breaks chroot, closes current
       * fd's and runs a command.
       * Also, the NetBSD shellcode doesn't break chroot because they stop the
       * dir tricks. Of course, they allow mknods in chrooted environments, so
       * if named is running as root, then it still might be expoitable.
       * The non-exec stack patch version returns into a malloc'ed buffer, whose
       * address can vary quite alot. Thus, it may not be as reliable as the other
       * versions..
       *
       * We broke this just a little in order to raise the bar on using it
       * (just slightly).. If you'd like to test it on your own box, put a shell
       * in /adm/sh, or /adm/ksh for solaris on the target machine.

      II.  BUGTRAQ SUMMARY 1999-10-24 to 199-11-01
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      
      1. Pacific Software URL Live! Directory Traversal Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 746
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-28
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/746
      Summary:
      
      The URL Live! free webserver from Pacific software is susceptible to the
      "../" directosy traversal vulnerability. By using the '../' string in a
      URL, an attacker can gain read access to files outside the intended web
      file structure.
      
      2. Squid Web Proxy Authentication Failure Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 741
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-25
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/741
      Summary:
      
      There is a vulnerability present in certain versions of the Squid Web
      Proxy Cache developed by the National Science Foundation. This problem is
      only in effect when users of the cache are using an external
      authenticator.
      
      The following is quoted from the original Bugtraq posting on this issue,
      this message in it's entirety is available in the 'Credits' section of
      this vulnerability.
      
      "After decoding the base64 encoded "user:password" pair given by the
      client, squid doesn't strip out any '\n' or '\r' found in the resulting
      string. Given such a string, any external authenticator will receive two
      lines instead of one, and most probably send two results. Now, any
      subsequent authentication exchange will has its answer shifted by one.
      Therefore, a malicious user can gain access to sites he or she should not
      have access to."
      
      3. Zeus Webserver Possible Remote root Compromise
      BugTraq ID: 742
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-25
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/742
      Summary:
      
      There are a number of vulnerabilities in the Zeus Web Server, that if
      carried out in combination can lead to a remote root compromise.The Zeus
      Web Server gives its users the option to use a pre-built search CGI
      program for their virtual website. The program accepts (as its http form
      variables) server filesystem paths as its arguments. Because of this, it
      is possible to display any file that the server has access to. Thus, by
      altering parameters to "search", an attacker can obtain the password hash
      for the admin user by displaying the configuration file.
      
      Once a password for the admin user is cracked, it is possible to execute
      aribtrary commands through the web based configuration UI as root (which
      the configuration UI runs as).
      
      4. Falcon Web Server Directory Traversal Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 743
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-26
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/743
      Summary:
      
      The Falcon Webserver is a personal desktop webserver designed for low
      volume page serving. Certain versions of this software do not properly
      handle user supplied URL's. Therefore a user can browse outside of the web
      browser 'root' directory at any file on the file system depending on
      permissions.
      
      A second problem exists wherein a longer than expected URL will elicit an
      error message from the server which betrays the location of the 'root'
      directory.
      
      5. AIX Filtering Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 744
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-26
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/744
      Summary:
      
      The filtering modules for AIX 4.3.2 do not allow you to filter tcp port
      numbers higher than 32767. This example was in the BugTraq posting
      regarding this problem:
      
       genfilt -v 4 -a D -s 0.0.0.0 -m 0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0 -M 0.0.0.0 \ -c udp -o any -O eq -P 123 -l n -w I -i all
      
       Works fine... but...
      
       genfilt -v 4 -a D -s 0.0.0.0 -m 0.0.0.0 -d 0.0.0.0 -M 0.0.0.0 -c udp \ -o any -O eq -P 32768 -l n -w I -i all
      
       Fails with: Bad destination port/ICMP type "32768".
      
      It is believed that this problem is a result of incorrect type (short int)
      being used for the port number argument. Compromise may occur through
      services listening on ports that are higher than 32767.
      
      6. MacOS 9 Console Lock Bypass Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 745
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-10-26
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/745
      Summary:
      
      MacOS 9 includes an idle-activated console lock feature, similar to a
      screensaver password in other operating systems. After a certain length of
      user inactivity, a dialog box appears stating that a password must be
      entered. After the user clicks 'OK' another dialog box appears offering
      the option to either supply a password or to log out the current user. If
      the 'log out' option is chosen, any programs running will start to shut
      down. In certain programs, dialog boxes are created in the shutdown
      process (for example, "Exit without saving? OK/Cancel"). If the user
      selects 'Cancel', the shutdown process is aborted and the user is returned
      to the current session without ever having to enter a password.
      
      7. WFTPD Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 747
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-28
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/747
      Summary:
      
      There is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in WFTPD
      that is known to affect versions 2.34 and 2.40. The overflow exists in the
      MKD and CWD commands, which if argumented with long strings in the right
      order, can overrun the buffer and allow for aribtrary code execution on
      the target host.
      
      This is from the BugTraq posting:
      
      First command
      
      MKD
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      
      Second command
      
      CWD
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
      
      Crash.....Overflow.
      
      
      8. Netscape Messaging Server RCPT TO DoS Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 748
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-29
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/748
      Summary:
      
      Netscape Messaging server will not de-allocate memory that is used to
      store the RCPT TO information for an incoming email. By sending enough
      long RCPT TO addresses, the system can be forced to consume all available
      memory, leading to a denial of service.
      
      9. Celtech ExpressFS USER Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 749
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-29
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/749
      Summary:
      
      Celtech's ExpressFS FTP server has been found to be vulnerable by means of
      a buffer overflow. If an argument of sufficient length is passed after the
      USER command, the next command sent will cause it to crash.
      
      10. NT Services Denial of Service
      BugTraq ID: 754
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 1999-10-31
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/754
      Summary:
      
      A specially crafted packet can cause a denial of service in on an NT 4.0
      host, rendering local administration and network communication next to
      useless. This attack will crash the "services" executable, which in turn,
      disables the ability for the machine to perform actions via 'named pipes'.
      As a consequence, users will be unable to remotely logon, logoff, manage
      the registry, create new file share connections, or perform remote
      administration. Services such as Internet Information Server may also fail
      to operate as expected.
      
      The problem lies within the manner that srvsvc.dll makes calls to
      services.exe. Certain MSRPC calls will return NULL values which are not
      correctly interpreted by services.exe. This, in turn, may lead to a crash
      of Services.exe.
      
      
      If this denial of service is combined with a number of other exploits, it
      may be possible to have this attack spawn a Debugger (ie Dr Watson) call
      on the host, which, if trojaned, may execute malicious code on the target
      host.
      
      
      11. FreeBSD Amanda 'amandad' Symlink Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 752
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 1999-11-01
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/752
      Summary:
      Amanda is a popular file backup system used by several free UNIX
      distributions. Under certain versions of the distribution shipped with
      FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE the amanda daemon itself (amandad) is subject to a
      symlink vulnerability which could result in a denial of service attack.
      
       This is caused because amandad during it's process of operations writes a
      debug file to the /tmp directory. This file (/tmp/amandad.debug) does not
      check for existing symlinked files of the same name. Amandad is not run
      SUID/SGID so the end result of this vulnerability would most likely be the
      ability to clobber other files owned by the UID which owns the amandad
      process. The output in this case cannot be tailored and consists of Amanda
      debug output.

      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/eerase20.zip
      
      East-Tec Eraser is an advanced security application designed to completely
      eliminate sensitive data from your computer. East-Tec Eraser works on
      Windows 98/95 and Windows NT. Eraser introduces a new meaning for the verb
      TO ERASE. Erasing a file now means wiping its contents beyond recovery,
      scrambling its name and dates and finally removing it from disk. When you
      want to get rid of sensitive files or folders beyond recovery, add them to
      the Eraser list of doomed files and ask Eraser to do the job. Eraser
      offers tight integration with the Windows shell, so you can drag files and
      folders from Explorer and drop them in Eraser, or you can erase them
      directly from Explorer by selecting "Erase beyond recovery" from the
      context menu.

        SET SF-NEWS NODIGEST
      
        If you want to unsubscribe from the list completely follow the instructions of section 0.2.2 next.
      
      7. I seem to not be able to unsubscribe. What is going on?
      
        You are probably subscribed from a different address than that from which you are sending
        commands to LISTSERV from. Either send email from the appropiate address or email the
        moderator to be unsubscribed manually.

       Noge od perja,
       Brzopleto plutaju po snjegu,
       Dok leptir puzi po uraganu.

       Krvav val,
       Stidnjivo brise zvijezde,
       A ohar lomi kosti lava.

       Izgoren list,

      warez d00dz /weirz doodz/ /n./ A substantial subculture of crackers refer to themselves as `warez
      d00dz'; there is evidently some connection with B1FF here. As `Ozone Pilot', one former warez d00d,
      wrote:

      Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software. If it has copy protection on it, they break the
      protection so the software can be copied. Then they distribute it around the world via several
      gateways. Warez d00dz form badass group names like RAZOR and the like. They put up boards that
      distribute the latest ware, or pirate program. The whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the
      pirate program released and distributed before any other group. I know, I know. But don't ask, and it
      won't hurt as much. This is how they prove their poweress [sic]. It gives them the right to say, "I
      released King's Quest IVXIX before you so obviously my testicles are larger." Again don't ask...
      The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit `0-day warez', that is copies of
      commercial software copied and cracked on the same day as its retail release. Warez d00ds also
      hoard software in a big way, collecting untold megabytes of arcade-style games, pornographic GIFs,
      and applications they'll never use onto their hard disks. As Ozone Pilot acutely observes:

      [BELONG] is the only word you will need to know. Warez d00dz want to belong. They have been
      shunned by everyone, and thus turn to cyberspace for acceptance. That is why they always start groups
      like TGW, FLT, USA and the like. Structure makes them happy. [...] Warez d00dz will never have a
      handle like "Pink Daisy" because warez d00dz are insecure. Only someone who is very secure with a
      good dose of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man. More likely you will find
      warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death, Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil,
      The Unknown, Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin Turbo. They like to sound badass when they
      can hide behind their terminals. More likely, if you were given a sample of 100 people, the person
      whose handle is Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name.
 
      The contrast with Internet hackers is stark and instructive. See cracker, wannabee, handle, elite;
      compare weenie, spod.

      check out http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/groups.html to see who
      you are up against. You can often gather intel from IRC as many of these
      groups maintain a presence by having a channel with their group name as the
      channel name, others aren't so obvious but do exist.
