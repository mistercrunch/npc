      How Can I Help ??  
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I'm looking for staff members to help with putting the zine together
      if you want your name in lights (ie: mad propz and credz in here) and
      have the time to spare, then here are some of the areas I can use help
      in:
      
      The Big One:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Text to HTML project: This entails converting all existing texts to
      HTML and including, were appropriate the hyperlinks for urls mentioned
      in text.
      
      Foreign Correspondants and Translators
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I'm also looking for people willing to translate articles from their
      area (usually Dutch, German, Norwegian etc) to contribute articles
      and if possible translate them into english for us. You will be
      marked as HWA staff on our list, please include your email and
      website info, and bio if you wish to do so, none of this is required
      however. Your help is appreciated!
      
      Site Design
      ~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I need some design ideas for the website, i've temporarily revamped it
      but i'd like to test some new look and feel ideas, if you're a web
      wizard and want to try your hand at making us a site, email me, and 
      go for it, be warned that we may NOT use your design, but don't let 
      that stop you from trying your hand at it. An online temp/demo site
      would be helpful.
      
      News Collection:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      There are a LOT of sources and resources, many listed here and others
      in the ether, search these or pick a few of these sources to search
      for stories of interest and email them to me. Scan for hacked, hacking
      cracked, cracking, defacement, DoS attack, Cyber cyberwar, etc as an
      example.
      
      CGI and PERL script programming
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I'd like to make the zine contents searchable by keyword/issue online
      and also display the indexes of online copies of the newsletter. If
      you have any ideas for this let me know, I could do it myself but If
      you already have a project laying around that would do for this then
      why reeinvent the wheel?
      
      Also; data grabbers that will snag the news from sites like HNN and
      strip the HTML off and email the raw news data, etc, headline collectors
      for security-focus and packetstorm etc are all also good ideas.
      
      Theres more of course, if you have something you'd like to contribute
      let me know and i'll find something for you to do. Thanks for listening

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you
    ~~~~~~~  are reading this from some interesting places, make my day and 
             get a mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that 
             some places it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and
             money be a cool dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard 
             preferably one that has some scenery from your place of 
             residence for my collection, I collect stamps too so you kill
             two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a postcard,
             return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) 
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner 
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc 
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

      I love the newsletter, read every edition. but your site sucks. now i 
      don't blame you, a lot of people have problems with good site design. I do 
      web design as a part time job, and I'd like (just to be nice, for money of 
      course.) to redo the site, if that's ok with you, I could leach the site 
      down, but i think it'd be easier if you could just zip it up and send it to 
      me. if you like my revisions feel free to keep them. if not, that's ok too, 
      i just thought that I'd put in the offer. Think it over. thanks for listening.

     It sure does suck, its getting pretty shoddy and out dated looking, a tad
     ragged around the edges, i've done some minor patch-up mods to make things
     better but don't have time to work on it in a major way, perhaps we can get
     something going here... - Ed

     Hack Takes Aim at AOL Clients 
     
     Wired News Report 
     5:30 p.m. 24.Jan.2000 PST A security breach on AOL Instant Messenger put 
     the privacy of AIM users at risk on Monday, according to a published 
     report. 

     The breach, first reported in Salon, allows subscribers to link new AOL 
     accounts to AIM names that already exist. Holes in the sign-up process 
     allow people to get around the password protection of the AIM accounts. 

     "We are aware of it and are deploying security measures to defeat it," said 
     Rich D'Amato, a spokesman for AOL. 

     AOL's online service is used to changed passwords, so hackers are easily 
     able to open new accounts using the existing AIM user's name. 

     People who subscribe to AOL are not affected by the breach. People who use 
     instant messaging software (AIM) outside of AOL, are. 

     D'Amato called the security breach an example of "hacker behavior that 
     crosses the line into illegal action." 

     "Our intention is to investigate this and when we identify an individual or 
     groups of individuals, we intend to bring this to the attention of the 
     proper law enforcement authorities," D'Amato said. 

     He declined to speculate on when the problem will be fixed or how many 
     users were affected, although he characterized it as "a very small number." 

     David Cassel, who edits the AOL Watch mailing list, claimed the security 
     hole was easily preventable. It was simply a matter of someone thinking 
     through the sign-on process. 

     "AOL left a gaping hole in the way they implemented it," Cassel wrote in an 
     email. "Those who happened to have an AOL account weren't vulnerable, but 
     everyone else was. To promote such an easily cracked software really 
     violates any reasonable expectation of security. In that sense, all AIM 
     users were affected." 

     "AOL is a marketing company, not a technology company," Cassel wrote. 
     "They mass-promoted a software that's vulnerable to easy attacks."

     Hackers attack Japanese government sites      By Reuters Special to CNET 
     News.com January 25, 2000, 11:40 a.m. PT 

     TOKYO--Japanese officials suffered an embarrassment today when hackers 
     penetrated two government Web sites, leaving a message in one of them 
     criticizing the Japanese government's position on the 1937 Nanjing 
     Massacre.

     Computer systems at Japan's Management and Coordination Agency were raided 
     yesterday, and its home page was replaced with derogatory messages 
     insulting the Japanese in the first-ever hacking of the country's 
     government computer system. 

     The hackers left a message on the Web site in Chinese blasting the Japanese 
     government for refusing to acknowledge that the Nanjing Massacre took 
     place, media reports said. 

     Jiji news agency said it had deciphered the message, which originally came 
     in garbled, to read: "The Chinese people must speak up to protest the 
     Japanese government for refusing to acknowledge the historical misdeed of 
     the 1937 Nanjing Massacre." 

     Hundreds and thousand of civilians were massacred by Imperial Army troops 
     during the 1937-38 occupation of the central Chinese city. 

     A meeting by ultrarightist Japanese in Osaka last weekend to whitewash the 
     incident, also called the Rape of Nanking, has whipped up new anger in 
     China, where hundreds marched through the streets of Nanjing to denounce 
     the conference. 

     The Chinese government lodged protests about the gathering. But the 
     Japanese government, which acknowledges that the incident was no 
     fabrication as some ultrarightists claim, failed to bar the group from 
     holding the weekend meeting. 

     A similar hacking incident occurred on Japan's Science and Technology 
     Agency's home page. Agency officials declined to give details of the 
     messages but said the home page was also replaced with a direct access 
     switch to adult magazine Web sites. 

     Top government spokesman Mikio Aoki said the government would launch an 
     extensive investigation into the hacking incidents, including possible help 
     from Washington, which is more advanced in dealing with hackers. 

     "The government must take all necessary measures including seeking help 
     from the United States," Aoki said at a news conference. 

     Officials said it was not immediately clear whether the same hacker was 
     responsible for the two separate cases of infiltration.

     Who gets your trust?
     
     Security breaches can come from those you least suspect
     
     Summary
     
     Systems administrators have extraordinary access to all the data on corporate
     systems. What can be done to ensure that your administrators will not betray
     that trust? 
     
     WIZARD'S GUIDE TO SECURITY
     By Carole Fennelly
     
     In the business world you will often hear the statement "We don't hire
     hackers." When pressed for a reason, the speaker usually reveals a fear that a
     "hacker" will install a back door in the system. Time and time again, however,
     I have seen back doors installed by employees or security professionals whose
     integrity is never questioned. When confronted, they usually say it's no big
     deal. After all, they have the root password. They just wanted to set up a root
     account with a different environment. That's not hacking, right? Wrong. Their
     intention did not matter -- the security of the system has been bypassed. 
     
      This article discusses how administrative privileges can be abused and
     suggests some methods for countering that abuse. It is not meant to imply that
     every administrator abuses privileges or has malicious intent -- just that you
     shouldn't assume anything. 
     
     What is a back door?
     
      Quite simply, a back door is a method for gaining access to a system that
     bypasses the usual security mechanisms. (Has everyone seen WarGames?)
     Programmers and administrators love to stick back doors in so they can access
     the system quickly to fix problems. Usually, they rely on obscurity to provide
     security. Think of approaching a building with an elaborate security system
     that does bio scans, background checks, the works. Someone who doesn't have
     time to go through all that might just rig up a back exit so they can step out
     for a smoke -- and then hope no one finds out about it. 
     
      In computer systems, a back door can be installed on a terminal server to
     provide direct access to the console remotely, saving the administrator a trip
     to the office. It can also be a program set up to invoke system privileges from
     a nonprivileged account. 
     
      A simple back door is an account set up in the /etc/passwd file that looks
     like any other userid. The difference is that this userid doesn't have to su to
     root (and it won't show up in /var/adm/sulog) -- it already is root: 
     
     auser:x:0:101:Average User :/home/auser:/bin/ksh 
     
     If you don't see it, look again at the third field (userid) and compare it to
     the root account. They are the same (0). If you are restricting direct root
     logins to the console only (via /etc/default/login), then this account will
     have the same limitation. The difference is that if someone does su to this
     account, it will not be apparent in /var/adm/sulog that it is root. Also, a
     change to the root password will not affect the account. Even if the person who
     installed the account intends no harm, he or she has left a security hole. 
     
      It is also pretty common for an administrator to abuse the /.rhosts file by
     putting in desktop systems "temporarily." These have a way of becoming
     permanent. 
     
      Back doors can also be set up in subtler ways though SUID 0 programs (which
     set the userid to root). Usually, the motivation for setting up back doors is
     one of expediency. The administrator is just trying to get a job done as
     quickly as possible. Problems arise later when either (1) he leaves under
     normal circumstances and the hole remains or (2) he leaves under bad
     circumstances and wants revenge. 
     
     Proprietary data
     
      A manager may also be reluctant to hire "hackers" for fear that they may
     divulge proprietary information or take copies of proprietary data. Several
     years ago, I was consulting at a company when a new administrator joined the
     group. In an effort to ingratiate himself with the team, he confided that he
     had kept the backup tapes from his old job (a competitor) and that they had
     some "really cool tools." It so happened that a consultant with my own business
     worked at the competitor's site. A scan of the tape revealed the proprietary
     software that the administrator had been working on, which eventually sold for
     a significant amount of money. While the admin probably did not intend to steal
     the software, his actions could have left his new employer facing a large
     lawsuit -- all for the sake of a few shell scripts. In this particular case, no
     one believed that the administrator had any ulterior motives. I wonder if
     people would have felt that way if he had been a "known hacker"? 
     
     System monitoring
     
      Administrators are supposed to monitor system logs. How else can problems be
     investigated? But there is a difference between monitoring logs for a
     legitimate reason and monitoring them to satisfy prurient curiosity. Using the
     system log files to monitor a particular user's behavior for no good reason is
     an abuse of privileges. 
     
      What is a good reason? Your manager asks you to monitor specific logs. Or
     maybe you notice suspicious activities, in which case you should inform the
     management. Or, more commonly, a user complains about a problem and you are
     trying to solve it. What is a bad reason? A user ticks you off and you want to
     see how he is spending company time. Or a user has a prominent position in the
     company and you want to know what kinds of Websites she goes to. 
     
     Countermeasures
     
     You can take some actions to ensure the integrity of privileged users, but
     none of them carries any guarantee. 
     
     Background checks
     
     You can have an investigative agency run a background check on an individual
     and you can require drug tests. These tell you only about past behavior (if the
     individual has been caught). 
     
      The state of New Jersey (where I live) has adopted a law commonly referred to
     as Megan's Law (see Resources). The law mandates that a community be notified
     of any convicted sex offender living in the community. On the surface, it
     sounds like a great idea and a way to protect children from predators. 
     
      As a parent, I am particularly sensitive to crimes against children. I
     received a Megan's Law notification this past year about a convicted sex
     offender who moved into town. It did not change a thing for me. My feeling is
     that every child molester has to have had a first time and that in any case not
     all molesters have been identified. Therefore, I take appropriate precautions
     with my children, regardless of who has moved to the area. 
     
      In the technical field, hackers are considered the molesters. (Yes, I know
     all about the politically correct terms cracker, defacer, etc., but the common
     term these days is hacker.) How do you know if someone is a "hacker"? Some
     people try to refine the term to mean "someone who has been convicted of a
     computer crime." But let's say, for example, that you attend Defcon, the
     hackers' conference, and encounter an intelligent job seeker with bright blue
     hair and funky clothes. Would you hire him? Chances are that you would at least
     scrutinize his credentials and make sure your contract spelled out all details
     of the work to be performed and the legal repercussions for any violations.
     What if the same person showed up for an interview with the blue dye rinsed out
     and in a nice pressed suit? Be honest: would you perform the same background
     checks regardless of a person's appearance? 
     
     Technical measures
     
     Some technical software packages can limit or control superuser privileges. I
     recommend using them to prevent the inadvertent abuse of superuser privilege.
     Unfortunately, knowledgeable administrators and programmers with privileged
     access will be able to circumvent these measures if they really want to. 
     
     
     sudo
     
     The freely available sudo package provides more granular control over the
     system by restricting which privileged commands can be run on a user basis. See
     Resources for the Sudo main page, which has a more complete description. 
     
     
     Tripwire
     
     Tripwire is a file integrity package that, following the policy determined by
     the administrator, reports any changes made to critical files. Tripwire was
     originally developed at Purdue University by Gene Kim under the direction of
     Eugene Spafford. I plan to evaluate the merits of the commercial version of
     Tripwire in a future column. Tripwire is a good way for an administrator to
     tell whether the system files or permissions have been modified. 
     
      What can be done, however, if the senior administrator who monitors the
     system has malicious intent?
     
     Professionalism
     
     The best defense against the abuse of administrator privileges is to rely on a
     certain level of professionalism. The medical Hippocratic oath includes the
     mandate Do No Harm. While there is no such professional oath for systems
     administrators, you can establish guidelines for acceptable behavior. During
     the mid-1980s, I worked as an administrator in a computer center at a large
     telecommunications research facility. We had a code of ethics that a user had
     to sign before an account could be installed. We also had a code of ethics for
     privileged users that included additional restrictions, such as: 
     
     No SUID 0 (set userid to root) programs will be installed without the
     consent, in writing, of the senior administrator. 
     
     All users' email is to be considered private and confidential and may not be
     read by anyone other than the intended recipient. 
     
     Users' files may not be modified or read except in the case of a
     predetermined problem or security investigation. Be prepared to justify. 
     
     Privileged users are often entrusted with sensitive information, such as an
     employee termination, before other employees. This information is to be kept
     confidential. 
     
     The root passwords are changed monthly and are to be distributed by the
     senior administrator only. The passwords must be kept in a safe location, such
     as your wallet. If the password is lost, notify the senior administrator or
     your manager immediately. 
     
     Keystroke monitoring of user activities is strictly prohibited without senior
     management approval, in writing. 
     
     
     All administrative procedures and tools are to be considered proprietary
     information and are the property of the computer center. 
     
     Tape archives may not be removed from the facility without written approval.
     
     Discretion
     
     A code of ethics for privileged users should not be considered a punitive
     device, but rather a statement about the integrity of the person who signs it.
     At one point during my years in the computer center, the secretary to the
     president of the company came to me with a printer problem. As I was assisting
     her, she became upset when she realized that the test job she had sent to the
     printer was highly confidential. I was able to reassure her that all
     administrators were bound by a code of ethics and would be terminated for
     violations. (Besides, I wasn't really reading it, I was just looking for
     garbage characters!) Professionals must establish a certain level of trust.
     This is especially important for those privy to sensitive information regarding
     terminations or investigations. 
     
     Final thoughts
     
     Would I hire someone who showed up for an interview with blue hair, body
     piercings, and a name like 3v1l HaK0rZ? No. Not because he might install a back
     door, but because he was ignorant about what was acceptable on Wall Street. As
     for the back doors? More are installed by well-groomed "professionals" in suits
     than by "hackers." Anyone with the required skills can be either a "security
     consultant" or a "hacker." The only difference is the label.

03.0  Slash, Croatian cracker, speaks out
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      The following is from one of the last defacements that Slash has done, he
      has since renounced defacing and is starting a new security group called
      b0f (Buffer Overflow) we'll keep you posted as this develops. - Ed
      
      
      Defaced by slash [ 2.1.2000 ] Original site here 
      
      (http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/2000/01/08/www.badjura-petri.com/index-old.html)
      
      www.badjura-petri.com - I got some interesting mail in the last few days that I
      want to share with You. The first one is from a Security Consultant David Hove, who
      works for a company named "RISCmanagment Inc." (www.riscman.com), and this is
      what he wrote to me in his mail :
      
      ------
      
      Numb Nuts, 
      
      Your judgments lay upon broken young souls who know no better. Let it be! Hackers
      will hack regardless of holes previously exploited. If the sys adm does not fix their
      holes this is not the issue. Hacking for fame is not the issue. You yourself mailed your
      hack in for recognition did you not. STOP THE HYPOCRISY AND SIMPLY HACK. Who
      the hell are U to dictate what should be placed on a defaced website? I personally
      work the other side of the fence specializing in keeping you out but thoroughly enjoy
      watching you and others like you go about your daily routine. Exploiting port 80,
      buffer overflows, running your little scripts, ect. Fuck ethics! The harder you try to
      hack the more aware we become as admins. For those admins who do not keep up
      Fuckem!

      Security Consultant

      RISCmanagement Inc.                                                                           
      www.riscman.com
      
      -------
      
      
      Deer Mr. David, your email made me very sad because I realized that people don't
      get the message I'm trying to say. Hacking previously hacked sites is considered lame,
      and yes, hacking for fame is the issue. Hackers now adays hack only to get media
      attention. In my country a 16 year old Back Orifice user was raided for "hacking" a
      computer of a Croatian politian. The media made a national hero out of him. In the
      interview he said that he could hack into a bank with just two of his friends and a
      good computer. Now, people who read that newspaper bought the story, but people
      who know young Denis via IRC can confirm that he is a complete idiot an a lamer. His
      parents are so proud of him, not knowing that anyone can "hack" using Back
      Orifice.        
      
      About me mailing my hack to attrition. Yes, I did mail the hack to attrition, you
      know why !? I deface to spread the message out. I personally think if I just deface
      the site that people wont notice it. So I report it to attrition and they put a mirror of
      the site I defaced so other people can view it too. I don't do it for the fame. I could
      hack under a different name everytime, but this is my style. I don't got braging on IRC
      "I hacked this..", "I hacked that..". I don't have to prove my skillz to anyone. People
      can respect me or hate me. I sincerely doubt that defacing a site will make me look
      better infront of my friends. Almost anyone can find himself a remote exploit and run it
      against the server. But not anyone can secure a Unix server, program or even make
      html. For me defacing is just expressing my opinion on stuff, nothing more.
      
      About 'fuck the ethics' thing. Mr. David, the ethics are here to prevent a major
      chaos. Without ethics people would just go around and delete anything they run into.
      I suggest every hacker to stick to the ethics as close as he can, hell, that's why they
      were written. I know people forget about them, but there are always people like me
      to remind hackers about the ethics. That's the balance. People don't stick to them,
      they life stupid messages like "I 0wn3 j00". I tell You people, that's bad. Can't You
      just write something. Anything, just not these stupid irritating messages. Ok, we
      started another discussion here. "Who the hell are U to dictate what should be placed
      on a defaced website?" - You say. Well, Your right. I'm nobody. I can't dictate what
      should be placed on a defaced website. But I can suggest people not to do it. I just
      suggested it, I didn't dictate or order it.
      
      "The harder you try to hack the more aware we become as admins." - Aware ?! If
      I deface Your site ten times, and don't tell You how I got in, You become more aware
      !? I damage Your company for 10.000 $ by defacing it, because people say: "How can
      they secure my server when they can't even secure their own." And nobody wants
      Your service anymore. Don't get me wrong. I'm sure You're a very good and
      experienced administrator, but nothing is secure enough, that hackers can't brake it. 
      
      That's what we devoted Our lives to, penetrating systems. I enjoy hacking. That
      is really something unique. People through ages have always wanted to do something
      that's forbidden or illegal. Just remind Yourself of Adam & Eve, and the Heaven
      garden. Eve had to eat that apple alldo God gave them everything they needed, and
      just forbid them to eat apples from that tree. Hacking is illegal in many countries. You
      could get worse sentence for hacking than for murdering someone.  I don't really care
      if I get raided.  Hacking is my crime. A crime out of passion. Respect me or hate me,
      the choice is Yours.
      
                                                                      - Peace out, slash

04.0  The hacker sex chart 2000
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      This was to be included in the last issue but attrition was down (only
      source I know of that carries it) so here it is in its glory. 
      
      *********** WARNING: Explicit content **************************************

       for updates, additions, or to be put on the sexchart mailing list, 
         mail crank@ice.net.
       to receive the latest version on efnet irc, "/msg lifelike sexchart".
      
       a link is denoted by any sexual action between computer users that is
         capable of spreading an std, from wet kissing on up.
      
       the last .05 of revisions is listed at the bottom.
      
       since the chart has grown so much, it's been extended in a strange way.
         to preserve the 78 column width, there is now a secondary chart beneath
         the first. people whose names appear between asterisks (*) in the first
         chart also exist in the second.

      unconfirmed links:
      
      these are links i've been told more than twice to add, but have then been 
        told by others to remove once they're on the chart.  each link stays for
        six months, & if no one can prove it's valid in that time, it is 
        removed & assumed untrue.
      if you bore witness to one of these links or know someone who did, mail
        crank@ice.net with your confession!
      
      (no unconfirmed links at this time.)

      notable gross things on the chart:
      
      this is a section for easy reference to family members on the chart.  the
        end people are the relation as noted.  if you know two people on the big
        loop are in the same family, mail crank@ice.net & let us rejoice in the
        incest!

05.0  Peer finally arrested after over a decade of connection resetting
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From http://www.ircnews.com/
      
      (Humour, in case you didn't know a common connection error is
      "connection reset by peer" caused by errors in the network and on
      occasion a DoS attack on your IRC connection... ;) - Ed)
      
      Peer Arrested, Charged With Resetting Connections

       SEATTLE, WA - An exhaustive eight month cyberhunt
       ended shortly before dawn on January 14th, 2000, as FBI
       agents and Washington State Troopers apprehended the
       elusive chatroom terrorist known only as Peer. 

       The IRC menace was brought to justice after a
       decade-long connection resetting spree that plagued
       chatters around the globe. FBI officials said the number of
       reset connections numbered in the "millions". 

       Connections being reset by peer were the number one
       cause of interupted chat sessions on all major IRC
       networks in 1999. 

       Undernet ChanServ Committee member Morrissey told
       IRCNews.com, "What set peer apart was the element of
       suprise. With ping, you kinda knew you were gonna time
       out. You could tell. Peer totally got you out of nowhere." 

       Leland, another bigshot on the Undernet IRC network,
       praised the FBI for their work, "How many idle times must
       be ruined? How many cybersex sessions must be cut
       short before we put an end to Peer and his shinanigans?" 

       Peer's lawyers criticized Leland's use of the word
       "shinanigans". 

       Peer's lead defence attorney responded, "Really, I think
       we can come up with a better term than that. We're all
       adults here. Besides, it's 'alleged' shinanigans." 

       Federal Prosecutor Sarah Evans told IRCNews.com she
       intends to "throw the book" at Peer. If convicted on all
       counts, Peer could spend up to the next three years on
       probation. 

       "His ass is mine.", claimed a motivated Evans. "With any
       luck, we'll get that judge who handled the Mitnick case."

07.0  Rant: Mitnick to go wireless?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Editorial, by Cruciphux
      
      Jan 23rd 2000      
                         
      
      Finally the long awaited release of ueber hacker Kevin Mitnick has
      arrived, he was released Friday Jan. 21st in the morning and is not
      allowed to touch computers or cellular phones for a period of three
      years without express permission of his probation officer.
      
      Kevin holds out one hope though, earlier in his 'carreer' Kevin was
      an avid amateur radio operator and his license recently expired, he
      is reportedly scrambling to obtain a new one. This poses some very
      interesting questions, will he be allowed to operate his HAM equipment?
      
      Packet Radio 
      
      For those not in the know myself and several HWA members are also
      HAM operators, most of us got hooked by the prospect of a technology
      called "packet radio". The internet runs on a protocol known as X.25
      packet radio uses a similar methodology known as AX.25, the "A" denotes
      "A"mateur. We're some of the few people that have actually IRC'ed 
      using a packet radio link to a unix server over the 2m band, but of
      course this requires a computer and additional computer equipment hooked
      to the radio gear necessary to run packet, what if we forget all that
      since it is out of Kevin's reach to own a computer at this time and look
      at what other 'trouble' he can get into.
      
      Repeater Nets and the Autopatch
      
      The radios of choice these days among young hams are dual band HT's (short
      for handy-talky or 'walky-talkie') these will usually cover the 2m band
      and the 440 cm bands, the 2m band by itself is the most common band in use
      and operates a great deal using repeaters. A repeater can be compared to
      a cell site insomuch as it takes a weak signal (the HT, generally 100mw to
      4 watts in power, much like small cell phones) and REPEATS or re-broadcasts
      on another (close) frequency a stronger signal, thus reaching greater 
      range. With special DTMF codes it is possible to LINK repeaters and talk
      across the country using repeater nets.
      
      Whats so great about this?, apart from the obvious ability to talk to people
      long distances for little to no cost, many repeaters have the magic box
      known as an AUTOPATCH. The autopatch is a computer interface at the repeater
      site that interfaces your radio signals with a TELCO line. (aha!). Yes
      many hams enjoy the priviledges (minus obvious privacy and anonymity) of
      'cellular' or 'radio phone' useage for minimal cost. For a GOOD radio you
      are looking at an investment around $500 and for a HAM club membership
      (to get all the repeater and autopatch codes etc) you're looking at around
      $15/year or you can find the codes posted in many places on the web.
      
      Caveats / privacy
      
      The airwaves are 'public property' and as such are regulated (for our own 
      good of course) by big brother, that being the FCC in the U.S.A or DOC in
      Canada. When you pass your licensing test (minimal proficiency in electronics
      and general radio theory must be demonstrated via written test) you will be
      assigned a unique CALL SIGN (in some places you can request a custom/vanity
      sequence but will be allocated a random unused call if your request is being
      used). Since the airwaves are public property, so are the records of those 
      users that are licensed to broadcast on them. Several online databases exist
      or can be purchased cheaply on CDROM with many search features like search by
      name, call address, partials etc... in this case a simple search on the QRZ
      website (http://www.qrz.com/) in the OLD database for "Kevin Mitnick" returns
      several possible matches, among them the correct one which is listed below.
      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      Callbook Data for N6NHG
      The following information is taken from the March 1993 QRZ Ham Radio
      Callsign Database. This is not the current information for this callsign.
      Click on the underlined callsign to see the latest information for this
      record. 
      
      
      Callsign:   N6NHG
      Class:      General
      Name:       KEVIN D MITNICK  
      Effective:  12 Dec 1989 
      Expires:    12 Dec 1999 
      Address:    14744 LEADWELL ST 
      City/State: VAN NUYS CA 91405 
      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      We can safely assume this is correct since the initials (KDM) are right and
      the location matches up along with the license renewal date of 12/12/99.
      
      Shennanigans
      
      
      How does Kevin fit into all this? well as you can see, it is possible to
      interface the radio with computer equipment and also manipulate outside
      phone lines using ham radios, a recurring problem in these parts were pirate
      operators making bogus 911 calls using the local CN-Tower's (then public or
      'open' autopatch - it now requires a code and subaudible PL tone) actually
      closed down the repeater site for some time and caused unknown harassing
      traffic to the 911 operators fielding the bogus calls.
      
      The pirate is not totally safe however. much like Kevin was apprehended by
      Tsutomu thru lax use of his cellphone and some radio direction finding gear
      (RDF) so can the 2m pirate be tracked through RDF triangulation, several
      grass roots groups do nothing but track down pirate signals or sometimes for
      competition, random placed signals, in what is known as the 'Fox Hunt'. But
      this requires lots of manpower and the willingness to get out there and help
      do some tracking.
      
      Epilogue
      
      I truly hope Kevin is allowed to get back into one of his lifetime loves but
      he may find that there are too many caveats with new features and computer
      integration into the repeater systems, mailboxes and the like are common place
      on repeaters, and so are email gateways, so it is conceivable that one could

     Intruders Get Under A Network's
     Skin
     (11/30/99, 5:40 p.m. ET) By Rutrell Yasin, InternetWeek 

     A rise in rogue distributed denial of service
     tools being installed on networks by intruders
     has prompted the Computer Emergency
     Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center
     to help companies thwart the large coordinated
     packet flooding attacks. 

     CERT, a watchguard organization, has issued an
     advisory on two tools--trinoo and Tribe Flood Network
     (TFN)--after receiving reports from organizations
     affected by the tools. 

     The tools "appear to be undergoing active development,
     testing, and deployment on the Internet," according to a
     CERT incident note. 

     So far, the tools have been installed on thousands of
     servers or workstations in about 100 enterprise sites, said
     Kevin Houle, CERT's incident response team leader. 

     While the type of packet flooding attacks the tools
     generate are not new, the scope of the attacks can have
     a devastating impact on an enterprise network, industry
     experts and IT managers agreed. 

     Both trinoo and TFN enable an intruder to launch
     coordinated attacks from many sources against one or
     more targets. In essence, the tools use bandwidth from
     multiple systems on diverse networks to generate potent
     attacks. 

     The tools "can generate very large denial of service
     attacks that consume as much as one gigabyte of data
     per second," said Houle. To put that in perspective:
     Rather than using one BB gun to hit a target, a hacker
     now has the equivalent of 1,000 BB guns, Houle said. 

     Or the effects can be more like a shotgun, said Mike
     Hagger, vice president of security at Oppenheimer
     Funds. These tools can "be deadly and can bring a
     company to its knees in a matter of seconds," Hagger
     said. 

     These rogue distributed tools are usually installed on host
     servers that have been compromised by exploiting known
     security holes, such as various Remote Procedural Call
     vulnerabilities, according to CERT. 

     Trinoo is used to launch coordinated UDP flood attacks
     from many sources. A trinoo network consists of a small
     number of servers and a large number of clients. To
     initiate an attack, an intruder connects to a trinoo server
     and instructs it to launch an attack against one or more
     IP addresses. The trinoo server then communicates with
     the clients, giving them instructions to attack one or more
     IP addresses for a specified period of time, CERT said. 

     In addition to UDP flood attacks, TFN can generate
     TCP SYN flood, ICMPecho request flood, and ICMP
     directed broadcasts or smurf attacks. The tool can
     generate packets with spoofed source IP addresses. To
     launch an attack with TFN, an intruder instructs a client
     or server program to send attack instructions to a list of
     TFN servers or clients. 

     In its alert, CERT has issued a number of steps IT
     managers can take to thwart distributed denial of service
     attacks. To prevent installation of distributed attack tools
     on networked systems, users should stay up to date with
     security patches to operating systems and applications
     software. 

     IT managers should also continuously monitor their
     networks for signature of distributed attack tools. For
     example, if a company uses intrusion detection systems,
     IT should tune it to recognize signs of trinoo or TFN
     activity. 

     Since a site under attack may be unable to communicate
     via the Internet during an attack, security policies should
     include "out of the band communications with upstream
     network operators or emergency response teams,"
     CERT advised.

     Distributed Denial of Service Tools

     Updated: December 8, 1999 (added DSIT Workshop paper and IN-99-05)
     Thursday, November 18, 1999

     Overview

     We have received reports of intruders installing distributed denial of
     service tools. Tools we have encountered utilize distributed technology
     to create large networks of hosts capable of launching large coordinated
     packet flooding denial of service attacks. 

     We have seen distributed tools installed on hosts that have been 
     compromised due to exploitation of known vulnerabilities. In particular, 
     we have seen vulnerabilities in various RPC services exploited. For more
     information see the following CERT Incident Notes: 

          IN-99-04, Similar Attacks Using Various RPC Services 
          IN-99-05, Systems Compromised Through a Vulnerability in am-utils 

     Two of the tools we have seen are known as trinoo (or trin00) and tribe
     flood network (or TFN). These tools appear to be undergoing active 
     development, testing, and deployment on the Internet. 

     Descriptions

          Trinoo 
          Tribe Flood Network 


     Trinoo 

     Trinoo is a distributed tool used to launch coordinated UDP flood denial 
     of service attacks from many sources. For more information about various 
     UDP flood attacks, please see CERT Advisory CA-96.01. A trinoo network 
     consists of a small number of servers, or masters, and a large number of
     clients, or daemons. 

     A denial of service attack utilizing a trinoo network is carried out by
     an intruder connecting to a trinoo master and instructing that master to
     launch a denial of service attack against one or more IP addresses. The 
     trinoo master then communicates with the daemons giving instructions to 
     attack one or more IP addresses for a specified period of time. 

        1.intruder -------> master; destination port 27665/tcp 
        2.master -------> daemons; destination port 27444/udp 
        3.daemons -------> UDP flood to target with randomized destination ports 

     The binary for the trinoo daemon contains IP addresses for one or more 
     trinoo master. When the trinoo daemon is executed, the daemon announces
     it's availability by sending a UDP packet containing the string "*HELLO*"
     to it's programmed trinoo master IP addresses. 

          daemon -------> masters; destination port 31335/udp 

     The trinoo master stores a list of known daemons in an encrypted file 
     named "..." in the same directory as the master binary. The trinoo master
     can be instructed to send a broadcast request to all known daemons to 
     confirm availability.
     Daemons receiving the broadcast respond to the master with a UDP packet 
     containing the string "PONG". 

        1.intruder -------> master; destination port 27665/tcp 
        2.master -------> daemons; destination port 27444/udp 
        3.daemons -------> master; destination port 31335/udp 

     All communications to the master on port 27665/tcp require a password,
     which is stored in the daemon binary in encrypted form. All communications
     with the daemon on port 27444/udp require the UDP packet to contain the 
     string "l44" (that's a lowercase L, not a one). 

     The source IP addresses of the packets in a trinoo-generated UDP flood 
     attack are not spoofed in versions of the tool we have seen. Future 
     versions of the tool could implement IP source address spoofing. 
     Regardless, a trinoo-generated denial of service attack will most likely
     appear to come from a large number of different source addresses. 

     We have seen trinoo daemons installed under a variety of different names,
     but most commonly as 

          ns 
          http 
          rpc.trinoo 
          rpc.listen 
          trinix 
          rpc.irix 
          irix 

     Running strings against the daemon and master binaries produces output 
     similar to this (we have replaced master IP address references in the 
     daemon binary with X.X.X.X)

      Tribe Flood Network 

      TFN, much like Trinoo, is a distributed tool used to launch coordinated 
      denial of service attacks from many sources against one or more targets.
      In additional to being able to generate UDP flood attacks, a TFN network
      can also generate TCP SYN flood, ICMP echo request flood, and ICMP 
      directed broadcast (e.g., smurf) denial of service attacks. TFN has 
      the capability to generate packets with spoofed source IP addresses. 
      Please see the following CERT Advisories for more information about 
      these types of denial of service attacks. 

                        CA-96.01, TCP SYN Flooding and IP Spoofing Attacks 
                        CA-98.01, "smurf" IP Denial of Service Attacks 

      A denial of service attack utilizing a TFN network is carried out by an
      intruder instructing a client, or master, program to send attack 
      instructions to a list of TFN servers, or daemons. The daemons then
      generate the specified type of denial of service attack against one
      or more target IP addresses. Source IP addresses and source ports can
      be randomized, and packet sizes can be altered. 

      A TFN master is executed from the command line to send commands to TFN
      daemons. The master communicates with the daemons using ICMP echo reply
      packets with 16 bit binary values embedded in the ID field, and any 
      arguments embedded in the data portion of packet. The binary values, 
      which are definable at compile time, represent the various instructions
      sent between TFN masters and daemons. 

      Use of the TFN master requires an intruder-supplied list of IP addresses
      for the daemons. Some reports indicate recent versions of TFN master may
      use blowfish encryption to conceal the list of daemon IP addresses. 
      Reports also indicate that TFN may have remote file copy (e.g., rcp)
      functionality, perhaps for use for automated deployment of new TFN 
      daemons and/or software version updating in existing TFN networks. 

      We have seen TFN daemons installed on systems using the filename td. 
      Running strings on the TFN daemon binary produces output similar to this. 

                   %d.%d.%d.%d
                   ICMP

      Solutions

      Distributed attack tools leverage bandwidth from multiple systems on 
      diverse networks to produce very potent denial of service attacks. To
      a victim, an attack may appear to come from many different source 
      addresses, whether or not IP source address spoofing is employed by
      the attacker. Responding to a distributed attack requires a high degree
      of communication between Internet sites. Prevention is not straight 
      forward because of the interdependency of site security on the Internet;
      the tools are typically installed on compromised systems that are outside
      of the administrative control of eventual denial of service attack targets. 

      There are some basic suggestions we can make regarding distributed denial
      of service attacks: 

      Prevent installation of distributed attack tools on your systems 
      Remain current with security-related patches to operating systems and
      applications software. Follow security best-practices when administrating
      networks and systems. 

      Prevent origination of IP packets with spoofed source addresses 

      For a discussion of network ingress filtering, refer to RFC 2267, Network
      Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP 
      Source Address Spoofing 

      Monitor your network for signatures of distributed attack tools 

      Sites using intrusion detection systems (e.g., IDS) may wish to establish
      patterns to look for that might indicate trinoo or TFN activity based on 
      the communications between master and daemon portions of the tools. Sites
      who use pro-active network scanning may wish to include tests for installed
      daemons and/or masters when scanning systems on your network. 

      if you find a distributed attack tool on your systems 

      It is important to determine the role of the tools installed on your system.
      The piece you find may provide information that is useful in locating and 
      disabling other parts of distributed attack networks. We encourage you to 
      identify and contact other sites involved. 

      If you are involved in a denial of service attack 

      Due to the potential magnitude of denial of service attacks generated by 
      distributed networks of tools, the target of an attack may be unable to 
      rely on Internet connectivity for communications during an attack. Be 
      sure your security policy includes emergency out-of-band communications
      procedures with upstream network operators or emergency response teams 
      in the event of a debilitating attack. 

      In November 1999, experts addressed issues surrounding distributed-systems
      intruder tools. The DSIT Workshop produced a paper where workshop 
      participants examine the use of distributed-system intruder tools and provide
      information about protecting systems from attack by the tools, detecting the 
      use of the tools, and responding to attacks.

      ISS Security Alert
      February 9, 2000
      
      Denial of Service Attack using the TFN2K and Stacheldraht programs
             
      
      Synopsis:
      
      A new form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack has been
      discovered following the release of the trin00 and Tribe Flood Network (TFN)
      denial of service programs (see December 7, 1999 ISS Security Alert at
      http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise40.php3). These attacks are more powerful
      than any previous denial of service attack observed on the Internet. A
      Distributed Denial of Service attack is designed to bring a network down by
      flooding target machines with large amounts of traffic. This traffic can
      originate from many compromised machines, and can be managed remotely using
      a client program. ISS X-Force considers this attack a high risk since it can
      potentially impact a large number of organizations. DDoS attacks have proven
      to be successful and are difficult to defend against.
      
      Description:
      
      Over the last two months, several high-capacity commercial and educational
      networks have been affected by DDoS attacks.  In addition to the trin00 and
      TFN attacks, two additional tools are currently being used to implement this
      attack: TFN2K and Stacheldraht. Both of these tools are based on the
      original TFN/trin00 attacks described in the December ISS Security Alert.
      
      Attackers can install one of these DDoS programs (trin00, TFN, TFN2K, or
      Stacheldraht) on hundreds of compromised machines and direct this network of
      machines to initiate an attack against single or multiple victims. This
      attack occurs simultaneously from these machines, making it more dangerous
      than any DoS attack launched from a single machine.
       
      
      Technical Information:
      
      TFN2K:
      The TFN2K distributed denial of service system consists of a client/server
      architecture.
      
      The Client:
      The client is used to connect to master servers, which can then perform
      specified attacks against one or more victim machines. Commands are sent
      from the client to the master server within the data fields of ICMP, UDP,
      and TCP packets. The data fields are encrypted using the CAST algorithm and
      base64 encoded. The client can specify the use of random TCP/UDP port
      numbers and source IP addresses. The system can also send out "decoy"
      packets to non-target machines. These factors make TFN2K more difficult to
      detect than the original TFN program.
      
      The Master Server: 
      The master server parses all UDP, TCP, and ICMP echo reply packets for
      encrypted commands. The master server does not use a default password when
      it is selected by the user at compile time.
      
      The Attack:
      The TFN2K client can be used to send various commands to the master for
      execution, including commands to flood a target machine or set of target
      machines within a specified address range. The client can send commands
      using UDP, SYN, ICMP echo, and ICMP broadcast packets. These flood attacks
      cause the target machine to slow down because of the processing required to
      handle the incoming packets, leaving little or no network bandwidth.
      Possible methods for detection of these flooding attacks are recommended in
      the TFN/trin00 December 7, 1999 ISS Security Alert. TFN2K can also be used
      to execute remote commands on the master server and bind shells to a
      specified TCP port. 
      
      TFN2K runs on Linux, Solaris, and Windows platforms. 
      
      Stacheldraht (Barbed Wire):
      
      Stacheldraht consists of three parts: the master server, client, and agent
      programs.
      
      The Client:
      The client is used to connect to the master server on port 16660 or port
      60001. Packet contents are blowfish encrypted using the default password
      "sicken", which can be changed by editing the Stacheldraht source code.
      After entering the password, an attacker can use the client to manage
      Stacheldraht agents, IP addresses of attack victims, lists of master
      servers, and to perform DoS attacks against specified machines. 
      
      The Master Server: 
      The master server handles all communication between client and agent
      programs. It listens for connections from the client on port 16660 or 60001.
      When a client connects to the master, the master waits for the password
      before returning information about agent programs to the client and
      processing commands from the client. 
      
      The Agent:
      The agent listens for commands from master servers on port 65000. In
      addition to this port, master server/agent communications are also managed
      using ICMP echo reply packets. These packets are transmitted and replied to
      periodically. They contain specific values in the ID field (such as 666,
      667, 668, and 669) and corresponding plaintext strings in the data fields
      (including "skillz", "ficken", and  "spoofworks"). The ICMP packets act as a
      "heartbeat" between agent and master server, and to determine source IP
      spoofing capabilities of the master server. The agent identifies master
      servers using an internal address list, and an external encrypted file
      containing master server IP addresses. Agents can be directed to "upgrade"
      themselves by downloading a fresh copy of the agent program and deleting the
      old image as well as accepting commands to execute flood attacks against
      target machines.
      
      The Attack:
      Like TFN/TFN2K, Stacheldraht can be used to perform ICMP, SYN, and UDP flood
      attacks. The attacks can run for a specified duration, and SYN floods can be
      directed to a set of specified ports. These flood attacks cause the target
      machine to slow down because of the processing required to handle the
      incoming packets, leaving little or no network bandwidth. Possible methods
      for detection of these flooding attacks are discussed in the TFN/trin00 ISS
      Security Alert published December 7, 1999. 
      
      Stacheldraht runs on Linux and Solaris machines.
      
      Detecting TFN2K/Stacheldraht related attacks:
      
      ISS SAFEsuite intrusion detection solution, RealSecure, detects the Denial
      of Service attacks that these distributed tools use, providing early warning
      and response capabilities. RealSecure can reconfigure firewalls and routers
      to block the traffic. On some firewalls this can be as granular as blocking
      a particular service or protocol port. In conjunction with the December 7,
      1999 ISS Security Alert, RealSecure 3.2.1 included signatures to detect the
      communications between the distributed components of TFN and trin00.
      RealSecure will add signatures to detect TFN2K and Stacheldraht in its next
      release, which will also include an X-press Update capability to speed
      future signature deployment.

      Student charged with hacking

       Fugitive: Prosecutors say he broke into Palo Alto firm, then fled to 
       Bulgaria. 

      BY HOWARD MINTZ Mercury News Staff Writer 

      A federal grand jury in San Jose on Wednesday indicted a former Princeton 
      University student suspected of hacking into the computer system of a Palo 
      Alto e-commerce company and stealing nearly 2,000 credit card numbers.

      In the government's latest attempt to hunt down a computer hacker, federal 
      prosecutors brought charges against Peter Iliev Pentchev, a 22-year-old 
      native of Bulgaria who is believed to have fled the United States after 
      school officials confronted him about his computer activities.

      According to the U.S. Attorney's office in San Jose, Pentchev left the 
      country in late 1998, shortly after the alleged hacking incident occurred. 
      Law enforcement officials believe Pentchev went to Bulgaria and were 
      unclear Wednesday what diplomatic obstacles there may be to returning him 
      to this country to face charges.

      The four-count indictment charges Pentchev with violating federal computer 
      laws by hacking into an undisclosed Palo Alto company between Nov. 20 and 
      Dec. 19, 1998, stealing at least 1,800 credit card numbers, as well as 
      user names and passwords of that company's customers. The indictment does 
      not specify the company, and federal officials declined to name it.

      But Assistant U.S. Attorney Mavis Lee, who is prosecuting the case, said 
      the hacking incident shut down one of the company's Web servers for five 
      days and caused enough chaos in its database that it cost the firm more 
      than $100,000 to restore its security system.

      Authorities have no evidence that Pentchev used the credit card numbers to 
      commit fraud.

      Federal law-enforcement officials do not believe there is a link between 
      Pentchev and a computer intruder who earlier this month attempted to 
      extort $100,000 from Internet music retailer CD Universe, claiming to have 
      stolen as many as 300,000 credit card numbers. The alleged extortionist 
      was suspected of operating somewhere in Eastern Europe.

      That hacker began posting more than 25,000 allegedly stolen card numbers 
      on a web site Christmas Day. The site eventually was shut down, and 
      thousands of customers who had shopped at CD Universe canceled their 
      cards.

      In the Bay Area case, investigators said they were able to trace the 
      computer intrusion to Pentchev because he left evidence in log files in 
      the company's computer system. ``He wasn't careful about mopping up after 
      himself,'' Lee said.

      Princeton University officials confronted Pentchev about the allegations 
      in December 1998, and he disappeared shortly thereafter. If convicted, 
      Pentchev faces a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison.

10.0  Major security flaw found on Microsoft product
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    
      Exclusive: Major security flaw hits Microsoft
      http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/2000/3/ns-12942.html

      Thu, 27 Jan 2000 17:03:47 GMT
      Will Knight
     
     
     More embarrassment for Microsoft security as yet another
     flaw is discovered. Will Knight brings you this exclusive
     report 
     
     A British security expert claims to have uncovered a major
     security flaw in Microsoft's Web server software, Internet
     Information Server 4 (IIS). 
     
     David Litchfield a Windows NT specialist with British firm
     Cerberus Information Security, says the latest exploit against a
     Microsoft product allows a malicious hacker to gain unauthorised
     access to sensitive files, including cached or stored credit card
     details, address information, user IDs and passwords. Of most
     concern is the way these details can be seized: typing a simple
     URL into any browser makes it possible to gain access to files on
     Web servers running IIS, that have not been specifically
     configured to disable the exploit. 
     
     According to Litchfield, the situation is serious. "It takes no
     expertise [to use this technique] at all. It's so easy to exploit, I dare
     not give out a specific example. It would just fall into the hands of
     script kiddies [a copycat who uses someone else's techniques to
     hack a system]." ZDNet UK News has a copy of the exploit
     technique. 
     
     Thousands of e-commerce Web sites use IIS prompting Litchfield
     to warn a number of high profile UK e-commerce sites he
     believed were vulnerable. 
     
     Last year Microsoft suffered a major PR blow when its Hotmail
     service -- the world's leading Web based email service -- was left
     open to attack by a similarly simple hacking technique. But it is not
     just Microsoft's products that are vulnerable to attack: there have
     been several security breaches of high-profile e-commerce Web
     sites illustrating the precarious nature of the fledgling technology. 
     
     Visa, for example, recently confirmed receiving ransom demands
     from individuals claiming to be able to bring down their computer
     system. E-commerce Web site CDUniverse was also struck by a
     computer hacker who stole hundreds of credit card numbers and
     published them on the Internet. 
     
     Mark Tennant, Microsoft product manager for NT Server told
     ZDNet UK News, Thursday that although Microsoft products had
     made headlines recently for its security flaws, it was to be
     expected. "This product is a mainstream product with millions of
     users, obviously with that many users flaws are more likely to be
     picked up." Ostensibly that might be true, but to observers, those
     who see Microsoft products hacked time and again, isn't it a
     worrying pattern? 
     
     Tennant disagrees and drew comparisons with Linux "which
     doesn't have millions of users so you therefore don't hear of this
     type of issue". He added: "Microsoft is completely committed to
     security." Asked if that commitment could guarantee Windows
     2000 -- NT's big brother due next month -- would not suffer the
     same sort of security flaws as its predecessor Tennant said: "I
     cannot predict what could happen a month down a line... but we
     are committed to security." 
     
     Litchfield suggests the pressure put on organisations to get online,
     by both government and software houses has led to companies
     leaving themselves wide open to computer criminals. "The World
     Wide Web is a hacker's paradise," he remarks. "The lure of
     e-commerce as an effective channel to further promote a business
     and fuel its success has led to too many companies getting
     'connected' too quickly, sacrificing security for speed." 
     
     Security consultant Neil Barrett from another security firm, UK
     Information Risk Management, agrees: "The Holy Grail to any
     hacker is the remote access exploit. In the past problems with IIS
     have mainly been denial of service. If this exploit does what it says
     it does, it's down to how well credit card details are protected on
     a system which we know from experience is not very well at all."
     As a first defence Barrett advises either an intrusion detection
     system or encryption or ideally "both". 
     
     Full details of the exploit are available from the Cerberus Web site
     at this address:http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/adviishtw.html
     and a patch for Internet Information Server 4 may be downloaded
     from the Microsoft security home page.

     others have said.

      Name       : Webhits.dll buffer truncation
      Affected Systems: Microsoft Windows NT 4 running Internet Information
                                  Server 4 All service Packs
      Issue        : Attackers can access files outside of the web virtual
                       directory system and view ASP source

      Microsoft Advisory :
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-006.asp
      
      
      Internet Information Server 4.0 ships with an ISAPI application webhits.dll
      that provides hit-highlighting functionality for Index Server. Files that
      have the extention .htw are dispatched by webhits.dll.
      
      A vulnerability exists in webhits however that allows an attacker to break
      out
      of the web virtual root file system and gain unathorized access to
      other files on the same logical disk drive, such as customer databases,
      log files or any file they know or can ascertain the path to. The same
      vulnerability can be used to obtain the source of Active Server Pages or
      any other server side script file which often contain UserIDs and
      passwords as well as other sensitive information.
      
      
      *** WARNING ****
      Even if you have no .htw files on your system you're probably
      still vulnerable! A quick test to show if you are vulnerable:
      go to http://YOUR_WEB_SERVER_ADDRESS_HERE/nosuchfile.htw
      If you receive a message stating the "format of the QUERY_STRING
      is invalid" you _are_ vulnerable. Cerberus Information Security's
      free vulnerability scanner - CIS - now contains a check for this
      issue - available from the website http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/
      *** WARNING ****
      
      
      
      Details
      *******
      
      This vulnerability exploits two problems and for the sake of clarity
      this section will be spilt into two.
      
      1) If you DO have .htw files on your system
      ****************************************
      The hit-highlighting functionality provided by Index Server allows
      a web user to have a document returned with their original search
      terms highlighted on the page. The name of the document is passed
      to the .htw file with the CiWebHitsFile argument. webhits.dll,
      the ISAPI application that deals with the request, opens the file
      highlights accordingly and returns the resulting page. Because
      the user has control of the CiWebHitsFile argument passed to the
      .htw file they can request pretty much anything they want. A secondary
      problem to this is the source of ASP and other scripted pages can
      be revealed too.
      
      However, webhits.dll will follow double dots and so an attacker is able
      to gain access to files outside of the web virtual root.
      
      For example to view the web access logs for a given day the attacker would
      build the following URL
      
      http://charon/iissamples/issamples/oop/qfullhit.htw?CiWebHitsFile=/../../win
      nt/system32/logfiles/w3svc1/ex000121.log&CiRestriction=none&CiHiliteType=Ful
      l
      
      Sample .htw files often installed and left on the system are
      /iissamples/issamples/oop/qfullhit.htw
      /iissamples/issamples/oop/qsumrhit.htw
      /iissamples/exair/search/qfullhit.htw
      /iissamples/exair/search/qsumrhit.htw
      /iishelp/iis/misc/iirturnh.htw (this .htw is normally restricted to
      loopback)
      
      2) If you DON'T have any .htw files on your system
      **************************************************
      To invoke the webhits.dll ISAPI application a request needs to be made
      to a .htw file but if you don't have any on your web server you might wonder
      why you are still vulnerable - requesting a non-existent .htw file will
      fail.
      
      The trick is to be able to get inetinfo.exe to invoke webhits.dll but
      then also get webhits.dll to access an existing file. We achevie this
      by crafting a special URL.
      
      First we need a valid resource. This must be a static file such as a .htm,
      .html, .txt or even a .gif or  a .jpg. This will be the file opened by
      webhits.dll as the template file.
      
      Now we need to get inetinfo.exe to pass it along to webhits for dispatch and
      the only way we can do this is by requesting a .htw file.
      
      http://charon/default.htm.htw?CiWebHitsFile=/../../winnt/system32/logfiles/w
      3svc1/ex000121.log&CiRestriction=none&CiHiliteType=Full
      
      will fail. Obviously. There is no such file on the system with that name.
      
      Notice we've now invoked webhits, however, and by placing a specific number
      of spaces (%20s) between the exisiting resource and the .htw it is then
      possible to trick the web service: The buffer that holds the name of the
      .htw
      file to open is truncated, causing the .htw part to be removed and therefore
      when it comes to webhits.dll attempting to open the file it succeeds and we
      are then returned the contents of the file we want to access without there
      actually being a real .htw file on the system.
      
      
      The code is probably doing something similar to this:
      
      FILE *fd;
      int DoesTemplateExist(char *pathtohtwfile)
      {
      
       // Just in case inetinfo.exe passes too long a string
       // let's make sure it's of a suitable length and not
       // going to open a buffer overrun vulnerability
      
       char *file;
      
       file = (char *)malloc(250);
       strncpy(file,pathtohtwfile,250);
       fd = fopen(file,"r");
      
       // Success
       if(fd !=NULL)
        {
         return 1;
        }
       // failed
       else
        {
         return 0;
        }
      }
      
      Here webhits.dll "contains" a function called DoesTemplateExist() and is
      passed
      a pointer to a 260 byte long string buffer containing the path to the .htw
      file
      to open but this buffer is further reduced in length by the strncpy()
      function
      removing whatever was stored in the last ten bytes (in this case the .htw of
      the
      HTTP REQUEST_URI) so when fopen() is called it succeeds. This happens
      because
      Windows NT will ignore trailing spaces in a file name.
      
      
      Solution
      ********
      .htw needs to be unassociated from webhits.dll
      To do this open the Internet Server Manager (MMC). In the left hand pane
      right click the computer you wish to administer and from the menu that pops
      up choose Properties.
      
      From the Master Properties select the WWW Service and then click Edit. The
      WWW Service Master properties window should open. From here click on the
      Home Directory tab and then click the Configuration button. You should
      be presented with an App Mappings tab in the Application Mappings window.
      Find the .htw extention and then highlight it then click on remove. If a
      confirmation
      window pops up selected Yes to remove. Finally click on Apply and  select
      all of the child nodes this should apply to and then OK that. Now close all
      of the WWW Service property windows.

      ----[ 1. Scope of problem
      
      Many applications are vulnerable to various forms of SQL hacking.  While
      programs know they should avoid strcpy() and giving user data to a
      system() call, many are unaware of how SQL queries can be tampered with.
      
      This is more of a technical paper than an advisory, but it does explain
      how I used a vulnerability in the wwwthreads package to gain
      administrative access and some 800 passwords to PacketStorm's discussion
      forum.
      
      
      
      ----[ 2. Long explaination of SQL hacking
      
      As with any other day, I was surfing around the PacketStorm forums, which
      use wwwthreads. The URL parameters (the cruft after the '?' in an URL) of
      the forums started catching my eye.  Being the web security puppy I am, I
      started getting curious.  So using an ultra-insightful hacking technique,
      I changed the 'Board=general' parameter to read 'Board=rfp' used with the
      showpost.pl script. Lo and behold I get the following error given to me:
      
        We cannot complete your request.  The reason reported was:
          Can't execute query:
          SELECT B_Main,B_Last_Post
          FROM rfp
          WHERE B_Number=1
        . Reason: Table 'WWWThreads.rfp' doesn't exist
      
      Seeing there's also a 'Number=1' parameter, we can figure this query can
      be reconstructed as
      
              SELECT B_Main,B_Last_Post FROM $Board WHERE B_Number=$Number
      
      Now, if any of you have read my phrack 54 article (the SQL appension part,
      available at http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/p/doc.asp?id=7&iface=2) you can
      see where I'm going.  We can not only substitute a $Board name and
      $Number, but also extra SQL commands.  Imagine if $Board were to equal
      'general; DROP TABLE general; SELECT * FROM general ' This would translate
      into
      
              SELECT B_Main,B_Last_Post FROM general; DROP TABLE general;
                      SELECT * FROM general WHERE B_Number=$Number
      
      Now the ';' is generic for ending a command.  Normally we could use a '#'
      for mySQL to ignore everything else on the line; however, the 'FROM'
      clause is on a separate line than the 'WHERE' clause, so mySQL won't
      ignore it.  Considering that invalid SQL will cause mySQL to not run any
      commands, we at least need to give a valid command string to parse...in
      this case, we feed a generic select (similiar to the original) back to it.
      The result of this (theoretically) is to drop (delete) the general forum
      table.
      
      But in reality, it doesn't work.  Not because the theory is wrong, but
      because the database user we're using doesn't have DROP privileges.  And
      due to how wwwthreads is written, it won't quite let you do much with
      this. But all is not lost, we can just start changing all numbers left and
      right, looking for where it blows up...or we can go the easy route and
      download the (eval) source code from www.wwwthreads.com.  Yeah, kind of
      cheating, but it's not quite a one-to-one solution.
      
      You see, the eval code and the license code (of which PacketStorm is
      running) are slightly different, including their SELECT statements.  So we
      have to be a little creative.  First, let's find the SELECT statement (or
      equivalent) that's featured above.
      
      I like to use less, so I just 'less showpost.pl', and search (the '/' key)
      for 'SELECT'.  We come up with
      
      # Grab the main post number for this thread
        $query = qq!
          SELECT Main,Last_Post
          FROM $Board
          WHERE Number=$Number
        !;
      
      Wow, that's it..except the field names (Main,Last_Post,Number) are
      different than the pro version (B_Main,B_Last_Post,B_Number).  If we look
      right above it, we see
      
      # Once and a while it people try to just put a number into the url,
        if (!$Number) {
          w3t::not_right("There was a problem looking up the Post...
      
      Which is what limits the use of the $Number parameter.
      
      At this point let's now evaluate 'why' we want to go forth into this.
      Obviously DROP'ing tables ranks right up there with other stupid DoS
      tricks.  You may be able to modify other people's posts, but that's lame
      too.  Perhaps setting up our own forum?  All that information is stored in
      the DB.  But that's a lot of records to update.  How about becoming a
      moderator?  Or even better, an administrator?  Administrators can add,
      delete, and modify forums, boards, and users.  That may be a worthy goal,
      although your still only limited to the realm of the forum, which makes
      you a king of a very small and pitiful domain.
      
      However, there is one thing worthy.  If you make yourself a user account,
      you'll notice you have to enter a password.  Hmmm...those passwords are
      stored someplace...like, in the database.  If we hedge our 'password
      reuse' theory, and combined with the fact that wwwthreads (in some
      configurations) post the IP address of the poster, we have some
      possibilities worth checking out.
      
      So, let's look at this password thing.  Going into 'edit profile' gives us
      a password field, which looks an awful lot like a crypt hash (view the
      HTML source). Damn, so the passwords are hashed.  Well, that just means
      you'll need a password cracker and more time before you can start checking
      on password reuse. Assuming we *can* get the passwords......
      
      Let's start with the administrator access first.  The adduser.pl script is
      a good place to start, since it should show us all parameters of a user.
      Notice the following code
      
      # --------------------------------------
      # Check to see if this is the first user
        $query = qq!
          SELECT Username
          FROM   Users
        !;
      
        $sth = $dbh -> prepare ($query) or die "Query syntax error: $DBI::errstr.
              Query: $query";
        $sth -> execute() or die "Can't execute query: $query. Reason:
              $DBI::errstr";
        my $Status = "";
        my $Security = $config{'user_security'};
        my $rows = $sth -> rows;
        $sth -> finish;
      
      # -------------------------------------------------------
      # If this is the first user, then status is Administrator
      # otherwise they are just get normal user status.
        if (!$rows){
          $Status = "Administrator";
          $Security = 100;
        } else {
          $Status = "User";
        }
      
      
      What this does is look to see if any users are defined.  If no users are
      defined, the first user added gets the Status of 'Administrator' and a
      security level of 100.  After that, all added users just get Status=User.
      So we need to find a way to make our Status=Administrator.  A full user
      record can be seen a little further down...
      
      # ------------------------------
      # Put the user into the database
        my $Status_q   = $dbh -> quote($Status);
        $Username_q    = $dbh -> quote($Username);
        my $Email_q    = $dbh -> quote($Email);
        my $Display_q  = $dbh -> quote($config{'postlist'});
        my $View_q     = $dbh -> quote($config{'threaded'});
        my $EReplies_q = $dbh -> quote("Off");
        $query = qq!
          INSERT INTO Users (Username,Email,Totalposts,Laston,Status,Sort,
              Display,View,PostsPer,EReplies,Security,Registered)
          VALUES ($Username_q,$Email_q,0,$date,$Status_q,$config{'sort'},
              $Display_q,$View_q,$config{'postsperpage'},$EReplies_q,$Security,$date)
        !;
      
      
      Now, I should take a moment here and explain the quote() function.  A
      string value of "blah blah blah", when stuck into a query that looks like
      "SELECT * FROM table WHERE data=$data" will wind up looking like
      
              SELECT * FROM table WHERE data=blah blah blah
      
      which is not valid.  The database doesn't know what to do with the extra
      two blah's, since they look like commands.  Therefore all string data need
      to be encapsulated in single quotes (').  Therefore the query should look
      like
      
              SELECT * FROM table WHERE data='blah blah blah'
      
      which is correct.  Now, in my SQL appension article I talk about 'breaking
      out' of the single quote string by including your own single quote.  So if
      we submitted "blah blah' MORE SQL COMMANDS...", it would look like
      
              SELECT * FROM table WHERE data='blah blah' MORE SQL COMMANDS...'
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                    data we submitted
      
      This causes the SQL engine to interpret the MORE SQL COMMANDS as actual
      SQL commands, since if figured the 'data' part of the string ended with
      the second single quote (the one we submitted).  This is a drawback of
      converting data into a 'human readable' string, to be parsed back into
      data again...it's hard to determine what's 'code/commands' and what's
      'data'.
      
      All is not lost, however.  By submitting a '', it tells the SQL engine to
      NOT end the data string, but rather only think of it as a single quote in
      the data context.  Therefore the following query
      
              SELECT * FROM table WHERE data='data''more data'
      
      makes the database look for the value "data'more data".  So to keep people
      from breaking out of strings and submitting extra SQL commands, all you
      have to do is double up every single quote (turn ' into '').  This will
      ensure that all data is indeed considered data.  And this is what the
      DBI->quote() function does--it will put single quotes around the string,
      and double all single quotes in the string.
      
      So after all of that explaination, the short of it is that anything that
      is run through quote() is of no use to use, because we can't submit extra
      SQL commands or otherwise tamper with anything fun.  And if you look,
      wwwthreads uses quote() extensively.  So this may be rough.  But all is
      not lost...
      
      You see, there are different field types.  You can have strings, boolean
      values, various numeric values, etc.  While a string field needs to be in
      the format of field='data', a numeric field doesn't use the '' (i.e.
      numeric_field='2' is invalid).  The correct syntax for numeric fields in
      numeric_field=2.  Ah ha!  There's no quotes to deal with, and you can't
      even use quotes anyways.  The correct solution is to make sure all numeric
      field data is indeed numeric (more on this later).  But I'll give you a
      hint...wwwthreads doesn't go that far (nor do most applications,
      actually).
      
      So, now we need a SQL statement that preferably deals with a table we are
      interested in.  A SELECT statement (retrieves data) is tougher, since
      we'll need to include a whole 'nother query to do something other than
      SELECT.  INSERT and UPDATE are nice because we're already modifying
      data...we can just ride in more data to update (hopefully).
      
      Poking around brings us to a very nice spot...changeprofile.pl.  This is
      the script that takes data entered in editprofile.pl and enters the
      changes into the database.  Of course, the profile is our user profile.
      This means to use this, we need a valid user account.  In any event, let's
      have a look-see...
      
      # Format the query words
        my $Password_q   = $dbh -> quote($Password);
        my $Email_q      = $dbh -> quote($Email);
        my $Fakeemail_q  = $dbh -> quote($Fakeemail);
        my $Name_q       = $dbh -> quote($Name);
        my $Signature_q  = $dbh -> quote($Signature);
        my $Homepage_q   = $dbh -> quote($Homepage);
        my $Occupation_q = $dbh -> quote($Occupation);
        my $Hobbies_q    = $dbh -> quote($Hobbies);
        my $Location_q   = $dbh -> quote($Location);
        my $Bio_q        = $dbh -> quote($Bio);
        my $Username_q   = $dbh -> quote($Username);
        my $Display_q    = $dbh -> quote($Display);
        my $View_q       = $dbh -> quote($View);
        my $EReplies_q   = $dbh -> quote($EReplies);
        my $Notify_q     = $dbh -> quote($Notify);
        my $FontSize_q   = $dbh -> quote($FontSize);
        my $FontFace_q   = $dbh -> quote($FontFace);
        my $ICQ_q        = $dbh -> quote($ICQ);
        my $Post_Format_q= $dbh -> quote($Post_Format);
        my $Preview_q    = $dbh -> quote($Preview);
      
      
      Ack!  Practically everything is quoted!  That means all those parameters
      are useless to us.  And lets peek at the final actual query that sticks
      all our information back into the database
      
      # Update the User's profile
        my $query =qq!
          UPDATE Users
          SET Password   = $Password_q,
          Email          = $Email_q,
          Fakeemail      = $Fakeemail_q,
          Name           = $Name_q,
          Signature      = $Signature_q,
          Homepage       = $Homepage_q,
          Occupation     = $Occupation_q,
          Hobbies        = $Hobbies_q,
          Location       = $Location_q,
          Bio            = $Bio_q,
          Sort           = $Sort,
          Display        = $Display_q,
          View           = $View_q,
          PostsPer       = $PostsPer,
          EReplies       = $EReplies_q,
          Notify         = $Notify_q,
          TextCols       = $TextCols,
          TextRows       = $TextRows,
          FontSize       = $FontSize_q,
          FontFace       = $FontFace_q,
          Extra1         = $ICQ_q,
          Post_Format    = $Post_Format_q,
          Preview        = $Preview_q
          WHERE Username = $Username_q
        !;
      
      Since wwwthreads nicely slaps the '_q' on the variables, it's easy to see.
      See it?  $Sort, $PostsPer, $TextCols, and $TextRows aren't quoted.  Now,
      let's figure out where that data comes from
      
        my $Sort       = $FORM{'sort_order'};
        my $PostsPer   = $FORM{'PostsPer'};
        my $TextCols   = $FORM{'TextCols'};
        my $TextRows   = $FORM{'TextRows'};
      
      Wow, they're taken straight from the submitted form data.  That means they
      are not checked or validated in any way.  Here's our chance!
      
      Going back to structure of the user record (given above), there's a
      'Status' field we need to change.  Looking in this UPDATE query, Status
      isn't listed.  So this means that the Status field is going to remain
      unchanged.  Bummer.  See what we're going to do yet?  Take a second and
      think about it.
      
      Remember, all of this hinges around the fact that we want to submit what
      looks like data, but in the end, the SQL engine/database will interpret it
      differently.  Notice in the query that the fields are listed in the format
      of field=value, field=value, field=value, etc (of course, they're on
      separate lines).  If I were to insert some fake values (for the sake of
      example), I might have
      
          Name='rfp', Signature='rfp', Homepage='www.wiretrip.net/rfp/'
      
      All I did was put the fields on the same line, collapse the whitespace,
      and fill in the (quoted) string values.  This is valid SQL.
      
      Now, let's put this all together.  Looking at the the 'Sort' variable
      (which is numeric), we would feasibly have
      
              Bio='puppy', Sort=5, Display='threaded'
      
      which is still valid SQL. Since $Sort=$FORM{'sort_order'}, that means the
      above value for Sort was given by submitting the parameter sort_order=5.
      Now, let's use Sort to our advantage.  What if we were to include a comma,
      and then some more column values?  Oh, say, the Status field?  Let's set
      the sort_order parameter to "5, Status='Administrator',", and then let it
      run its course.  Eventually we'll get a query that looks like
      
              Bio='puppy', Sort=5, Status='Administrator', Display='threaded'
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    our submitted data
      
      This is still valid SQL!  And furthermore, it will cause the database to
      update the Status field to be 'Administrator'!  But remember when we
      looked in adduser.pl, the first user had a Security level of 100.  We want
      that to, so we just set the sort_order parameter to "5,
      Status='Administrator', Security=100,", and then we get
      
              Bio='puppy', Sort=5, Status='Administrator', Security=100, ...
      
      which updates both values to what we want.  The database not knowing any
      better will update those two fields, and now the forums will think we're
      an administrator.
      
      So I go to apply this new technique on PacketStorm...and get a 404 for
      requests to changeprofile.pl.  Yep, the pro version doesn't have it.
      Navigating the 'Edit Profile' menu, I see that it has 'Basic Profile',
      'Display Preferences', and 'Email Notifications/Subscriptions', which the
      demo does not (it's all lumped together).  Wonderful.  If they changed the
      scripts around, they may have also changed the SQL queries (well they had
      to, actually).  So now we're in 'blackbox' mode (blindly making educated
      guesses on what's going on).  Since we want to play with the sort_order
      parameter still, you'll see that it's contained in the 'Display
      Preferences' script (editdisplay.pl).  This script handles the sort_order,
      display, view, PostPer, Post_Format, Preview, TextCols, TextRows,
      FontSize, FontFace, PictureView, and PicturePost (gained by viewing the
      HTML source).  So it's a subset of the parameters.  Using the above code
      snippets, we can guess at what the SQL query looking like.  So why not
      give it a shot.
      
      First I poke some invalid values into sort_order (characters instead of
      numbers).  This causes an error, which I figured.  Since, in the first
      example how the fields where 'B_' for the 'Board' table, the 'User' table
      (which we are now using) prefixes colums with a 'U_'.  So that means we
      need to use 'U_Status' and 'U_Security' for field names.  Good thing we
      checked.
      
      Since this needs to be a valid form submit, we need to submit values for
      all of the listed variables.  At this point I should also point out
      (again) we need a valid user account of which to increase the status.
      We'll need the username and password (hash), which are printed as hidden
      form elements on various forms (like editdisplay.pl).  You'll see the
      parameters are Username and Oldpass.  So based on all of this, we can
      construct a URL that looks like
      
      changedisplay.pl? Cat=&
              Username=rfp
              &Oldpass=(valid password hash)
              &sort_order=5,U_Status%3d'Administrator',U_Security%3d100
              &display=threaded
              &view=collapsed
              &PostsPer=10
              &Post_Format=top
              &Preview=on
              &TextCols=60
              &TextRows=5
              &FontSize=0
              &FontFace=
              &PictureView=on
              &PicturePost=off
      
      
      The important one of course being
      
              &sort_order=5,U_Status%3d'Administrator',U_Security%3d100
      
      which is just an escaped version of what we used above (the %3d translate
      to the '=' character).  When you lump it all together into a single
      string, you get
      
      changedisplay.pl?Cat=&Username=rfp&Oldpass=(valid password hash)
      &sort_order=5,U_Status%3d'Administrator',U_Security%3d100&display=threaded
      &view=collapsed&PostsPer=10&Post_Format=top&Preview=on&TextCols=60
      &TextRows=5&FontSize=0&FontFace=&PictureView=on&PicturePost=off
      
      which, while gross, is what it needs to be.  So, I submit this to
      PacketStorm, and get
      
              Your display preferences have been modified.
      
      Wonderful.  But, noticing on the top menu, I see an 'Admin' option now.  I
      click it, and what do I see but the heart warming message of
      
              As an Administrator the following options are available to you.
      
      Bingo!  Administrator privileges!  Looking at my options, I can edit
      users, boards, or forums, assign moderators and administrators, ban
      users/hosts, expire/close/open threads, etc.
      
      Now for our second objective...the passwords.  I go into 'Show/Edit
      Users', and am asked to pick the first letter of the usernames I'm
      interested in.  So I pick 'R'.  At list of all 'R*' users comes up.  I
      click on 'rfp'.  And there we go, my password hash.  Unfortunately,
      there's no nice and easy way to dump all users and their hashes.  Bummer.
      So I automated a perl script to do it for me, and dump the output in a
      format that can be fed into John the Ripper.
      
      
      
      ----[ 3. Solution
      
      Now, how to defend against this?  As you saw, the reason this worked was
      due to non-restricted data being passed straight into SQL queries.
      Luckily wwwthreads quoted (most) string data, but they didn't touch
      numeric data.  The solution is to make sure numeric data is indeed
      numeric.  You can do it the 'silent' way by using a function like so
      
      sub onlynumbers {
              ($data=shift)=~tr/0-9//cd;
              return $data;}
      
      And similar to how all string data is passed through DBI->quote(), pass
      all numeric data through onlynumbers().  So, for the above example, it
      would be better to use
      
              my $Sort = onlynumbers($FORM{'sort_order'});
      
      Another area that needs to be verified is the table name.  In our very
      first example, we had 'Board=general'.  As you see here, a table name is
      not quoted like a string.  Therefore we also need to run all table names
      through a function to clean them up as well.  Assuming table names can
      have letters, numbers, and periods, we can scrub it with
      
      sub scrubtable {
              ($data=shift)=~tr/a-zA-Z0-9.//cd;
              return $data;}
      
      which will remove all other cruft.
      
      In the end, *all* (let me repeat that... **ALL**) incoming user data
      should be passed through quote(), onlynumbers(), or scrubtable()...NO
      EXCEPTIONS!  Passing user data straight into a SQL query is asking for
      someone to tamper with your database.
      
      New versions of wwwthreads are available from www.wwwthreads.com, which
      implement the solutions pretty much as I've described them here.
      
      
      ----[ 4. Conclusion
      
      I've included two scripts below.  wwwthreads.pl will run the query for you
      against a pro version of wwwthreads.  You just have to give the ip
      address of the server running wwwthreads, and a valid user and password
      hash.  w3tpass.pl will walk and download all wwwthreads user password
      hashes, and give output suitable for password cracking with John the
      Ripper.

14.0  Spank, variation of the stream.c DoS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      ------------------------------------------------
      Explanation of the 'spank' attack
      -- a new breed stream/raped
      ------------------------------------------------
      
      By: lst (yardley@uiuc.edu)
      
      This is a tad different than the previous release.  Stream/Raped mearly 
      flooded the host with ack's (or no flags) and came from random ips with 
      random sequence numbers and/or ack numbers.  The difference now is that 
      this not only does the previous stuff, but also directly attacks from and 
      to multicast addresses as well.  Just as before, rate limiting should be 
      done to counteract its effect (the same idea as ICMP_BANDLIM).  The 
      multicast handling should also be checked to verify that it is behaving 
      properly.
      
      The attacker specifies the port[s] that they want to send the attack to, 
      depending on what ports are selected, you will have different net 
      results.  If the port is an open port, then you will possibly have a longer 
      kernel path to follow before the drop.  Therefore, a smart attacker will 
      hit open ports, but havoc can also come about from random ports due to 
      states and processing.
      
      In the best case scenario, you will experience only the lag of the flood 
      and the lag of the processing (currently) and then be fine when the 
      attacker stops,  In the worst case, you lockup, kill the network, and 
      possibly have to reboot.  Once you patch it, you deal with a lot less 
      processing time (the drops are handled without the RST flag when 
      appropriate--bandlim type idea).  In other words, you go to the drop 
      routine instead of dropwithrst silencing your response, which decreases 
      your processing time, the hit on your network, and the effect of the flood 
      (once a threshold is reached, all those bad packets are silently dropped 
      and the attack has less of a net effect).
      
      The filters that were presented at the beginning of this email will block 
      all multicast packets that come out (and in) the tcp stack I have been
      getting mailed a lot about this.  Here is why I said the previous 
      statement.  Receiving a packet with no flags is considered an illegal
      packet (obviously) and is often dumped, however, as we have seen in 
      the past, illegal packets often wreak havoc and often go untested.
      
      There is very little that "raped.c" or "stream.c" actually showed as 
      problems in the TCP/IP stacks.  The true problem lies more in the effects 
      of the response (caused by the attack).  This is the same concept as the 
      SYN floods of yesteryear, and the same type of thing will be done to handle 
      it.  The main difference is that it will be on a simpler note because there 
      isn't much need for a "cookie" based system.  One should just throttle the 
      response of the reset packets which in turn will help stop the storm that 
      you generate and in general, harden the tcp/ip stack to behave the way it 
      is supposed to.
      
      The main effect of this attack is that you are shooting back RST+ACK's at 
      all the spoofed hosts.  Obviously, a lot of these hosts will not exist and 
      you will get ICMP unreaches (as an example) bounced back at you.  There are 
      other possibilities as well, but unreach would be the most common 
      (redirects might be common as well although i did not spend the time to 
      analyze that).  The ones that don't respond back may send you some packets 
      back as well (depending on if the port was valid or not and what their 
      firewall rules are).  This type of attack is complicated by the multicasts, 
      and the effect is amplified as well.  All in all, it becomes very nasty 
      very quick.  Basically, this causes a nice little storm of packets, in the 
      ideal case.
      
      Note that I said ideal case in the previous paragraph.  This is not always 
      the observed behavior.  It all depends on what is on the subnet, what type 
      of packets are recieved, what rules and filters you have setup, and even 
      the duration of the flood.  It has been pointed out several times that the 
      machine will go back to normal once the attack is stopped, which is exactly 
      why something like ICMP_BANDLIM will work.
      
      I have also been asked a lot about what this "bug" affects.  I have seen it 
      have effects on *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Win* as far as OS's go.  It has 
      also seemed to affect some hubs, switches, routers, or gateways since 
      entire subnets have "disappeared" briefly after the attack.  The multicast 
      attack seems to be more deadly to teh network than the previous attack and 
      its affects get amplified and even carried over to the rest of the network 
      (bypassing secluded network bounds).  I don't have more specifics on the 
      systems affected because of the difficulty in testing it (and keeping the 
      network up) since I do not have local access to the networks that I tested 
      on, and remote access gets real ugly real fast.
      
      Another possibility that has been suggested as to why some machines die is 
      that the machine's route table is being blown up by the spoofed 
      packets.  Each spoofed packet has a different source address which means 
      that a temporary route table entry is being created for each one.  These 
      entries take time to timeout.  Use 'vmstat -m' and check the 'routetbl' 
      field while the attack is going on.
      
      Route table entries can be controlled somewhat under freebsd with:
      
      [root@solid]::[~] sysctl -a | fgrep .rt
      net.inet.ip.rtexpire: 3600
      net.inet.ip.rtminexpire: 10
      net.inet.ip.rtmaxcache: 128
      
      You can do the following, to help if the route table is at least part of 
      the problem:
      
      sysctl -w net.inet.ip.rtexpire=2
      sysctl -w net.inet.ip.rtminexpire=2
      
      Things that will help:
      
      1. Drop all multicast packets (ingress and egress) that are addressed to 
         the tcp stack because multicasts are not valid for tcp.
      2. Extend bandwidth limiting to include RST's, ACK's and anything else 
         that you feel could affect the stability of the machine.
      3. Don't look for listening sockets if the packet is not a syn
      
      I hope that this helps, or explains a little more at least.
      
      ---------------------------------------------------
      Temporary remedy
      ---------------------------------------------------
      
      If you use ipfilter, this MAY help you, but the issue is quite a bit 
      different than the previous issue.
      
      -- start rule set --
      block in quick proto tcp from any to any head 100
      block in quick proto tcp from 224.0.0.0/28 to any group 100
      pass in quick proto tcp from any to any flags S keep state group 100
      pass out proto tcp from any to any flags S keep state
      pass in all
      -- end rule set --
      
      optionally, a rule like the following could be inserted to handle outgoing 
      packets (if they send from the firewall somehow) but you have bigger 
      problems than the attack if that is the case.
      
      -- start additional rule --
      block out proto tcp from any to 224.0.0.0/28
      -- end additional rule --
      
      That will help you "stop" the attack (actually it will just help minimize 
      the affects), although it will still use some CPU though
      
      Note: If you use IPFW, there is no immediate way to solve this problem due 
      to the fact that it is a stateless firewall.  If you are getting attacked, 
      then temporarily use ipfilter (or any other state based firewall) to stop 
      it.  Otherwise, wait for vendor patches or read more about the explanation 
      for other possible workarounds.

      -----------------------
      Conclusion
      -----------------------
      
      This bug was found in testing.  It seems a bit more lethal than the 
      previous and should be addressed as such.  Patches should be available now, 
      but I do not follow all the platforms.

      The Clock Strikes Midnight for RSA
      
      In a date more feared by RSA Security than Y2K, the patent for the venerable
      RSA data encryption algorithm will expire on September 20th of this year. No
      longer will RSA be able to charge royalties for the algorithm, first
      published by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman in 1977 and patented
      in 1983. After patent expiration, the algorithm will become part of the
      public domain, and companies will be free to incorporate the algorithm into
      their products without paying RSA any type of royalty or licensing fee.
      Although the demise of a 17 year patent for widely used technology is a big
      deal, there is also a distinct possibility that, like Y2K, it will turn out
      to be a non-event due to the momentum of the established security industry.

      Information Warfare
      
      As the latest buzzword to succeed Y2K on the media's "terror throne,"
      information warfare (IW), as a useful term, begs for realistic definition.
      No doubt, bin Laden can attack us. Graduate students at Cal Tech, MIT, or
      UCLA and tenth-graders at your local high school can also launch "volleys"
      against corporate America. How effective such invasions would be is the
      critical issue. In the Gulf War, Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries expended vast
      rounds against allied planes, and it was almost totally ineffective. Sheer
      bulk doesn't always equate to victory.  Read the full story here.

      that their systems have been compromised. They are in diverse locations
      around the world, administered by people who speak different languages,

      computer security requires some level of encryption to be applied to various
      kinds of data, for example secure web transactions, or SSH. But something
      that often goes ignored is the fact that all good crypto relies on some
      degree of randomness, which if not fulfilled properly can lead to a
      significant loss in the strength of encryption

       "Key Finding" Attacks and Publicity Attacks
      
      
      
      A couple of weeks ago the New York Times reported a new "key finding"
      attack.  This was a follow-up to some research discussed here some months
      ago, showing how to search for, and find, public and private cryptographic
      keys in software because of their random bit patterns.
      
      The company nCipher demonstrated that someone who has access to a Web
      server that uses SSL can find the SSL private key using these techniques,
      and potentially steal it.  nCipher's press release talked of "a significant
      vulnerability to today's Internet economy."  Huh?  Why is this news?
      
      It's not the fact that the SSL private keys are on the Web server.  That's
      obvious; they have to be there.  It's not the fact that someone who has
      access to the Web server can potentially steal the private keys.  That's
      obvious, too.  It's not the news that a CGI attack can compromise data on a
      Web server.  We've seen dozens of those attacks in 1999.  Even the press
      release admits that "no information is known to have been compromised using
      a 'key-finding' attack.  Neither nCipher nor the New York Times found
      anyone who was vulnerable.  But wait . . . nCipher sells a solution to this
      "problem."  Okay, now I understand.
      
      I call this kind of thing a publicity attack.  It's a blatant attempt by
      nCipher to get some free publicity for the hardware encryption
      accelerators, and to scare e-commerce vendors into purchasing them.  And
      people fall for this, again and again.
      
      This kind of thing is happening more and more, and I'm getting tired of it.
       Here are some more examples:
      
      * An employee of Cryptonym, a PKI vendor, announced that he found a
      variable with the prefix "NSA" inside Microsoft's cryptographic API.  Based
      on absolutely zero evidence, this was held up as an example of NSA's
      manipulation of the Microsoft code.
      
      *  Some people at eEye discovered a bug in IIS last year, completely
      compromising the product.  They contacted Microsoft, and after waiting only
      a week for them to acknowledge the problem, they issued a press release and
      a hacker tool.  Microsoft rushed a fix out, but not as fast as the hackers
      jumped on the exploit.  eEye sells vulnerability assessment tools and
      security consulting, by the way.
      
      I'm a fan of full disclosure -- and definitely not a fan of Microsoft's
      security -- and believe that security vulnerabilities need to be publicized
      before they're fixed.  (If you don't publicize, the vendors often don't
      bother fixing them.)  But this practice of announcing "vulnerabilities" for
      the sole purpose of hyping your own solutions has got to stop.
      
      Here are some examples of doing things right:
      
      *  The University of California Berkeley researchers have broken just about
      every digital cellphone security algorithm.  They're not profiting from
      these breaks.  They don't publish software packages that can listen in on
      cellphone calls.  This is research, and good research.
      
      *  Georgi Guninski has found a huge number of JavaScript holes over the
      past year or so.  Rather than posting scary exploits and cracking tools
      that script kiddies could take advantage of, and rather than trying to grab
      the limelight, he has been quietly publishing the problems and available
      workarounds.  Of course, the downside is that these bugs get less attention
      from Microsoft and Netscape, even though they are as serious as many others
      that have received more press attention and thus get fixed quickly by the
      browser makers.  Nonetheless, this is good research.
      
      *  The L0pht has done an enormous amount of good by exposing Windows NT
      security problems, and they don't try to sell products to fix the problems.
       (Although now that they've formed a VC-funded security consulting company,
      @Stake, they're going to have to tread more carefully.)
      
      *  Perfecto markets security against CGI attacks.  Although they try to
      increase awareness of the risks, they don't go around writing new CGI
      exploits and publicizing them.  They point to other CGI exploits, done by
      hackers with no affiliation to the company, as examples of the problem.
      
      * Steve Bellovin at AT&T labs found a serious hole in the Internet DNS
      system.  He delayed publication of this vulnerability for years because
      there was no readily available fix.
      
      How do you tell the difference?  Look at the messenger.  Who found the
      vulnerability?  What was their motivation for publicizing?  The nCipher
      announcement came with a Business Wire press release, and a PR agent who
      touted the story to reporters.  These things are not cheap -- the press
      release alone cost over $1000 -- and should be an obvious tip-off that
      other interests are at stake.
      
      Also, look critically at the exploit.  Is it really something new, or is it
      something old rehashed?  Does it expose a vulnerability that matters, or
      one that doesn't?  Is it actually interesting?  If it's old, doesn't
      matter, and uninteresting, it's probably just an attempt at press coverage.
      
      And look at how it is released.  The nCipher release included a hacker
      tool.  As the New York Times pointed out, "thus making e-commerce sites
      more vulnerable to attack and more likely to buy nCipher's product."
      Announcements packaged with hacker tools are more likely to be part of the
      problem than part of the solution.
      
      I am a firm believer in open source security, and in publishing security
      vulnerabilities.  I don't want the digital cellphone industry, or the DVD
      industry, to foist bad security off on consumers.  I think the quality of
      security products should be tested just as the quality of automobiles is
      tested.  But remember that security testing is difficult and
      time-consuming, and that many of the "testers" have ulterior motives.
      These motives are often just as much news as the vulnerability itself, and
      sometimes the announcements are more properly ignored as blatant
      self-serving publicity.

      The White House released a national plan to protect America's computer

      no plans to monitor commercial systems, but that can change.  The
      government does want to involve industry in this.)  The plan also calls for
      the establishment of an "Institute for Information Infrastructure
      Protection" and a new program that will offer college scholarships to
      students in the field of computer security in exchange for public service
      commitments.  The scholarship program seems like a good idea; we need more
      computer security experts.

             New U.S. Encryption Regulations
      
      
      
      We have some, and they're a big improvement.  On the plus side, "retail"
      encryption products -- like browsers, e-mail programs, or PGP -- will be
      widely exportable to all but a few countries "regardless of key length or
      algorithm."  On the minus side, the new regulations are complex (an
      unending stream of work for the lawyers) and will still make it difficult
      for many people to freely exchange encryption products.  They also do not
      address the Constitutional free speech concerns raised by encryption export
      controls.
      
      Major features of the new regs:
      
      * "Retail" encryption products are be exportable, regardless of key length
      or algorithm, to all but the designated "T-7" terrorist nations.  In order
      to export you need to fill out paperwork.  You need to get a retail
      classification, submit your product to a one-time technical review, and
      submit periodic reports of who products are shipped to (but not necessarily
      report end users).
      
      * Export of encryption products up to 64 bits in key length is completely
      liberalized.
      
      * "Non-retail" products will require a license for many exports, such as to
      foreign governments or foreign ISPs and telcos under certain circumstances.
      
      * Source code that is "not subject to an express agreement for the payment
      of a licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale of any
      product developed with the source code" is freely exportable to all but the
      T-7 terrorist countries.  Source code exporters are required to send the
      Department of Commerce a copy of the code, or a URL, upon publication.
      Note that posting code on a web site for anonymous download is allowed; you
      are not required to check that downloaders might be from one of the
      prohibited countries.
      
      One obvious question is: "How does this affect the Bernstein and Karn court
      cases?"  I don't know yet.  The free speech concerns are not addressed, but
      the things that Bernstein and Karn wanted to do are now allowed.  We'll
      have to see what the attorneys think.
      
      A more personal question is: "How does this affect the Applied Cryptography
      source code disks?"  Near as I can tell, all I have to do is notify the
      right people and I can export them.  I will do so as soon as I can.  Stay
      tuned.

                 The Doghouse: Netscape
      
      
      
      Netscape encrypts users' e-mail passwords with a lousy algorithm.  If this
      isn't enough, their comments to the press cement their inclusion in the
      doghouse:
      
      "Chris Saito, the senior director for product management at Netscape, said
      that the option to save a password locally was included for convenience.
      Saito added that Netscape didn't use a stronger encryption algorithm to
      protect passwords so that 'computer experts could still access the
      information, in case someone forgot their password.'"
      
      In other words, they implemented lousy security on purpose.
      
      "Netscape's Saito said the company wasn't aware of the vulnerability and
      added that a 'security fix' would be forthcoming if that vulnerability were
      proved to exist.  If the Javascript vulnerability doesn't exist, a password
      stealer would have to have physical access to a user's computer to figure
      out the algorithm."
      
      Note the complete ignorance of viruses like Melissa, or Trojan horses like
      Back Orifice.
      
      "Saito noted that Netscape already has numerous safety features, including
      a Secure Sockets Layer, which enables users to communicate securely with
      Web servers, and a protocol for encrypting e-mail messages sent."
      
      None of which matters if the password is stolen.

                 Block and Stream Ciphers
      
      
      
      Block and stream ciphers both transform a message from plaintext to
      ciphertext one piece at a time.  Block ciphers apply the same
      transformation to every piece of the message, and typically deal with
      fairly large pieces of the message (8 bytes, 16 bytes) at a time.  Stream
      ciphers apply a different transformation to each piece  of the message, and
      typically deal with fairly small pieces of the message (1 bit, 1 byte) at a
      time.
      
      Traditionally they have been separate areas of research, but these days
      they are converging.  And if you poke around at the issues a bit, you'll
      see that they not very different at all.
      
      Stream ciphers first.  Traditional stream ciphers consist of three standard
      pieces: an internal state, a next-state function, and a
      plaintext-to-ciphertext transformation function.  The internal state is
      generally small, maybe a hundred bits, and can be thought of as the key.
      The next-state function updates the state.  The transformation function
      takes a piece of plaintext, mixes it with the current state, and produces
      the same size ciphertext.  And then the stream cipher goes on to the next
      piece.
      
      The security of this scheme is based on how cryptographically annoying the
      two functions are.  Sometimes just one of the functions is
      cryptographically annoying.  In electronic stream ciphers, a complicated
      next-state function is usually combined with a simple transformation that
      takes the low-order bit of the state and XORs it with the plaintext.  In
      rotor machines, such as the German Enigma, the next-state function was a
      simple stepping of various rotors, and the transformation function was very
      complicated.  Sometimes both are cryptographically complicated.
      
      These ciphers could generally operate in two modes, depending on the input
      into the next-state function.  If the only input was the current state,
      these were called output-feedback (OFB) ciphers.  If there was the
      additional input of the previous ciphertext bit, these were called
      cipher-feedback (CFB) ciphers.  (If you were in the U.S. military, you knew
      these modes as "key auto-key" (KAK) and "ciphertext auto-key (CTAK),
      respectively.)  And you chose one mode over the other because of error
      propagation and resynchronization properties.  (Applied Cryptography
      explains all this in detail.)
      
      Traditionally, stream cipher algorithms were as simple as possible.  These
      were implemented in hardware, and needed as few gates as possible.  They
      had to be fast.  The result was many designs based on simple mathematical
      functions: e.g., linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).  They were
      analyzed based on metrics such as linear complexity and correlation
      immunity.  Analysts looked at cycle lengths and various linear and affine
      approximations.  Most U.S. military encryption algorithms, at least the
      ones in general use in the 1980s and before, are stream ciphers of these sorts.
      
      Block ciphers are different.  They consist of a single function: one that
      takes a plaintext block (a 64-bit block size is traditional) and a key and
      produces a ciphertext block.  The NSA calls these ciphers codebooks, and
      that is an excellent way to think of them.  For each key, you can imagine
      building a table.  On the left column is every possible plaintext block; on
      the right column is every possible ciphertext block.  That's the codebook.
      It would be a large book, 18 billion billion entries for the smallest
      commonly used block ciphers, so it is easier to just implement the
      algorithm mathematically -- especially since you need a new book for each
      key.  But in theory, you could implement it as a single table lookup in a
      very large codebook.
      
      Block ciphers can be used simply as codebooks, encrypting each 64-bit block
      independently (and, in fact, that is called electronic codebook (ECB)
      mode), but that has a bunch of security problems.  An attacker can
      rearrange blocks, build up a portion of the codebook if he has some known
      plaintext, etc.  So generally block ciphers are implemented in one of
      several chaining modes.
      
      Before listing the block cipher chaining modes, it's worth noticing that a
      block cipher algorithm can serve as any of the functions needed to build a
      stream cipher: the next-state function or the output function.  And, in
      fact, that is what block cipher modes are: stream ciphers built using the
      block cipher as a primitive.  A block cipher in output-feedback mode is
      simply the block cipher used as the next-state function, with the output of
      the block cipher being the simple output function.  A block cipher in
      cipher-feedback mode is the same thing, with the addition of the ciphertext
      being fed into the next-state function.  A block cipher in counter mode
      uses the block cipher as the output function, and a simple counter as the
      next-state function.  Cipher block chaining (CBC) is another block-cipher
      mode; I've seen the NSA call this "cipher-driven codebook" mode.  Here the
      block cipher is part of the plaintext-to-ciphertext transformation
      function, and the next-state function is simple.
      
      For some reason I can't explain, for many years academic research on block
      ciphers was more practical than research on stream ciphers.  There were
      more concrete algorithm proposals, more concert analysis, and more
      implementations.  While stream cipher research stayed more theoretical,
      block ciphers were used in security products.  (I assume this was the
      reverse in the military, where stream ciphers were used in products and
      were the target of operational cryptanalysis resources.)  DES's official
      sanction as a standard helped this, but before DES there was Lucifer.  And
      after DES there was FEAL, Khufu and Khafre, IDEA, Blowfish, CAST, and many
      more.
      
      Recently, stream ciphers underwent something of a renaissance.  These new
      stream ciphers were designed for computers and not for discrete hardware.
      Instead of producing output a bit at a time, they produced output a byte at
      a time (like RC4), or 32 bits at a time (like SEAL or WAKE).  And they were
      no longer constrained by a small internal state -- RC4 takes a key and
      turns it into a 256-byte internal state, SEAL's internal state is even
      larger -- or tight hardware-based complexity restrictions.  Stream ciphers,
      which used to be lean and mathematical, started looking as ugly and kludgy
      as block ciphers.  And they started appearing in products as well.
      
      So, block and stream ciphers are basically the same thing; the difference
      is primarily a historical accident.  You can use a block cipher as a stream
      cipher, and you can take any stream cipher and turn it into a block cipher.
       The mode you use depends a lot on the communications medium -- OFB or CBC
      makes the most sense for computer communications with separate error
      detection, while CFB worked really well for radio transmissions -- and the
      algorithm you choose depends mostly on performance, standardization, and
      popularity.
      
      There's even some blurring in modern ciphers.  SEAL, a stream cipher, looks
      a lot like a block cipher in OFB mode.  Skipjack, an NSA-designed block
      cipher, looks very much like a stream cipher.  Some new algorithms can be
      used both as block ciphers and stream ciphers.
      
      But stream ciphers should be faster than block ciphers.  Currently the
      fastest block ciphers encrypt data at 18 clock cycles per byte (that's
      Twofish, the fastest AES submission).  The fastest stream ciphers are even
      faster: RC4 at 9 clock cycles per byte, and SEAL at 4.  (I'm using a
      general 32-bit architecture for comparison; your actual performance may
      vary somewhat.)  I don't believe this is an accident.
      
      Stream ciphers can have a large internal state that changes for every
      output, but block ciphers have to remain the same.  RC4 has a large table
      -- you can think of it as an S-box -- that changes every time there is an
      output.  Most block ciphers also have some kind of S-box, but it remains
      constant for each encryption with the same key.  There's no reason why you
      can't take a block cipher, Blowfish for example, and tweak it so that the
      S-boxes modify themselves with every output.  If you're using the algorithm
      in OFB mode, it will still encrypt and decrypt properly.  But it will be a
      lot harder to break for two reasons.  One, the internal state is a moving
      target and it is a lot harder for an attacker to build model of what is
      going on inside the state.  Two, if the plaintext-to-ciphertext
      transformation is built properly, attacks based on chosen plaintext or
      chosen ciphertext are impossible.  And if it is a lot harder to break a
      cipher with self-modifying internals, then you can probably get by with
      fewer rounds, or less complexity, or something.  I believe that there is
      about a factor of ten speed difference between a good block cipher and a
      good stream cipher.
      
      Designing algorithms is very hard, and I don't suggest that people run out
      and modify every block cipher they see.  We're likely to continue to use
      block ciphers in stream-cipher modes because that's what we're used to, and
      that's what the AES process is going to give us as a new standard.  But
      further research into stream ciphers, and ways of taking advantage of the
      inherent properties of stream ciphers, is likely to produce families of
      algorithms with even better performance.

      From: Markus Kuhn <Markus.Kuhn@cl.cam.ac.uk>
      Subject: German smart-card hack
      
      The note on "German hackers have succeeded in cracking the Siemens digital
      signature chip" in the 1999-12-15 CRYPTO-GRAM is wrong.  I have been in
      contact with the German Hacker (Christian Kahlo) behind this story.  He
      discovered that one user of the Siemens SLE44 chip series included in his
      ROM software a routine that allowed him to upload and execute not only
      interpreter bytecode, but also raw 8052 assembler instructions.  Using this
      undocumented facility, Christian uploaded a tiny assembler program that
      dumped the entire ROM of the card.  The ROM was investigated, posted on the
      USENET as a documented disassembler listing in a TeX file and no
      vulnerabilities were found.  Christian also discovered in the ROM that the
      SLE chips send out the chip type and serial number when the I/O line is
      held low during a positive reset edge and the following 600-700 clock
      cycles, which is a perfectly normal feature (comparable to the BIOS
      power-up message of a PC) that is fully documented in the SLE44 data sheets
      and that is not security relevant.
      
      No smartcard applications were hacked this way, no vulnerability was found
      in any smartcard application, and definitely no private keys were
      compromised.  All this also has nothing to do with digital signatures.  Any
      news to the contrary is the result of misunderstandings by journalists, who
      as usual fill in the gaps of the story with their limited technical
      background knowledge and try to formulate such reports to be more
      spectacular than the story behind them.  The only policy that has been
      violated here is that Siemens -- like most other smartcard chip producers
      -- tries to make sure that nobody except big customers can easily get
      access to smartcard development kits that allow to upload assembler code
      directly, which might otherwise shorten the learning curve for a
      microprobing attacker slightly.  Users of Siemens chips that allow code
      uploads are apparently required to use a bytecode interpreter instead.
      This policy seems to have been ignored secretly by one Siemens customer who
      left a backdoor in his byte-code interpreter to enable the later upload of
      high-speed crypto routines that cannot be implemented sufficiently
      efficient in the bytecode.
      
      Christian discovered this, even though he decided *not* publish the details
      on how he did this or the name of the Siemens customer in whose cards he
      had discovered this.  All he published was a dump of the standard Siemens
      SLE ROM code (CMS = Chip Management System, comparable to a PC BIOS), a
      piece of code that had already been known semi-publicly for many years in
      the pay-TV hacking community from successful microprobing attacks on the
      SLE44 series.  Christian's main contribution is that he has discovered a
      very nice low-cost assembler-level development kit for some of the SLE
      smartcards, which used to cost a fortune and an NDA before.  This is not
      the first time that this has happened: Pay-TV smartcards have been shipped
      before with software that
      provides for uploads of EEPROM software patches with broken authentication
      techniques, which has been known and used in the smartcard tampering
      community for many years.

      Subject: Re: New U.S. Crypto Export Regulations
      
      In CRYPTO-GRAM of December 15, 1999 you wrote about the proposed new U.S.
      crypto export regulations, and I can agree with everything you said.
      However, I believe you missed something important: the view FROM the rest
      of the world.
      
      I work in the finance industry in Europe -- Zurich, to be precise -- and
      have some involvement with security.  This industry (a) WILL NOT use U.S.
      crypto products, and (b) will certainly NOT make any long-term plans or
      partnerships to do so for U.S. products with consumer content, because (a)
      the products to date are forced by law to be weak, but more important, (b)
      the U.S. government can't be trusted.  Even if it approved today the export
      of some products based on strong crypto, everyone knows that this
      permission could be terminated tomorrow for the same or other products.
      And everyone also suspects strongly that the U.S. government will in any
      case force providers to put trap doors into their products.
      
      Under the circumstances, the European finance and e-business industries
      would be have to be crazy to use U.S. crypto-based products.  And they're
      not crazy.
      
      To play in this business in the rest of the world, the U.S. will have to
      have a clear, consistent, and favorable policy, and U.S. companies will
      have to present products that are demonstrably strong with no trap doors.
      (I invite you to speculate if this will happen before Hell freezes over.)
      In the meantime, there are plenty of non-U.S. products to choose from, and
      banks like UBS, Credit Suisse, Grupo Intesa, Societe General, Deutsche
      Bank, Generale Bank, Bank Austria, and Barclays are not sitting back
      anxiously waiting for U.S. products to become available.  They're doing
      business with non-U.S. products that are just fine, thank you.

      Subject: Electronic voting
      
      All these comments regarding electronic voting and absentee voting are
      missing the mark.  The State of Oregon has that all elections (except
      presidential) are done by mail.  It's like the entire state is voting absentee.
      
      The process is actually pretty painless.  You receive your voter pamphlet
      and then you get your ballot.  It has to be in by election day.  If you
      miss the excitement of going to the voting booth there are collection
      points where you can drop off your filled in ballot.  It's really not that
      hard.
      
      The point here is that the state has determined that it is easier (and
      cheaper) to simply process the entire election via the absentee process.
      It now becomes a simple step to go from by mail to by electronic voting.
      All of the arguments regarding coercion must already have been answered
      (the government always thinks a process through completely).  We have
      elected all sorts of politicians without anyone coming back and reporting

      Subject: RE: Absentee Ballots
      
      I just checked some figures with a friend who has the data on Absentee
      Ballots for San Mateo County in California and he has compared it with the
      San Francisco elections held this week.
      
      The percentage of registered voters using absentee ballots is about
      13%-15%.  But the more astonishing is the fact that 35%-50% of those
      actually voting are done by absentee ballots.  The lower figure is for
      national elections and the higher side corresponds to local elections.

      Subject: PKI article--agree and disagree
      
      I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed your article with Carl
      Ellison, "Ten Risks of PKI: What You're not Being Told about Public Key."
      I'm the lead ecommerce attorney for the state of Washington, and we are
      currently procuring a private PKI vendor to provide digital signatures for
      state and local government, similar to the federal government ACES procurement.
      
      What you say that PKI is not needed for ecommerce to flourish is true.
      It's a thought I keep having at all the digital signature law presentations
      I attend, and the theme I had planned to discuss at my March 7 talk in
      Boston on PKI.  One has to keep asking oneself, why do I need a digital
      signature?  What is the opportunity cost of setting up a PKI?  (That is,
      what security improvements could I make if I spent the money on something
      besides PKI).
      
      However, I disagree with this statement in your article:
      
      "In other words, under some digital signature laws (e.g., Utah and
      Washington), if your signing key has been certified by an approved CA, then
      you are responsible for whatever that private key does.  It does not matter
      who was at the computer keyboard or what virus did the signing; you are
      legally responsible."
      
      The law seems to say that at first reading, but my view of the law is that
      it sets up a "rebuttable presumption" of non-repudiation.  This is the same
      rule that applies to physical, pen and ink signatures.  Your statement
      reflects the views of some proponents of PKI who overstate the legal force
      of a "licensed digital signature" under Washington law.  But if, in fact, I
      never applied my digital signature to a document, and I can prove it (e.g.,
      I have an alibi), then I would not be legally responsible.  I believe that
      is the situation in non-PKI electronic signature schemes, where a (paper
      and manually signed) Electronic Data Interchange Agreement or Trading
      Partner Agreement will state that all data submitted between the parties
      carries the same legal force as if it was manually signed.
      
      Having found flaws in the PKI-style laws of Washington, Utah and Minnesota,
      I do not find a great deal of higher or practical intelligence in the more
      popular electronic signature laws, either.  Esignature laws have not proven
      any more important to ecommerce than PKI digital signature laws, so why are
      we in such a rush to pass UETA (uniform electronic transaction act)?
      
      
      From: "Carl Ellison" <cme@acm.org>
      Subject: Re:  PKI article--agree and disagree
      
      You are correct.  However, I believe we still need to warn against the
      rebuttable presumption of non-repudiation.  The keyholder may have no alibi
      at all.  The keyholder may not be aware that his key was misused (e.g., by
      an attacker who had gained physical or network access to his computer).
      
      This is similar to the position people were in in Britain when they were
      challenging ATM card operations.  It took expert witnessing by Ross
      Anderson to defend some of their claims, and even then it didn't always
      work.  There, too, the presumption was that the cardholder performed any
      operation when the ATM logs said he did -- whether he did or not.  It was
      up to the cardholder to prove the negative.
      
      This gets even worse when the keyholder has his private key on a smartcard
      in his possession.  It's that much harder to convince a jury that you
      didn't sign, if the merchant or bank can claim that the signing key never
      left your personal possession.  When an attacker has network access to your
      computer, he doesn't leave a trail.  You have no audit record showing the
      attack.  It's your word against the merchant's and you have no evidence to
      offer on your behalf.  You can't even accuse anyone else.  You have no idea
      who to accuse.
      
      Meanwhile, your account has been debited until you manage to prove your
      point (against the presumption that you're lying).  When you compare this
      to credit card purchases, it's radically different.  With a credit card,
      you have not spent anything until you write the check to the credit card
      company.  When or before you write that check, you can challenge a line
      item and force the merchant to prove that you were in fact the purchaser.
      At  least with my AMEX account, the immediate result is that AMEX removes
      the item from my statement -- to be reinstated if the merchant is able to
      prove that I did do the purchase.  I have had such challenges go my way
      once and the other times, I had simply forgotten.  In one case, I thought I
      was being double-billed, but it turns out I had never been billed the first
      time (many months before).

      Subject: Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems
      
      I read with interest your recent article on ECC in the November 15 issue of
      Crypto-Gram.  I agree with most of your statements and comments.
      
      Your recommendations were:
        1) If you're working in a constrained environment where longer keys just
      won't fit, consider elliptic curves.
        2) If the choice is elliptic curves or no public-key algorithms at all,
      use elliptic curves.
        3) If you don't have performance constraints, use RSA.
        4) If you are concerned about security over the decades (and almost no
      systems are), use RSA.
      
      I certainly agree with recommendations 1) and 2) -- ECC certainly cannot be
      worse than no security at all!
      
      Regarding recommendation 3), I think that most environments which call for
      public-key solutions will have *some* performance constraints.  The
      limiting factor could be an over-burdened web server which needs to sign
      thousands of outgoing messages per minute, a handheld device which is
      communicating with a PC, etc.  In such scenarios, one should select the
      public-key method that performs the best in the most constrained
      environment.  If the constraints involve key sizes, bandwidth, power
      consumption, or speed (for private key operations), then ECC is likely the
      method of choice over RSA.
      
      Finally, I feel that your recommendation that RSA should be used (instead
      of ECC) in situations where you are concerned with long-term security is a
      bit unfair.  After all, as you state in the postscript to your article, all
      the analysis you used on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem also
      applies to the integer factorization problem.  I propose that applications
      which do require long-term security should consider using both* RSA and ECC
      -- by double encrypting a message with RSA and ECC, or by signing a message
      twice with RSA and ECC.
      
      The following are my condensed thoughts on the security and efficiencies of
      ECC as compared with RSA.  They should be considered a supplement to your
      Crypto-Gram article, and not a replacement of it.

      Certicom, and it is in his financial interest for you to believe in

20.0  POPS.C qpop vulnerability scanner by Duro

      /*  POPScan QPOP/UCB/SCO scanner by duro
          duro@dorx.net
      
          takes list of ip's from stdin
          
         The hosts gathered by this scanner are 
         almost 100% vulnerable to a remote
         root attack.  The exploits used to root
         the vulnerable machines can all be found by
         searching bugtraq.  UCB pop is 100% of the
         time vulnerable to the qpop exploit (it's a very
         old version of qpop).  The QPOP version is 
         filitered to make sure that non-vulnerable 
         versions do not show up in the scan.
         Common offsets for the bsd qpop exploit are:
          621, 1500, 500, 300, 900, 0
      
      Example usage:
      
      ./z0ne -o ac.uk | ./pops > ac.uk.log &
      would scan ac.uk for vulnerabilities.

22.0  HACK MY SYSTEM! I DARE YA!
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/_Can_you_break_into_my_system__I_dare_you__.html
      
      Title  "Can you break into my system? I dare you!"

      Summary
      
      We in Beyond Security believe that the only way to test your security is 
      by trying to break it. But we're not as drastic as one Linux system 
      administrator who took this one step further - he is asking attackers to 
      try and break into a server he is administrating.

      Details

      Many administrators have to deal with potentially malicious users having 
      legal accounts on their servers. Universities, ISPs and large companies 
      have to consider the risk that local users, having access to the system as 
      valid users, will       sometime try to elevate their privileges. The 
      system administrator of zeus-olympus.yi.org assumes that some of his users 
      are 'evil'. Although he is confident that his Linux system is secured, he 
      would like others to do their best to attack his system. He therefore 
      provided two user accounts that have normal user access to the system, and 
      he allows anyone who wishes to use those accounts and gain entry to the 
      server. Once logged in, the users are free to try and compromise the 
      system's security, with no strings attached. The only 'catch' is that once 
      vulnerability is found, it should be reported immediately, so that the 
      hole can be closed. This offer is extremely unique. There have been 
      'hacking' contests in the past (usually by commercial companies trying to 
      show that their product is secure), but this is one of the first time that 
      an administrator is offering full access to the machine (using a valid 
      user account) - which of course makes this game much more interesting. 
      Therefore, if you would like to try and break a Linux Redhat machine, join 
      this war game and give it your best shot.

      Additional information

      To join the contest, visit http://zeus-olympus.yi.org/ and enter the 
      'password required' section. The login is: war and the password is game. 
      Upon entering this section, you will receive the account information 
      needed to log into the       server. 
      Feel free to give Danny some feedback about his war game: dannyw@mediaone.net.

      Software pirating ring cracked by local
      FBI 

      February 4, 2000

      BY LORRAINE FORTE STAFF REPORTER 

      Chicago FBI agents say they have broken up a worldwide ring of software
      thieves--called the "Pirates with Attitude"--who were distributing thousands of
      programs, including the yet-unreleased Windows 2000.

      A tip from an informant in Chicago led to the breakup of "one of the most sophisticated
      and longest-standing" piracy and hacking rings, according to a complaint filed Thursday
      in federal court in Chicago. 

      The FBI used the informant's access codes to break into the group's Web site and
      obtain a roster of the suspects.

      Robin Rothberg was arrested Thursday at his home in New Chelmsford, Mass., near
      Boston. Federal officials say he was a founder and key member of the ring, which
      evaded law enforcement for eight years. He is charged with conspiring to infringe
      copyright.

      Three days before Christmas, Rothberg somehow got a copy of Windows 2000--the
      latest update of the operating system, scheduled to go on sale next month--and
      uploaded it to the Internet, according to the criminal complaint.

      Rothberg, an employee of NEC Technologies, accessed the group's Internet site
      through a Zenith Data Systems computer server in Buffalo Grove, the complaint
      states. At least two other users allegedly pirated and distributed software through
      servers in Chicago, at MegsInet Inc. on West Ohio and at Computer Engineers Inc. on
      North Wacker.

      Members of the group downloaded software in exchange for uploading other
      programs, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Griffin. They might then give away or sell
      that software.

      "It was a barter system, with the upshot being that the site itself contained an
      incredible amount of software," Griffin said.

      FBI spokesman Ross Rice said the investigation is continuing. Authorities do not yet
      know the size of the pirating ring, or the monetary value of the thousands of stolen
      software titles allegedly distributed from the group's WAREZ site, called Sentinel.

      WAREZ is a term for an Internet site that distributes pirated versions of software. The
      Sentinel site was launched in April 1996 and was set up so that only authorized users
      could access it; it was not available to the general public.

      The group's members were "carefully screened to minimize the risk of detection" and
      were given specific roles, such as "crackers," who stripped away the copy protection
      often embedded in commercial software; "couriers," who transferred large volumes of
      software files from other pirating sites, and "suppliers," who brought in programs from
      major software companies.

      Rothberg, according to the complaint, stole at least nine other major Microsoft
      programs between June and October 1999. Microsoft did not respond Thursday to
      requests to comment on the case.

      An industry group, the Business Software Alliance, has said software theft costs
      33,000 jobs and $11 billion a year.

      FBI nabs Chelmsford man in software piracy ring 
      by Andrea Estes 

      Friday, February 4, 2000

      Federal officials say they've captured a leader of a worldwide band of
      e-pirates who surf the cyberseas in search of software plunder. 

      Robin Rothberg, 32, of Chelmsford, is a founding member of Pirates
      with Attitudes, an international crew that steals popular titles from
      powerful companies and gives them away to its members for free, the
      FBI says.

      The group, snared by FBI agents in Chicago, is sophisticated and
      devious enough to have sought after software before it hits the
      shelves, authorities said.

      In December, FBI agents found Windows 2000 - which still hasn't
      been released - and Office 2000 premium, a program given to select
      customers for testing purposes.

      In all, agents found enough software to fill the memory of 1,200
      average-sized personal computer hard drives.

      Rothberg, who until last week was a notebook software engineer for
      NEC Computer Services in Acton, was arrested yesterday and
      charged with conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Boston. Wearing a
      long ponytail and black leather jacket, he pleaded not guilty and was
      released without bail.

      According to an FBI affidavit, Pirates with Attitudes is a highly
      structured organization with different members assigned different
      tasks.

      ``Suppliers'' steal the programs from major software companies.
      ``Couriers'' deliver the files to PWA and ``crackers'' strip away the
      security codes that prevent piracy.

      The group, overseen by a council, screens members to ``minimize the
      risk of detection by authorities,'' according to an affidavit filed by FBI
      Special Agent Michael Snyder of Chicago.

      Rothberg, who is alleged to be a member of the council, was arrested
      after an informant helped steer Snyder, an MBA and computer expert,
      through its maze-like system.

      Agents located PWA's internet site, ``Sentinel,'' which is accessible
      only to authorized users.

      ``Members maintain access to PWA's site by providing files, including
      copyrighted software files obtained from other sources, and in turn
      are permitted to copy files provided by other users,'' wrote Snyder.

      ``Using the confidential informant's access codes, FBI agents logged
      onto Sentinel and viewed a directory listing thousands of copyrighted
      software titles available for downloading by PWA members,'' he wrote.

      So far only Rothberg has been arrested. Chicago authorities
      yesterday said the investigation is continuing.

      ``In the simplest terms, it's an organization that allowed its members
      to upload software to a site configured so it could store a substantial
      amount of software,'' said assistant United States Attorney Lisa
      Griffin. ``They could then download it into their own computers.''
      Members give and take what they wish, officials said.

      ``It's a two-way street,'' said Randy Sanborn, spokesman for the
      United States Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Illinois.

      Officials wouldn't say whether members have to pay anything - such
      as a membership fee - for the service.

      Rothberg was downsized out of his job last week when the division he
      worked for ceased to exist, according to an NEC spokeswoman, who
      said the company has no plans to investigate Rothberg's job
      performance.

      Rothberg asked Magistrate Judge Robert Collings for permission to
      travel to California today for a job interview.

      And Rothberg said he had several more planned, his attorney Joseph
      Savage told Collings.

      Collings ordered him to stay off his computer except to look for a job,
      let the FBI spot check his e-mail, and get the court's permission if he
      wants to travel outside the Bay State.

24.0  Mitnick's Release Statement
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      I debated wether or not to include this in this issue since the news is
      saturated with Mitnick stories right now (at least they're taking notice)
      and decided it was valid to include it here in our archives. There are
      many more articles available on Mitnick, so i've just included his release
      statement.

      Mitnick's Release Statement:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      January 21, 2000 


     Kevin Mitnick read the statement shown below upon his release from federal custody in Lompoc, California
     after nearly 5 years behind bars. 

     Mr. Mitnick is the copyright holder of this statement, and hereby gives permission for limited reuse and
     republication under the Fair Use doctrine of U.S. Copyright Law. All other rights reserved. 



     Good morning. 

     Thank you all for taking the time to come out to Lompoc today, my first day of freedom in nearly
     five years. I have a brief statement to read, and I ask that you permit me to read my statement
     without interruption. 

     First, I'd like to thank the millions of people who have visited the website kevinmitnick.com during
     my incarceration, and who took the time to show their support for me during the past five years. I
     relied on their support during the five years I've been incarcerated more than they will ever realize,
     and I want to thank them all from the bottom of my heart. 

     As many of you know, I've maintained virtually complete silence during my incarceration -- I've
     refused dozens of requests for interviews from news organizations from around the world, and for
     very real reasons -- my actions and my life have been manipulated and grossly misrepresented by
     the media since I was 17, when the Los Angeles Times first violated the custom, if not the law, that
     prohibits publication of the names of juveniles accused of crimes. 

     The issues involved in my case are far from over, and will continue to affect everyone in this society
     as the power of the media to define the "villain of the month" continues to increase. 

     You see, my case is about the power of the media to define the playing field, as well as the tilt of
     that playing field -- it's about the power of the media to define the boundaries of "acceptable
     discussion" on any particular issue or story. 

     My case is about the extraordinary breach of journalistic ethics as demonstrated by one man, John
     Markoff, who is a reporter for one of the most powerful media organizations in the world, the New
     York Times. 

     My case is about the extraordinary actions of Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Schindler and
     Christopher Painter to obstruct my ability to defend myself at every turn. 

     And, most importantly, my case is about the extraordinary favoritism and deference shown by the
     federal courts toward federal prosecutors who were determined to win at any cost, and who went as
     far as holding me in solitary confinement to coerce me into waiving my fundamental Constitutional
     rights. If we can't depend on the courts to hold prosecutors in check, then whom can we depend on?

     I've never met Mr. Markoff, and yet Mr. Markoff has literally become a millionaire by virtue of his
     libelous and defamatory reporting -- and I use the word "reporting" in quotes -- Mr. Markoff has
     become a millionaire by virtue of his libelous and defamatory reporting about me in the New York
     Times and in his 1991 book "Cyberpunk." 

     On July 4th, 1994, an article written by Mr. Markoff was published on the front page of the New
     York Times, above the fold. Included in that article were as many as 60 -- sixty! -- unsourced
     allegations about me that were stated as fact, and that even a minimal process of fact-checking
     would have revealed as being untrue or unproven. 

     In that single libelous and defamatory article, Mr. Markoff labeled me, without justification, reason,
     or supporting evidence, as "cyberspace's most wanted," and as "one of the nation's most wanted
     computer criminals." 

     In that defamatory article, Mr. Markoff falsely claimed that I had wiretapped the FBI -- I hadn't --
     that I had broken into the computers at NORAD -- which aren't even connected to any network on
     the outside -- and that I was a computer "vandal," despite the fact that I never damaged any
     computer I've ever accessed. Mr. Markoff even claimed that I was the "inspiration" for the movie
     "War Games," when a simple call to the screenwriter of that movie would have revealed that he had
     never heard of me when he wrote his script. 

     In yet another breach of journalistic ethics, Mr. Markoff failed to disclose in that article -- and in all
     of his following articles about me -- that we had a pre-existing relationship, by virtue of Mr.
     Markoff's authorship of the book "Cyberpunk." Mr. Markoff also failed to disclose in any of his
     articles about this case his pre-existing relationship with Tsutomu Shimomura, by virtue of his
     personal friendship with Mr. Shimomura for years prior to the July 4, 1994 article Mr. Markoff wrote
     about me. 

     Last but certainly not least, Mr. Markoff and Mr. Shimomura both participated as de facto
     government agents in my arrest, in violation of both federal law and jounalistic ethics. They were
     both present when three blank warrants were used in an illegal search of my residence and my
     arrest, and yet neither of them spoke out against the illegal search and illegal arrest. 

     Despite Mr. Markoff's outrageous and libelous descriptions of me, my crimes were simple crimes of
     trespass. I've acknowledged since my arrest in February 1995 that the actions I took were illegal,
     and that I committed invasions of privacy -- I even offered to plead guilty to my crimes soon after
     my arrest. But to suggest without reason or proof, as did Mr. Markoff and the prosecutors in this
     case, that I had committed any type of fraud whatsoever, is simply untrue, and unsupported by the
     evidence. 

     My case is a case of curiosity -- I wanted to know as much as I could find out about how phone
     networks worked, and the "ins" and "outs" of computer security. There is NO evidence in this case
     whatsoever, and certainly no intent on my part at any time, to defraud anyone of anything. 

     Despite the absence of any intent or evidence of any scheme to defraud, prosecutors Schindler and
     Painter refused to seek a reasonable plea agreement -- indeed, their first "offer" to me included the
     requirement that I stipulate to a fraud of $80 million dollars, and that I agree never to disclose or
     reveal the names of the companies involved in the case. 

     Have you ever heard of a fraud case where the prosecutors attempted to coverup the existence of
     the fraud? I haven't. But that was their method throughout this case -- to manipulate the amount of
     the loss in this case, to exaggerate the alleged harm, to cover up information about the companies
     involved, and to solicit the companies involved in this case to provide falsified "damages" consistent
     with the false reputation created by Mr. Markoff's libelous and defamatory articles about me in the
     New York Times. 

     Prosecutors David Schindler and Christopher Painter manipulated every aspect of this case, from
     my personal reputation to the ability of my defense attorney to file motions on time, and even to the
     extent of filing a 1700 item exhibit list immediately before trial. It was the prosecutors' intent in this
     case to obstruct justice at every turn, to use the unlimited resources of the government and the
     media to crush a defendant who literally had no assets with which to mount a defense. 

     The fact of the matter is that I never deprived the companies involved in this case of anything. I
     never committed fraud against these companies. And there is not a single piece of evidence
     suggesting that I did so. If there was any evidence of fraud, do you really think the prosecutors in
     this case would have offered me a plea bargain? Of course not. 

     But prosecutors Schindler and Painter would never have been able to violate my Constitutional rights
     without the cooperation of the United States federal court system. As far as we know, I am the only
     defendant in United States' history to ever be denied a bail hearing. Recently, Mr. Painter claimed
     that such a hearing would have been "moot," because, in his opinion, the judge in this case would not
     have granted bail. 

     Does that mean that the judge in this case was biased against me, and had her mind made up before
     hearing relevant testimony? Or does that mean that Mr. Painter believes it is his right to determine
     which Constitutional rights defendants will be permitted to have, and which rights they will be
     denied? 

     The judge in this case consistently refused to hold the prosecutors to any sort of prosecutorial
     standard whatsoever, and routinely refused to order the prosecutors to provide copies of the
     evidence against me for nearly four years. For those of you who are new to this case, I was held in
     pre-trial detention, without a bail hearing and without bail, for four years. During those four years, I
     was never permitted to see the evidence against me, because the prosecutors obstructed our efforts
     to obtain discovery, and the judge in this case refused to order them to produce the evidence against
     me for that entire time. I was repeatedly coereced into waiving my right to a speedy trial because
     my attorney could not prepare for trial without being able to review the evidence against me. 

     Please forgive me for taking up so much of your time. The issues in this case are far more important
     than me, they are far more important than an unethical reporter for the New York Times, they're far
     more important than the unethical prosecutors in this case, and they are more important than the
     judge who refused to guarantee my Constitutional rights. 

     The issues in this case concern our Constitutional rights, the right of each and every one of us to be
     protected from an assault by the media, and to be protected from prosecutors who believe in winning
     at any cost, including the cost of violating a defendant's fundamental Constitutional rights. 

     What was done to me can be done to each and every one of you. 

     In closing, let me remind you that the United States imprisons more people than any other country on
     earth. 

     Again, thank you for taking time out of your busy lives to come to Lompoc this morning, and thank
     you all for your interest and your support.

      Hacker Mitnick released Friday
      
      By Kevin Poulsen, ZDNet News
      UPDATED January 21, 2000 9:30 AM PT
      
       For the first time since 1995, computer criminal Kevin Mitnick is a free
      man.  But will he hack again?
      
       Nearly five years after news of his arrest blazed across the nation's
      headlines, hacker Kevin Mitnick walked out of a medium security prison in
      Lompoc, Calif., early friday morning...
      
       Nearly five years after news of his arrest blazed across the nation's
      headlines, hacker Kevin Mitnick walked out of a medium security prison in
      Lompoc, Calif., early Friday morning -- and into an uncertain future.
      
       The 36-year-old hacker was greeted at the gate by friends and family
      members. His mother will drive him to Los Angeles, where his first order of
      business will be to obtain a driver's license, report to his new probation
      officer and see a doctor about injuries he suffered in a prison bus accident
      last year.
      
      "He's having neck pains, and back and shoulder pains," said Reba Vartanian,
      Mitnick's grandmother. "He hasn't had a regular doctor in five years."
      
       A free man for the first time since 1995, he will live in the Los Angeles
      suburb of Westlake Village with his father, Alan Mitnick, a general
      contractor.
      
       Less clear is what Mitnick is going to do for a living. Under court order,
      the hacker is banned for three years from using any kind of computer
      equipment without the prior written permission of his probation officer -- a
      restriction that even the court acknowledged would affect his employability.
      "He's experiencing a lot of frustration over the things he can't do," said
      Eric Corley, editor of the hacker magazine 2600 and the leader of a "Free
      Kevin" grass-roots movement. "Keep in mind this is someone who's been kept
      away from these things for five years, and when he gets out he won't even be
      able to touch them."
      
       Does incarceration cure an addict?
      The restrictions, and long history of recidivism, make one former friend and
      partner-in-crime pessimistic about Mitnick's future. "Do you cure a drug
      addict or alcoholic by incarceration on its own?" asked Lew DePayne,
      rhetorically. "Do you cure him by taking away his ability to earn a living?"
      
       Mitnick and DePayne became friends in the late 1970s, when they were both
      teenagers. Together, they explored and manipulated the telephone network as
      Los Angeles' most notorious "phone phreaks." In the 1980s, DePayne seemingly
      dropped out of the scene, while Mitnick moved on to corporate computers and
      networks, developing a penchant for cracking systems in search of
      proprietary "source code," the virtual blueprints for a computer program or
      operating system.
      
       Mitnick had already been in a series of minor skirmishes with the law when,
      in 1989, he suffered his first adult felony conviction for cracking
      computers at Digital Equipment Corp. and downloading source code. He served
      one year in federal custody, followed by three years of supervised release.
      
      In 1992, Mitnick was charged with a violation of his supervision for
      associating with DePayne again. He went underground and online, using the
      Internet to crack computers belonging to such cell phone and computer makers
      as Motorola (NYSE: MOT), Fujtsu and Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) and to
      copy more proprietary source code. The FBI captured him on Feb. 15, 1995,
      when computer security expert Tsutomu Shimomura suffered an attack on his
      machine and responded by tracking Mitnick to his hideout in Raleigh, N.C.
      
       Shimomura and New York Times reporter John Markoff went on to write the
      book "Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted Computer
      Outlaw -- By The Man Who Did It." Shimomura and Markoff sold the movie
      rights to Miramax Films, who cast Skeet Ulrich as Mitnick. But since
      shooting wrapped on the project in December 1998 the movie has languished on
      the shelf with no known theatrical release date, surrounded by swirling
      rumors of a direct-to-video or cable TV release. Miramax publicists didn't
      return telephone inquiries about the project.
      
       Mitnick's arrest began a series of courtroom battles over procedures and
      evidence that finally ended last year in a plea agreement.
      
      The hacker pleaded guilty in March 1999 to seven felonies and admitted to
      his Internet hacking. In August 1999, Judge Marianna Pfaelzer sentenced him
      to 46 months in prison, on top of an earlier 22 months sentence for the
      supervision violation and cell phone cloning. With credit for his lengthy
      period of pretrial custody, and some time off for good behavior, Mitnick's
      served just under five years in prison.
      
       "My sincere hope is that he gets his act together and complies with the
      conditions of his supervised release and doesn't engage in further hacking
      activity," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter, one of
      Mitnick's two federal prosecutors. Painter's work on the Mitnick case helped
      propel him to a position as deputy chief of the U.S. Department of Justice's
      computer crime and intellectual property section in Washington, D.C. He
      begins at the DOJ in March.
      
       "I think that the significance of this case is that he was so prolific. He
      not only had done this once before, but he did it on such a large scale,"
      Painter said. "If past ends up being prologue, then certainly we'll go back
      to court and deal with it at that time."
      
      From hacking to ham?
      Greg Vinson, one of Mitnick's defense attorneys, foresees a rosier future
      for the hacker, perhaps with a job that exploits his famous ability to
      "social engineer" people into doing his bidding.
      
       "I think he's had a number of different offers to kind of do PR-type of
      work," said Vinson, who also points out that Mitnick might still get a
      computer job. "You have to remember the order says, 'Without the prior
      express permission of the probation office.' So it's not absolutely
      prohibited."
      
      If Mitnick can't use computers, he reportedly hopes to indulge his love for
      technology by returning to amateur radio, a childhood passion. Federal
      Communications Commission records show that Mitnick's license expired last
      month. According to Kimberly Tracey, a ham radio operator in Los Angeles and
      a friend of Mitnick's, he's been scrambling to renew it.
      
      "This is going to be part of Kevin's life, because they've taken away
      computers and everything else," said Tracey. "I hope they don't take away
      this."
      
      Mitnick was unavailable for comment on his imminent release. Sources close
      to the hacker say he granted the CBS news show "60 Minutes" an exclusive
      interview last week, which is scheduled to air Sunday.
      
      But in an interview with ZDNet News last July, Mitnick complained about his
      treatment by the government prosecutors, who he said were "grossly
      exaggerating the losses in the case and the damages I caused." (See: Mitnick
      says, "I was never a malicious person.")
      
      DePayne: Anger a major stumbling block
      DePayne, Mitnick's former friend and co-defendant, worries that Mitnick's
      anger will work against him in his new life.
      
      "I don't know if that's ever going to go away; I don't know if he'll be able
      to deal with it," said DePayne, speaking from his home in Palo Alto. Calif.,
      where he's serving six months house arrest for aiding Mitnick's hacking
      during his fugitive years. "That's going to be a major stumbling block for
      him going forward."
      
      DePayne said he last heard from Mitnick the night of his arrest, on a
      message left on his answering machine. Now 39 years old, divorced and
      heading a small Internet company of his own, DePayne insists he doesn't plan
      on associating with the impish hacker he first met as a brash teenager two
      decades ago.
      
      "I can't be fooling around with these stunts and practical jokes that Kevin
      might want to fool around with," said DePayne. "I'll miss Kevin. I won't
      miss the trouble he brings to the table."

      Mitnick: I was manipulated
      
       By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News
      UPDATED January 21, 2000 3:41 PM PT
      
       Just freed from prison Friday, notorious hacker Kevin Mitnick slammed
      prosecutors and a New York Times' reporter for allegedly treating him
      unjustly in the court and in the media over the past six years.
       "Prosecutors ... manipulated every aspect of this case from my personal
      reputation, to the ability of my defense attorney to file motions in time,
      and even to the extent of filing a 1,700-item exhibit list immediately
      before a trial," said Mitnick, reading from a three-page statement to
      reporters gathered near the Lompoc, Calif. prison facility, minutes after
      being released from the medium-security prison.
      
      Almost five years ago, federal authorities arrested Mitnick on a 25-count
      indictment relating to misuse of Pacific Bell equipment for illegal wiretaps
      and copying proprietary source code from Motorola, Sun Microsystems Inc.,
      NEC Corp. and Novell, among others.
      
      "My case is one of curiosity," said Mitnick. "There was no intent to defraud
      anyone of anything."
      
      New York Times' reporter John Markoff covered the latter portion of the
      two-and-a-half year pursuit of Mitnick, and in a July 4, 1994, article
      called him "Cyberspace's most wanted."
      
      Mitnick blames the hype surrounding his elusive flight from authorities and
      his subsequent arrest on Markoff's article. In addition, the 36-year old
      ex-hacker claims that Markoff crossed the line by bringing authorities and
      computer expert Tsutomu Shimomura together to track him down.
      
      Mitnick went as far as to call the article libelous and defamatory.
      
       In a Friday morning interview, Markoff stood by his reporting, saying that
      the allegations were "really disappointing to me because it suggests that in
      the past five years, and perhaps in the last 20 years, Kevin has not learned
      anything. What he might have learned from all his time in prison is that it
      is wrong to break into other people's computers. I don't think it is anymore
      complex than that."
      
       Markoff pointed out that Mitnick had been arrested five times in the last
      20 years for computer-related crimes. "The problem is, and the reason the
      judge kept him away from computers, (is that) this is the fifth time that he
      has been arrested. It's not like they haven't given him chances," said
      Markoff.
      
      Markoff also denied any ethical breach. "I won't get into the specifics on
      those three cases," Markoff said. "I want to say that I stand by my story,
      and to note that it was written while Kevin was a fugitive from four law
      enforcement agencies, and that's why it was written."
      
      In court, Mitnick also claims he didn't get a fair shake.
      
      Looking tired and much thinner than five years ago, the bespectacled
      cybercriminal blamed prosecution for blocking his defense from acting on his
      behalf. "Their method (in) this case was to manipulate the amount of loss to
      exaggerate the alleged harm," he said.
      
      "I've acknowledged since my arrest in February, 1995, that the actions I
      took were illegal, and that I committed invasions of privacy. But to suggest
      without reason or proof, as did Mr. Markoff and the prosecutors in this
      case, that I had committed any type of fraud whatsoever, is simply untrue,
      and unsupported by the evidence."
      
      Damages 'grossly inflated'
      In total, the prosecution estimated damages at $80 million by including the
      full R&D costs of the applications and source code that Mitnick copied, even
      though none of the code was ever sold to another company or is known to have
      been used by a competitor.
      
      "Everybody realizes that those (estimates) were greatly inflated," said
      Jennifer Granick, a San Francisco defense attorney, who represented hacker
      Kevin Poulsen in litigation following that hacker's release from prison.
      (Poulsen is a ZDNet News contributor.)
      
      The number may sound familiar. That's because David L. Smith, who plead
      guilty to writing and releasing the Melissa virus in December, similarly
      admitted to the prosecutor's assessed damages of $80 million.
      
      It's no coincidence: Under federal law that is the maximum amount accounted
      for by sentencing guidelines. In fact, it is usually the major factor in
      determining the length of jail time.
      
      That leads to a skewed pursuit of justice, said Granick. "The criminal
      courts are here to deal with societal wrongs," she said. "It is not their
      primary purpose to recompense the victims."
      
      "I hope that the Kevin Mitnick case is the last case of the great '80s
      hacker hysteria," she continued. "I hope that we won't have the same kind of
      hype in the future so that people can get a fair shake in the media and in
      court."
      
      The U.S. Attorney's office could not comment by press time.

      The case of the kung fu 'phreak'
      
       Did Kevin Mitnick really trash-talk his hunter, Tsutomu Shimomura, about
      his kung fu ability? The real kung fu prankster is unmasked.
      
      By Kevin Poulsen, ZDNet News
      January 21, 2000 11:59 AM PT
      
      Two days after computer security expert Tsutomu Shimomura suffered the
      now-legendary Christmas Day 1994 hack-attack that launched his search for
      Kevin Mitnick, a mysterious message left on his voice mail box added
      real-world menace to the cyberspace crime.
       "Damn you, my technique is the best," said an odd voice in a faux-British
      accent. "I know sendmail technique, and my style is much better ... Me and
      my friends, we'll kill you."
      
      Three days later the caller left another message, this time beginning with a
      kung fu scream and affecting the voice of an actor in a martial arts film:
      "Your security technique will be defeated. Your technique is no good."
      
      In a third message, on Feb. 4, 1995, the caller chided Shimomura, who he
      called "grasshopper," for mentioning the messages in a Newsweek article on
      the intrusion and for putting digitized copies on the Internet. "Don't you
      know that my kung fu is the best?"
      
      The taunting phone calls were presumed to be from Shimomura's intruder, and
      they became a fixture in the Shimomura vs. Mitnick manhunt story. Digitized
      copies can be found on the official Web site for Shimomura's book,
      "Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted Computer
      Outlaw -- By The Man Who Did It."
      
      The equation of hacking with kung fu fighting has become a cultural
      touchstone in its own right, and on more than one occasion the "Lone Gunmen"
      hackers on Fox's "The X-Files" have been heard to mutter, "My kung fu is the
      best."
      
      The real kung fu 'phreak'
      The only problem is, the thinly disguised voice never sounded at all like
      Kevin Mitnick, and two of the messages came after the hacker had been
      arrested.
      
      "I heard that this guy named Shimomura had been hacked ... So I just
      thought, What the hell, I'd leave some voice mails," says 31-year-old Zeke
      Shif. "I used to watch kung fu movies a lot."
      
      Under the handle "SN," Shif once had a solid reputation in the computer
      underground as a "phone phreak" (i.e., phone hacker). But he says that, by
      1995, his fear of "The Man" had long since scared him straight; he simply
      succumbed to the temptation to make some prank phone calls.
      
      "I thought I'd be funny," says Shif, who like many hackers from the early
      1990s has gone on to work in the computer security trade, for Virginia-based
      Network Security Technologies Inc.
      
      The matter became less amusing when Shif read the news reports on Feb. 15,
      1995. "I found out Mitnick got caught, and they were trying to link that to
      the voice mail," says Shif, who responded by calling Shimomura again. "I
      left a pre-emptive messages, saying, listen, this has nothing to do with any
      Mitnick or anything, I'm just making fun of kung fu movies."
      
      And this time, he didn't call him grasshopper.

      Mitnick Released

      Mitnick Released
      
       Hacker Kevin Mitnick, released after nearly five years in prison, blames
      the media and federal prosecutors for his imprisonment.
      
      By Iolande Bloxsom  January 21, 2000
      
      Convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick was released early this morning from federal
      prison in Lompoc, California.
      
      Possibly the most famous hacker ever, Mitnick was arrested in February of
      1995, and has spent almost five years in prison.
      
      In a prepared statement, Mitnick had harsh words for both the media and
      federal prosecutors, both of whom he blamed for his long incarceration.
      
      The media "grossly misreported" his case and created what he called the
      "villain of the month." He also railed against the media for "defin[ing]
      what is 'acceptable discussion'."
      
      Mitnick singled out John Markoff, a reporter for The New York Times,
      accusing him of "libelous and defamatory reporting-- and I use the word
      reporting in quotes." He charged that Markoff's articles had facts that were
      untrue, that were unproven, and that Markoff failed to disclose a previous
      relationship. (Mitnick appeared in Cyberpunk, a book Markoff co-wrote with
      Katie Hafner in 1995.) Finally, Mitnick claimed that the journalist "is a
      millionaire" now because of his reporting on the convicted hacker.
      
      In a later interview with ZDTV's Janet Yee, Markoff said he stood by his
      reporting.
      
      However, Mitnick had equal censure for prosecutors David Schindler and
      Christopher Painter, who, he claimed "went as far as holding me in solitary
      confinement," to try to force him to plead guilty. He says, though, that his
      crime was one of trespass, rather than fraud. "I never deprived company's of
      anything... there was never any evidence of fraud."
      
      Mitnick pleaded guilty on March 26, 1999, to seven felonies, including
      unauthorized intrusion into computers at cellular telephone companies,
      software manufacturers, ISPs, and universities. He also admitted to
      illegally downloading proprietary software from some of these companies.
      
      In August, US District Court Judge Marianna Pfaelzer sentenced Mitnick to 46
      months in prison and ordered him to pay $4,125 in restitution. She also
      ordered Mitnick not to touch a computer or cellular phone without written
      approval from his probation officer.
      
      The sentence, governed by a plea agreement between Mitnick and his
      prosecutors, ran on top of the 22 months he already received for cell-phone
      cloning and a probation violation, for a total of 68 months. With credit for
      his lengthy pretrial custody and some time off for good behavior, Mitnick
      served just less than five years in prison.
      
      Mitnick is headed back to Los Angeles, where his family lives.

      Mitnick's Digital Divide
      
      It's the year 2000, and Kevin Mitnick is going free. The problem is, he'll
      be trapped in 1991.
      
       By Kevin Poulsen  January 12, 2000
      
       On Friday, January 21, hacker Kevin Mitnick will go free after nearly five
      years behind bars. But when he walks out the gates of the Lompoc federal
      correctional institution in California, he'll be burdened with a crippling
      handicap: a court order barring him for up to three years from possessing or
      using computers, "computer-related" equipment, software, and anything that
      could conceivably give him access to the Internet.
      
      These anti-computer restrictions are even more ridiculous today than when I
      faced them upon leaving federal custody in June, 1996.
      
       In the wired world of 2000, you'd be hard pressed to find a job flipping
      burgers that didn't require access to a computerized cash register, and
      three years from now McDonald's applicants will be expected to know a little
      Java and a smattering of C++.
      
       Since Mitnick's arrest in 1995, the Internet has grown from a hopeful ditty
      to a deafening orchestral roar rattling the windows of society. The
      importance of computer access in America has been acknowledged by the White
      House in separate initiatives to protect technological infrastructure from
      "cyberterrorists," and to bridge the so-called digital divide between
      information haves and have-nots. "We must connect all of our citizens to the
      Internet," vowed President Clinton last month.
      
      He was not referring to Kevin Mitnick.
      
      Mitnick, dubbed the "World's Most Notorious Hacker" by Guinness, pleaded
      guilty on March 26 to seven felonies, and admitted to cracking computers at
      cellular telephone companies, software manufacturers, ISPs, and
      universities, as well as illegally downloading proprietary software. Though
      he's never been accused of trying to make money from his crimes, he's been
      in and out of trouble for his nonprofit work since he was a teenager.
      
      So, the theory goes, keeping Mitnick away from computers will deprive a
      known recidivist of the instruments of crime and set him on the road to
      leading a good and law-abiding life.
      
      I've heard that theory from prosecutors, judges and my (then) probation
      officer. They all compare computers to lock picks, narcotics, and guns--
      everything but a ubiquitous tool used by a quarter of all Americans and
      nearly every industry.
      
      Mitnick, we should believe, will be tempted in the next year or so to crack
      some more computers and download some more software. But when the crucial
      moment comes for him to commit a felony that could land him in prison for a
      decade, his fingers will linger indecisively over the keyboard as he
      realizes, "Wait! I can't use a computer! My probation officer will be
      pissed!"
      
      The fact is, if Mitnick chooses crime, he won't be deterred by the 11 months
      in prison that a technical supervised release violation could carry. These
      conditions only prevent him from making legitimate use of computers.
      
      Mitnick's rehabilitation is up to him. But the system shouldn't throw up
      obstructions by keeping him away from the mainstream, on the sidelines, and
      out of the job market. His probation officer will have the power to ease his
      restrictions, perhaps by allowing him to get a computer job with the
      informed consent of his employer. That would be a good start.
      
      January 21 will be a happy day for Mitnick, his family, and friends. But
      getting out of prison after a long stretch carries challenges too. Nobody is
      served by stranding the hacker on the wrong side of the digital divide.

       Hacker files motion accusing government of misconduct -- goes on the record
      with ZDNN. 'The federal government manipulated the facts.'
      
      By Kevin Poulsen, ZDNet News
      July 30, 1999 4:36 PM PT
      
       Kevin Mitnick and his attorneys are asking a federal judge to unseal a
      court filing that they claim proves the government was guilty of misconduct
      while building its case against the hacker. The goal, says Mitnick in a rare
      interview, is to clear his name.
       "At the beginning of this case the federal government manipulated the facts
      to allege losses that were grossly inflated," Mitnick said in a telephone
      interview Thursday night from the Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center.
      "Hopefully, if the court considers this motion and rules upon its merits, it
      will clear me publicly of the allegations that I caused these significant
      losses."
      
       The motion, filed by defense attorney Don Randolph on July 22, is the
      latest conflict in a case that's remained unusually acrimonious, considering
      that both sides reached a plea settlement in March. Under the terms of the
      agreement, Mitnick pleaded guilty to seven felonies and admitted to
      penetrating computers at such companies as Motorola (NYSE:MOT), Fujitsu and
      Sun Microsystems, (Nasdaq:SUNW) and downloading proprietary source code. On
      Aug. 9, he's expected to be sentenced to 46 months in prison, on top of the
      22 months he received for cell phone cloning and an earlier supervised
      release violation.
      
      Mitnick vexed by 'snowball effect'
      The only sentencing issue left unresolved is the amount of money Mitnick
      will owe his victims.
      
      Prosecutors are seeking $1.5 million in restitution -- a modest figure
      compared to the more than $80 million the government quoted to an appeals
      court last year, when it successfully fought to hold the hacker without
      bail. That figure, though no longer promulgated by prosecutors, vexes
      Mitnick, who sees a "snowball effect" of bad press that began with a 1994
      front-page article in the New York Times.
      
      "Because of this assault that was made upon me by John Markoff of the New
      York Times, then the federal government grossly exaggerating the losses in
      the case and the damages I caused, I have a desire to clear my name,"
      Mitnick said. "The truth of the matter is that I was never a malicious
      person. I admit I was mischievous, but not malicious in any sense."
      
       Markoff reported on Mitnick for the New York Times, and went on to
      co-author Tsutomu Shimomura's book, "Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of
      America's Most Wanted Computer Outlaw -- By The Man Who Did It," slated as
      an upcoming movie from Miramax. Markoff's portrayal of Mitnick, and the
      profit it ultimately earned him, has been the subject of some criticism from
      Mitnick's supporters, and raised eyebrows with a handful of journalists.
      
       Markoff's most enduring Mitnick anecdote is the story that the hacker
      cracked NORAD in the early 1980s, a claim that was recycled as recently as
      last May by another New York Times reporter. "I never even attempted to
      access their computer, let alone break into it," Mitnick said. "Nor did I do
      a host of allegations that he says I'm guilty of."
      
      For his part, Markoff says of the NORAD story: "I had a source who was a
      friend of Kevin's who told me that. I was not the first person to report it,
      nor the only person to report it."
      
       Government collusion?
      The July 22 motion filed by Mitnick's attorney accuses the government of
      coaching victim companies on how to artificially inflate their losses. The
      filing is based on documents Randolph subpoenaed from Sun, which show that
      shortly after Mitnick's February 1995 arrest, the FBI specifically
      instructed Sun to calculate its losses as "the value of the source code"
      Mitnick downloaded, and to keep the figure "realistic."
       Following the FBI's advice, Sun estimated $80 million in losses based on
      the amount they paid to license the Unix operating system. Six other
      companies responded, using software development costs as the primary
      calculus of loss. The total bill came to $299,927,389.61, significantly more
      than the $1.5 million the government says Mitnick inflicted in repair and
      monitoring costs, and theft of services and the $5 million to $10 million
      both sides stipulated to for purposes of sentencing.
      
      "At the beginning of this litigation, the government misrepresented to the
      federal judiciary, the public and the media the losses that occurred in my
      case," Mitnick said.
      
      To Randolph, it all smacks of collusion. "What comes out from the e-mails
      that we have, is that the so-called loss figures solicited by the government
      were research and development costs at best, fantasy at worst," he said. "I
      would classify it as government manipulation of the evidence."
      
      However, prosecutor David Schindler dismissed Randolph's claims as "silly
      and preposterous."
      
      "What would be inappropriate is to tell them what dollar amount to arrive
      at. In terms of the methodology, in terms of what is to be included in loss
      amounts, that direction is something we often provide because we're aware of
      what components are allowable under law, and which components are not," he
      said.
      
      Schindler said development costs are a valid indicator of victim loss, but
      acknowledges that putting a dollar figure on software can be difficult.
      
      Mitnick claims cover-up
      Mitnick and his attorney both say there's more to the story, but they can't
      talk about it. At Mitnick's last court appearance on July 12, the judge
      granted a government request that any filings relating to victim loss be
      sealed from the public.
      
      "As much as the government would like to, you can't take the recipe for ice
      and file it under seal and have it become confidential," said Mitnick, who,
      along with his attorney, is challenging the confidentiality of the loss
      information, and asking for the motion to be unsealed.
      
      Mitnick claims he smells a cover-up. "The government should not be permitted
      to bury the truth of the case from the public and the media by seeking and
      obtaining a protective order to essentially force me to enter a code of
      silence," he said.
      
      "Our only concern, as it has been from day one, is the protection of the
      victims of Mitnick's crimes," prosecutor Schindler said. "Why Mitnick and
      his lawyers want to continue to harass, embarrass and abuse them remains a
      mystery to us, but it's something that we will continue to oppose
      vigorously."
      
      Although the software costs are no longer being used against his client,
      Randolph claimed that by "manipulating the loss figures," the government
      raises the issue of whether even the more modest $1.5 million calculation is
      accurate. In the sealed motion, he's seeking an evidentiary hearing to
      explore the matter, and asking that Mitnick be released on a signature bond
      pending that hearing.
      
      And if Mitnick winds up owing money anyway? "We're asking for sanctions that
      the government pay the restitution," Mitnick said, "and that the judge
      recommend that I be immediately designated to a halfway house for the
      government's misconduct in this case."
      
      Excerpt of the Sun documents are available on the Free Kevin Web site,
      maintained by members of a tireless grass-roots movement that's protested
      the hacker's imprisonment for years. "I'd like to sincerely thank all my
      friends and supporters for all the support they've given me over this long
      period of time," Mitnick said. "I'd like to thank them from my heart."

25.0 Hackers vs Pedophiles, taking on a new approach.
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,33869,00.html
     
      Hackers' New Tack on Kid Porn 
      by Lynn Burke 
      
      3:00 a.m. 3.Feb.2000 PST Kent Browne used to spend most of his free time 
      hacking Web sites, erasing hard drives, disabling servers, and knocking 
      folks out of chat rooms. 

      Like many hackers, he subscribed to the classic Machiavellian argument, 
      that the end justifies the means -- especially when the end was 
      eradicating child pornography on the Internet. 

      
      In early December, he and some fellow hackers from New York to Australia 
      started a group called Condemned, and announced their intention to take 
      down child pornographers by any means necessary. 

      But when Browne, 41, talked to Parry Aftab, an attorney who heads the 
      biggest and most well-known of the anti-child pornography groups -- Cyber 
      Angels -- he had a sudden change of heart. 

      "She said that the one problem we would have would be with law 
      enforcement. If they knew we were doing illegal stuff, they wouldn't touch 
      us with a 10-foot pole," he said. "Quite frankly, I'm an older guy. I've 
      got two kids. And I       don't want to take any chances." 

      So now he and the rest of Condemned's loosely organized volunteers use 
      specially designed software and good old-fashioned Internet search engines 
      to ferret out the bad stuff and tip off federal agents in the U.S. Customs 
      Service       and the FBI. 

      They're not alone. Natasha Grigori and her volunteer staff at 
      antichildporn.org have also decided to hang up their hacking shoes. At her 
      old organization, Anti Child Porn Militia, Grigori was dedicated to the 
      use of hacking to disable child       pornography Web sites. 

      "We started out very angry, we started out very militant," she said. 

      But a trip to Def Con in Las Vegas made her change her mind. She started 
      talking with people on the right side of the law, and they told her they 
      supported her cause, but not her means. 

      "You can't stop a felony with a felony," she says now. 

      But the decision to go "legal" was a difficult one, and she lost most of 
      her volunteer hackers. 

      "Less than a dozen out of 250 stuck with us," she said. "They didn't like 
      the idea. They just thought we could rip and tear."       Browne also says 
      he had a hard time leaving the hacking behind, mostly because he thought 
      it was right. 

      "Which is more illegal? Having children's pictures on the Internet or 
      hacking down the servers?" he asked. "Morally, I felt I was right." 

      But morals don't make hacking the right way to eliminate child 
      pornography, according to Aftab, the author of The Parent's Guide to 
      Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace. She says hacking complicates the 
      fight and casts a cloud       over groups like hers that work closely with 
      law enforcement. 

      "We need help but we need the right help," she said. 

      When a site is taken down off the Web, it turns up somewhere else, usually 
      within minutes, she said. And if a server is destroyed, so is the evidence 
      of the person behind it. 

      "I'd frankly love to able to do all kinds of things to these groups," she 
      said. "You can't let your gut reaction dictate how you react to a 
      disgusting situation." 

      Getting a gauge on the prevalence of child pornography is difficult. 
      Experts say that most of the images of child pornography are downloaded 
      from newsgroups and traded in secret email clubs. 

      Aftab says true child pornography -- the kind that features children who 
      are very young -- isn't very easy to stumble across on the Web. It takes 
      some digging, she says, for her volunteers to find about 150 new sites 
      each month. 

      And the reason a group like hers is necessary, she says, is that the 
      technological savvy of the law enforcement is lacking. 

      "When the total technology behind the cops is that one guy uses AOL at 
      home, it's kind of hard to do cyber-forensics," she said. 

      Grigori said she recently asked a federal agent to come to her office for 
      a meeting to talk about the problem. "The one fed looked at my computer 
      like it was a toaster," she said. "I asked him for his email address, and 
      he said, 'I don't       have a computer.'" The former deputy chief of the 
      Child Exploitation Unit at the Department of Justice, Robert Flores, also 
      says the government isn't doing its part. 

      Flores has had years of experience tracking down child pornographers and 
      pedophiles, both online and off. But he didn't think he could get his job 
      done as a government employee. 

      "I got to the point where I thought I could do more for families and kids 
      outside of the Justice Department," he said. 

      Flores is now the senior counsel for the Fairfax, Virginia-based National 
      Law Center for Children and Families, a legal resource center for child 
      pornography. "One of the things the Justice Department has failed to do is 
      say that the law       applies on the Internet, that the Internet is not a 
      lawless place," he said. 

      The laws forbidding child pornography are fairly new. 

      The Supreme Court first ruled in New York v. Ferber in 1982 that child 
      pornography was not protected by the First Amendment. The decision said 
      the government could ban sexual images with serious literary or artistic 
      value in the       interest of preventing "the harmful employment of 
      children to make sexually explicit materials for distribution." 

      Two years later, the justices said the government could outlaw not just 
      the distribution but also the possession of child porn. 

      And it is only in the last few years that the Internet has played a role 
      in laws and statutes governing pornography in general, and child 
      pornography in particular. There is currently a schism within the legal 
      community over the       definition of child pornography, and whether it 
      should include computer-generated photographs or computer-enhanced 
      photographs that appear to feature children engaged in sex acts, but 
      actually contain adults. 

      But while the courts hammer out the issues, some say citizens shouldn't 
      take matters into their own hands. 

      Flores likened the Internet community's attempt to patrol child 
      pornography to picketers in front of a porn store. It's well-intentioned, 
      but it won't change anything. 

      "My recommendation is that this is not the job for a layman, quite 
      simply," he said. "That's why we pay taxes."

26.0  SCRAMDISK (Windows) on the fly encryption for your data.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
           
      This isn't new, but it is a VERY good package, several of my colleagues and
      myself use it for sensitive material on our winboxes. The bonus is, its
      free software and will offer sufficient protection of data for most users.
      This is especially useful for using personal data on your drives at work
      and hiding it from the boss, its like having your own (secret) hard disk
      in your work's machine. The other uses are obvious. A note about PGP,
      the latest versions have a BACKDOOR that allows federal agencies access
      to your data. Use an earlier version of PGP (4.2) if you want to make
      things harder for federal agents to access your data(!) - Ed
      
      
      The walls have ears, the net has taps, the government (not just your own)
      IS listening and scanning your data, so protect your privacy and use
      PGP for sensitive emails or data transmissions, also use SSH instead of
      telnet for accessing your shell accounts if possible as many sites are
      sniffed by hackers daily. - Ed

                                                                        5/1/2000
                                                                        
      ScramDisk - Disk Encryption Tool      
      
      Details
      
      Scramdisk is a program that allows the creation and use of virtual 
      encrypted drives. Basically, you create a container file on an existing 
      hard drive that is locked with a specific password. This container can 
      then be mounted by the Scramdisk software, which creates a new drive 
      letter to represent the drive. The virtual drive can then only be accessed 
      with the correct pass phrase. Without the correct pass phrase the files on 
      the virtual drive are totally inaccessible - even physically extracting 
      the data will reveal nothing (since the contents are encrypted).

      Once the pass phrase has been entered correctly and the drive is mounted, 
      the new virtual drive can be used as a normal drive; files can be saved 
      and retrieved and you can safely install applications onto the encrypted 
      drive.

      Scramdisk allows virtual disks to be stored in a number of ways:

      1. In a container file on a FAT formatted hard disk. 2. On an empty 
      partition. 3. Stored in the low bits of a WAV audio file (this is called 
      steganography). This last option is especially interesting, since this WAV 
      file can be sent by e-mail or carried on a diskette without attracting too 
      much attention (since by casual hearing the WAV file sounds like the 
      original sound file).

      Details: Scramdisk can create virtual disks with a choice of a number of 
      'industry standard' encryption algorithms: Triple-DES, IDEA, MISTY1, 
      Blowfish, TEA (either 16 & 32 rounds), and Square. It also includes a 
      proprietary and very fast algorithm 'Summer' which is provided for minimal 
      security applications and for compatibility with older versions of 
      ScramDisk.

      Why not use PGP? PGP is a great program, but it doesn't allow the 
      on-the-fly encryption of a disk's contents. Instead users have to:

      1. Decrypt the existing file 2. Work on the data 3. Re-encrypt the data 
      The problem is, while the file is decrypted it is vulnerable to 
      interception. 

      Scramdisk is complementary to PGP; PGP is excellent for communication 
      security, but is somewhat lacking user friendliness when used for data 
      storage security.

      Flaws in the system Scramdisk is not totally secure (and nor is any 
      security program!). There are a number of ways an attacker may try 
      infiltrating your system:

      1. Look for applications that leak data. A very well known word-processor 
      has an interesting bug that leaks parts of the raw contents of the disk 
      when saving an OLE Compound Document.

      2. Look for data that isn't deleted securely. Ok, everyone knows that you 
      can undelete a file easily. Did you know that even a file that has been 
      'wiped' could potentially be recovered by looking at the surface of the 
      disk? Deleted files should be securely wiped using an appropriate program 
      (PGP v6+ contains a secure file wiping program). 

      3. Look for data that has leaked in other ways. Temporary files and the 
      swap file spring to mind. These both need to be securely erased too. 

      4. Using Van Eck monitoring. Basically, electrical emissions from the 
      monitor, hard drive and even keyboard can be detected and recorded from a 
      distance away. This may allow an eavesdropper to see what's on your screen 
      or detect your pass phrase as you type it.

      5. Brute Forcing. This can happen in a number of ways: they can try 
      brute-forcing your pass phrase (its important to use a large pass phrase 
      that isn't easily guessed, it helps to use both upper and lower case and 
      numbers as well) or they can try to brute force the algorithm. This is 
      hard work (and will take around 2^127 operations with most of the ciphers 
      included with ScramDisk - DES & Summer are exceptions). 

      6. Some of the ciphers included may be susceptible to attacks not known 
      about in public. The NSA/GCHQ may have a mechanism faster than brute-force 
      of attacking the algorithms. Scramdisk does not include any weak 
      algorithms in the original distribution (apart from Summer, which is 
      included for backwards compatibility), but who can tell what the 
      Intelligence Agencies can do with Blowfish, IDEA, 3DES et al? 

      7. Install an amended version of ScramDisk on your computer that secretly 
      stores your pass phrase so that it can be later read by a CIA agent. (Or 
      use a program like SKIn98 to do it!) Far fetched? Possibly, but you should 
      be aware that this kind of attack exists. There is no real way to defend 
      this attack. Check the PGP Signatures of the ScramDisk files against the 
      executables on your computer, but could your copy of PGP have also been 
      amended? 

      8. Beating you until you spill your pass phrase. Truth drugs also work, 
      apparently.

      Movie Studios File DVD Hack Suit 
      Reuters 
      
      5:20 p.m. 14.Jan.2000 PST 
      The seven largest US movie studios filed their own lawsuits Friday to prevent
      several Internet sites from distributing a program that could allow copying 
      of DVD movies. 
      
      The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in New York and Connecticut, followed
      a broader lawsuit filed last month in state court in California by a DVD 
      equipment manufacturers group. 
      
      
      At issue is a program called DeCSS, written by a Norwegian programmer, that
      allows users to bypass the encryption scheme used on DVDs to prevent unauthorized
      copying. 
      
      But many Internet users and programmers say the software had a simpler, less
      insidious goal. They said the program was needed to allow people to watch DVD
      movies on computers running the Linux operating system. 
      
      The studios argued that by allowing potential illegal copying, the program 
      violated US copyright law. They asked the courts to prohibit four people from
      distributing the program on their Web sites. 
      
      A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America, the studios' 
      lobbying group, said the Web sites involved were dvd-copy.com, krackdown.com
      and ct2600.com. Dozens of other Web sites have also carried either the program
      or source code instructions showing how to write the program. 
      
      "This is a case of theft," said Jack Valenti, president of the association. 
      "The posting of the de-encryption formula is no different from making and then
       distributing unauthorized keys to a department store." 
      
      The people who posted the code said they had done nothing wrong, insisting that
      the program was meant to allow viewing of DVD movies under Linux. 
      
      "I don't have illegal copies of movies on my site," said Shawn Reimerdes, a
       computer programmer who maintains the dvd-copy.com Web site. "Just posting
       these files shouldn't be illegal." 
      
      Internet advocacy groups have also opposed the lawsuits, arguing that the posting
      of computer codes on a Web site is a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. 
      
      "This is definitely an infringement on freedom of speech," said Shari Steele,
      director of legal services at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco
      -based cyber-rights advocacy group. "What has been done was totally legal.
      Posting of the program is legal and there are no pirated movies here." 
      
      Chris DiBona, who promotes Linux use for VA Linux Systems, said the industry had
      refused to help create a program to play DVDs under Linux. 
      
      "The whole reason this happened is because the movie industry itself didn't support
       Linux," DiBona said. "They thought they could keep this a secret. They failed." 
      
      The lawsuit relied on the 1998 Millennium Digital Copyright Act, which outlawed
      the distribution of products designed to crack copyright protection schemes. 
      
      "If you can't protect that which you own, then you don't own anything," MPAA's 
      Valenti said. 
      
      In the California case, the court last month turned down the industry's request
      for a temporary restraining order against a much wider array of defendants, many
      of whom had only provided a link on their Web page to a page

     SECURITY ALERT - WAR FTP DAEMON ALL VERSIONS

     Updated February 4th 2000 13:30 Central European Time.

     January 5th 2000, a seriuos security problem with War FTP Daemon 1.70 was 
     reported by email. Two hours after I read the mail, a security alert was sent
     to the war-ftpd mailing list, the alt.comp.jgaa newsgroup and the bugtraq 
     mailing list. The alert adviced all server operators to take the server 
     off-line until further notice.

     Brief overview

     War FTP Daemon 1.70: The bug allows unrestricted access to any file on the 
     local machine also for users that have not logged on. If an older ODBC driver
     is installed, the bug also gives users unlimited access to all system commands,
     with administrator privileges (this is a bug in ODBC that has been fixed in 
     recent versions). The advice is to take all version 1.70 servers off-line until
     the server is upgraded! A bugfix (War FTP Daemon 1.71) was released January 8th
     2000 14:40 CET. This version is not completely tested yet. Please report any 
     serious problems to jgaa@jgaa.com. I Will fix bugs in 1.70 over the next few 
     weeks to make 1.70 a little more comfortable to use while we wait for version 3. 
     War FTP Daemon 1.67b2 and previous versions: The bug may give privileged uses 
     unrestricted access to some files. Users must be logged in, and have at least 
     write or create permissions. Users can not execute commands. A bugfix was released
     less than 24 hours from I read the mail that reported the problem. 

     Buffer overflow problem in 1.6*

     February 2nd 2000 there was reported a buffer-overflow problem in 1.6 versions on
     BUGTRAQ. The problem does not seem to compromise the security, but the server can
     easily be crashed by remote attackers, after they have logged in. A fix
     was released February 3rd 2000, about an hour after I read about the problem.

     Bugfixes are released at ftp://ftp.no.jgaa.com  and http://war.jgaa.com/alert/files 

     I'm sorry for any inconveniences caused by these problems.

     General news

     War FTP Daemon 1.67. I will make a new full distribution for 1.67. Until this is
     ready, 1.65 must be installed, and then upgraded. 
     
     War FTP Daemon 1.72 service release.  I will make a service release of the 1.70
     series in the near future. Some annoying bugs will be fixed, and a command-line
     utility to add user accounts interactively, or from scripts, will be released. 
     There will also be a simple DLL wrapper interface for easy integration with other
     software.  
     
     War FTP Daemon 3.0. The development of the next major release continues. 3.0 is 
     currently running under Windows NT and Linux. The server is however not yet ready
     for alpha-testing. When all the basic functionality is implemented, and debugged,
     ftp://ftp.jgaa.com will open up, using version 3.0. This can be expected soon. 
     Early versions for Windows 9x, Windows NT, Debian Linux and FreeBSD will be 
     available for download. Version 3.0 will be Open Source, under the GNU Public License.  
     http://download.jgaa.com will open when War FTP Daemon 3.0 moves into early alpha.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      contributed by mack 
      MSNBC found seven ecommerce sites open for business
      with easily accessible customer databases. By
      connecting to weakly secured SQL databases MSNBC
      was able to access the personal information including
      credit card numbers of 2500 people. All of the sites
      have been informed of the problem. (And people act
      surprised when I tell them that I don't buy anything on
      the web.)

      Stealing cards easy as Web browsing

                          By Bob Sullivan                         
                                    MSNBC

       Jan. 14 —  Just how easy is it to steal credit card
       numbers on the Internet? On Thursday, MSNBC
       was able to view nearly 2,500 credit card
       numbers stored by seven small e-commerce Web
       sites within a few minutes, using elementary
       instructions provided by a source. In all cases, a
       list of customers and all their personal
       information was connected to the Internet and
       either was not password-protected or the
       password was viewable directly from the Web
       site.

       CREDIT CARD THEFT, a problem long lurking in the
       background of Internet commerce, leaped to the top of
       consumers’ minds earlier this month when a computer
       intruder calling himself Maxus was able to break into CD
       Universe’s database of user credit cards. There’s still
       speculation about how he did it.
              But perhaps Maxus didn’t have to work so hard. This
       week, MSNBC was able to view nearly 2,500 credit card
       numbers and other data essentially by browsing
       e-commerce Web sites using a commercially available
       database tool rather than a Web browser. Not only were
       the sites storing the credit cards in plain text in a database
       connected to the Web — the databases were using the
       default user name and in some cases, no password.
              These basic security flaws were found by a legitimate
       Russian software company named Strategy LLC, according
       to CEO Anatoliy Prokhorov, and shared with MSNBC. He
       says he tried contacting some of the companies first and got
       no response. 

               “From our point of view this is just unprofessionalism in
        a very high degree that’s not explainable,” Prokhorov said.
        His company writes software that helps consumers compare
        prices across multiple e-commerce sites, so his developers
        become familiar with data structures at hundreds of
        e-commerce sites. He says they weren’t looking to find
        security flaws, but rather stumbled on these.
               “This is just a hole we passed by, an open door. Our
        people were amazed.”
               But security experts were not. Given the speed
        required to succeed in the fast-paced Internet economy,
        companies are in a big hurry to publish working Web sites
        and often skimp on security measures.
               “This is a microcosm of what’s out there,” said Elias
        Levy of SecurityFocus.com. Levy’s site was the first to
        report the CD Universe break-in last weekend. “One could
        only imagine what they would have found if they were
        looking for problems.... The problem is fairly widespread,
        and what Anatoliy has found is a small snapshot.”
               Prokhorov also contacted SecurityFocus.com with his
        information, and the site today will issue its own report
        based on its independent investigation.

               The security flaws Prokhorov found involve more than
        just easy-to-steal credit cards. At all seven sites, MSNBC
        was able to view a wide selection of personal data including
        billing addresses, phone numbers and in some cases,
        employee Social Security numbers. 
               Prokhorov sent the list and instructions to MSNBC on
        Tuesday. It included about 20 Web sites which either had
        no password protection at all on their database servers —
        in each case, they were running Microsoft’s SQL Server
        software — or had password information exposed on their
        Web site. Connecting to all the sites was as simple as
        starting SQL Server and opening a connection to the Web
        site. (Note: Microsoft is a partner in MSNBC.) 

        Expressmicro.com, Computerparts.com, Directmicro.com
        and Sharelogic.net — were all contacted 24 hours before
        this story so they could close the security hole.
               While the flaws are obvious, assessing blame is a much
        more sticky business. There’s a mounting concern that small
        businesses are particularly vulnerable to attack; many don’t
        have computer experts on staff. Other times, non-technically
        savvy business owners take lowball bids from developers
        who promise a secure Web site but don’t deliver. Then
        there are inherent problems in software itself that make
        flaws more likely.

               In some cases, the server-side code underlying a Web
        page is viewable if a browser places “::$DATA” at the end
        of the page’s Web address. That code, normally hidden,
        can contain any usernames, passwords and other
        information about any computer connected to that server.
        This flaw was revealed over two years ago and has since
        been patched. Four of the vulnerable sites MSNBC found
        were hosted on the same Web server and had not plugged
        this hole.

               But even without knowing that technique, an intruder
        could have entered the sites anyway — the username
        required for entering the database was the default “sa,”
        which stands for “system administrator”; the password was
        the name of the company. 

               “We used a developer, and obviously the developer
        didn’t take that flaw into consideration,” said a
        spokesperson for the sites. “The flaw could have lied within
        the software, but maybe the developer should have taken
        that into consideration ... and one thing we didn’t do, we
        didn’t hire a security company to come in and test our Web
        site.”
               Getting a second opinion when building an e-commerce
        site is a good idea, said security expert Russ Cooper, who
        maintains the popular NTBugTraq mailing list. 
               “Make a condition of the contract that it has to pass
        scrutiny of another individual who tests the site,” Cooper
        recommended. The fundamental problem, he said, is that
        developers have no liability for flaws they leave behind in
        e-commerce sites. Merchants are responsible for the cost of
        any stolen merchandise, while most developer contracts
        make clear they are not responsible for what happens with a
        site they build. “So a lot of people end up with a working
        site but not a secure site.”
                
               The other three vulnerable sites MSNBC visited simply
        used “sa” as the username for their database, and no
        password. 
               Average consumers have no way of knowing how
        well-guarded their personal information is when they submit
        it to a Web site. Levy said the problems MSNBC found at
        these seven sites are hardly isolated.
               “The blame falls on more than one person. You can’t
        rush out to set up an e-commerce site regardless of how
        much you want to make money. ... Many people don’t give
        (security) a second thought,” he said.
               
               One of the fundamental flaws in all these sites — and,
        experts say, in many other sites — is the storing of private
        consumer information in the first place. While encryption
        techniques that scramble the data are available, it’s often
        kept on a computer in plain text — one step away from the
        Internet. While that’s more convenient, experts agree it’s a
        bad idea.
               “My advice is, if nothing else, don’t store the data
        where it physically has access to the Web,” said Wesley
        Wilhelm, a fraud prevention consultant at the Internet Fraud
        Prevention Advisory Council. “Take them off every night
        and make a sneakernet run.”
               As for consumers, there isn’t much they can do to
        ascertain how well a Web site is guarding their personal
        information. Some experts suggest using only one card
        online, and religiously checking credit card bills. While
        consumers are liable for at most $50 of fraudulent
        purchases, they are responsible for catching them and
        alerting their bank.

        It is alleged the a team of sophisticated professional
        electronic intruders have broken into twelve
        multinational companies and have issued ransom
        demands to prevent the release of stolen information.
        This report only names one of the company's in
        question, Visa, and says that Scotland Yard is
        investigating. (While it would appear that Visa has
        admitted to the intrusion we would like know who the
        other companies are.)

       Hacker gang blackmails
       firms with stolen files 

       Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Stan Arnaud 
     
     
      A BRITISH group of hackers has broken into the computer
      systems of at least 12 multinational companies and stolen
      confidential files. It has issued ransom demands of up to
      £10m and is also suspected of hiring out its services. 
     
      Scotland Yard is now investigating the attacks, which
      computer experts have described as the most serious
      systematic breach ever of companies' security in Britain. 
     
      "The group is using very sophisticated techniques and has
      been exchanging information via e-mail and internet chat,"
      said an investigator. 
     
      Visa confirmed last week that it had received a ransom
      demand last month, believed to have been for £10m. 
     
      "We were hacked into in mid-July last year," said Russ
      Yarrow, a company spokesman. "They gained access to
      some corporate material and we informed both Scotland
      Yard and the FBI." 
     
      It is understood the hackers stole computer "source codes"
      that are critical to programming, and threatened to crash the
      entire system. If Visa's system crashed for just one day, the
      company - which handles nearly £1 trillion business a year
      from customers holding 800m Visa cards - could lose tens of
      millions of pounds. 
     
      "We received a phone call and an e-mail to an office in
      England demanding money," Yarrow said. 
     
      The company contacted police after the ransom demand.
      "We hardened the system, we sealed it and they did not
      return. We have firewalls upon firewalls, but are concerned
      that anyone got in." 
     
      Scotland Yard's computer crime unit is now scrutinising
      e-mail traffic between several known hackers in England and
      Scotland. Last month officers from the unit flew to
      Hopeman, a Scottish fishing village, and seized equipment
      from the home of James Grant, who works for a local
      computer company. He has been interviewed by detectives
      and Visa security experts. 
     
      It is understood that he has given a legal undertaking to Visa
      not to discuss the matter. "He is saying nothing at all," said
      his mother, Rhona. "That is a situation that will not change in
      the future." 
     
      Grant, 20, studied computing in nearby Elgin, and now
      works for Data Converters, based in Elgin. His father is a
      member of the civilian security staff at RAF Lossiemouth air
      base and his mother a care worker. 
     
      Detectives are studying attacks on at least 12 companies that
      they believe have been penetrated by the group and others
      that may be connected, including one within the Virgin group,
      in which a hacker tried to break into the UK mailing system.
      They believe the group may also be acting as paid specialists
      for information brokers who trade corporate secrets. 
     
      "These are professionals and there is some evidence that
      suggests some of the activity was contracted and paid for,"
      said a computer expert involved in the investigation. 
     
      The group's success has exposed flaws in security. The
      internet company CD Universe last week confirmed it had
      called in the FBI after being blackmailed by a hacker who
      had copied more than 300,000 of its customer credit card
      files. 
     
      Scotland Yard said: "There is an ongoing investigation into
      the incident involving Visa, but it is too early to speculate
      about the involvement of a group."

      Scam forces Telstra to fix 29,000 pay phones
      9:17 Friday 14 January 2000 
      AAP
      TELSTRA is urgently modifying 80 per cent of its public pay phones after
      a scam was discovered involving a drinking straw and free phone calls 
      around the world. 

      Telstra would have the 29,000 vulnerable phones rectified soon, Telstra's
      public affairs manager Michael Herskope said yesterday.

      The Spanish-manufactured coin and phone card-operated Smart pay phone 
      was phased into the Australian network from 1997. 

      The scam potentially cost Telstra millions of dollars in unlimited STD 
      and ISD calls since then, but Telstra can only speculate. 

      "We have a rough idea, but that's not something we're really going to 
      publicise,'' Herskope said.

      The scam was made public on the front page of Albury-Wodonga's The Border
      Morning Mail yesterday.

      The newspaper was told by perpetrators that the low-tech scam had been 
      well known since the phones were introduced as part of a $100 million 
      upgrade of the public phone national network. 

      One source said some people may have learnt about it from the Internet. 

      The paper accompanied a man to three public phones chosen at random and
      observed him make free calls, including one to New York. 

      Telstra had initially dismissed the scam as a myth, the paper said. 

      But Herskope denied that Teltra only learnt of the fraud from the country
      newspaper. 

      "We've known about it for a little while,'' he said. 

      "It's pretty hard to articulate weeks, days. I'm not sure how it was brought
      to our attention but it certainly was.'' 

      He said rectifying the problem was a simple procedure. 

      Without disclosing how the fraud was perpetrated, he said there was no design
      fault in the phone. 

      "This particular fault will be closed off very shortly,'' he said.

32.0  Owning sites that run WebSpeed web db software

      From: George <georger@NLS.NET>

      Sent: Friday, February 04, 2000 7:32 PM
      Subject: Webspeed security issue leaves sites vulnerable


       I reported this to Progress (maker of Webspeed) a month ago and they said
       they would fix it but since then I've not seen any fixes released. I also
       pondered whether or not to release this information because some rather
       large web databases use Webspeed but I do believe in full disclosure as the
       best security so here goes...
       
       Webspeed is a website creation language used by some of the larger db based
       websites on the net. Version 3 comes with a java GUI configuration program.
       This configuration program has certain security setting options in it. One
       of which doesn't actually do anything.
       
       There is one option to turn off access to a utility called WSMadmin. It's in
       the messenger section of the GUI config program. However checking or
       unchecking this option doesn't change anything. In fact to turn this feature
       off you have to hand edit the ubroker.properties file. Look for the
       following entries:
       
       AllowMsngrCmds=1
       
       and each time you find this set it =0 in each of the sections. This will
       disable the feature (you want to do this on the production server).
       
       AllowMsngrCmds=0
       
       Ok, now the exploit to show how serious an issue this is on the web. It's
       just a misconfiguration really but it's caused by a bug in the java config
       program (I tested the NT version but since the config program is java it may
       also affect other platforms)
       
       Exploit:
       
       go to search engines and search for "wsisa.dll", I used google 3rd page or
       further (first 3 pages are all junk)
       
       Go to URL similar to
       http://www.domain.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/extra/somepage.htm with your browser
       
       change the url in the browser to
       http://www.domain.com/scripts/wsisa.dll/WService=anything?WSMadmin
       
       (note capitals are important)
       
       click on the link "End Sessions Logging and Display Sessions Info" (note you
       may have to start logging first then stop it if they've never used the
       logging feature)
       
       When you pick the End Sessions Logging choice it displays the log, find a
       statement in the log for the default service "Default Service =
       nameofservice"
       
       back up one page (hit your back button)
       
       type nameofservice into the Verify WebSpeed Configuration box and click the
       verify button.
       
       If everything worked you now own their site. I won't explain how to use the
       utility but anyone familiar with this should know exactly how dangerous this
       is.

33.0  Cerberus Information Security Advisory (CISADV000202)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      

      Cerberus Information Security Advisory (CISADV000202)
      http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/advisories.html
      
      Released              : 2nd February 2000
      Name                  : IDQ
      Affected Systems : Microsoft Windows NT 4 running Internet Information
                                   Server 3 or 4
      Issue                    : Attackers can access files outside of the web
      virtual
                                   directory system
      Author                  : David Litchfield (mnemonix@globalnet.co.uk)
      
      Description
      *********
      Any web site running Internet Information Server 3 or 4 and
      using Internet Data Query files to provide search functionality on the site
      may be exposed. IIS also comes with some sample IDQ scripts that are
      vulnerable so any website with these sample files left on are at risk.
      Using these IDQ scripts or even custom scripts it is possible to break
      outside of the web virtual root and gain unathorized access to files,
      such as log files and in certain cases the backup version
      of the Security Accounts Manager (sam._)
      
      It does require for the attacker to know the path to the file, for the file
      to be on the same logical disk drive as the IDQ file and for ACL to allow
      read access to the anonymous Internet account or the Everyone/guests group.
      
      
      
      Details
      *****
      The extent of this security hole depends upon whether the recent "webhits"
      patch
      has been installed. See
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-006.asp
      If the patch has been installed there is still a vulnerability - however,
      those that
      have not installed this patch are most at risk. Microsoft are re-releasing
      this advisory
      and the updated patch. Please note that Windows 2000 does not seem to be
      vulnerable to
      this. Cerberus' vulnerability scanner, CIS, has now been updated to check
      for this issue.
      For those that already have a copy of the scanner you can download the
      updated module
      from http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/webscan.dll - however those that do
      not yet have
      the scanner, if you would like a copy please go to
      http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/ and follow
      the Cerberus Internet Scanner link on the frontpage.
      
      If the "webhits" patch HAS NOT been installed
      ************************************
      Any idq file that resolves remote user input for any part of the template
      file is dangerous.
      eg: CiTemplate = %TemplateName%
      
      The ISAPI application that deals with IDQ queries is idq.dll and it will
      follow double dots in paths to template files, meaning an attacker can
      break out of the web root. If the idq file appends .htx to the CiTemplate
      eg: CiTemplate=/iissamples/issamples/%TemplateName%.htx
      
      some may think this will limit attackers to viewing only .htx files. Not so.
      Quoting from the Index Server documentation (/iishelp/ix/htm/ixidqhlp.htm),
      "Index Server does not support physical paths longer than the Windows NT
      shell limit (260 characters)."  Due to this limit it is possible to append
      lots of spaces onto the name of the file we want to read and thereby
      pushing the .htx out of the buffer and we're served back the file.
      
      IDQ files known to be at risk in one way or another:
      
      prxdocs/misc/prxrch.idq
      iissamples/issamples/query.idq
      iissamples/exair/Search/search.idq
      iissamples/exair/Search/query.idq
      iissamples/issamples/fastq.idq
      
      There are may be more.
      
      If the "webhits" patch HAS been installed
      *******************************
      Machines that have had the patch installed will only be vulnerable if the
      IDQ file does not specify a .htx extention
      eg:
      CiTemplate = %TemplateName%
      and
      CiTemplate = /somedir/otherdir/%TemplateName%
      are vulnerable whereas
      CiTemplate = /somedir/otherdir/%TemplateName%.htx
      is not vulnerable.
      
      Solution:
      *******
      Review your IDQ files to determine if you are at risk. If so edit them
      and use hardcoded template files. eg
      
      CiTemplate=%TemplateName%
      to
      CiTemplate=/your-virtual-directory/your-htx-file.htx
      
      and then edit your search form to reflect this change.
      Remove any sample files from the system - not just
      idq files. Apply the updated patch.

      II.  BUGTRAQ SUMMARY 2000-01-24 to 2000-01-30
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      
      1. Multiple Vendor BSD /proc File Sytem Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 940
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-01-21
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/940
      Summary:
      
      Certain BSD derivative operating systems use an implantation of the /proc
      filesystem which is vulnerable to attack from malicious local users. This
      attack will gain the user root access to the host.
      
      The proc file system was originally designed to allow easy access to
      information about processes (hence the name). It's typical benefit is
      quicker access to memory hence more streamlined operations. As noted
      previously certain implementations have a serious vulnerability. In short,
      the vulnerability is that users may manipulate processes under system
      which use /proc to gain root privileges. The full details are covered at
      length in the advisory attached to the 'Credit' section of this
      vulnerability entry.
      
      2. DNS TLD & Out of Zone NS Domain Hijacking
      BugTraq ID: 941
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-01-23
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/941
      Summary:
      
      A vulnerability exists in the mechanism used by DNS, in general, to
      determine the name server associated with TLD's (top level domains). DNS
      is built upon levels of trust, and by exploiting single points of failure
      in this trust system, it becomes possible for an attacker to convince a
      caching nameserver that allows for recursion through it that the root
      server for a given TLD is something other than what it actually is. By
      consecutively performing these cache attacks, it could be possible for an
      attacker to entirely take over name service for any given domain.
      
      The vulnerability is actually not specific to TLD's. The same attack can
      be used to hijack any domain which has out of zone NS records, if any of
      the servers that act as the name server for the out of zone domain can be
      compromised.
      
      The simplest explanation was presented in the example provided by it's
      discoverer, Dan Bernstein, on the Bugtraq mailing list, on January 23,
      2000: "Suppose an attacker can make recursive queries through your cache.
      Let me emphasize that this does not mean that the attacker is one of your
      beloved users; many programs act as DNS query-tunneling tools.
      
      Suppose the attacker is also able, somehow, to take over ns2.netsol.com.
      This isn't one of the .com servers, but it's a name server for the
      gtld-servers.net domain. Here's what happens:
      
         (1) The attacker asks your cache about z.com. Your cache contacts
             (say) k.root-servers.net, which provides a referral:
      
                com NS j.gtld-servers.net   (among others)
                j.gtld-servers.net A 198.41.0.21
      
             These records are cached.
      
         (2) The attacker asks your cache about z.gtld-servers.net. Your cache
             contacts (say) f.root-servers.net, which provides a referral:
      
                gtld-servers.net NS ns2.netsol.com   (among others)
                ns2.netsol.com A 207.159.77.19
      
             These records are cached.
      
         (3) The attacker takes over ns2.netsol.com.
      
         (4) The attacker asks your cache about zz.gtld-servers.net. Your
             cache contacts ns2.netsol.com, and the attacker answers:
                zz.gtld-servers.net CNAME j.gtld-servers.net
                j.gtld-servers.net A 1.2.3.4
      
             These records are cached, wiping out the obsolete j glue.
      
         (5) A legitimate user asks your cache about yahoo.com. Your cache
             contacts j.gtld-servers.net, and the attacker answers:
      
                yahoo.com A 1.2.3.4
      
             The user contacts yahoo.com at that address."
      
      The attack offered requires that an attacker be able to compromise the
      operation of the DNS server running on, in this case, ns2.netsol.com,
      although this is not the only server that could potentially be used to
      launch an attack of this style.  The author further indicates that there
      are in excess of 200 servers that could be used to manipulate resolution
      of all the .COM domains.
      
      3. Inter7 vpopmail (vchkpw) Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 942
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-01-21
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/942
      Summary:
      
      Vpopmail (vchkpw) is free GPL software package built to help manage
      virtual domains and non /etc/passwd email accounts on Qmail mail servers.
      This package is developed by Inter7 (Referenced in the 'Credit' section)
      and is not shipped, maintained or supported by the main Qmail
      distribution.
      
      Certain versions of this software are vulnerable to a remote buffer
      overflow attack in the password authentication of vpopmail.
      
      
      4. VMware Symlink Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 943
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-01-21
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/943
      Summary:
      
      VMware is software that runs multiple virtual computers on a single PC, at
      the same time, without partitioning or rebooting.
      
      Certain versions of the VMWare for Linux product do not perform /tmp file
      sanity checking and create files in the /tmp directory which will follow
      symlinks. This may be used by a malicious user to overwrite any file (with
      log data) which falls within the write permissions of the user ID which
      VMWare excecutes as. Typically this is root. This attack will most likely
      result in a denial of service and not a root level compromise.
      
      5. HP Path MTU Discovery DoS Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 944
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-01-24
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/944
      Summary:
      
      A potential denial of service exists in Hewlett-Packard's proprietary
      protocol for discovering the maximum path MTU (PMTU) for a give
      connection. This feature could potentially be used to cause denial of
      services, using HPUX machines as "amplifiers." Essentially, HP machines
      which are vulnerable can, under certain conditions, be coerced in to
      sending far more data outbound than they receive inbound. By forging
      source addresses, it is possible to send a small quantity of packets
      purporting to be from a given source, and cause the HPUX machine to send
      multiple packets in response. This could potentially be used as a denial
      of service.
      
      HP's proprietary path discover protocol works by sending data in parallel
      with ICMP packets being used for path discovery. While exact details of
      the nature of the denial of service were not made public, presumably it
      could be possible to utilize UDP packets, and default UDP services to

      6. Microsoft East Asian Word Conversion Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 946
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-01-20
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/946
      Summary:
      
      East Asian language versions of Word and Powerpoint are susceptible to a
      buffer overflow exploit. The overflowable buffer is in the code that
      converts Word 5 documents into newer formats. Word 97, 98, and 2000 will
      automatically convert older files into the new format upon loading.
      
      If a specially-modified Chinese, Japanese or Korean Word 5 document is
      loaded into a newer version of Word or PowerPoint, arbitrary code can be
      executed during the conversion process, at the privilege level of the
      current user.
      
      
      7. NT RDISK Registry Enumeration File Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 947
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-01-21
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/947
      Summary:
      
      The Rdisk utility shipped with all versions of Windows NT4.0 is used to
      make an Emergency Repair Disk. During the creation of this disk, a
      temporary file ($$hive$$.tmp) is created in the %systemroot%\repair
      directory that contains the registry hives while they are being backed up.
      The group Everyone has Read permission to this file, and in this manner
      sensitive information about the server could be leaked.
      
      The file is put in a location that is not shared by default, and is
      removed immediately after the disk is created. The only likely scenario
      where this could be exploited is in the case of NT Terminal Server, where
      an administrator and a regular user could both be logged in interactively
      at the same time.
      
      8. Qualcomm qpopper 'LIST' Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 948
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-01-26
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/948
      Summary:
      
      There is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in Qaulcomm's 'qpopper'
      daemon which allows users already in possession of a username and password
      for a POP account to compromise the server running the qpopper daemon.
      
      The problem lies in the code to handles the 'LIST' command available to
      logged in users. By providing an overly long user supplied argument a
      buffer may be overflowed resulting in the attacker gaining access with the
      user ID (UID) of the user who's account is being used for the attack and
      the group ID (GID) mail.
      
      This will result in remote access to the server itself and possibly
      (depending on how the machine is configured) access to read system users
      mail via the GID mail.
      
      9. NT Index Server Directory Traversal Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 950
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-01-26
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/950
      Summary:
      
      Index Server 2.0 is a utility included in the NT 4.0 Option Pack. The
      functionality provided by Index Service has been built into Windows 2000
      as Indexing Services.
      
      When combined with IIS, Index Server and Indexing Services include the
      ability to view web search results in their original context. It will
      generate an html page showing the query terms in a short excerpt of the
      surrounding text for each page returned, along with a link to that page.
      This is known as "Hit Highlighting". To do this, it supports the .htw
      filetype which is handled by the webhits.dll ISAPI application. This dll
      will allow the use of the '../' directory traversal string in the
      selection of a template file. This will allow for remote, unauthenticated
      viewing of any file on the system whose location is known by the attacker.

        Long Island authorities have arrested a 17-year-old high school student
     for hacking into his school district's computer.
                          
     Suffolk County authorities are charging Keith Billig with computer tampering
     and unauthorized use of a computer. Billig's is a student at Hauppauge High 
     School.
            
      On Wednesday, authorities say Billig gained access to the school district's 
     main frame computer. He allegedly was able to attain the password of every
     administrator, teacher and student in the district.
                          
      The computer's internal security system was able to detect Billig's intrusion
     in the early stages. Police say Billig's bragging about his exploits to
     teachers and other students is what led them to him. Authorities are not sure
     what Billig's motive for breaking into the computer system was.

      National Security Agency Selects Secure Computing to Provide Type 
      Enforcement(TM) on Linux OS

      Secure Computing First to Develop Strong Security Platform for Linux

      SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Secure Computing Corporation 
      (Nasdaq: SCUR - news), today announced that it has been awarded a sole 
      source contract by the National Security Agency (NSA) to develop a Secure 
      Linux Operating System       (OS). This contract calls for Secure 
      Computing to apply its patented Type Enforcement(TM) technology, to 
      develop a robust and secure Linux platform. This award furthers the goal 
      of Secure to pursue and acquire contracts that will provide enabling 
      technologies to both the Federal government infrastructure as well as 
      commercial electronic business applications.

      The NSA is the nation's high-technology cryptologic organization that 
      ensures important and sensitive activities in the US intelligence 
      community are protected from exploitation through interception, 
      unauthorized access, or related technical intelligence threats.

      Secure Computing's patented Type Enforcement technology provides network 
      security protection that is unique to the industry. This technology, first 
      developed under previous government contracts, is available today as part 
      of the UNIX OS for Secure       Computing's Sidewinder(TM) firewall. Type 
      Enforcement secures underlying operating systems and protects applications 
      and network services, by segmenting them into domains. Each domain is 
      granted permission to access only specific file types, including 
      executables. As such, each domain provides a self-contained, discrete 
      layer of protection that cannot be altered. Implementing Type Enforcement 
      within the operating system itself assures the highest level of security 
      available in commercial operating systems.

      ``The NSA has been a long standing customer and partner of Secure 
      Computing,'' said Chris Filo, vice president and general manager of the 
      Advanced Technology Division at Secure Computing. ``Working with the NSA 
      allows Secure to continue to advance       the state of the art in 
      security technologies that is required to enable safe, secure operating 
      environments within the Department of Defense (DoD), while at the same 
      time, providing the basis for our future commercial products.''

      Linux is a UNIX-type operating system that includes true multitasking, 
      virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, proper memory 
      management, TCP/IP networking, and other features consistent with 
      Unix-type systems. The Linux source code is freely       available to 
      everyone.

      About the National Security Agency

      The National Security Agency (NSA) is the nation's cryptologic 
      organization, tasked with making and breaking codes and ciphers. NSA is a 
      high-technology organization, working on the very frontiers of 
      communications and data processing. The expertise and       knowledge it 
      develops provide the government with systems that deny foreign powers 
      knowledge of US capabilities and intentions.

      The NSA is charged with two of the most important and sensitive activities 
      in the US intelligence community. The information systems security or 
      INFOSEC mission provides leadership, products, and services to protect 
      classified and unclassified national       security systems against 
      exploitation through interception, unauthorized access, or related 
      technical intelligence threats. The second activity is the foreign signals 
      intelligence or SIGINT mission, which allows for an effective, unified 
      organization and control of all the foreign signals collection and 
      processing activities of the United States.

      Cryptom May Be Violating the Law 


      contributed by White Vampire 
      Leading Internet civil liberties groups said today that
      new encryption export regulations released by the U.S.
      Commerce Department fall short of the Clinton
      Administration's promise to deregulate the
      privacy-enhancing technology. One example of this
      concerns the popular Internet site Cryptom where PGP
      is made freely available to anyone in the world who
      wants it. It is unclear with the new regulations whether
      this is a criminal act or not.

      Is This Man a Crypto Criminal? by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m. 15.Jan.2000 PST       Crypto maven John Young has a problem. 

      He may be a felon, guilty of a federal crime punishable by years in 
      prison. Or he may not be. He'd just like to know one way or another. 

      The 63-year-old architect and owner of the popular Cryptome site has 
      posted a copy of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption software for the 
      world to download. 

      
      Also: He Digs 'Through' Gov't Muck More Infostructure in Wired News Read 
      more Politics -- from Wired News

      
      PGP, an encryption program that lets users scramble files and email, has 
      become one of the most popular crypto applications online. But people 
      living outside the US have not been able to get it legally from a US Web 
      site. 

      Young's seemingly innocuous act might violate new US government 
      regulations that restrict placing privacy-protecting crypto programs on 
      the Web. Therein lies the uncertainty. The rules are much less onerous 
      than the previous       version, but they still apply. 

      And they're so labyrinthine and convoluted that even lawyers who 
      specialize in the area declined to guess whether or not Young has run 
      afoul of President Clinton's executive order and Commerce Department 
      regulations. 

      "The fact that questions still remain about what does and does not violate 
      the law demonstrates that these regulations continue to cloud the 
      situation," said David Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy 
      Information Center. 

      So Young decided to be intrepid -- and perhaps risk a confrontation with 
      the Feds. 

      "If it's not right, someone will tell me. If I go to a lawyer to ask, 
      they'll advise caution. Every time I go to a lawyer they advise me not to 
      do it, so I don't go any more," he said. 

      The Department of Commerce, which published the regulations and is in 
      charge of arresting crypto-miscreants, declined to comment. Eugene 
      Cottilli, a spokesman for the Commerce's bureau of export administration, 
      could not secure       an official response from government lawyers on 
      Friday. 

      
      Complicating matters is the different way that the regulations treat 
      ready-to-use binary software, and the human-readable source code that must 
      be compiled to be used. 

      On Friday, Young posted a copy of PGP Freeware Version 6.5.2a for Windows 
      and Macintosh, which contains binary code. The regulations appear to say 
      that Americans can only distribute it online if the government has 
      previously       "reviewed and classified" the software as acceptable for 
      distribution. 

      Under the old rules, Web sites could distribute binary code only if they 
      checked the Internet address of the recipient and attempted to verify that 
      it was a computer inside the US. 

      MIT, which makes PGP available, has a system that does just that. But 
      Young's site doesn't include the foreigner-verification check, and he said 
      overseas visitors have already been downloading the software. 

      The uncertainty -- and possibility of criminal prosecution -- doesn't faze 
      Young. "People are saying the regs are deliberately vague so you'll censor 
      yourself, so I tend to go the other way," he said. "I'm hoping this will 
      lead to       clarification." 

      Source code, on the other hand, is a bit freer. As long as it's not 
      subject to an onerous license and as long as you email the site's address 
      to the Commerce Department, Web posting appears to be permitted. 

      Some cryptographers have already done just that. 

      "I'm willing to give it a try," wrote cryptographer Wei Dai on an

      Man sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty to computer 
      hacking

      SUDBURY, Ont. (CP) - A man was sentenced to six months in jail and fined 
      $6,000 Monday after pleading guilty to computer hacking related charges, 
      including altering NASA's Web site.

      Jason Mewhiney, 22, went into the space agency's Web site March 5, 1997, 
      leaving a message that called for an end to the commercialization of the 
      Internet and freedom for two hackers in jail for computer crimes.

      Justice John Poupore compared Mewhiney's actions to that of a 
      "safecracker" trying to steal money from a bank.

      "Mr. Mewhiney, you ought not to leave this courtroom with a badge of 
      honour in the computer community," the judge said Monday.

      "You sir, are a convicted criminal. That is a distinction you will carry 
      with you for the rest of your life. It is nothing to be proud of."

      Mewhiney, of Val Caron, outside of Sudbury, pleaded guilty to 12 of the 51 
      charges he was facing, including committing mischief to data stored and 
      fraudulent use of a NASA computer system.

      He was able to access dozens of computer systems by using programs that 
      crack password codes. The space agency's home page was put briefly out of 
      service for repair, at an estimated cost of $70,000.

      NASA and FBI computer crime teams caught Mewhiney by tracing his 
      movements.

      Mewhiney told the court he was sorry.

      "I'd just like to say I'm sorry and I'm sorry for everyone's time I've 
      wasted," he said.

      RCMP searched his parent's home in the spring of 1998 and found a paper 
      with numerous computer system passwords on them.

      The judge agreed to a request by assistant Crown attorney Patricia Moore 
      that Mewhiney's computer and other papers seized by police be confiscated.

      One of his probation conditions was that he not possess a computer.

      Tuesday, 18 January, 2000, 17:52 GMT Hackers attack dinosaur auction 


       Dinosaur hunters with their quarry: Alan Detrich (left) and Fred Nuss



       By BBC News Online's Damian Carrington 

       An online auction for a complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton was attacked 
       by malicious hackers on Tuesday who filed 17 false bids. 

       At least six of these made it through security measures specifically put 
       in place to prevent such action. 

       "Some people found a way around that process and they have been removed," 
       confirmed Brian Payea, public relations manager for Lycos. 

       He told BBC News Online: "There are no valid bids so far." 

       Bank chat 

       The first attempt to auction the 11-metre fossil dinosaur on eBay was 
       scuppered by prank bids of up to $8m. However, this time, the new 
       auctioneers Lycos Auction had teamed up with the website millionaire.com 
       to try to verify the wealth of bidders before they made their offer. 

       Mr Payea described what should have happened: "You fill in a form, that 
       is sent to millionaire.com and they review it and have a conversation 
       with your bank. The approval is given and someone can bid." 

       However, hackers named "mrmanson20", "stevebert" and "dumbass507" found a 
       hole and posted bids of up to $15m, well over the reserve price of $5.8m. 

       No credit compromise

       Mr Payea declined to give details of what happened: "How the whole 
       process works is proprietary and I'm not going into detail about it. But 
       we are very confident it couldn't be done again." 

       He added that: "The hiccup does not compromise anybody's credit 
       information - that is all encrypted and very secure." 

       The auction opened on Monday but Mr Payea was not concerned that no 
       verified bids had yet been received: "It takes at least 24 hours for the 
       approval process to be completed. In any case, I think it will take 
       people a little while to commit to that kind of purchase - if it was me, 
       I'd be having a chat with an accountant or two before I bid." 

       Million dollar bones

       Even the reserve price may appear high but in 1997 a T. rex was bought 
       for $8.36m by the Field Museum in Chicago, US. The deal on this skeleton 
       does include delivery from its current home in a Kansas warehouse. 
       However, the bones are only partly exposed from the rock blocks in which 
       they were found. 

       The 65 million-year-old fossil was discovered on a South Dakota cattle 
       ranch in 1992. Owner Alan Detrich says he sees nothing wrong with 
       auctioning off a piece of the Earth's history. 

       After all, he said, he spent more than $250,000 of his own money 
       unearthing the dinosaur. And he will give 10% of the proceeds to the 
       owners of the cattle ranch where the rock-encased skeleton was found, he 
       says. 

       "This auction is open to the world. If we don't have the right to (sell 
       the fossil), then we don't live in America. If we didn't go there and get 
       him, he'd still be up there." 

       Mr Detrich added that he does not mind if his T. rex becomes a corporate 
       mascot or is sold to a private collector with no intention of displaying 
       it publicly. 




       Chuck Schaff, at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, 
       said the fossil would be ideal for drawing crowds to a museum, but was 
       probably too expensive for most. 

       "It's not unethical to sell it, it's just a shame it goes to the highest 
       bidder," Mr Schaff says. "Some specimens do get away from scientists, but 
       that's life. It's sad, though." 

       The auction, which began on Monday, is due to close at 0100 GMT on 11
       February 2000.

      'Cyberforce' to fight
      online crime 

      Monday January 17, 2000 

      A national "cyberforce" of computer
      specialists is to be established by the
      home office to police the internet and
      combat a rising tide of online crime. 

      It was confirmed last night that the home
      secretary, Jack Straw, has assigned
      £337,000 to the UK National Criminal
      Intelligence Service (NCIS) to draw up
      plans for establishing a squad to counter
      criminal activity on the web.

      The move, which will target those using
      computers for fraud, money laundering,
      distributing pornography and information
      about paedophilia, and hacking, follows a
      three-year NCIS study of internet crime
      which concluded that illegal activity on the
      web, from email viruses to cyber-stalking,
      is increasing as the wired population
      grows.

      Operation Trawler highlighted the
      inadequacies of anti-computer crime
      units, leading to calls for a dedicated
      organisation.

      The new unit is expected to include
      experts in the private sector, the Inland
      Revenue and police. It will also draw on
      resources available through links with MI5
      and GCHQ - the government agency that
      eavesdrops on Britain and the world's
      communications networks.

      Roger Gaspar, the director of intelligence
      at NCIS, and David Phillips, the chief
      constable of Kent and head of the crime
      committee at the Association of Chief
      Police Officers are drawing up plans for
      the unit, which will also make use of links

      DAILY BRIEFING

      Army outpost held off hackers
      in New Year's showdown

      By Joshua Dean
      jdean@govexec.com

      Shortly after dark on New Year's Day, the pager on the belt of
      Steve Carey, chief of information assurance at the Army's
      Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, went off. The message was
      alarming: a hacker was trying to crack into a critical server that
      keeps track of network identities and passwords at the arsenal. 

      When Carey got to the arsenal's network management center,
      he found the system protections had withstood the attack and all
      was well. But Carey and his staff couldn't rest. Attackers
      continued trying to breach the arsenal's computers and its Web
      sites as the new millennium dawned. 

      Some other government sites were spared attacks during the
      New Year's holiday, even though they had braced for the worst.
      But Redstone is a particularly attractive target for high-tech
      bandits.

      The arsenal has technical information on 14 of the Army's top 29
      weapons systems, including missiles, helicopters and
      conventional aircraft. It also handles about 63 percent of the
      Army's foreign military sales. This means transfers of money as
      well as weapons technology. "It's big bucks," said Col. Douglas
      S. Brouillette, who heads the arsenal's Intelligence and Security
      Directorate.

      As a result, security experts in Redstone's Local Computer
      Incident Response Team (LCIRT) are constantly vigilant and in
      many ways ahead of other agencies when it comes to handling
      network attacks. LCIRT uses a number of computer intrusion
      detection systems. But even places such as Redstone, where
      computer security is a high priority, can't get all the technology
      resources they need. So instead of relying entirely on technology,
      the arsenal depends on people to remain alert against attacks.

      "We have a high level of monitoring because we don't have all
      the firewalls we need installed yet. We hope the monitoring
      compensates for that," Brouillette said. "Monitoring allows us to
      detect, immediately react and fix attacks until we get all the
      firewalls and other security products installed."

      Redstone's basic defense is to find attacks quickly in order to
      stop them as they happen, he said. Contract analysts from
      Intergraph Federal Systems serve with Carey on his defense
      team.

      Redstone needs all the help it can get, because its networks are
      peppered with attacks daily. "We've had hundreds of incidents in
      the last three-month period," Brouillette said. "That's 3,000 to
      4,000 scans of the network."

      Hackers conduct scans to try to find out what hardware and
      software are present on a given network. Scans can discover
      computers or even modems with open links to the Internet.
      Unknown hackers who appeared to be from countries including
      Bulgaria, China, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia,
      Poland, Portugal, Romania and Russia have scanned Redstone
      over the past three months. But because hackers can make it
      look as if they were on a computer in a different country, pinning
      them down geographically is an imperfect science.

      Once the reconnoitering is complete, hackers try to exploit
      vulnerabilities and gain access to private networks and the
      information stored there. Without intrusion detection systems and
      expertise, network staff may never know they've been hacked.

      Beyond scanning and attempted break-in, hackers can cripple
      networks and servers by launching "denial-of-service" attacks.
      In such incidents, intruders launch a flood of messages to a
      single server, overwhelming it. Denial of service attacks have
      become so commonplace that they come with colorful names,
      such as Ping Flood, SMURF, SYN Flood, UDP Bomb and
      WinNuke.

      Over the past three months Redstone has been hit with 17 denial
      of service attacks. Twelve of them succeeded. 

      And then there are the vandals—Internet gang members armed
      with digital spray paint—that LCIRT must contend with.

      "Three of our Web sites have been breached in the past 12
      months," Carey said. In the successful attacks, the methods
      were new to the network defenders, which meant the attackers
      were able to change the Web sites. Once LCIRT members
      discovered how the hackers pulled off the attacks, they went
      through every base Web server to make sure vulnerabilities
      were fixed. 

      Because of past vigilance, the New Year's vandals failed to
      make a dent. LCIRT members say new attacks and techniques
      are constantly appearing, and the only way to stop them is to
      have a team monitoring the network and the logs of the intrusion
      detection systems.

      That's how the arsenal's defenders knew the New Year's
      hackers were aiming deliberately for one of Redstone's most
      sensitive servers. "If you get into that server you can go
      anywhere in the installation," Brouillette said, breathing a sigh of
      relief now that 2000 is well under way and his servers are intact

      contributed by kingpin 
      We don't usually cover individual security vulnerabilities
      here at HNN but this one is interesting. The Palm
      HotSync Manager is vulnerable to DoS attack which may
      also crash the system and possibly allow the execution
      of arbitrary code. Anyone who runs HotSync Manager
      over the network is a potential target of attack.

       Title    Palm HotSync Manager is vulnerable to Denial of Service attack

      Summary
      
      HotSync Manager provides network synchronization between the Palm Desktop
      and a remote Palm PDA that is connected via the Internet. This feature is
      used to backup the information from the Palm PDA to a secure location.
      However, using HotSync Manager over the network exposes it to an attack,
      where anyone with network connection to the station running HotSync Manager
      can crash the application and possibly execute arbitrary code.

      Details
      
      Vulnerable systems:
      HotSync Manager 3.0.4 under Windows 98

      Non vulnerable systems:
      HotSync Manager 3.0.4 under Windows 2000

      Exploit:
      By connecting to the HotSync Manager's TCP listening port (TCP port 14238),
      and sending a large amount of data followed by a newline, it is possible to
      crash the HotSync Manager.

46.0  HNN: Jan 24:  Viruses Cost the World $12.1 Billion 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      HWA Comment:
      
      I'll say this as a RUMOUR or MYTH in order to avoid possible libel charges
      but it was a well known fact that certain (very well known and established)
      Anti-Virus vendor(s) ran underground BBS's (dial up bulletin boards) in the
      80's and later special backdoored FTP sites in the 90's for the purpose of
      virus authors to upload new viruses to be deployed into the wild so that the
      AV companies could capitalize on these new 'threats'....so when I read about
      costs like this I really wonder how much was premeditated by the AV companies
      themselves in order to make a buck from susceptible companies and people that
      refused to practice safe computing....trust noone, except maybe AVP. You can
      debate this if you like but I know it is fact, I was there and had access to
      these sites. - (HWA Trusted source)

      According to a recent study conducted by Computer
      Economics, a California based computer consulting firm,
      the world spent $12.1 billion last year in a war against
      malicious self replicating code. The $12.1 Billion figure is
      based on lost productivity, network downtime and the
      expense involved in getting rid of the virus. (Hmmmm,
      that number seems ridiculously large.)

      Computer Viruses Cost $12 Billion in
      1999
      Report Tallies Business Impact of 'Economic Terrorism' 
  
      Jan. 20, 2000 
  
      By David Noack 
  
                           CARLSBAD, Calif. (APBnews.com) --
                           Businesses around the world spent $12.1
                           billion last year in a war against "economic
                           terrorism" in the form of malicious computer
                           viruses, according to a new study. 
  
                           Computer Economics, a computer consulting
                           firm here, has found that the economic impact
                           of virus attacks on information systems around
                           the world are taking a heavy financial toll on
                           business. 
  
      For the most part, computer security concerns have focused on hackers
      trying to gain entry into a company's computer system, rifling through files
      and possibly stealing sensitive and confidential information. 
  
      But viruses, especially those delivered in e-mail, are giving corporate
      information technology managers something new to worry about. 
  
      Lost productivity and downtime 
  
      Samir Bhavnani, the analyst with Computer
      Economics who conducted the study, said the
      $12.1 billion is based on lost productivity,
      network downtime and the expense involved in
      getting rid of the virus. 
  
      "This form of economic terrorism is growing as
      viruses are no longer the minor annoyances that they were a few years
      ago," Bhavnani said. "Now they can verge on the catastrophic and cause
      major predicaments for any organization." 
  
      He said for the first six months of last year, financial losses caused by
      computer viruses totaled $7.6 billion. 
  
      Bhavnani said that companies must devote time to teaching their
      employees "prudent workstation use." 
  
      Delivery began to change 
  
      "Simple things like refraining from downloading
      unnecessary and non-work-related items from
      the Internet, opening executable files sent via
      e-mail or frequenting pornographic Web sites
      will increase the security level and reduce the
      vulnerability of valuable corporate resources,"
      Bhavnani said. 
  
      A survey conducted last year by Information
      Security magazine asked information
      technology managers where they experienced
      the most security breaches. Seventy-seven
      percent said computer viruses were the No. 1
      problem, followed by unauthorized access by
      employees and hackers and the theft and destruction of computing
      resources. 
  
      Last year, a series of malicious viruses clogged e-mail networks, crashed
      computers and erased hard drives. 
  
      The way that viruses are delivered began to change. The "Bubbleboy" virus
      was activated when unsuspecting users opened an infected e-mail. In the
      past, computer viruses were spread through attachments, and e-mail was
      generally regarded as safe. 
  
      'High-profile damage' 
  
      With computer virus alerts coming sometimes on a daily basis, security
      experts say that businesses are still not taking virus prevention seriously. 
  
      "Despite all of the high-profile damage caused by viruses, organizations are
      still just beginning to implement adequate security plans," said Michael
      Erbschloe, vice president of research at Computer Economics.
      "Additionally, many firms are reluctant to report damages because they
      feel they may be identified as an easy target." 
  
      The study says that in the past three years there has been a major
      programming shift as viruses have become far more malicious and are
      designed specifically for destruction and damage. 
  
      The study said that computer viruses were initially designed to create a
      minor annoyance. Now they are very complex and come in a multitude of
      forms, and many are polymorphic, which means they change while in a
      computer to avoid detection from anti-virus software. 
  
      Melissa and Explorer encouraged copycats 
  
      "The Melissa and Explorer.zip viruses acted as a catalyst in 1999," said
      Erbschloe. "Organizations started to realize the severity and the malicious
      intent of most new computer viruses and began to take the cries for
      increased security spending more seriously." 
  
      Steven Ross, a director at Deloitte & Touche's Enterprise Risk Services
      Practices, said computer viruses are having a noticeable impact on
      companies. 
  
      "The first wave of viruses 10 years ago attacked at the operating system
      level. The ones we see today are attacking at the application level. The
      filters that come into play when you boot up aren't necessarily capturing
      the things that are happening at the application level," said Ross. 
  
      He said there may only be a handful of smart computer writers, and that
      there are hundreds and thousands so-called script kiddies who when
      taught to program a virus can do so without much effort. 
  
      Writers rely on 'general complacency' 
  
      "There is also a general complacency. ... They are absolutely counting on
      it," said Ross. 
  
      He cited an example of removing 7,500 viruses from a number of servers for
      a company. When he returned the next week, there were 1,500 more
      viruses. 
  
      Dan Schrader, vice president of new technology at Trend Micro, an
      anti-virus software company in Silicon Valley, said the $12.1 billion figure is
      "conceivable," and "I am not at all surprised by that number." 
  
      "If you want to label what the year [1999] was in technology, the first label
      would be the year of the IPO, and the second label would be the year of the
      computer virus. There were more serious computer virus outbreaks in any
      one month of last year than we've had virtually in the entire history of
      computing," said Schrader. 
  
      He said there was "tremendous innovation" among computer virus writers,
      and for the first time the virus writers got it that it's "all about the Internet." 
  
      "There is lost data, lost productivity while you wait for the tech guy to come
      around, and then there's the e-mail systems being shut down," Schrader
      said. "One of the more common ways for companies to respond to news of
      a new virus outbreak is to do a pre-emptive shutdown of their e-mail
      system. ... It's the main way that computer viruses are spread."

      It gets really scary when hackers join security firms
      By John Taschek, PC Week
      January 16, 2000 9:00 PM PT
      URL: 
      
      It's shaping up to be an interesting year, which in some cultures is not necessarily a good thing. First,
      Lotus President Jeff Papows resigns, though I'm not sure I believe anything from Papows anymore.
      Then Steve Jobs takes full control over at Apple, which will, of course, trigger a huge sell-off at
      Apple because, as everyone knows, Jobs works best when he's a front-seat driver with a back-seat
      title. Then China reportedly bans Windows 2000, presumably so that the country could develop an
      indigenous operating system based on Linux. (The Chinese government denied the report.) 
      
      But by far the oddest thing to happen is that the hackers (or, as the fundamentalist technologists say,
      crackers) who went by the name L0pht Heavy Industries have now become full-scale security
      consultants. Does this bode ill for the nation's security, or what? Is everyone off their rocker? 
      
      I can't believe what I'm reading. I also can't believe I'm writing about it, since dealing with people
      who have exhibited criminal tendencies is not a business I want to be in. 
      
      L0pht was a highly publicized group of hackers who started out cracking security systems and then,
      somewhere along the line, became somewhat legitimate because they began to document what they
      were doing on the L0pht.com Web site. L0pht also develops software that allows users to crack
      operating system passwords in a matter of hours. 
      
      To get an idea how strange it is for a security firm to hire L0pht personnel, you only need to look at
      the Attrition.org Web site, which highlights L0pht. Attrition's motto is, "We're easy to get along with
      once you learn to worship us." More damning is that L0pht has also gone on record as saying that
      "governments and multinational corporations are detrimental to the personal liberties on the Internet."
      On the other hand, L0pht's new company, called @Stake, is a specialized professional services
      company that will provide a full range of security solutions for the e-commerce operations of global
      clients. 
      
      This is clearly an example of the farmer giving the fox the key to the chicken coop. I can't imagine
      that any legitimate startup would actually seek out L0pht. But that's exactly what has happened, as
      executives from Forrester Research, Cambridge Technology Partners and Compaq formed @Stake
      specifically to provide security services to its clients. Lo and behold, the vice president of R&D at
      @Stake is none other than Professor Mudge, the chief scientist at L0pht. I can just imagine Mudge
      hacking and cracking to his heart's content, simply to find weaknesses at those multinational
      companies, which then would become @Stake's new customers. 
      
      Of course, the tired old argument is that L0pht performs a service by detailing flaws in systems so
      that companies can boost their defenses against a real, and more threatening, hacker. Hogwash,
      poppycock and every other early-20th-century declarative. L0pht comprised many extremely bright
      and talented people, and Mudge might have been the smartest of the bunch. But L0pht's history
      shows that the group is not ethical, maintained practices that bordered on being illegal and is simply
      downright scary. I wouldn't want any organization that hired the brain trust of L0pht as my security
      consultant. 
      
      See @Stake's response to John Taschek's column. 
      
      Is it better to join them if you can't beat them? Write me at john_taschek@zd.com.
      
      I encourage you to DO write him and respond to this article but do so politely, expletives and leet
      talk will just make us look worse and prove his point. - Ed

      L0pht-@Stake pact: Going legit, selling out or both?
      By Michael Caton, PC Week
      January 16, 2000 9:00 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/columns/0,4351,2421254,00.html
      
      What bothers me the most about security specialist L0pht Heavy Industries becoming part of
      @Stake isn't the idea of hiring hackers. It's the idea that L0pht's great, free public service is now
      very much for hire. 
      
      The trend in the industry has been to give away, or at least subsidize with advertising, some
      beneficial IT resources. I can think of at least a half-dozen free IT help sites that eventually hope to
      make money through advertising or e-commerce. Access to security information is moving in the
      other direction, however, entirely because there is so much demand and so few security experts. 
      
      L0pht has been a thorn in the side of many vendors; a quick look at its Web page, reveals a great
      tweak of Microsoft. L0pht has been known to really embarrass vendors that have not moved quickly
      enough to address the security holes the group finds. Access to most of the information has been
      free—or, according to the L0pht site, "so that system administrators, users, and software and
      hardware vendors may benefit from our knowledge, we share some of it with you." 
      
      In the past, "some" could have meant that L0pht held information back to protect us all from the less
      scrupulous, but now it could be held back to help @Stake maintain a competitive advantage when
      consulting. Talk about unscrupulous. 
      
      What will be as interesting will be to see how this security-for-hire model plays out when it comes to
      companies such as @Stake maintaining a competitive advantage. By going fully legit and for-profit,
      this could compromise relationships with hacking sources. When a security expert or hacker finds a
      new exploit, is the rush going to be to share it with anyone? Not if someone else is going to make
      money off it or hold it as confidential information to have a competitive advantage. 
      
      Perhaps image and rhetoric can maintain enough good will to keep sources alive, although I'm not so
      sure an anarchist's mantra will convince too many people when a company's analysts bill out in the
      tens of thousands of dollars per week. 
      
      In an industry where the nondisclosure agreement is as important as the business contract, I wonder
      just how well the hacking community will disclose security holes it finds when under contract to
      vendors. Let's face it: IT consulting companies aren't the only ones hiring hackers. Security skills can
      be as useful for product development as for product deployment. 
      
      Hopefully, as @Stake contracts out to vendors, it has an escape clause that allows it to disclose
      security flaws after a certain number of business days, just to keep the vendors honest. While it is
      possible that L0pht will survive in spirit, the @Stake Web site, has all the polish of the best
      up-and-coming dot-com company looking to strike gold. Retaining the anti-establishment spirit would
      certainly keep it in the good graces of its sources.

      Cutting to the chase: Hackers join forces with security
      firm to keep the world safe 
      Net Life/Stephanie Schorow 

      Tuesday, January 18, 2000

      Which is a more revealing story? That in December a hacker calling
      himself Maxim broke into a server at an on-line CD store and obtained
      thousands of credit card numbers? 

      Or that when Maxim posted those numbers on a Web site from which
      visitors could get them, one at a time, thousands reportedly did so?

      Must we beware the hacker in the machine - or the hacker next door?

      First, a look at the word ``hacker'' - it's not a synonym for
      ``criminal,'' just as not every locksmith is a burglar, as one hacker
      told me. A hacker cracks software codes to get into a company's
      network or Web page for the thrill of beating the system, not
      necessarily to cause mischief. But the movie ``War Games''
      transformed a bit of MIT slang for a guy who likes to create
      computers into a term for someone who wants to destroy them.

      In popular culture, the Evil Genius Hacker has joined the Mad Scientist
      and Meglomaniac Who Wants to Rule the World as a standard
      stereotype. Fox Mulder of TV's ``The X-Files'' could not chase his
      aliens without illegal hacking help from the so-ugly-they're-cute Lone
      Gunmen, Good Guy Hackers. Hackers get a total makeover into
      leather-coated chic in ``The Matrix.''

      But such stereotypes don't hold up in real life. The most recent Def
      Con - the hackers' annual meet-and-defeat confab, had, according to
      one on-line report, ``all the corporate professionalism of a computer
      mainstream industry.'' Activists, calling themselves ``white hat
      hackers,'' have formed a group dedicated to hacking into and shutting
      down kiddie-porn sites.

      And just two weeks ago, the famed Boston-area hacker collective -
      known as the LOpht - announced its merger with a start-up security
      company, @Stake. With founders hailing from Compaq and Forrester
      Research, plus $10 million in venture capital, @Stake is pure pinstripe.
      At LOpht, geek rules.

      The news intrigued me. For years, I'd heard about LOpht's expertise,
      its Web postings of key security flaws in Windows-based systems,
      about its outlaws-in-good-standing image with the so-called black
      hat hacker underground, and about their gizmo- and
      Cheez-Its-clogged warehouse. Going by hacker handles of Mudge,
      Dildog and Space Rogue, they've testified on lax computer security
      before the U.S. Senate. They embodied Bob Dylan's phrase: ``to live
      outside the law, you must be honest.''

      When the hacker who goes only by ``Mudge'' returned my call, his
      voice was more lighthearted than mysterious. For a guy who
      supposedly has the ability to take down the Internet in 30 minutes,
      he was cheerfully patient with a fumbling reporter's Hacking 101
      questions.

      What enticed LOpht to come in from the cold? Well, money, for one
      thing; ``we'd been looking around for various way to get the LOpht
      to fund itself,'' said Mudge. With @Stake's pledge not to market any
      specific security product, take kickbacks from vendors or interfere
      with LOpht's continued posting of security flaws, LOpht will be able to
      remain the hacker's Consumer Reports, Mudge said.

      LOpht's independence is invaluable to @Stake, said Ted Julian,
      @Stake founder and vice president of marketing: ``There's an
      enormous demand in the marketplace for these people.''

      That's because computer security itself is transforming. As Mudge
      said, ``We know how to make a closed system.'' Put up a fire wall
      and keep people out. But with burgeoning e-commerce, systems have
      to remain open enough to allow consumers access to key information.
      Users, for example, might want to search inventories or track a
      delivery. Yes, Mudge asserted, ``you absolutely can'' secure such
      systems. You just need the right tools. Attorney General Janet Reno's
      recent call for a national anti-cybercrime network underscores the
      need for enhanced security.

      Hacking is changing, too. Once the domain of code-writing
      uber-nerds, it's been invaded by so-called script kiddies, young
      neophytes who attack with a point and click. ``The media actually
      encourages them,'' Mudge said, disgustedly. ``If you read about
      someone breaking into a high profile Web page, it's `a 16-year-old,
      brilliant misguided kid.' If a 16-year-old walked into a liquor store,
      shot the clerk to get the money, they never say, a `brilliant juvenile
      expert in spontaneous combustion.' ''

      For me, the most telling aspect of the Maxim hack was that
      afterwards no one I knew - even those who blew big bucks shopping
      the dotcoms - seemed spooked about e-shopping. Perhaps we've
      accepted a certain level of e-commerce risk. Consider: thousands of
      traffic accidents occur daily, but we wouldn't ban driving. We just
      want to keep the 16-year-old drivers under control. And we want
       safer roads. Which makes me glad that the LOpht is still out there.

      Pentagon Goes Ballistic With New Defense Tests; Group of
      Hackers Goes Corporate; Winds of Change Stir Up New
      Developments in Weather

      Aired January 22, 2000 - 1:30 p.m. ET 

      THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS
      FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. 

      RICK LOCKRIDGE, GUEST HOST: The Pentagon goes ballistic with new
      defense tests, a secretive group of computer hackers goes corporate, and the
      winds of change stir up new developments in weather. Those stories and more
      are just ahead on SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY WEEK. 

      Hello and welcome. I'm Rick Lockridge in for Ann Kellan. 

      A test of a new high-tech U.S. defense system ended in failure this past
      week. A prototype Interceptor, designed to knock out approaching missiles,
      apparently sailed right past its target. Pentagon experts think they've figured
      out what went wrong. 

      But as Jamie McIntyre reports, the failure is raising questions about the whole
      program. 

      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

      JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT
      (voice-over): From the launch of a target missile at night in California through
      the launch of an Interceptor from a sunny Pacific island, Pentagon rocket
      scientists thought they were looking at a slam dunk. Everything was tracking
      perfectly. But as they counted down to an expected mid-space collision,
      nothing, no flash: nothing but black space. They missed. 

      In reconstructing the failure, Pentagon officials say they believe heat sensors
      the Interceptor uses to find the warm warhead failed in the crucial final six
      seconds. Why they don't yet know. 

      It was a bitter disappointment after October's successful maiden test, but the
      Clinton administration vowed to press on, insisting some misses were
      inevitable. 

      JOE LOCKHART, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Obviously, if
      this were easy technology, they wouldn't have to test. They'd just go ahead
      and deploy. 

      MCINTYRE: The $100 million test was the second of 19 planned tests of a
      system designed to protect the United States from a limited missile attack by a
      rogue nation. But only one more test is planned in the spring before the
      Pentagon recommends whether to invest billions more for deployment of the
      system by 2005. 

      Critics insist the failure is a wake-up call that the complex missile shield is not
      ready for primetime. 

      TOM COLLINA, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS: I would say it's
      just another piece of evidence that's showing that you can't make a decision
      this summer, that the system's moving too fast. 

      MCINTYRE (on camera): The Pentagon, stung by criticism that it may have
      overstated its previous success, went to great lengths this time to explain
      exactly what went wrong. And while insisting it can solve the technical
      problems, a senior military official admitted the test schedule may be overly
      ambitious.

      LOCKRIDGE: NASA made it official this week. The Mars Polar Lander is
      dead. The spacecraft was designed to study the Martian atmosphere and dig
      up soil samples. It was due to land on Mars on December 3. But just before it
      entered the Martian atmosphere, it stopped sending data back to Earth, and it
      hasn't been heard from since. One final attempt to contact it this past week
      met with silence. Scientists say the Polar Lander may have burned up as it
      descended, or it may have crashed on mars, but they'll probably never know
      for sure. Two panels investigating the failure are due to report in March. 

      Coming up later in the show: dolphins stranded in the shallows, and the rescue
      effort that helped turn things around. But first, some underground computer
      hackers surface to show what's at stake when you're online. 

      (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

      LOCKRIDGE: A mysterious hacker group that's legendary in some Internet
      circles is going mainstream. The Boston-based group, called Lopht, is starting
      a company to advise big business on computer security. 

      Our reporter Ann Kellan has known members of Lopht for two years now,
      and wonders how if the new corporate ties will change their lofty goals. 

      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

      "MUDGE", LOPHT MEMBER: We decided Lopht is now going to
      completely sellout, and we are going to join the mainstream. 

      ANN KELLAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He gives keynote speeches to
      packed houses... 

      "MUDGE": If you're looking for computer security, then the Internet is not the
      place to be. 

      KELLAN: ... is invited, along with fellow group members, to testify before the
      U.S. Senate. He's a trained musician, and plays a mean guitar. He goes by the
      handle "Mudge," won't reveal his name, rank or Social Security number... 

      "MUDGE": I don't worry have to worry about, you know, who's waiting
      outside of my house when I leave in the morning. 

      KELLAN: ... and has been a member of a band of computer hackers called
      Lopht since 1992. 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Seven people, close quarters, on top of each other
      -- it's amazing that we get can actually get along without being at each others'
      throats. 

      KELLAN: Headquarted in a secret warehouse near Boston, the Lopht is filled
      with hand-me-down equipment. Even the bathroom is wired. 

      "WELD POND," LOPHT MEMBER: Here's our bathroom. Normally, a
      bathroom wouldn't be very exciting, but our bathroom has a Web browser. 

      KELLAN: There are processors and networks, from Novell to Microsoft. 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got it from dumpsters. We got it as, you know,
      people give equipment to us. 

      KELLAN: And once they own it, they legally attack it, learning how each
      system works, inside and out. 

      "WELD POND": We don't just attack Microsoft, no matter what, you know,
      Microsoft might say. 

      KELLAN: Each member has area of expertise. "Weld Pond," programmer
      and Web guru. "Brian Oblivion" knows networks. "Silicosis (ph)" deciphers
      network codes. "Space Rogue" knows the inner workings of Macintosh
      computers. He also publishes a daily hacker newsletter on the Web. 

      "SPACE ROGUE," LOPHT MEMBER: There a lot of things that go on that
      affect the hacker culture and the people that are in the hacker community that
      don't really get reported in the mainstream. 

      KELLAN: "Kingpin" is a hardware expert, started hacking when he was 7,
      not always legally. He says Lopht helped set him straight. 

      "KINGPIN," LOPHT MEMBER: I got into trouble for some things when I
      was younger, and they basically took me under their wing. They must have
      thought I had some good in me. 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Still do; we're just still trying to find it. 

      KELLAN: "Dill Dog" is an ace programmer. Before joining Lopht, he made
      headlines in another hacker group, developing software that let's people
      access computers from remote locations, for good or for bad. It ticked off the
      likes of Microsoft, but if a system is vulnerable, Lopht's philosophy is to go
      public with it. 

      "MUDGE": If you don't bring it public and if you just hand information off to
      the offending company, they just want to bury it, because it's cheaper for them
      to do that. 

      KELLAN: Considered by many the consumer advocates of the computer
      world. 

      "KINGPIN": We know the computer industry is here to stay, and we want to
      make security better. We want to make the industry better. 

      KELLAN: In the hacker world, blue hairs mingle with crew cuts and criminals
      with feds, the cops and robbers attend the same conventions, to learn from
      each other -- where computer vulnerabilities are, where thieves can break in
      and steel everything, from bank accounts to medical records. 

      KELLAN (on camera): How vulnerable are all the systems out there? 

      (LAUGHTER) 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Toys can be hacked. 

      KELLAN (voice-over): The Lopht has been an exclusive hacker playground.
      And now this band of hackers is going corporate, moving to white-walled
      offices money, getting money to buy new equipment, a place where they can
      do more good, says "Mudge." 

      As far as their old stomping grounds... 

      "MUDGE": The luxurious labs will still exist there for sometime, I'm sure,
      but... 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still can't tell you where you it is. 

      "MUDGE": Even the Lopht folks are sitting there going, we love this place, but
      boy, we can make something so much better. 

      KELLAN: The move is good, and he'll stay casual and keep his personal life
      private, he says. But will success change Lopht's goals? 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One thing we always said about Lopht, if it stops
      being fun, then it's not Lopht, then it's work. 

      "KINGPIN": It's just so wonderful to figure out how the world works around
      you, and especially when it doesn't. 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is a family, that's what it is. 

      KELLAN: For SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY WEEK, this is Ann Kellan. 

      (END VIDEOTAPE) 

      LOCKRIDGE: The Lopht members say their security expertise is particularly
      needed in the field of e-commerce. They see a conflict there between
      protecting data and the need to make Web sites very easy and welcoming for
      cyber-shoppers. But, says one of their new corporate partners, "If you can't
      do security right, you can't do e- commerce right." "Mudge" agrees, and says
      security should no longer be just walls built to keep people out, but an element
      that makes everyone's job easier, from the warehouse to the delivery company
      to the customer. 

      Coming up: from climate patterns to better weather detection, we'll tell with
      you what's making waves. 

      (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

      LOCKRIDGE: Some climate researchers think there's a big change going on
      in the Pacific Ocean that could bring weird weather for the next 30 years.
      They say unusual areas of warm and cold water may mean we're entering a
      pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which changes weather around
      the world. 

      Anne McDermott has more. 

      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

      ANNE MCDERMOTT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Painting
      the lawn: Another wacky California custom? Well, no. This was back in the
      late '80s, when a drought burned up all the grass. Eventually, though, the
      vegetable dye was washed away by El Nino. But it may be time to get out
      that green dye again, because according to the experts, more drought is on the
      way. And that's because of a natural recurring climate pattern over the
      Pacific Ocean called Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO for short. 

      Unlike El Nino, which only sticks around a year or two, PDO is a much bigger
      phenomenon, and one that waxes and wanes over the course of 20 to 30
      years. Scientists monitoring this PDO say it steers the jet stream over North
      America and will result, they say, in lots more rain in the Northwest part of the
      United States and less than normal rainfall in the Southern part of the country. 

      WILLIAM PATZERT, JPL OCEANOGRAPHER: When the Pacific speaks
      with events like this, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the United States definitely
      listens. 

      MCDERMOTT: How severe droughts will be is by no means possible to
      determine, but expect a renewed interest in those low-flow showerheads and
      those water-skimping toilets. No one's forgotten rationing or the sacrifices. 

      UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not being able to wash down my driveway and
      wash my car. 

      MCDERMOTT: Now this PDO is not related to global warming, but its reach
      may be global. Scientists say it's possible that the PDO played a part in the
      terrible flooding in Venezuela last year and in those wind storms that battered
      Europe late last month. But mostly, this climate pattern will affect the U.S. 

      In fact, it's already happening. Scientists say New England's long wait for that
      first big snow is related to the PDO. Next up: well, at least some periods of
      drought in some parts of the country, though it's unlikely it'll make anyone
      yearn for the return of El Nino.

      Angeles.

      LOCKRIDGE: If we're going to have strange weather in the next few years,
      at least forecasters may be able to give us a bit more warning of what's
      coming. The National Weather Service has a brand new computer, and
      officials say it will make predictions faster and more accurate. 

      Natalie Pawelski reports. 

      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

      NATALIE PAWELSKI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Predicting
      this week's snowstorms and bitter cold and forecasting the hurricanes and
      tornadoes of warmer months has just gotten easier, says the National Weather
      Service, thanks to a new supercomputer. 

      JACK KELLY, NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE: We're starting off
      today with a much -- a five-times-faster computer than we've had, and by
      September, it will be about 28-times faster than the one we currently have. So.
      we're able to do better simulations of the atmosphere. 

      PAWELSKI: The Weather Service says the new computer will give people
      more lead time to prepare for severe storms, and it's designed to run
      increasingly-complex forecasting models that predict what's coming with
      ever-greater detail. 

      KELLY: What's that mean for everyone? It means more accurate forecasts,
      longer-time forecasts and more accurate, both temperature, rain, you name it;
      it's going to be better than what we've been able to do. 

      PAWELSKI: They say everybody talks about the weather but nobody does
      anything about it. The new computer should allow people to talk about coming
      weather further in advance. And while we still can't do anything about it, at
      least we can be better prepared. 

      For SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY WEEK, I'm Natalie Pawelski. 

      (END VIDEOTAPE) LOCKRIDGE: Coming up next: surfing the Web and
      the water. We'll travel to Florida for a marine mammal mystery, then
      introduce you to an older generation learning some new technology. 

      (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

      LOCKRIDGE: Skywatchers with clear weather got a spectacular show on
      Thursday night. A total lunar eclipse made the full moon glow an eerie shade
      of red over North and South America. This was the first time in four years
      that the Sun, Earth and Moon lined up just right to produce this kind of show.
      It happens when the Earth's shadow blocks most of the Sun's rays from
      lighting up the Moon. The next full lunar eclipse will be in July, and the best
      viewing for that one will be from Asia and Australia. 

      Marine biologists in the Florida keys are trying to solve a mystery. Starting last
      weekend, dozens of bottle-nosed dolphins began stranding themselves on tidal
      flats. They included both healthy and sick animals, and scientists are trying to
      figure out just what drove them so close to shore. 

      Reporter Mike Tobin, from our affiliate WSVN, has the story. 

      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

      MIKE TOBIN, WSVN REPORTER: Hours and hours of desperate,
      exhaustive labor got rescuers to the point where they finally chased the
      dolphin out into open water. 

      CHRIS BLANKENSHIP, MARINE BIOLOGIST: It's nice to see him go
      offshore, but whether they get stranded again, we don't know. 

      TOBIN: Without warning, dolphins started coming ashore, not just on Long
      Key, but on the west coast of Florida. These dolphins ran aground at
      Aresnicker (ph) Bank, about five miles off Long Key. So necropsies are being
      performed on all the dolphin that died to see if there was an illness or toxin
      which caused this. 

      BRAD LANGE, LAYTON, FLORIDA FIRE DEPARTMENT: Something's
      obviously going on. Right now, we're checking dolphins out, and hopefully we'll
      know more later on. 

      TOBIN: There were two efforts going on in the water, one to nurse the ill,
      exhausted or injured back into swimming shape, and two, to scare the healthy
      dolphin into the open sea, but the first attempts at human chains were
      unsuccessful. The healthy dolphin kept coming back. Then someone came up
      with a theory that this was tightly knit pod of dolphin, and the sick ones were
      calling for help. 

      BLANKENSHIP: Sometimes animals will, when they congregate together as
      a family, if you get a couple of sick ones, and they have this feeling of
      responsibility, at least in my mind, you know, they have to take care of the
      animals that are sick. 

      TOBIN: So they moved the sick ones to a tank onshore, where they couldn't
      communicate with the other dolphin. Sadly, one of those died when it was
      moved. 

      DENISE JACKSON, WILDLIFE RESCUE: We have had scenarios that
      once the injured and the sick ones died, the healthy ones did leave. 

      TOBIN: Then the volunteers formed a human chain again, this time with
      kayakers in front. With buckets of fish on their legs, they would try to act like
      the Pied Piper, tempting the dolphin out to sea. With all the people behind them
      scaring the dolphin, the survivors made it to the open water, where they can't
      be injured or trapped by the sharp corral the in the shallow water of the Keys. 

      LANGE: We consider this a great success because there could have been a
      lot of them expired.

      When you imagine a typical Internet user, you might think of a teenager
      endlessly chatting with friends, or a young business tycoon checking stock
      prices on a Palm Pilot. 

      But the Internet's not just for the young. As Don Knapp reports, it's keeping
      some senior citizens young at heart.

      DAVID LANSDALE, GERIATRICS EXPERT: So let's go down one more,
      push your enter key. 

      DON KNAPP, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): David Lansdale's

      Internet. 

      LANSDALE: Now one more. Now type "au." 

      UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought maybe I was through with life, I was
      ready for a rocking chair because I was 86 years old, and I haven't found the
      rocking chair yet. 

      KNAPP: The average age of Lansdale's students is around 68. All are in
      nursing or assisted care homes. He used family relationships to introduce them
      to the Web. 

      LANSDALE: Here they are in California, a family was back in New York.
      The opportunity for them to connect, to cross that time and space, was an
      incredibly-precious opportunity to them. 

      UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hear you are so beautiful. 

      KNAPP: Lillian Sher (ph) dictates an e-mail to a newborn great
      granddaughter. Working with one another, the seniors learn as a group, to both
      master the Internet and overcome what Lansdale calls the maladies of the
      institutionalized: loneliness, helplessness, boredom and cognitive decline. 

      MARY HARVEY, WEB SURFER: Bingo just doesn't appeal to me, but this
      does. Believe me, this does. 

      (LAUGHTER) 

      KNAPP: Ninety-four year-old Ruth Hyman is a star pupil and an instructor. 

      RUTH HYMAN, INTERNET INSTRUCTOR: When I sent a letter to my
      grandchildren, a great grandchildren, they hanged it up in their offices, just like
      I used to hang their drawings on my refrigerator. 

      LANSDALE: There's a collective benefit, there is an element of -- a
      tremendous element of therapy. And remember that we started as a support
      group. 

      DIXON MOOREHOUSE, WEB SURFER: I just wished I was 15 years old
      and getting to learn all this. 

      LANSDALE: The seniors call their weekly meetings Monday Night Live, and
      many say it's given them new life. 

      HYMAN: Three years ago they told me I wasn't going to live, but I showed
      them. I got on the Web and got work, and I worked ever since.

      Jan. 22 — Computer crime is on the rise. And as
      more people start purchasing online, entrusting
      their credit card numbers and other personal
      details to the ether, many experts say it is time
      to step up the battle for online security. 
           “You don’t even have to be a really knowledgeable
      intruder, you can just use one of these tools that are out
      there and break into a system,” says Kathy Fithin of the
      Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon
      University in Pittsburgh. Last year the Response Team
      received reports of more than 8,000 Internet attacks and
      intrusions.
           Connecticut-based CD Universe reported it received a
      fax from a hacker describing himself as a 19-year-old from
      Russia. The hacker offered to destroy the credit card files
      he had accessed through a flaw in the software for
      $100,000. When CD Universe passed up the offer, the
      hacker retaliated by posting up to 25,000 numbers on a
      Web site called Maxus Credit Card Pipeline. 

      Card Numbers Cause Alarm 
           “What’s interesting about this case is the sheer scale of
      the crime. The person claims to have 300,000 credit cards,
      which is an enormous amount,” says security expert Elias
      Levy. 
           Discover Financial Services, Visa, MasterCard and
      American Express are all working to get new cards to the
      customers compromised by the Russian hacker.
           The Maxus incident is bound to reignite consumer
      concern over online security. At least 30 businesses are
      compromised every day, according to ABCNEWS
      research. The problem has led to a boom in computer
      security firms.
           @Stake, a security firm in Boston, went to the source
      and hired eight of the most prominent hackers in the
      country, a group called L0pht Heavy Industries. The L0pht
      crew consider themselves “gray-hat” hackers. Unlike
      black-hat hackers such as Maxus and white-hat vigilante

          # Halcon Hacker Valiant Gives QuadCon An Exclusive Interview And Some
            Special Tips In Trying To Prevent Your Machine From Being Hacked
          
      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      The Interview Of Valiant The Leader Of Halcon.  |   http://www.halcon.com.au
      ----------------------------------------------
      
      BackGround:
      Halcon was founded in 1993 as a Bulletin Board System and by 1996 had grown
      to atleast ten members.  Still growing, in October 1996 the group took on
      the name Halcon Technologies and in 1997 Valiant registered a business name,
      allowing them to register the halcon.com.au domain name.  Although the group
      was not widely known, on 22nd October 1999, Halcon was blamed for a massive
      hack on the Australian Republican Movement website.  Despite denials and
      misquotations, the story was covered by news outlets, an example of which is
      at the following URL:
      
                     http://www.halcon.com.au/arm0001.html
                     
      Following this incident, Halcon received massive amounts of publicity (most
      of it was unwanted) and Valiant claims that Halcon has become the most
      popular hacking group in Australia.  It currently has 24 members and thousands
      of supporters.
      
      Having been misquoted once, Valiant has since denied all interviews to the press,
      including an offer from Channel Nine.  QuadCon is therefore proud to present
      an exclusive, uncut interview with Valiant.
      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The Interview
      -------------
      QuadCon: If you were a system administrator of a newly installed slackware 
               linux machine and you had 20 minutes to secure it what would you do?
      
      Valiant: Go to all the available sites (www.halcon.com.au/links.html) that
               cater for that, and quickly grab and install as many patches for 
               your software available.  Close all services (especially fingerd)
               that arn't needed, relocate telnet to a different port (I know it
               breaches RFC's, but fuck it.) and make sure that you don't
               adduser lamers.  :)
      
      QuadCon: What is the most common thing to hack to gain access to?
      
      Valiant: Fingerd is the most exploitable feature on machines, the good old 
               crackers highway.  Allthough these days it's neglected as a mode of 
               system penetration, also alot of sysadmins don't understand the point
               of finger anymore and remove it anyway.  As for hacking, the best
               method available that I remember overusing would be a buffer overflow
               in a certain software which makes calls to root.  Flood the software,
               bang, down it goes and you have root.  :)
      
      QuadCon: Does the name Halcon have any relavence to you and why did you choose
               it for the name of the group?
      
      Valiant: Halcon .. well, I chose that many years ago, so I can't really
               remember why it was chosen, other than that it sounds funky.  :P
      
      QuadCon: How would you characterize the media coverage of you?
      
      Valiant: Trivial and biased.  They just want an 'evil hacker genious' who 
               brags about how he hacked NASA, they don't really like me as 
               basically I won't brag, and I prefer to explain how idiotic the 
               consumers are for purchasing fucked computers, etc, and other 
               consumer related problems.
      
      QuadCon: What do you think about hacks done in your name--for instance, the
               Australian Republican Movement hack?
      
      Valiant: I wasn't expecting such media coverage on that topic, however they
               have no evidence against me, and I have yet to admit to even being 
               born at this point in time.  So fuck 'em all.  :)
      
      QuadCon: What's the biggest misconception perpetuated by Hollywood 
               cybermovies? 
      
      Valiant: There is no such thing as a hot female hacker named Acid Burn who has
               pert tits and lips that would look very nice wrapped around my hard 
               disk.  :)
      
      QuadCon: In your own words, define hacker.
      
      Valiant: There's two meanings.  I fall into both.  The code hacker, who lives
               to program and does it the hard way, and the system hacker, who loves
               finding exploitable features in systems to gain access, does so, 
               notifies the sysadmin and patches the hole.
      
      QuadCon: What is your technical background. (Which platform do you prefer 
               PC/MAC? What is your online background? Do you do networking? Do you
               know programming languages,etc.)
      
      Valiant: At the moment my prefered operating system is Windows 98 due it's
               usability and comprehensive system architecture, when it comes to
               personal use, for industrial things such as networking, I prefer any
               linux distribution.  I am a PC user, allthough I have a few old Apple
               Classics in my computer collection.  I've been using the internet
               through BBS gateways for ten or more years.  I network when I have
               to, but I used to work as a network engineer.  As for programming
               languages, I have a bad memory and generally have to 'relearn' things
               when I need them, however it's more a refresh than a relearn.  :)
      
      QuadCon: I understand that hackers assume an online nickname to become known
               by - how did you acquire your nickname?
      
      Valiant: I was seven years old when I logged onto a BBS using an audio coupler
               900 bps modem at a friends place.  It asked for a handle, Valiant was
               my current dungeons and dragons charracter, so I typed it in
               sheepishly.  I've been known by it ever since.  :) 
      
      QuadCon: What do you portray system administrators are like?
      
      Valiant: Fail-safe devices that take care of systems, that if programmed 
               correctly would never need human assistance.  :)
      
      QuadCon: What do you think of ALOC, another aussie hacking group?
      
      Valiant: Who?  :)
      
      QuadCon: What currently is Halcon working on?
      
      Valiant: Currently working on?  We're currently working on the ultimate 
               encyclopeadia of how to be slothenly and lazy.  :)
      
      QuadCon: What would you like Halcon to be in the future?
      
      Valiant: I don't know, that's a hard question really.  I never wanted it to be
               anything to begin with, time has just made it bigger than I ever 
               expected.  Back when I was a kid and it first started, I never really
               thought it would exceed a BBS group of users who were of the same 
               interests.  Now it's allmost like a religious cult for some.  :)
      
      QuadCon: Who in the world do you dislike most?
      
      Valiant: Anyone with an IQ under 110.  :)  100 is average, so I like people a
               tad over.  The others should be neutered and shot.  :)
      
      QuadCon: Any last comments?
      
      Valiant: I like being a cunt-rag.

49.0  HNN: Jan 25:  AIM Accounts Susceptible to Theft 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      AOL will always have problems of some sort, no matter what they

      not know more than the basics of how the user interfaces work

      A group of teenagers have discovered a way to take
      over any AOL Instant Messenger account as long as
      they know the person's screen name. A staff tool that
      was picked up from AOL's proprietary online service lets
      them exploit a hole in AOL 5.0's registration process,
      allowing them to reset users' passwords. During the AOL
      5.0 registration process, AOL asks for a person's screen
      name. The teenagers enter the screen name they want
      to have, when prompted for a password they make one
      up to get the "invalid password" message. AOL 5.0 then
      buffers the screen name within the registration process.
      The perpetrators then jump to another part of the
      registration process where AOL thinks the intruder is the
      rightful owner of the AIM screen name and permits the
      password to be reset. AOL says it is working to correct
      the problem.

     Hackers learn how to take over AOL IM accounts 
     By Courtney Macavinta
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     January 24, 2000, 4:30 p.m. PT 

     America Online Instant Messenger users could find their online identities 
     stolen via a security hole that allows hackers to hijack their accounts 
     through another popular service: AOL 5.0.

     A small band of hackers has discovered a way to take over any AOL Instant 
     Messenger (AIM) account as long as they have a person's screen name. By 
     using an AOL staff tool they unearthed while poking around the company's 
     proprietary online service, they exploit a public hole in the AOL 5.0 
     registration process that lets them reset AIM users' passwords.

     Once the hackers do this handiwork, initial users of the screen names are 
     locked out of their accounts, giving the hackers open access to users' 
     "buddy lists" of other AIM users and the ability to maintain trial AOL 5.0 
     accounts under the same screen names, as confirmed by CNET News.com.

     AOL spokesman Rich D'Amoto said he hasn't heard of any complaints about 
     stolen AIM screen names, but that the company is looking into the issue and 
     will try to track down the hackers.

     "We're aware of the situation and we are deploying security measures to 
     defeat the hackers," D'Amoto said.

     More than 40 million people have registered AIM screen names and use the 
     program to carry on short conversations or send quick alerts to their 
     friends or co-workers.

     AIM users can set up private buddy lists and never have to share their 
     screen names with people they don't know. But many users give up their 
     names freely in chat rooms or through AIM's "find a buddy" feature, which 
     lets users search for someone to talk with based on a common interest, such 
     as books or religion.

     The teen-age hackers who found the hole in AOL 5.0 say they have stolen 
     more than a hundred names, such as "New York City." Some use the names 
     they've seized to extract information about the person from friends and 
     family. Mostly the ploy is a game. 

     "We do it if we've seen someone we don't like in a private chat room," one 
     of the hackers said in an interview.

     At one point, the high school senior said he tried to let AOL know about 
     the hole. "If AOL would just listen to people like us instead of blowing us 
     off and terminating our accounts, they could fix it," he said.

     Security holes usually aren't kid's stuff to a major company such as AOL, 
     however.

     In the wake of high-profile privacy breaches by way of human error and 
     email-based attacks, AOL has been forced to take security seriously to 
     ensure its more than 20 million members that their personal information, 
     e-commerce transactions and communications are protected on its service.

     AOL wants AIM registrants to feel safe, too; their frequent and consistent 
     activity adds up to lucrative advertising dollars for AOL. And AOL's 
     quality control and privacy measures will only become more important--and 
     potentially harder to manage--as its acquisition of Time Warner takes 
     shape.

     AOL will likely try to close the loophole in the registration process that 
     allows the hackers to assign a new password to the account.

     Here's how it works:

     At one point in the 5.0 registration process, AOL asks for a person's 
     screen name. The hackers enter the screen name they intend to steal, but 
     when asked for a password, they simply guess and get an "invalid password" 
     message. The trick is that AOL has "buffered," or remembered, the screen 
     name within the registration process. The hackers then use a tool that lets 
     them jump to another part of the registration process. Once these steps 
     have been taken, AOL thinks the hacker is the rightful owner of the AIM 
     screen name and later on in the registration process permits the password 
     to be reset.

     Security experts say such abuses aren't rare.

     "These software faults are more common than most people think; it's more 
     common than we would like," said Elias Levy, of the consulting firm 
     Security Focus. "Most companies, their first reaction is to deny the 
     problem and then go into damage recovery mode and fix the problem without 
     acknowledging it."

     Although AIM users could simply register a new screen name, Levy said that 
     having a name stolen could be more of a concern for people who use 
     messenger or chat programs for professional reasons.

     "It can be nerve wracking if someone stole your online personality," he 
     said.

     AOL said that if a person has had their AIM screen name stolen, for now 
     they can use the program's "forgot password" feature to have an email sent 
     to the address they provided at registration that includes the account's 
     current
     password. Then the original holder of the screen name can reset the password 
     once again.

      Hackers impersonate AOL users
      By Lisa Napoli, MSNBC
      January 24, 2000 6:09 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2426698,00.html?chkpt=zdnntop
      
      Since November, a group of teenagers say they have been stealing AOL Instant Messenger screen
      names and masquerading as their rightful owners. The hackers sometimes act as imposters and
      pilfer credit card numbers and other personal data from friends and family of the exploited online
      users. The hackers demonstrated their method to MSNBC on Monday. 
      
      According to a letter the hackers sent on Sunday to members of the technology press, they use the
      names "just for the pure joy of trying to ruin friendships by insulting friends who have no idea they
      are talking to a hacker and not the victim." 
      
      The hackers say they have contacted the media because AOL (NYSE: AOL) had not responded to
      their notification to them of the security hole. 
      
      An AOL spokesman, Rich D'Amato, said on Monday afternoon, "We are aware of the situation and
      are deploying security measures to defeat it. When hacker behavior crosses the line into illegal
      action, we'll certainly bring it to the attention of authorities." 
      
      D'Amato would not specify how many people had been affected or pinpoint the time line, saying
      those details could affect the investigation. 
      
      "AOL is so easy to abuse, it's pathetic," said TangentX, who says he is 17- years-old and, along with
      two others, found the security hole this fall. They discussed it, he said, in special private chat rooms
      on AOL for hackers and use of the so-called "exploit" spread. He estimates that 400 names have
      been stolen to date. 
      
                            AOL press materials say that 45 million people have created AOL
                            Instant Messenger screen names as of last August. The popular
                            software allows online users to chat privately, almost in real time, with
                            others who have the software. 
      
                            AOL also owns ICQ, another popular instant messaging program,
      which claims 50 million registered users.
      
      TangentX says he and others have found several ways to make an instant message screen name
      into an AOL account without the password. One involves resetting a password for a screen name
      through a security hole. The other involves taking a screen name, creating an AOL account for it
      and then changing the password. 
      
      When he was given a screen name on Monday afternoon by MSNBC, TangentX was able to access
      the account and send an instant message from the name in a matter of minutes.

     Hack Takes Aim at AOL Clients 
     Wired News Report 
     
     5:30 p.m. 24.Jan.2000 PST 
     A security breach on AOL Instant Messenger put the privacy of AIM users at risk
     on Monday, according to a published report. 
     
     The breach, first reported in Salon, allows subscribers to link new AOL accounts
     to AIM names that already exist. Holes in the sign-up process allow people to get
     around the password protection of the AIM accounts. 
     
     "We are aware of it and are deploying security measures to defeat it," said Rich
     D'Amato, a spokesman for AOL. 
     
     AOL's online service is used to changed passwords, so hackers are easily able to
     open new accounts using the existing AIM user's name. 
     
     People who subscribe to AOL are not affected by the breach. People who use instant
     messaging software (AIM) outside of AOL, are. 
     
     D'Amato called the security breach an example of "hacker behavior that crosses the
     line into illegal action." 
                                 
     "Our intention is to investigate this and when we identify an individual or groups
     of individuals, we intend to bring this to the attention of the proper law 
     enforcement authorities," D'Amato said. 
     
     He declined to speculate on when the problem will be fixed or how many users were
     affected, although he characterized it as "a very small number." 
     
     David Cassel, who edits the AOL Watch mailing list, claimed the security hole was
     easily preventable. It was simply a matter of someone thinking through the sign-on
     process. 
     
     "AOL left a gaping hole in the way they implemented it," Cassel wrote in an email.
     "Those who happened to have an AOL account weren't vulnerable, but everyone else was.
     To promote such an easily cracked software really violates
     any reasonable expectation of security. In that sense, all AIM users were affected." 
     
     "AOL is a marketing company, not a technology company," Cassel wrote. "They 
     mass-promoted a software that's vulnerable to easy attacks."

      By changing the order number in the URL users at
      Outpost.com are able to view the personal information,
      including the type of credit card used, of other users.
      An Outpost spokesperson said that the problem would
      be fixed immediately. (This type of problem is extremely
      old, it is surprising that such a large company such as
      Outpost has this problem. This just further illuminates
      the need for effective e-commerce security.)

      Outpost Leaves Data Unguarded 
      by Chris Oakes 
      
      1:25 p.m. 24.Jan.2000 PST 
      While James Wynne was checking his online order Friday at Outpost.com, he 
      noticed something curious -- he could check orders from other people, too. 

      He noticed that the long Web page address for his transaction included his 
      order number, and decided to see what happened if he changed a digit to 
      try and access other customers' records. 

      The modified address pulled up the same detailed transaction summary for 
      another customer's order number -- including a full range of sensitive, 
      and valuable, personal data. 

      "You can see someone's email address, their billing address, their 
      shipping address, type of credit card they used, their order history -- 
      everything they bought, everything they received, everything they're 
      currently waiting for,"       Wynne said. 

      In addition to exposing nuggets of information about individuals -- tying 
      their email identity to their street address, and revealing recent 
      purchases -– the security glitch could be exploited by marketers to build 
      databases of target       customers, said Wynne. 

      "I could set up data-mining program that would check random [order] 
      numbers and find out all people who bought PalmPilots at Outpost.com," he 
      said. 

      Outpost.com acknowledged the flaw Monday and said it would have the 
      problem fixed by the end of the day. But the vulnerability did not 
      represent a dramatic risk, the company said. 

      Most commerce sites prevent the simple searching of their database by 
      encrypting or otherwise preventing the data from appearing in URLs. 

      "It shouldn't be there, but it is," said Outpost.com spokesman Craig 
      Andrews. "It's sort of hidden buried away in the URL," he said, claiming 
      that only hackers looking for holes would be able to find it. 

      Furthermore, he said, while the hole revealed both personal and purchasing 
      information, it did not betray credit card numbers or other vital 
      financial information. 

      "It's unfortunate that pricing and product information is there. But the 
      other personal information is all over the place. You can go to a place 
      like [Web information directory] 411 and get addresses and personal 
      email." 

      However, Andrews acknowledged that people generally volunteer the 
      information in directory services, and purchasing information is not 
      included. 

      Ray Everett-Church, chief privacy officer at Alladvantage.com and longtime 
      spam-watcher, said the flaw is more of a threat than Outpost portrayed it 
      to be. 

      "I would certainly consider this a threat to not only integrity of data 
      privacy promises a site might make, but certainly to the kinds of 
      confidence level that companies should be trying to instill in consumers," 
      Everett-Church said. 

      "It causes folks to question the security of these transactions and the 
      advisability of entering into them in the first place." 

      Was it an oversight that led to the hole? Technically, yes, but not 
      really, said Outpost.com's Andrews. 

      "Between management of the site and the software they use to manage 
      orders, it was just something that hadn't come up.... It wasn't really an 
      oversight by the textbook definition." 

      Everett-Church said he doesn't think the public hears about personal data 
      vulnerabilities nearly as often as they occur. 

      "I think these sorts of Web ordering systems have these problems quite 
      frequently -- probably more frequently than we realize. All it takes is a 
      clever hacker to keep poking and prodding at the systems to find these 
      kinds of
      weaknesses."

      Sun fights Linux, WinNT with 'free Solaris'
      By Deborah Gage, Sm@rt Reseller
      January 24, 2000 8:58 AM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2426200,00.html?chkpt=zdhpnews01
      
      Sun Microsystems Inc. is expected to eliminate licensing fees for Solaris 8 to boost its appeal against
      Linux and Microsoft Windows NT, say sources close to the company. 
      
      Sun is expected to make its "free Solaris" campaign the centerpiece of its Solaris 8 unveiling, which
      takes place this Wednesday in New York City. At that event, Sun also is expected to announce it
      will open up access to Solaris 8 source code. 
      
      Solaris 8 is due to ship in February, around the same time Microsoft is due to ship Windows 2000. 
      
      McNealy: Set it free
      Sun CEO Scott McNealy has been laying the groundwork for the announcement for months by
      telling audiences that software is a service and should be free. McNealy recommended last year that
      the government require Microsoft to make free and open its application program interfaces, rather
      than break itself into pieces, as a preferred remedy in the current Department of Justice vs.
      Microsoft antitrust investigation. 
      
      "Free" is a relative term, however. Sun in December eliminated fees for Java 2 Standard Edition but
      still requires developers to pay for compatibility tests required to maintain their licenses. And Linux
      advocates and other industry watchers have claimed that the Sun Community Source License is not
      as free or open as Linux and other open-source licenses are. 
      
      Sun will pitch Solaris 8 against Microsoft's high-end Windows 2000 package called Windows 2000
      Datacenter, which is in beta and won't be commercially available until midyear, at best. 
      
      Sun in November announced a free early access version of Solaris 8. Sun is positioning Solaris 8 as
      the most scalable and reliable network operating system on the market. Microsoft, which stepped up
      its Windows 2000 marketing campaign within the past week, in anticipation of the Feb. 17 rollout of
      the product, is touting Windows 2000's reliability as its main selling point. 
      
      Zander: We'll never do Linux
      Microsoft's not Sun's only worry. Sun must fend off growing encroachments by Linux, which not
      only is free but also is becoming more robust with help from Sun competitors IBM Corp., Intel Corp.
      and Hewlett-Packard Co. 
      
      Sun President Ed Zander told financial analysts last week that Sun will never adopt Linux as its
      operating system but will instead "put every ounce of R&D we have into Solaris." 
      
      "It amazes me to watch IBM and all those other companies chase Linux the way they did Windows
      NT five years ago," Zander said. 
      
      Sun has been working for over a year to offer Solaris under the Sun Community Source License but
      was stymied by the fact that it didn't own all the intellectual property inside Solaris. SCSL is a quasi
      open-source license that requires developers to return bug fixes to Sun, maintain compatibility and
      pay fees to Sun when they ship binaries based on Sun source code. 
      
      It is unclear how Sun has resolved its intellectual property issues. But that isn't stopping the company
      from working to get on the good side of the open-source community. Sun is sponsoring ApacheCon
      2000, the first official conference of the Apache Software Foundation upcoming in March, and is
      helping with the Apache Foundation's Jakarta and Java Apache projects.

      Your Ears Are Their Business 
      by Noah Shachtman 
      
      3:00 a.m. 25.Jan.2000 PST 
      Even in the car, there's no hiding from marketers' prying eyes -- and ears. 
      
      Companies like concert mega-promoter SFX Entertainment are using a new 
      device to find out what's being played on customers' radios as they pull 
      into venue parking lots. The information is supposed to help businesses 
      gauge the effectiveness of radio advertising campaigns. 

      But the system -- built by Alabama start-up Mobiltrak and installed at 13 
      SFX locations in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta, and elsewhere -- is coming 
      under fire from privacy experts. 

      "Nobody would think that they're being monitored in a parking lot. And 
      nobody would think that there's something of value in listening to a radio 
      station while they're in that parking lot," said Brooklyn Law School 
      professor Paul       Schwartz. But there is something of value here, and 
      the people listening don't get any of that value. They're being polled 
      without knowing they're in a poll." 

      By contrast, when the local supermarket videotapes your weekly grocery 
      run, or Dell monitors your tech support call -- even when SFX tracks your 
      visit to its Web site -- the companies let you know you're being observed. 
      The major       traditional measurement companies, like The Arbitron 
      Company and Nielsen Media Research pay a small stipend to the people they 
      survey. 

      Mobiltrak counters that such efforts aren't needed with their system. 
      Individual cars aren't being tracked, they argue, so there's no invasion 
      of an individual's privacy. 

      "We can't link to a particular automobile. It's just not technically 
      possible," claims Lucius Stone, Mobiltrak's director of sales and 
      marketing. "It's a high-volume, random sample. It can only measure one 
      radio at a time. And there's no       way of telling which radio it is. 
      It's most analogous to a traffic counter." 

      The technology relies on a simple principle: Every FM radio is not only a 
      receiver, but a transmitter, too, emitting the same radio frequency (or 
      "RF") as the station to which it's tuned. That's why airlines ask 
      passengers to turn off their       radios during takeoff and landing: to 
      prevent interference with pilots and air traffic controllers' 
      communications. 

      Mobiltrak picks up these RFs leaked from car radios' oscillators, and 
      counts what stations are being played. 

      Many in the privacy community fear that the temptation to use this 
      information to breach established bounds of discretion will be too great 
      for Mobiltrak to resist. "If it's merely aggregate information, not tied 
      to an individual, then it's       not really a concern," says Jason 
      Catlett, president of consumer privacy group Junkbusters. 

      "But there's an economic incentive to get down to the individual level, 
      and a precedent for using the same technology to look at the individual 
      householder." 

      Like Mobiltrak, the British Broadcasting Company scrutinizes RF emissions. 
      By law, British residents must have licenses for the television sets they 
      own. 

      
      The BBC deploys vans equipped with oscillation detectors to residential 
      neighborhoods to enforce the law. The vans track which homes are equipped 
      with TV sets, and then checks again to make sure that the residents have 
      licenses for the TVs. 

      "TV license enforcement is the main reason that women end up in prison in 
      the UK," University of Cambridge cryptographer Ross Anderson wrote in an 
      email. "The detector vans operate during the day, so when they find an 
      unlicensed       set and knock on the door, it's usually a woman who 
      answers. A fine of 1,000 pounds is imposed, and if she can't pay it she 
      goes to jail." 

      What's more, Anderson and his colleagues have shown that the U.S. National 
      Security Agency and others have long been able to use RF emissions to 
      reconstruct what's on a computer monitor. 

      But this invasive operation is a far cry from what Mobiltrak is doing, say 
      some media business insiders. 

      "I haven't met one person in the radio industry that's the least bit 
      concerned about this from a privacy standpoint, as it currently exists," 
      reports Ron Rodrigues, editor-in-chief of the trade magazine Radio & 
      Records. 

      Still, Rodrigues acknowledges, "We seem to be in a period when disclosure 
      is becoming more important. With Mobiltrak, there may have to be some sort 
      of disclosure that people are being monitored, like radar on the 
      California       highways." 

      Schwartz, the Brooklyn law professor, believes something more than 
      notification may be in order. 

      "We can collect all this information in new ways. But who should get the 
      benefits of this information?" he asks. "Is it like minerals on the deep 
      sea bed outside the continental shelf, exploitable for whoever can get to 
      it first? Or should       we return some of the benefits in more direct 
      ways to the people who created it?"

      Activists charge DoubleClick double cross

      Web users have lost privacy with the drop of a cookie, they say

      By Will Rodger, USATODAY.com

      Say goodbye to anonymity on the Web.

      DoubleClick Inc., the Internet's largest advertising company, has begun
      tracking Web users by name and address as they move from one Web site to
      the next, USATODAY.com has learned.

      The practice, known as profiling, gives
      marketers the ability to know the
      household, and in many cases the precise
      identity, of the person visiting any one of
      the 11,500 sites that use DoubleClick's
      ad-tracking "cookies."

      What made such profiling possible was
      DoubleClick's purchase in June of Abacus
      Direct Corp., a direct-marketing services
      company that maintains a database of
      names, addresses and retail purchasing
      habits of 90% of American households.

      With the help of its online partners,
      DoubleClick can now correlate the Abacus
      database of names with people's Internet
      activities.

      Company spokeswoman Jennifer Blum
      said Tuesday that only about a dozen sites
      are participating now. But she
      acknowledged that DoubleClick would like
      all its partner sites to participate.

      DoubleClick defends the practice, insisting
      that it allows better targeting of online ads
      -- and thus makes consumers' online
      experiences at once more relevant and
      more profitable for advertisers. The
      company calls it "personalization."

      Consumer advocates have another term for it: privacy invasion.

      After being informed of DoubleClick's actions, several privacy activists said
      they would file a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission next
      month.

      "This is a blatant bait-and-switch trick," says Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Inc.,
      an Internet-privacy consultancy. "For four years they have said (their
      services) don’t identify you personally, and now they're admitting they are
      going to identify you."

      To tie Doubleclick's "anonymous" records of your surfing habits to its Abacus
      database, it needs only the cooperation of another site that can identify you
      positively.

      Futuristic though that sounds, positive identification is actually simple.
      DoubleClick need only tie your cookie to another one placed by a site that
      ships you something through the mail, or one which requires registration.

      To do that:

        DoubleClick sends a cookie to your browser and gives it a unique ID
      number.

        Doubleclick sends the same ID number on to the site that knows who you
      are.

        That company then sends back the data that DoubleClick needs to look you
      up in the Abacus database.

      And voila -- DoubleClick knows who you are, too.

      The combination of DoubleClick's cookie-derived information -- more than
      100 million files -- with Abacus' database on the purchasing habits of 90
      million households means the vast majority of Web-connected Americans will
      likely lose their online anonymity, says David Banisar, deputy director of
      Privacy International. 

      DoubleClick's Blum said she was not sure whether surfing habits tracked by
      DoubleClick before Abacus data are merged will be included in future
      profiles.

      DoubleClick executives maintain they still give users who don't want to be
      tracked a chance to opt out.

      "That person will receive notice that their personal information is being
      gathered," DoubleClick Senior Vice President and Abacus unit chief Jonathan
      Shapiro says flatly.

      Yet, that chance to opt out comes only in the form of a few lines of text
      placed in the privacy policies of participating Web sites. Since those policies
      are often buried two or three levels down, online consumers will seldom know
      what is being done with their personal information in the first place, let alone
      that they may opt out, activists say.

      "That is not permission," Banisar says. "That is fraudulent on its face."

      Catlett, Banisar and the Electronic Privacy Information Center plan to file a
      complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by Feb. 16.

      They say they will charge that DoubleClick has duped consumers by
      suggesting the company's technology lets them remain anonymous. They
      expect to enlist a wide array of consumer groups to back their position.

      Further troubling to privacy advocates is DoubleClick's refusal to say which
      Internet sites are furnishing them the registration rolls that DoubleClick needs
      to link once-anonymous cookies to names, addresses, phone numbers and
      catalog purchases.

      "The fact that DoubleClick is not disclosing the names of the companies who
      are feeding them consumers' names is a shameful hypocrisy," Catlett says.
      "They are trying to protect the confidentiality of the violators of privacy."

      Shapiro Tuesday bristled at Catlett's characterization. Any company that uses
      data from the Abacus database to target Internet ads must disclose it online,
      he says.

      Moreover, he adds, DoubleClick itself would hand over to privacy advocates
      the list of participating companies if it could. But as in many lines of business,
      partners frown when their relationships are disclosed without their permission,
      he says.

      "If they all bought a billboard and said they work with us, that would be great,"
      Shapiro says.

      The controversy over DoubleClick began last summer, when the company
      announced it was buying Abacus Direct in a deal valued at more than $1
      billion.

      Privacy experts had feared that DoubleClick would begin merging the two
      databases at some point. But they say they were unaware that DoubleClick
      had begun its profiling practice late last year.

      Before its Abacus purchase, DoubleClick had made its money by targeting
      banner advertisements in less direct ways.

      DoubleClick ad-serving computers, for instance, check the Internet addresses
      of people who visit participating sites. Thus, people in their homes may see
      ads different from those seen by workers at General Motors, or a
      machine-tool company in Ohio.

      Every time viewers see or click on those banners, DoubleClick adds that fact
      to individual dossiers it builds on them with the help of the cookies it drops on
      users' hard drives.

      Those dossiers, in turn, help DoubleClick target ads more precisely still,
      increasing their relevance to consumers and reducing unnecessary repetition.

      Those cookies remained anonymous to DoubleClick until now.

      Being tracked as they move around the Web "doesn’t measure up to people's
      expectation on the Net," says Robert Smith, publisher of the newsletter
      Privacy Journal. "They don't think that their physical locations, their names
      will be combined with what they do on the Internet. If they (DoubleClick)
      want to do that they have to expose that plan to the public and have it
       discussed."

      Privacy fears raised by DoubleClick database plans 
      By Courtney Macavinta
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      January 25, 2000, 8:10 p.m. PT 
 
      Having sealed its purchase of a direct marketing company, DoubleClick has 
      begun signing up sites to create a network that will tie Web surfers' 
      travels with their personal information and shopping habits--online and 
      off.

      The leading Web advertising company plans to build a database of consumer 
      profiles that will include each user's "name, address, retail, catalog and 
      online purchase histories, and demographic data," according to the 
      company's       new privacy policy. The database, which the company says 
      will only be seen by DoubleClick, is intended to help members of its 
      budding, U.S.-based Abacus Alliance perfect their target marketing.

      The move comes a little over a month after New York-based DoubleClick 
      completed its $1.7 billion acquisition of Abacus Direct and in the wake of 
      the Federal Trade Commission's November probe on the growing trend of 
      online                              profiling. Privacy advocates, who 
      protested the deal from the start, have unsuccessfully tried to get the 
      FTC to review the implications of the merger because they say it means one 
      thing for consumers: less privacy.

                             Until recently, DoubleClick's policy was to not 
                             correlate personal information with its 100 million 
                             cookies, which are scattered worldwide. But the new 
                             database will rely on the cookies, which the                              
                             company places on Net users' computers to record 
                             surfing habits and display pertinent advertising. 
                             Net users aren't informed when they are given a 
                             DoubleClick cookie unless their browser is preset 
                             to do so, but they can "opt out" through the 
                             company's Web site.

                             The more than 11,500 sites that belong to 
                             DoubleClick's network could feed into the new 
                             database, which will correlate with the personal 
                             information in Abacus' existing database of more 
                             than 2                              billion 
                             consumer catalog transactions. The rollout was 
                             first reported by USA Today.

                             DoubleClick says that not all of the sites using 
                             its ad technology will join the alliance.

                             "They have to somehow have something to give to be 
                             a member of this," said Jennifer Blum, 
                             DoubleClick's spokeswoman.

                             The new database works like this: In the past, if a 
                             person named Jane Doe had a DoubleClick cookie that 
                             detected that she loved golf-related sites, the 
                             company could show her ads for sports-related       
                             content. But in the future, if the same surfer 
                             gives personal information to a member of the 
                             Abacus Alliance, DoubleClick will know a lot more 
                             about her: that her name is Jane Doe, and that she 
                             used to buy sweaters and pants via Company X's 
                             catalog but hasn't done so for years. However, Jane 
                             did buy a coat online last month. Now DoubleClick 
                             can advise Company X to target Jane with Net ads 
                             instead of sending her a catalog.

      "Yes, of course this will be done," Blum said. "The goal here is to match 
      up the information."

      DoubleClick says that the focus of the alliance is to eliminate junk mail 
      and to give consumers information about products they want. But privacy 
      advocates charge that the combined companies are finally acting on their 
      potential       to create one of the most extensive consumer profiles 
      ever.

      "Privacy advocates have been saying for years that marketers will turn the 
      Net into a gigantic data-gathering machine for junk mail, telemarketing 
      and advertising; now that machine is working," said Jason Catlett, founder 
      of       Junkbusters, a clearinghouse for privacy-protection measures.

      DoubleClick contends that before members of the Abacus Alliance put 
      information into the new database, they must inform consumers.

      "Going forward, when a consumer puts in personal information to a Web site 
      that is a member of this alliance, they will be told that the information 
      will be shared with other parties," Blum said. "Consumers are given notice 
      and       choice if they want to opt out."

      Blum said that once companies join the alliance they also must give Net 
      users notice that their information is going to be shared--even if that 
      person has shared information with the Web site before.

      But privacy watchdogs say an opt-out policy is not fair to consumers who 
      may not realize that when a company says their information is being shared 
      with a "third party," it's really the potentially enormous DoubleClick 
      database.

      "DoubleClick is trying to characterize this as choice, but its practice is
      based on opt out, not opt in," Catlett said. "We said this would happen--
      behold it quietly has."

      DVD hacker arrested in Norway By Reuters January 25, 2000 11:30 AM PT URL:

      A Norwegian teenager has been charged with distributing a software program 
      that enables users to       make unauthorized copies of DVD movies, police 
      said on Tuesday. 

      Jon Johansen is thought to have developed a program "that breaks the 
      entire copyright protection of       the DVD (digital versatile disc) 
      system," said Inger Marie Sunde, a senior public prosecutor at Norway's 
      economic crime unit. 

      "He is charged with breaking intellectual property laws," said Sunde. 
      Johansen's father was also       charged in the case, since the teen 
      posted the source code on a Web site owned by his father. 

      Johansen refuted the charges in a CNN Norway article, saying that he has 
      done nothing wrong. The       16-year-old student stressed that the 
      program he and others on the Internet created was only meant for playing 
      DVDs on computers running the Linux operating system. 

      Previously, when the movie industry contacted him and asked him to remove 
      the source code, he       complied so as to avoid a lawsuit. Despite his 
      cooperation, the movie industry is suing anyway. 

      Major Hollywood studios, which use an encryption scheme on their DVDs to 
      prevent unauthorized       copying, have already taken legal action 
      against three people in the United States who displayed Johansen's program 
      on their Web sites. 

      Computer equipment confiscated       His program, known as DeCSS, is 
      thought to have been the first program posted to the Internet that 
      resulted from reverse engineering the DVD copy protection system. 

      Norwegian law firm Simonsen Musaeus said in a statement it had reported 
      Johansen and his father,       Per Johansen, to the police earlier this 
      month on behalf of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a lobby group for 
      seven major Hollywood studios. 

      Sunde told Reuters police had questioned Jon Johansen late on Monday, 
      searched his home and       confiscated computer equipment. 

      "He is a suspect, and we found that there were reasonable grounds for a 
      search," she added. 

      Other sites reported that two computers, a cell phone and some CDs had 
      been taken by police. In       addition, Johansen had to inform police of 
      all his passwords. 

      Simonsen Musaeus acts on behalf of U.S. license agency DVD Copy Control 
      Association and the       MPA, which represents major Hollywood studios 
      such as Sony's Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Seagram Co. unit 
      Universal Studios Inc. and Warner Bros., a Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX) 
      unit. 

      A U.S. district court in New York on Friday ordered three people to remove 
      Johansen's DeCSS       program from their Web sites after the MPA filed a 
      complaint. 

      DVDs store sound and pictures digitally on an optical disc with a storage 
      capacity considerably
      greater than that of a regular CD-ROM.

      Teen charged in connection with DVD cracking tool 
      By Courtney Macavinta
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      January 25, 2000, 5:00 p.m. PT 
 
      update Norwegian police questioned and charged a 16-year-old student who 
      sent the U.S. movie industry into a frenzy when he helped create a program 
      that breaks the encryption on DVDs that spread like wildfire on the Net.

      In an interview today, Jon Johansen said that police raided his house 
      yesterday to collect evidence stemming from allegations that he violated 
      trade secrets to create a program called DeCSS, which cracks the security 
      code in the       DVD Content Scrambling System. That, in turn, allows 
      people to view digital movies through unauthorized players, such as 
      computers running the Linux operating system.

      Police seized several computers, a Nokia cellular phone and some CDs and 
      then charged Johansen with breaking security to gain unauthorized access 
      to data or software. He and his father, whose company's Web site was used       
      to post the program, also were charged with copyright infringement.

      The son and father face two to three years in prison and fines if 
      convicted.

      Johansen said that several people developed the program to allow users to 
      play DVDs on various PCs. The effort is described on OpenDVD.org.

      "Our goal was to make it possible to watch DVDs under the Linux operating 
      system," Johansen wrote in an email.

      In the wake of the release of DeCSS, the film industry has vigorously 
      tried to stamp out the program. The Motion Picture Association of America 
      (MPAA) filed a lawsuit in New York against individuals who allegedly 
      posted the       program on their Web sites; the organization also is a 
      founder of the DVD Copy Control Association, which filed a similar lawsuit 
      in California.

      The judges in both cases have issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting 
      the defendants from posting the code through the duration of the trials. 

      But Johansen argues that the MPAA has misled the public into believing 
      that his program allows people to more easily copy DVDs.

      "The (motion picture industry) is claiming that their encryption was copy 
      protection," he said. "The encryption is in fact only playback protection, 
      which gives the movie industry a monopoly on who gets to make DVD 
      players."

      The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is defending the parties in both 
      cases, argues that people have a right to discuss the "the technical 
      insecurity of DVD" and demonstrate their points through reverse 
      engineering.

      The DVD association was formed in December of last year by companies that 
      also are members of the MPAA, the Business Software Alliance and the 
      Electronic Industries Alliance to license out the DVD Content Scrambling
      System.

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 25, 2000

      Norwegian Teen Becomes Industry's Latest Test Case

      Motion Picture Industry Continues Campaign Against Open Source Software 
      Community Over DVD Security

      San Francisco -- The home of a Norwegian teenager was raided by the police 
      today acting at the behest of the motion picture industry intent on 
      suppressing discussion and distribution of DVD-viewing software developed 
      outside of industry's monopoly on such       software. This action follows 
      closely three lawsuits filed by the industry in California, New York, and 
      Connecticut against numerous individuals and organizations including 
      coders, journalists, an ISP, and numerous Netizens. 

      "The motion picture industry is using its substantial resources to 
      intimidate the technical community into surrendering rights of free 
      expression and fair use of information," said Tara Lemmey, Executive 
      Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "These actions are       a 
      wake-up call for the technical community. The process of 
      reverse-engineering and public posting and commenting of code that the 
      MPAA is attempting to suppress is fundamental to the development of 
      commercial and open source software." 

      Sixteen-year-old Jon Johansen, who was among the first to post the DeCSS 
      program that allows users to view DVDs on computers not using Windows or 
      Macintosh operating systems, had his computer and cellular telephone 
      seized by police. Both he and his father       were questioned at length 
      by the police and have been threatened with indictment for posting the 
      code, which the motion picture industry claims was illegally created. 

      According to several international legal experts contacted by EFF, the 
      industry is relying on untested legal theory in its case against Johansen. 
      With regard to the industry's use of Norwegian Criminal Code sect 145(2), 
      a provision making it illegal to "break a security       arrangement" to 
      access data, experts agree that it is not clear whether it can apply to a 
      situation where someone breaks a security system to access material on a 
      device of which that person is the owner. The second charge of 
      contributory copyright infringement, as likely to be argued in this case, 
      has also not been before the Norwegian courts. 

      The actions being brought by the motion picture industry have attracted 
      the attention of the Global Internet Liberty Campaign (GILC), a coalition 
      of over 50 international civil liberties and human rights groups. "We 
      believe that intellectual property owners should not be       allowed to 
      expand their property rights at the expense of free speech, legal 
      reverse-engineering of software programs for interoperability reasons, and 
      discussions of technical and scientific issues on the Internet," wrote 
      GILC members in a statement released last week. "DVD-CCA's lawsuit is in 
      direct conflict with United Nations human rights accords and the First 
      Amendment of the United States Constitution." (EFF is a GILC member.) 

      EFF will continue fighting the industry's attempts to censor Web sites

      Foreigners Must Disclose Internet Secrets to Beijing Soon 

      Encryption Rules For Firms Threaten Growth of the Web 

      By MATT FORNEY 

      BEIJING -- The Chinese government is about to require foreign firms to 
      reveal one of their deepest secrets -- the type of software used to 
      protect sensitive data transfers over the Internet. 

      By next Monday, foreign and Chinese companies must register the type of 
      commercial encryption software they use. Such software makes it more 
      difficult for hackers -- or governments -- to eavesdrop on electronic 
      messages. Eventually, the companies must provide       details of 
      employees who use the software, making it easier for authorities to 
      monitor personal and commercial use of the Internet. 

      In addition, the regulations bar Chinese companies from buying products 
      containing foreign-designed encryption software. A strict interpretation 
      would include such products as Netscape browsers or Microsoft Outlook, as 
      well as the more complex equipment vital for       conducting business 
      securely over the Internet. 

      The rules are the latest sign of Beijing's unease with the Internet, which 
      has been used by dissidents and members of the banned sect Falun Dafa to 
      communicate and spread information. Authorities have tried to block sites 
      and require users to register, but the number       of users continues to 
      rise and now totals about nine million. 

      The new rules, however, could slow the Internet's groswth here. If 
      companies offering electronic business services worry that the Chinese 
      government is monitoring their transmissions, they could relocate outside 
      China's borders, where they wouldn't have to reveal       the type of 
      encryption software they use. 

      "This is sending the wrong message to foreign investors," says Patrick 
      Powers director of China operations for the U.S.China Business Council, 
      who adds that "the foreign business community is deeply concerned." 

      So is the U.S. government, which recently approved the export of many 
      types of encryption software. Commerce Secretary William Daley plans to 
      raise the issue with senior Chinese officials this week in Switzerland 
      during the annual World Economic Forum. 

      China revealed the new regulations on Oct. 15, in an order published in 
      the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily. It demanded 
      that "foreign organizations or individuals using encryption products or 
      equipment containing encryption technology in       China must apply" for 
      permission by Jan. 31. It exempted diplomatic missions. 

      After meeting that application deadline, foreign companies must fill out a 
      second round of paperwork. According to a copy of the forms, companies 
      must name employees who are using encryption software and give the 
      location of the computers they use, as well as       their e-mail 
      addresses and telephone numbers. 

      The order adds that "no organization or individual can sell foreign 
      commercial encryption products." 

      If enforced, the regulations would certainly complicate the development of 
      the Internet in China. Most of the routers and servers that compose the 
      nerve center of China's networks come from foreign companies. and often 
      include encrypted software to ensure secure       communications. The 
      rules could force delays in network construction as Chinese software 
      companies struggle to expand their encryption services. 

      "If IBM or Hewlett-Packard wants to sell an e-commerce Web server to 
      China, it might have to isolate which parts relate to security" and then 
      find Chinese companies to write the software, says Jay Hu, director of the 
      Beijing branch of the U.S. Information       Technology Office, an 
      industry research group. "I don't think Chinese companies have that 
      ability." Neither International Business Machines Corp. nor Hewlett 
      Packard Co. would comment. 

      The encryption regulations could apply to just about anything that 
      transmits sensitive digital information, including cell phones, Internet 
      browsers and e-mail software. Microsoft's Outlook program uses low-level 
      encryption, and the company might have to seek Chinese       partners to 
      design it anew. Alick Yan, a spokesman for Microsoft (China) Co., said 
      it's too early to gauge the potential impact. 

      The government has created a new agency to enforce the regulations, but it 
      isn't clear who controls the body. "We report to the State Council," which 
      is China's cabinet, explained director Yang Lingjun, who declined to 
      comment further. However many
      foreign-company officials, speaking anonymously, say they're afraid the
      organization is staffed by the Ministry of State Security, China's secret police.

      NEC Corp said on Wednesday it developed a new
      encryption technology to protect data on the Internet
      and other networks. The new technology,

      NEC develops encryption technology for networks      
      TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - NEC Corp said on Wednesday it developed a new encryption
      technology to prevent hackers from tapping into business-to-consumer exchanges on 
      the Internet and other networks.      
      
      The new technology, Cipherunicorn-A, creates several false keys in addition to the
      true encryption key, making it especially difficult for potential intruders to crack,
      NEC said.      
      
      The technology also features a dynamic encryption code that can use key lengths of
      128, 192 or 256 bits, offering higher levels of security than conventional methods
      with a fixed length of 128 bits, an NEC spokesman said.      
      
      The electronics maker aims to develop software utilising the new technology as soon
      as possible, he said, although he gave no specific time frame.      
      
      Worries about Internet hackers were heightened in Japan this week after humiliating
      raids on government Web sites, in which hackers linked one to a pornographic site 
      and attacked the nation's war record on another.

      Bad News for Hackers, Crackers

      Worldtalk, UPS Combine Powerful Security Solutions to
      Safeguard Critical Information 

      SANTA CLARA, Calif. and ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 24, 2000 --
      Worldtalk and UPS today announced the launch of a cutting edge
      security product combining industry-leading solutions to protect critical
      business information on a company's Web site or in transit via e-mail. 

      The new product, WorldSecure/Mail for UPS OnLine Courier,
      integrates Worldtalk's award-winning WorldSecure products with UPS
      Document Exchange for a lethal one-two punch against hackers or
      crackers looking to gain access to confidential information on the Web. 

      Worldtalk's award-winning WorldSecure products, based on the
      WorldSecure policy management platform, enable organizations to
      define and enforce content security policies for e-mail and the Web.
      Worldtalk's products provide organizations with the ability to reduce
      corporate liability, secure intellectual property, guarantee confidentiality
      of communications with trading partners and protect network
      resources. WorldSecure/Mail ensures the confidentiality and privacy of
      Internet communication, protects information assets, and blocks viruses
      and SPAMs. 

      UPS Document Exchange guards sensitive information in transit
      between one organization's server and another's. Armed with 128-bit
      encryption on the server and optional password protection, UPS
      Document Exchange offers secure, trackable electronic delivery of
      anything that can be contained in a digital file, including documents,
      images and software, along with definitive proof of delivery. 

      Combined, the two products allow an organization to establish criteria
      by which specific types of sensitive documents or information can leave
      its network only via UPS Document Exchange - and are automatically
      converted into a secure UPS Document Exchange digital package
      before sending. Meanwhile other, less sensitive information can still be
      sent by conventional e-mail. Both companies will sell the integrated
      solution. 

      As an added security measure, UPS is putting its money where its
      mouth is by offering companies up to $100,000 for business losses as
      part of its customer assurance plan when using UPS Document
      Exchange. 

      Solutions that protect the security of sensitive documents become even
      more important as businesses communicate more frequently over the
      Internet. By the year 2001, 35 percent of business documents - 21
      million per day - will move via the Internet, according to the Aberdeen
      Group. 

      "With the combination of WorldSecure and UPS Document Exchange,
      organizations can ensure their sensitive documents won't be floating
      around unprotected in the wildly unsecure world of e-mail," said Kim
      Marchner, Group Manager for UPS Document Exchange Marketing.
      "An organization has the power to define which types of documents -
      like prospectuses or confidential reports from its legal department - will
      be required to carry the protection of Document Exchange when
      leaving the server." 

      An important feature of UPS Document Exchange is its ease of use by
      both sender and receiver. Unlike unwieldy encryption programs that
      require the sender and recipient to have the same type of encryption
      software, Document Exchange requires only that the sender have a
      standard e-mail package, and the receiver have a standard Web
      browser. 

      "Organizations want to leverage the economy, efficiency and ubiquity
      of Internet e-mail," said Jim Heisch, President and CFO, Worldtalk.
      "Solutions like WorldSecure/Mail and UPS Document Exchange allow
      them to simply and efficiently define and enforce policies that ensure
      the safe use of their e-mail systems." 

      UPS Document Exchange, launched in June 1998, is a secure Internet
      communications service for business-to-business commerce based on
      Tumbleweed Communication Corp.'s Integrated Messaging Exchange
      (IME technology. Tumbleweed Integrated Messaging Exchange (IME)
      is a set of products and services that leverage the Internet and existing
      e-mail to create a secure, trackable online communications channel.
      Thousands of businesses are currently using UPS Document Exchange
      to securely move critical documents, images and software over the
      'Net.

      The popular MP3 trading software, Napster, may have a
      security hole. Internet security consultant Richard
      Smith, has found that Napster logs users' IP numbers.
      This information could be used to help copyright owners
      identify and try to prosecute Napster users who may be
      illegally trading music files.

     Security problem discovered in Napster music software 
     By Paul Festa
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     January 26, 2000, 3:30 p.m. PT 

     Those who use Napster's popular software for trading digital music
     files may not be as anonymous as they think they are.

     Napster's program, which lets users see which digital music files
     other users possess, also exposes their Internet Protocol addresses,
     according to Internet security consultant Richard Smith. IP addresses
     are unique strings of numbers that identify users' computers on the 
     Internet.

     That could help copyright owners identify and try to prosecute Napster 
     users who may be illegally swapping music.

     "Napster has a problem," he said. "It's serious in the sense that they
     have exposed their users to legal risk."

     Napster acknowledged the problem but minimized its importance, saying
     that IP addresses are not easily procurable except by experienced 
     network experts or hackers, and that individual IP addresses are more
     often than not obscured behind corporate or Internet service provider
     firewalls and proxy servers.

     "With our product, when you transfer from point to point, the IP address
     is available to you," said Eddie Kessler, Napster's vice president of 
     engineering. "It's something that a hacker might have access to. In most
     cases, tracing an individual user would not be possible, but it is possible."

     Smith noted that IP addresses are traceable to individuals about a third of
     the time.

     Napster said it is working on hiding its users' IP addresses.

     "We're evaluating various technologies that would provide an even higher
     level of security to our users," Kessler said. "Specifically, they would
     not make your IP address visible to the person who was downloading content
     to you."

     Kessler would not say when the company expects to implement those changes.

     The trend in digital music copyright enforcement has been to target companies
     and larger institutions like universities rather than individuals. Napster 
     itself is the target of a lawsuit by the Recording Industry Association of
     America (RIAA), which accused the company of "facilitating piracy" through
     its forum for letting online users trade unauthorized music files directly
     from their PCs.

     Another company under legal fire from the RIAA is music Web site MP3.com.

     Smith said he discovered the Napster security flaw after examining the 
     documentation posted to the Web this week by Stanford University senior
     David Weekly. Weekly's post irked Napster, which asked him to pull the page.
     Weekly declined and encouraged the page's dissemination.

     Today Kessler said the matter with Weekly will rest there.

     "We're not going to play the DVD DeCSS game and try to shut it down," 
     Kessler said, referring to the recent controversy over a piece of software
     called DeCSS that lets users circumvent copyright controls on DVDs. The 
     Motion Picture Association of America has gone after sites to force them
     to take down copies of the tool.

     (Lets face it, if the fedz want to shut you down, you're toast they just
     don't put this on a priority level high enough to assign their limited
     man power to. There are bigger fish to fry, hackers aren't the only users
     of sniffers and anyone can arp -a netstat -a to see active connections...)

          208.184.216.222

          ports: 4444,5555,6666,7777,8888

          Interesting. Looks like their general strategy is to cluster in units
          of 5 IP block (corresponding to grouped rackmounts?) with 5 sets of 
          port numbers for process redundancy on the servers. I bet they started
          with GlobalCenter, but decided to move in with Abovenet at their SJC2 
          colocation facility, now that they have their stuff together. That's 
          where the organized clusters are. The Globalcenter unit looks like 
          it's not in California, but connected via an OC48 line to 
          Globalcenter's Herdon, VA node. (Thanks to Ben Byer!)

          When you're requesting a file from another client, and they ask 
          you to connect to port ZERO, they don't want you to pull the file
          from them; they want to push the file to you directly. If you 
          receive this, send a 0-length F4 (Give Push Goahead) to the 
          Napster server, and the other client will connect to you.

      napster messages
      ================
      
      by drscholl@users.sourceforge.net
      February 1, 2000
      
      0.  Forward
      
      This is meant to be an open specification.  If you find errors or know of
      additional functionality not described hereafter, please send me email.  It
      benefits the entire community to have a complete and accurate protocol
      specification.  Not only does it allow for clients to be developed for any
      platform, but also decreases the strain on the server having to parse out
      bad client messages.
      
      Disclaimer: the following information was gathered by analyzing the protocol
      between the linux nap client and may not resemble the official windows client
      protocol.
      
      1.  Client-Server protocol
      
      each message to/from the server is in the form of
      <length><type><data>
      where <length> and <type> are 2 bytes each.  <length> specifies the length in
      bytes of the <data> portion of the message.  Be aware that <length> and <type>
      appear to be in little-endian format (least significant byte goes first).  For
      example, in the C language you would encode the number 1 as
              const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x01, 0x00 };
      and 256 would be encoded as
              const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x00, 0x01 };
      [The above is for illustrative purposes only, there are much quicker ways to
      actually encode a number. -ed]
      
      Note that in many cases, strings are passed as double-quoted entries.  For
      example, filenames and client id strings are always sent as
              "random band - generic cowboy song.mp3"
      or
              "nap v0.8"
      Where required, double quotes are used in the description of the messages
      below.
      
      Some additional information about use of quotes inside of quotes:
      > The answer is, no, it doesn't do escaping of quotes.  If you try searching
      > for the phrase 'a "quoted" string' on the windows client, you get no songs
      > found, and "invalid search request" printed in yellow in your console
      > window.  (don't know what code that is, sorry.)
      >
      > and no wonder-- a little birdie told me that the client sends this:
      >
      > FILENAME CONTAINS "a "quoted" string" MAX_RESULTS 100
      
      [contributed by Ben Byer <bbyer@rice.edu>.  -ed]
      
      Note that unlike the IRC protocol, each line does NOT end in \r\n.  The
      <length> field specifies exactly how much data you should read.
      
      2.  Message Types
      
      The following section describes the format of the <data> section for each
      specific message type.  Each field is denoted with <>.  The fields in a
      message are separated by a single space character (ASCII 32).  Where
      appropriate, examples of the <data> section for each message are given.
      
      <type> can be one of the following (converted to big-endian):
      
      0       error message [SERVER]
      
              <message>
      
      2       client login message [CLIENT]
      
              <username> <password> <port> "<client-info>" <link-type>
      
              <port> is the port the client is listening on for data transfer.  if
                      this value is 0, it means that the client is behind a firewall
                      and can only push files outward.  it is expected that requests
                      for downloads be made using the 500 message (see below)
              <client-info> is a string containing the client version info
              <link-type> is an integer indicating the client's bandwidth
                      0  unknown
                      1  14.4 kbps
                      2  28.8 kpbs
                      3  33.6 kbps
                      4  56.7 kbps
                      5  64K ISDN
                      6  128K ISDN
                      7  Cable
                      8  DSL
                      9  T1
                      10 T3 or greater
                      
              Example:
      
              foo badpass 6699 "nap v0.8" 3
      
      3       login ack [SERVER]
      
              <email>
      
              the server sends this message to the client after a succesful
              login (2).  If the nick is registered, the <email> address given at
              registration time is returned.  If the nick is not registered, a
              dummy value is returned.
      
      4       ??? [CLIENT]
      
              <n>
      
              the latest napster v2.0beta5a sends this prior to login.
      
      6       alternate login format [CLIENT]
      
              this message is used when logging in for the first time after
              registering (0x07) a nick
      
              <nick> <pass> <port> "<client-info>" <linkspeed> <email-address>
      
              note: this message is similar to the 0x02 message, with the addition    
              of <email-address> on the end
      
              Example:
      
              foo foo 6699 "nap v0.8" 3 email@here.com
      
      7       client registration message [CLIENT]
      
              <nick>
      
              this message is sent to create an account
      
              response to this message is one of 8, 9 or 10
      
      8       registration success [SERVER]
      
              the server sends this when the clients request to register a new
              nickname has succeeded.
      
      9       nickname already registered [SERVER]
      
              the server sends this message when the nickname the client has
              requested has already been registered by another user
      
      10      invalid nickname [SERVER]
      
              this server sends this message when the client attempts register
              an invalid nickname [what defines an invalid nickname? -ed]
      
      11      ??? [CLIENT]
      
              [returns "parameters are unparsable" -ed]

              "<filename>" <md5> <size> <bitrate> <frequency> <time>
      
              <md5> see section "MD5"
              <size> is bytes
              <bitrate> is kbps
              <frequency> is hz
              <time> is seconds
              
              Example:
      
              "generic band - generic song.mp3" b92870e0d41bc8e698cf2f0a1ddfeac7 443332 128 44100 60
      
      102     remove file [CLIENT]
      
              <filename>

          [FILENAME CONTAINS "artist name"] MAX_RESULTS <max> [FILENAME CONTAINS
      "song"] [LINESPEED <compare> <link-type>] [BITRATE <compare> "<br>"] [FREQ
      <compare> "<freq>"]
      
              The artist name and the song name are, obviously, treated
                      the same by the server; confirm this for yourself
                      on the windows client.
      
              max is a number; if it is greater than 100, the server will
                      only return 100 results.
      
              <compare> is one of the following:
                      "AT LEAST" "AT BEST" "EQUAL TO"
      
              <link-type> see 0x02 (client login) for a description
      
              <br> is a number, in kbps
      
              <freq> is a sample frequency, in Hz
      
              The windows client filters by ping time inside the client.
                      It pretty much has to, and it's easy to see the
                      result by setting ping time to at best 100 ms or
                      so, and max search terms to 50.  You'll get back
                      like 3 results, but the client will still tell you
                      that it found "50 results".
      
              Examples:
                      FILENAME CONTAINS "Sneaker Pimps" MAX_RESULTS 75 FILENAME
                               CONTAINS "tesko suicide" BITRATE "AT LEAST" "128"
      
                      MAX_RESULTS 100 FILENAME CONTAINS "Ventolin" LINESPEED
                              "EQUAL TO" 10

              [Commentary: this message causes problems if you consider linking
              servers together.  With the current one server situation, the server
              just rewrites the message it receives with the name of the client that
              sent it and passes it to the recipient client.  However, in the case
              where the recipient and sender are not on the same server, there is
              loss of information without encapsulating it.  It would have been
              better to put both the sender and recipient because if the servers
              are ever linked they will have to make a new message type for this
              situation.  -ed]

      matches at 300,032 bytes, but no correlation has been drawn as to when that
      happens.  The speculation at this point is that it might have to do with
      the existence of a ID3v2 tag, or perhaps the file was sampled at 48kHz...?
      
      Note: the linux nap client (versions 0.7 - 0.9) seem to hash exactly 300,000
      bytes, which is NOT what the official windows client does.

      DVD lawyers spill "secret" code 
      By Evan Hansen
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      January 26, 2000, 4:10 p.m. PT 
 
      A digital rights licensing group seeking to ban the controversial DVD 
      decryption program known as DeCSS has shut down yet another potential 
      distributor: a California state courthouse.

      Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge William Elfving today placed under 
      seal source code submitted in a trade secrets case filed by the DVD Copy 
      Control Association against 72 Web sites and individuals earlier this 
      month. 

      The order for now erases an embarrassing gaffe by attorneys for the group, 
      which is seeking to stop the defendants from publishing or linking to the 
      very same program on the Internet. It was unclear whether the apparent 
      slip-up       could have deeper consequences for the case. 

      Court papers are generally considered public documents, available to 
      anyone for the asking. Although parties in a case can file a request with 
      the court to make sensitive documents off-limits, the Copy Control 
      Association's       attorneys apparently filed the request only after 
      openly submitting the source code as a supporting document to the 
      complaint. 

      As a result, the document has been legally available at the courthouse for 
      the past two weeks. But the document was lifted from the court and made 
      available on the Internet at the Cryptome.org Web site. 

      The association's lead attorney in the case, Jeffrey Kessler of the New 
      York law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, called today's ruling a non-event. 

      "Everyone knew (the exhibit) would be placed under seal," he said. Kessler 
      declined to elaborate on how the exhibit was introduced in the case, 
      saying only that after today's decision the issue "has no further 
      significance       whatsoever." 

      But lawyers for the defense and intellectual property attorneys uninvolved 
      in the case said the gaffe could hurt the plaintiffs' case. 

      "It sounds like the plaintiffs goofed," said Judy Jennison, head of 
      Perkins Coie's Silicon Valley intellectual property litigation practice 
      and an experienced trade secrets trial attorney who is not involved in the 
      case. "If they didn't file it       under seal, they could be seen to have 
      given up the their (trade secret) rights." 

      Attorney Allonn Levy, who is representing defendant Andrew Bunner in the 
      case, agreed. Even if the document was inadvertently made public, he said, 
      it could jeopardize the trade secret status of the material. 

      "Anyone could have copied out the trade secrets from the file before it 
      was sealed," he said, although he added that he did not know whether 
      anyone had done so. "That raises a serious question of whether that 
      material is       protectable." 

      According to defendants in the case, DeCSS was created by legal reverse 
      engineering techniques to allow DVDs to be played on the Linux platform. 

      Since its release, however, the film industry has vilified the program as 
      an illegal hack aimed at producing illegal copies of DVD movies. 

      In addition to the Copy Control Association's suit in California, member 
      companies of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) filed a 
      lawsuit in New York against individuals for alleged violations of the 
      Digital Millenium       Copyright Act. 

      The judges in both cases have issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting 
      the defendants from posting the code throughout the trials' durations. 

      The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is defending the parties in both 
      cases, argues that people have a right to discuss the "the technical 
      insecurity of DVD" and to demonstrate their points through reverse 
      engineering. 

      The DVD association was formed in December of last year by member companies
      of the MPAA, the Business Software Alliance and the Electronic Industries 
      Alliance to license out the DVD Content Scrambling System.

      DVD Lawyers Make Secret Public 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      3:05 p.m. 26.Jan.2000 PST 
      Lawyers representing the DVD industry got caught in an embarrassing gaffe 
      when they filed a lawsuit and accidentally publicized the computer code 
      they wanted to keep secret. 

      The DVD Copy Control Association included its "trade secret" source code 
      in court documents, but forgot to ask the judge to seal them from public 
      scrutiny. 

      
      Whoops. 

      In a hastily arranged hearing Wednesday morning, DVD CCA lawyers asked 
      Santa Clara Superior Court Judge William J. Elfving to correct their 
      oversight, and he agreed to keep the document confidential. 

      It may be a little late. The document is dated 13 January and is widely 
      available on the Web. The owner of one site that placed the 140KB 
      declaration online says over 21,000 people have downloaded it so far. 

      The 11KB "CSSscramble" source code, part of the larger declaration of DVD 
      CCA president John Hoy, cannot be readily compiled into a DVD viewer or 
      copier. 

      But if it had not been released online last October, the DVD encryption 
      scheme likely would not have been penetrated. 

      Elfving granted an injunction last Friday, ordering 21 defendants to stop 
      posting DeCSS software -- which allows compressed video images to be 
      copied from a DVD disc onto a hard drive -- on their Web sites. 

      The blunder won't help the DVD CCA attorneys in their as-yet quixotic 
      quest to rid the Net of DeCSS. The entertainment industry frets that such 
      programs could eventually allow widespread piracy of movies. 

      One California litigator who specializes in Internet and intellectual 
      property cases says the boner won't derail the DVDCCA's lawsuit filed last 
      month in state court. 

      "The fact that these lawyers inadvertently filed with the court the source 
      code and that made it a public document does not have a [substantial 
      impact]," says Megan E. Gray, a lawyer in the Los Angeles office of Baker 
      and Hostetler.

      Gray said the biggest effect might be to mute the rhetoric of DVD CCA 
      lawyers. "It's difficult to say it's an outrage ... when you yourself have 
      contributed to public disclosure. It undermines your credibility," Gray 
      said. 

      Making an already difficult task even more tricky for DVD CCA lawyers is 
      that both the four-page CSSscramble source code and the DeCSS utility have 
      been mirrored by dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of Internet users in a kind 
      of       global keep-away game. 

      Activists outside a hearing even distributed copies of CSSscramble to 
      people outside the courthouse, prompting a DVD CCA attorney to enter the 
      document into official court records. 

      Jeffrey Kessler, the plaintiff's lead attorney from Weil, Gotshal and 
      Manges, told the judge at the time that CSSscramble was a trade secret and 
      should be confidential. 

      "I don't want to endanger their trade secret status by putting them in the 
      public record," Kessler said, according to a transcript. 

      He did not immediately return phone calls. 

      One of his colleagues separately asked that a defense exhibit with 
      CSSscramble be placed under seal. "DVD CCA requests the court place the 
      [declaration] under seal to avoid placing this information in the public 
      record," Jared Bobrow       wrote in a six-page brief on 9 January. 

      But both forgot about the DVD CCA president's exhibit -- that included 
      CSSscramble -- until this week. 

      "We still haven't waived our arguments that it has been entered into 
      public domain and trade secret protection has been waived by the other 
      side. We're going to pursue that," said Robin Gross, staff attorney for 
      the Electronic Frontier       Foundation, which is representing some of 
      the defendants. 

      "It threatens their case against the [DeCSS] utility. Their argument is 
      that this information is highly protected trade secrets and they go 
      through all the extremes to make sure the protection is in place," Gross 
      said. "Our position is that       they've waived trade secret protection 
      from entering this into the public domain." 

      Gross said EFF had not decided whether to appeal the preliminary 
      injunction or ask for a trial.

      Texas company accuses Yahoo of privacy violations 
      By Bloomberg News
      Special to CNET News.com
      January 26, 2000, 4:45 p.m. PT 

      DALLAS--Yahoo has been accused by closely held Universal Image of violating
      Texas' anti-stalking law by allegedly tracking computer users' every movement
      on the Internet without their consent.

      Universal Image, which does business as Chalkboardtalk.com on the Web, made
      the claim as part of a $4 billion lawsuit against Yahoo and its Yahoo 
      Broadcast unit. Dallas-based Universal Image, an educational video provider,
      filed the suit in December. 

      Universal Image has asked a Dallas judge to declare that Yahoo violated state
      law through the use of "cookies"--files attached to the computer of an Internet
      user that collect such information as names and addresses, Universal Image's 
      attorneys said.

      The lawsuit "concerns the right of privacy of every Internet user in America,"
      said Larry Friedman, an attorney for Universal Image.

      A Yahoo representative declined comment.

66.0  HNN: Jan 27:  Top Ten Viruses of 1999 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by nvirB 
      Anti-virus software firm Sophos has released its list for
      the top ten viruses of 1999. Form, a virus almost ten
      years old, makes it to number 9 on the list and six of
      the ten are word macro viruses. (Does anyone really
      use macros for anything other than viruses?)

      http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_619000/619687.stm
      
      Sophos:
      (Article unavailable, host was not responding - Ed)
      
      BBC;
      
      By BBC News Online's Damian
      Carrington 

      An analysis of the most common computer viruses of 1999 shows that
      although the threat of new self-propagating viruses is growing, older
      viruses are still very common. 

      One boot sector virus, Form, is nearly a decade old but still appears in
      the top ten. The  table was compiled  by anti-virus software firm
      Sophos, based on thousands of calls for help to the  company. 

      The three self-propagating viruses were
      Melissa, 
      ExploreZip
      and 
      Ska-Happy99
      
      which forward themselves by hijacking a computer's email program. This
      means that instead of taking months to spread into the wild, these 
      viruses have the potential to attack globally within days. 
            
      However, Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos,
      believes that old viruses still pose a major threat: "Some viruses become
      so common, they will never become extinct - they will always lurk on a 
      floppy disk in someone's drawer. 

      "Also, people may be aware of the latest scare but not the background 
      threat. It's difficult to get people excited about old threats." 

      Spreading out The most reported virus in 1999 was a  macro virus called
      Laroux and was first detected in early 1996. Unusually for a widespread
      macro virus, Laroux infects Excel spreadsheets rather than a Word
      document. 

      "It may be that people are getting quite cautious about opening documents, 
      as they may have been hit by that before, but are not so used to the threat
      of spreadsheets," says Mr Cluley. According to Mr Cluley, the key to
      long-lived viruses is being virtually invisible. "Viruses which jump up and
      down with very destructive payloads draw attention to themselves and 
      effectively kill themselves off, like lemmings. 

      "Form does nothing, it just spreads, although it still causes damage by using
      up system resources." 

      Silent but deadly

      Whilst having your hard disk wiped by a virus may seem the computer equivalent
      of Armageddon, many companies and individuals keep back-up copies of
      information. Some of the most damaging viruses are not destructive at all,
      says Mr Cluley. 

      "Some, like Melissa, can forward  documents to e-mail addresses stored on
      your computer - highly confidential information has leaked from companies in
      this way," he says. 

      And "data diddler" viruses exist which make subtle changes to data in a spread
      sheet. "If those are your company  results, it could be very embarrassing," he
      adds. 

      The year 2000 will see hoax viruses - email warnings of non-existent viruses -
      continue to cause enormous problems believes Mr Cluley. "In a way they are far
      more damaging than real viruses as they set off e-mail hurricanes and you can't
      disinfect a hoax. 

      "We had far more people seeking information on a hoax about a game
      involving Santa and his elves than any real virus." 

      Finally, Mr Cluley and other anti-virus experts are awaiting the sentencing in
      February of David L Smith, who pleaded guilty to distributing the Melissa macro
      virus and admitted causing more than $80m damage to North American
      companies. 

      "We are rather hoping that, depending on what the sentence is, it may send out 
      a message to virus authors that this isn't cool and the authorities are prepared
      to pursue you."

68.0  So wtf is the deal with l0pht and @stake? here's the FAQ jack.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      For those of you that need things spelled out for you ($$$) here's
      what happened with l0pht and @stake ($$$) - Ed
      
      
      
      L0pht/@Stake Merger FAQ

       1. Is it true? Did L0pht Heavy Industries actually merge with @Stake?
       2. Why did you do it? You seemed to have a perfect club-house 
          environment.
       3. So, how's the cultural fit with @Stake? How do the L0pht's values fit
          in there?
       4. So what's going to happen to the old L0pht space you were in?
       5. And what about the webpage? Is it going to go away? Is it going to        
          be put on 'atstake.com'?
       6. What exactly is L0pht doing over at @Stake? Are you consulting now?
       7. What's going to happen to all the advisories? Are you still going 
          to publish them?
       8. Are you still going to sell L0phtCrack? And AntiSniff? Will there be
          new versions?
       9. What's the deal with Hacker News Network anyway? Is that actually part
          of L0pht, and was it picked up by the merger?
       10. How does it feel working with a bunch of business stiffs?
       11. What are the financial makings of this merger?
       12. You talk about 'Strategic Security Solutions' on the @Stake webpage,
           and you talk about being truly 'vendor-neutral'... isn't that what 
           everyone else is doing? What makes @Stake different?
           Explain in small words. (Yeah we're all dumb fuckers out here, - Ed)
       13. I don't trust hackers like you. Why should I?
       14. Are you still going to get drunk and rant at cons? What about your 
           'professional image'?
       15. Are you hiring? Can I be a L0pht Member?
       16. Does @Stake have an open-door policy?
       17. Are you still going to the MIT Swapfest and selling funky stuff?
       18. Are you still using your handles? Or are you going to use your 
           real names now?
       19. What's up with Guerilla Net? Are you guys still doing hardware 
           projects over at @Stake?
       20. Will you be coming out with any more T-shirts?
        

       1. Is it true? Did L0pht Heavy Industries actually merge with @Stake?

            YES. L0pht Heavy Industries was incorporated, had employees on the 
            payroll, and sold software products and consulting services. In 
            short, we were a real company and had been operating that way for a 
            couple years. L0pht Heavy Industries legally merged with @Stake in 
            the beginning of 2000 so we are all one company now. The new company 
            will go by the name of @Stake. 

       2. Why did you do it? You seemed to have a perfect club-house 
          environment.

            We strived to be (and achieved) a pure R&D environment. 
            Unfortunately pure research and development is not a very profitable 
            arena. In addition, one needs business people, sales and 
            productization of services. So, while we tried to keep the research 
            and fun environment we were fighting a losing battle in making ends 
            meet.

            To summarize, we had problems scaling. Everyone was spending more 
            money and effort doing less research and experiments. The L0pht 
            wanted desperately to avoid having to compromise our goals and 
            ideals which would have happened if we had continued to go the route 
            we were. The solution was obvious. We needed to find an organization 
            that valued the R&D work that we did, could benefit from it, profit 
            from it, and enable us to keep contributing to the community.

            We feel very fortunate in having come across such people in @Stake. 
            We see this as a win-win situation where we will be able to do a lot 
            of the research that we were unable to do while just being the 
            L0pht. We also feel very fortunate in finding an organization that 
            did not expect us to about-face in the way we approach sharing our 
            findings with people. 

       3. So, how's the cultural fit with @Stake? How do the L0pht's values fit 
          in there?

            Here is a PARTIAL list of components that we find work very well 
            with our VALUES and make us very comfortable about the merger:

                 @Stake is aiming to be completely product / vendor neutral. 
                 This enables them to make the best design decision and 
                 recommendations possible to the customer without unknown 
                 biases. This is accomplished in the following ways:

                      @Stake will not take commissions / kick-backs from product 
                      vendors for recommending a product into a customer. @Stake 
                      is in the business of providing strategic services rather 
                      than tactical ones. What this means is that they see the 
                      benefit in helping design / implement solutions with 
                      security and functionality from the beginning rather than 
                      looking for known problems and helping to only remediate 
                      them when they could have been avoided all together. 
                      @Stake will not sell products. Thus they do not have 
                      customers being worried that they will recommend their own 
                      product even if it might not be the best solution. What 
                      this means to us is that we get to continue coming out 
                      with tools and programs but are forced to give them away 
                      for free! How cool is that! We are completely non-biased 
                      in our opinions of products and technologies, and we are 
                      able to continue our experimentation and 
                      reverse-engineering of such. This also allows us to 
                      continue our "consumer reports"-style announcements, 
                      papers and research. 

                 @Stake is committed to a strong research and development leg as 
                 a method of always being a leader and not just a follower. 
                 @Stake wants smarter customers rather than dumber ones in the 
                 community. By helping to educate everyone as much as possible 
                 it not only helps differentiate the company but allows more 
                 interesting and thorough solutions to be deployed for 
                 customers. This is the same belief that the L0pht has always 
                 held. 

       4. So what's going to happen to the old L0pht space you were in?

            We still have the space. Some of the hardware projects that were 
            going on over there are just not practical to move. We are also 
            setting up new lab space that has many of the things that we could 
            not manage at the old location. 

       5. And what about the webpage? Is it going to go away? Is it going to be 
          put on 'atstake.com'?

            Not in the immediate future. There will obviously be a period of 
            time before we manage to fully integrate everything. As was stated 
            in a previous response one of the reasons we embarked upon this 
            merger is due to the like-minded beliefs. So, when the two web sites 
            finally merge you can expect to find the same sort of information 
            that is currently published in an even better format. It might even 
            be that they stay as individual web sites, one focusing more on R&D 
            and the other on business angles. What it boils down to is that you 
            can expect some changes but the main focus will be quite similar to 
            what it currently is. 

       6. What exactly is L0pht doing over at @Stake? Are you consulting now?

            The L0pht forms the nucleus of the Research and Development group in 
            @Stake. By continuing to push the envelope in security research we 
            can help productize new services to the consulting and business legs 
            of @Stake. 

       7. What's going to happen to all the advisories? Are you still going to 
          publish them?

            The L0pht will continue to publish advisories. This will not change. 
            The L0pht never did and never will publish an advisory based upon 
            insider information that would betray someones trust. However, we 
            will continue to act as a Consumer Reports style organization in 
            posting our general findings through analysis and evaluation as 
            general customers reviewing software.

            We still beleive in Full-Disclosure in our advisories. We are also 
            happy that we will be better able to work with companies in giving 
            them advance notice before posting publicly to the world. 

       8. Are you still going to sell L0phtCrack? And AntiSniff? Will there be 
          new versions?

            Since @Stake is purely a consulting services company, it did not 
            acquire the products that were sold commercialy from the L0pht. 
            L0phtCrack and AntiSniff are being moved to a holding company 
            independent of @Stake and will continue to be sold. We will be 
            donating the proceeds (after operational expenses) to non-profit and 
            educational organizations.

            The free versions will continue to be free and include source code. 
            A new version of L0phtCrack was 95% complete at the time of the 
            merger. The authors will probably finish the last bit and release 
            L0phtCrack 3.0 but the schedule is uncertain.

            A Linux version of the researchers version of AntiSniff is underway 
            and will be released under the same free researchers license that 
            the command line AntiSniff currently has. 

       9. What's the deal with Hacker News Network anyway? Is that actually part 
          of L0pht, and was it picked up by the merger?

            Hacker News Network was run by l0pht employees on l0pht equipment so 
            it certainly was a part of l0pht. We feel it provides a valuable 
            news source to the security community so it will continue to operate 
            as part of @Stake. We expect to be able to spend more time and 
            resources in making it an even better resource for the community. 

       10. How does it feel working with a bunch of business stiffs?

            @Stake is definitely not populated with a bunch of business stiffs. 
            One of the reasons L0pht merged with @Stake was the quality of the 
            people there. They understand our vision of computer security. Some 
            of them would even be considered hackers exactly the same way we 
            think of ourselves as hackers.

            Things are a bit more businesslike at the merged company but the 
            place is a place that values openness, diversity, creativity, 
            thinking outside of the box, and coming up with non-conventional 
            solutions. 

       11. What are the financial makings of this merger?

            @Stake is not a publicly traded company right now and as such we are 
            not able to give those details. We are happy to say that the main 
            impetus for the merger was the ability to engage in much more 
            grandious research work and not compromise our morals in the 
            process. We started into this field in order to learn, educate, and 
            contribute and are happy to say that we should only be able to do 
            this things even better now. 

       12. You talk about 'Strategic Security Solutions' on the @Stake webpage, 
           and you talk about being truly 'vendor-neutral'... isn't that what 
           everyone else is doing? What makes @Stake different? Explain in small 
           words.

            The answer to question #3 should help on the vendor-neutral aspect 
            being more than just lip service.

            As for the 'Strategic Security Solutions' this is similar to how the 
            L0pht always handled customers. An example in the software world 
            between tactical and strategic might help: Problem: A buffer 
            overflow was found in a section of code. The offending call was the 
            unbounded strcpy(). Tactical approach: Replace that particular 
            strcpy() call with the bounded strncpy(). If a similar problem is 
            found elsewhere later on fix that one after it is reported. Repeat 
            as necessary. Strategic approach: From the design point help model 
            with security involved. Use bounded string functions to remove that 
            class of future problems. Obviously the above is just an example of 
            the way we see tactical being different from strategic approaches. 
            This is how we view all projects be they in the infrastructure, 
            content, operational, network, etc. fields. It also does not 
            preclude us from implementing tactical solutions as necessary but 
            the main focus is enabling, not only reacting. 

       13. I don't trust hackers like you. Why should I?

            We call ourselves hackers using the original, positive meaning of 
            the word. A good definition can be found in Eric Raymond's Hacker's 
            Dictionary. We think hackers have higher ethical standards than most 
            in the business world. We do not do anything illegal with our 
            computers or anyone else's. We get our kicks finding and solving 
            security vulnerabilities in products and technologies using our own 
            networks, hardware, and other resource. This is the way we have 
            always operated and that is the way we will continue to operate. If 
            you can't relate to this, then you should probably reinvestigate the 
            meaning of the word 'hacker'. 

       14. Are you still going to get drunk and rant at cons? What about your 
           'professional image'?

            We will continue to be involved in conferences the way we always 
            have. Don't you think that if @Stake had told Mudge he would not be 
            able to have a beer with his friends and talk about crypto-systems 
            that would have been a show stopper for the merger right there? 

       15. Are you hiring? Can I be a L0pht Member?

            We are definitely hiring. We cannot thrive and be the leader in 
            security without the best people on the planet. Submit your resume 
            to jobs@atstake.com if you are interested. We want to work with the 
            best and you probably do, too. If you have top notch security skills 
            in consulting or research we urge you to apply. That being said, we 
            cannot accept everyone that applies but will do our best to make 
            sure everyone gets a fair shake.

            The L0pht is fully integrated with @Stake so there is no seperate 
            group of people called "L0pht Members". We are proud to call 
            ourselves members of the @Stake team. We will now be known as 'The 
            Hackers Formerly Known As The L0pht', or perhaps some unpronouncable 
            symbol. 

       16. Does @Stake have an open-door policy?

            @Stake operates in a similar fashion to most other professional 
            service organizations. The reason we went to the closed door policy 
            at the L0pht was to enable ourselves to get work done and not just 
            have the place be a local hang-out for people wanting to kick back 
            with a beer and watch TV. While we will be more accesible at @Stake, 
            we are there to do R&D work and as such it will continue to not be 
            an open-door-hangout type environment.

            Keep in mind, however, that L0pht has not had a true open-door 
            policy for many years. At our original location, the L0pht was more 
            of a club-house and place for general hanging-out of hackers from 
            around the world. When we moved to our new location and decided to 
            do real research and provide to the community, the L0pht was not 
            open for everybody. We occasionally gave tours and threw parties, 
            but the space was not open for visitors 24 hours a day. 

       17. Are you still going to the MIT Swapfest and selling funky stuff?

            We will still be going to the MIT Swapfest to see people and pick up 
            various things. We hope we won't have to sell our scraps at it 
            anymore in order to make ends meet :) However, as most people going 
            to the MIT flea, we will also want to "upgrade our junk pile". We 
            will be selling, just not every month as in the past. 

       18. Are you still using your handles? Or are you going to use your real 
           names now?

            We have been using our handles for over 10 years now. It is what we 
            have published under in academic journals, magazines, books, given 
            training courses under, and provided recommendations to the US 
            Senate under. As such they are as much our recognized names in the 
            security community and we will continue to use them. Many companies 
            seem to be scared of doing business with people using pseudonyms or 
            handles. This is a problem that we would like to solve. We are not 
            really hiding from anyone, but this is how we've been known for a 
            long time, and for some, is what our parents call us. We hope to 
            educate those companies by showing them that its not the name that's 
            important, rather the information and services that can be provided. 

       19. What's up with Guerilla Net? Are you guys still doing hardware 
           projects over at @Stake?

            @Stake has committed to enabling the R&D labs to work on hardware 
            related projects as well as protocol and software ones. We see an 
            ultimate marriage between all of these areas as technology is 
            progressing and would be remiss if we turned a blind eye towards any 
            of them. 

       20. Will you be coming out with any more T-shirts?

            The T-shirts were fun little projects that we did more out of 
            amusement than anything else. Should the opportunity and inspiration 
            strike again we would not rule out the possibility of
            coming out with some new designs.

      The newest version of the windows operating system,
      technically still in beta and not scheduled for release
      until February 17, 2000, has a major security hole.
      Microsoft has been quick to issue a patch for the hole
      that allows web surfers to view files stored on a
      targeted web server. The problem lies with Microsoft
      Index Server which is built into Windows 2000. At least
      six banks and three major computer manufacturers have
      been effected by the bug. (What the hell are they doing
      using beta software on production systems anyway?)

      Have Script, Will Destroy (Lessons in DoS)

      By: Brian Martin 
      
      
      
      I began writing this article almost one year ago, after the onslaught of 
      smurf attacks being launched against various networks throughout the 
      Internet. At the time, the newly discovered Denial of Service (DoS) attack 
      was a crippling tool designed for one purpose; remotely disabling machines 
      by flooding them with more traffic than they could handle. The smurf 
      attack was the first well known (and well abused) DoS attack that could 
      effectively cripple any network, regardless of size or bandwidth. This 
      presented a new problem to network administrators and security personnel 
      worldwide.

      The LowDown

      Also known as Network Saturation Attacks or Bandwidth Consumption Attacks, 
      the new breed of DoS attacks flood a remote network with an staggering 
      amount of traffic. Routers and servers targeted would go into overdrive 
      attempting to route or handle       each packet as it came in. As the 
      network receives more and more of these illegitimate packets, it quickly 
      begins to cause legitimate traffic like web and mail to be denied. In 
      minutes, all network activity is shut down as the attack consumes all 
      available network resources.

      Prior to bandwidth consumption attacks, most DoS attacks involved sending 
      very few malformed packets to a remote server that would cause it to 
      crash. This occured because of bugs in the way many servers handled the 
      malformed packets. Malformed       packets (also known as Magic Packets) 
      consisted of network protocol options that were out of sequence, 
      improperly matched, or too large. As a result, a server receiving these 
      packets had no rules or guidelines dictating how it should behave when 
      processing the malformed packet. The result was a system panic or crash 
      that would basically shut the machine down or force it to reboot. Perhaps 
      the most well known example of this type of attack is the WinNuke attack.

      Regardless of ethics or motives, Magic Packet DoS attacks showed an 
      inkling of grace in their execution. A single packet sent from one server 
      to another, causing it to crash or reboot was a targeted attack. The 
      precision with which this type of attack is carried       out is analogous 
      to a scalpel in surgery. Network consumption attacks on the other hand 
      involve millions of packets. Worse, once launched the attack was no 
      respector of those standing between the launch point and the target 
      network. Often times thousands of customers sharing bandwidth with the 
      target would be adversely affected as well. A single attack of this nature 
      had the ability to knock thousands of machines off the Internet in a 
      single swoop. Such attacks are the equivalent of using a broadsword to do 
      surgery.

      

      The Next Generation

      Attacks like the smurf DoS have a cascading affect that can be seen as a 
      virtual avalanche. The starting point is nothing more than a few pebbles 
      and snowballs (packets). As they travel downhill (along the path of 
      routers to the target), they accumulate more       mass and trigger the 
      release of more pebbles. By the time the falling material hits the bottom 
      of the mountain (the target), it is swamped in large amounts of snow and 
      rocks. Despite the effectiveness of this attack, there is a single point 
      from which the attack is launched. If an attack is detected early enough, 
      it is possible to filter out the offending packets before they leave the 
      original network.

      

      The next generation of Denial of Service attacks are known as Distributed 
      Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Expanding on the idea of network 
      saturation attacks, DDoS effectively does the same thing but utilizes 
      several launch points. The philosophy and       objective of this is 
      twofold. First, if a single machine being used to launch an attack is 
      discovered and disabled, the overall attack proceeds with near full force. 
      Second, by utilizing several launch points on different networks, an 
      attacker is able to shut down larger networks that might not otherwise be 
      affected by a single flood.

      Taking Down the Big Boys

      Prior to launching this form of DDoS flood, the attacker must first 
      compromise various hosts on different networks. The more networks and 
      machines used as launch points, the more potent the attack. Once each host 
      had been broken into, they would install a       DDoS client program on 
      the machine that would sit ready to attack. Once the network of 
      compromised servers was configured with the new client program, the 
      attacker could send a quick command from the DDoS server software 
      triggering each machine to launch an attack.

      

      [chart comparing 56k vs cable vs t1 vs t3]       Until this last wave of 
      DDoS attacks, it was generally assumed that hosts residing on large pipes 
      (connections with incredible bandwidth) could not be seriously affected by 
      network saturation attacks. As large Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are 
      finding out, this is no longer the case. By using several smaller network 
      connections, an attacker can eventually saturate the biggest ISPs and 
      consume all of their bandwidth. This was demonstrated most effectively 
      with the eBay, Amazon, Buy.com and other large scale web sites.

      Difficulty in Tracking

      Neophytes to networking always seem to question why these attacks are not 
      tracked down, and the legs of the perpetrator not broken. It is a rare 
      case to see ISPs interested in tracking down the individual(s) behind 
      these attacks. Rather than take the time and       effort to perform an 
      investigation (which is lenghty), most ISPs realize that a quick filter 
      denying ALL traffic to the site being attacked is a better solution. In 
      essence, the ISP does the job of the person launching the attack and does 
      it much more effeciently. As you can imagine, that is not exactly a 
      deterrent for those committing these attacks.

      One of the primary reasons investigations of DoS attacks is lengthy is it 
      involves tracking down the packets hitting the target. Rather than leave 
      the launch point with the IP address of the machine actually being used, 
      the packets are tagged with forged source IP       addresses. Since the IP 
      information in each packet varies wildly, and since the addresses can not 
      be trusted, a network administrator must trace the packets back to the 
      source one router at a time. This involves connecting to the router (often 
      times this must be done at the physical console for security reasons), 
      setting up a filter or sniffer to detect where the packets are coming from 
      before arriving at that particular router, and then move to the new 
      offending router. This presents problems when you consider a single packet 
      may cross as many as thirty routers owned by ten different companies.

      The act of forging the source IP of a packet is called IP Spoofing and is 
      the basis for a wide variety of network attacks. One of the original 
      intentions of a Denial of Service attack was to knock a machine off the 
      network in order for you to assume it's identity.       Once you 
      masquerade as that machine, it is possible to intercept traffic intended 
      for it as well as gain access to other machines on the target network via 
      trusted host relationships. Attackers today seem to have lost all focus on 
      the reason one would committ a DoS attack.

      Save The Day Already!

      Denial of Service attacks are not new. They have existed in one form or 
      another since computers were invented. In the past they involved consuming 
      resources like disk drive space, memory or CPU cycles. Those not familiar 
      with how computers operate often       scream for quick solutions to the 
      various DoS attacks that plague our networks. Unfortunately, this is 
      easier said than done.

      Every weekday morning and afternoon millions of Americans go to and from 
      work. They pile on to two and four lane freeways only to move at a crawl. 
      Travelling ten miles in one hour is a common occurance for those fighting 
      rush hour traffic in heavily trafficed       areas of business districts 
      in cities across the nation. Every day they carry out this ritual, 
      screaming and cursing the thousands of other drivers clogging the roads, 
      and day after day the problem does not fix itself. Be it packets or cars, 
      it is very well established that enough of either will overcrowd a road or 
      network connection. At a given point, too many of either will bring all 
      traffic to a standstill. Why isn't the traffic problem solved? We all know 
      the solution is bigger and better roads, more carpooling, diverse 
      schedules, and more common sense when behind the wheel. Fat chance that 
      will happen anytime soon. On the flip side, it is very unlikely that they 
      will fix every router on every network and install mechanisms to help 
      avoid network saturation attacks.

      In the long run, it is a rather simple fix that could help eliminate these 
      attacks. Any network device that accepts or passes network traffic can be 
      designed to monitor activity better. If a web server is receiving too many 
      hits, it starts rejecting new connections so       that existing 
      connections can still view pages or interact with the site. This practice 
      is called throttling or bandwidth limiting and is designed to prevent 
      excessive connections, conserve resources and keep things operating 
      correctly. Unfortunately, this philosophy has not carried over to routers 
      (the machines that pass all internet traffic) so network consumption 
      attacks go on unchecked. A relatively few amount of networks have learned 
      this is a good solution to flood attacks. As such, their routers are 
      designed to monitor traffic and quit passing illegitimate traffic once 
      detected. The problem with this approach is that once the flood of packets 
      have hit the remote network, the damage is done. The downside to this 
      mechanism is the added latency as the router checks each and every packet 
      that passes through it. Because of this slowdown, ISPs hesitate 
      implementing this solution.

      In order to make connection throttling effective, every network router 
      should have this mechanism implemented. This would allow a router close to 
      the source of the attack to detect the illicit traffic and put up a filter 
      that rejected it before it left the launch point.       This invariably 
      leads to the question "How do you know if traffic is illegitimate?" 
      Looking back to the section on IP spoofing, we can easily create a quick 
      solution to the problem. In fact, this mechanism is found in most 
      Firewalls implemented today.

      

      In the diagram above, we show a forged packet with the IP address of 
      150.23.83.44. It stands to reason that such a packet would not 
      legitimately be travelling around a network designated by the 1.2.3.x 
      subnet. Because of this, any router on that network       (especially the 
      one acting as a gateway to the outside world) receiving that packet should 
      drop it. Instead of blindly passing the packet on without question, 
      routers should discriminate against suspicious packets by refusing to pass 
      them on to the next router and setting off some kind of alarm for the 
      administrator.

      A second mechanism can be put into place that would help cut down on these 
      attacks. On any given day, there is an average amount of traffic passed 
      through any router. By monitoring these averages and applying other common 
      sense rules, routers could be       made to throttle heavily increased 
      traffic. For example, if a router detected a sudden surge in traffic to a 
      destination machine in which every packet claims to originate from a 
      different IP address, that is a good sign of a saturation attack using 
      spoofed packets. Rather than pass that traffic down the network, the 
      router should throttle the traffic to avoid the likely flood that will 
      ensue.

      As stated many times before, easier said than done. Implementing these 
      features falls on the many vendors of routers. Using these routers on 
      production networks on the open Internet is up to the tens of thousands of 
      companies maintaining a presence on the       Internet. These upgrades 
      cost time and money, something companies hesitate to invest; until the 
      first time they are on the receiving end of such an attack. Like most 
      security incidents, companies tend to implement reactive security 
      measures, rarely proactive measures.

      Why Ask Why?

      Somewhere along the way, everyone wants to know why such attacks are 
      carried out. Using the recent series of attacks against Yahoo, eBay and 
      others is just as good example as any. To quash the distant hopes of a 
      reasonable explanation, "There is no       good reason!".

      Consider that your typical DDoS attack affects hundreds (if not thousands) 
      of machines, on a wide variety of networks. The single purpose of the 
      attack is to cripple or shut down the target site so that it can not 
      receive legitimate traffic. There are only a handful       of reasons for 
      doing it at all, none of which are reasonable or justifiable. In other 
      words, DoS attacks are worthless and childish.

      The first reason with perhaps the longest history is simple revenge. Some 
      site out there wronged you in some way. Perhaps they spammed you, stopped 
      hosting the free web pages they provided for you, fired your father or 
      committed some other transgression.       DoS attacks are a form of 
      virtual revenge, especially against companies doing business over the 
      Internet. The primary argument here is that these attacks cause problems 
      for a number of ISPs, other customers who share bandwidth with the target, 
      as well as the satisfied customers of the site. This goes back to the 
      broadsword vs scalpel analogy.

      The second reason has become rather trendy with novice script kiddies, 
      second rate web page defacers, and those under the illusion they are part 
      of the professional security community. "I did it to prove the system was 
      vulnerable!" This is perhaps the most       pathetic justification for 
      launching a DoS attack. To many, this is no different than the attacker 
      setting off a large nuclear device right next to a corporate server and 
      then proclaiming "See! This can impact your operations!" Of course it can, 
      this has been proven a hundred times over.

      The third reason I can come up with falls back to playground rules. "If I 
      can't play kickball, I'll throw the ball on the roof so no one else can 
      play either!" This third grade mentality is far from justification of such 
      attacks. Those wishing to exact some form of       punishment against a 
      site should consider the diminished intellect required to launch these 
      attacks. There are better ways to deal with mean companies.

      My Rant

      Three types of people deserve the brunt of harsh insults and petty name 
      calling. Each are responsible for this problem plaguing Internet users, 
      and each could do their part to help stop it.

      Each individual that carries out a DoS attack does so knowing full well 
      what it could result in if they are caught. Practically nothing. There is 
      precious little to deter someone from carrying out such vicious attacks. 
      The very few times administrators put effort into       tracking down a 
      malicious user it results in them getting ousted from the ISP. The next 
      day, the offending user is back online accessing the Internet via another 
      ISP. Until the attack against Yahoo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
      (FBI) was not concerned over these attacks. To date, the FBI has not 
      managed to apprehend the perpetrator of a devastating DoS attack against 
      their own home page (www.fbi.gov). For one reason or another they were 
      seen as an annoyance, not a reason for loss of business. Law Enforcement 
      needs to take a bigger interest in DoS attacks and start to punish those 
      responsible. These types of attacks should take any competant law 
      enforcement agent a few hours of tracking and maybe a handful of 
      legitimate warrants.

      Like the FBI, ISPs receiving these attacks need to take more proactive 
      steps in preventing DoS attacks. When they do occur, ISPs should also take 
      more time in tracking down the offending users and passing on the 
      information to appropriate law enforcement.       Rather than silently 
      kicking them off the Internet for a day, taking a more active and public 
      stance showing that malicious activity will not be tolerated would have a 
      better effect. Those ISPs scared of retaliation need to remember that they 
      are in the best position to stop the attackers.

      Last, the pathetic kids (literally and figuratively) committing these 
      attacks. In many cases, these attacks are launched with mystical scripts 
      written in foreign languages and just produce the desired affect. There is 
      no grace, no skill, and no intellect behind these       attacks. You are 
      not a hacker and you do not deserve respect for your childish actions. You 
      are no better than the twisted individuals who spray a crowd of innocent 
      bystanders with a machine gun, only to nick your intended target. If you 
      can't express yourself better than a saturation attack, and can't deal 
      with being called a name or wronged somehow, seek help offline. You sorely
      need it.

      CERT warning? What, me worry?


      By: Coris Neme 

      The February 3 announcement by CERT of a major
      security hole that affected all Web browsers so badly that
      they recommended wiping all cookies and browsing only
      known sites sounded bad--until I read the warning. I'm
      writing this article for one reason and one reason only: to
      dispel the FUD and hysteria of this ludicrous "warning".
      I've seen e-mail virus hoaxes that I was more inclined to
      panic about. 

      The supposed danger here, cross-site scripting, is that
      malicious JavaScript code could appear on a Web page, a
      newsgroup posting, or an e-mail. (Oh, my! The horror!)
      You might want to restrain your shock; this isn't news.
      Malicious scripts, unseen by the average user, have been
      possible since scripting languages came into being. Poison
      JavaScript and nasty Java applets are nothing new under
      the sun. CERT is basically telling us that it's 1996 again. 

      To be fair, the warning goes into a little more detail: It
      says that dynamically generated pages could launch
      JavaScript code unintentionally. Mr. Obvious, it's time for
      your wake-up call. Any page, dynamic or static or
      anything in between, can contain malicious code. But if
      you've disabled the scripting language that the code uses,
      it's irrelevant where the code came from. 

      Another point the CERT warning raises is that this
      so-called malicious code could hide in frame and snoop
      data from another frame entirely. Sure, if your browser's
      buggy enough to allow such a thing. Dozens of such
      vulnerabilities have been removed from both Netscape and
      Internet Explorer; I think the threat of one frame spying
      on another is just about over. But hey, if it really was '96
      all over again, they'd have an excellent point. 

      While we're on the subject, why do e-mail and news
      clients even support JavaScript, anyway? There's no
      legitimate purpose for it being there, after all, and it just
      serves as a way for someone to exploit the next big
      implementation bug that pops up. Had CERT posted a
      recommendation that all future browsers remove scripting
      capabilities from their e-mail and news clients, I think the
      hacking community would have stood up and applauded. 

      Shall we eradicate our entire cookie file, only browse the
      sites that are in our bookmarks, and never venture forth
      onto the Web again because of a sudden warning about a
      low-grade threat that's existed for nearly half a decade
      and for which many of the exploits have already been
      patched? The layman and the newbie are certainly being
      led to think so. I simply can't believe their recommended
      course of action--disable all scripting, don't browse
      promiscuously, and get rid of all your cookies. (I usually
      wipe most of my cookies anyway, but there are a few I
      keep.) 

      I was surprised to see the news posted without so much
      as an editorial about how outdated and overblown the
      warning really is. This is 2000, not 1996. Malicious code is
      still out there and yes, it still can get you; but about the
      most that it can do is overload your system and force a
      shutdown or a crash. (Poision JavaScript or Java that
      causes a crash is usually a self-solving problem. Such
      code can be found and eliminated; it's not stealthy.) It
      can't (usually) cause one frame to spy on another. It
      can't just arbitrarily steal data from your hard drive. It's
      as dangerous and as harmless in static pages as in
      dynamically-generated pages. 

      I think it would be nice to read the news Monday and see
      that the media, instead of repeating the warning blindly,
      was now telling the world that the hacking community had
      denounced the CERT warning for the ridiculous paranoia it
      really is. Or failing that, perhaps we could get the
      blueprints to the time machine from whence this message
      came, and in turn we could deliver our own Chicken Little
      alerts about events that came and went many years ago.
      (Brace yourselves; I feel a 1987 coming on.)

      The Japanese Panic Project


      Findings of a simple fifteen-minute security
      audit.

      Written by YTCracker 

      Greetings from Colorado Springs. 

      As you have probably heard by now, the Japanese
      government is panic-stricken following a few simple
      defacements of their government's websites. Damage
      control is quickly being administered to the sites in the
      limelight, however the problems still stand. 

      McIntyre[of Attrition] and I were discussing the recent
      news uproar concerning the aforementioned defacements.
      He and I were curious if the Japanese government was
      either extremely secure or extremely ignored. I mounted
      up on my 486[running console slack, you may phear now],
      fired up nmap and went at it, looking for anything that
      didn't look right. Anything that warranted a deeper
      investigation [checking the version of a daemon, running
      an rpcinfo query on a box] I accomplished using basic
      stock commands. Nothing extremely fancy or "zero-day",
      just the basics. 

      A few minutes into my audit of some of the top-level
      government websites, I discovered two vulnerablities on
      the www.stat.co.jp website. Continuing on, I informed
      McIntyre of my findings. Lo and behold, just a few hours
      after this extremely shallow security audit, the
      www.stat.go.jp site was defaced. I systematically ran
      through the sites on this list [found here] and my findings
      were pretty astounding. Many of these government sites
      contain vulnerabilities[several-year-old ones such as statd
      and qpop, along with newer vulnerabilities such as amd
      and sadmind] and run comparitively outdated operating
      systems [SunOS4]. I noticed gross violations of security
      relating to proxy servers with open permissions. On one
      site I noticed a cgi exploit dated about two years old.
      More than half of the NT servers I surveyed were
      exploitable by either eEye's stack bug or the
      now-infamous remote data service [msadc.pl] exploit. 

      These scans [COMPLETELY non-intrusive ;)] were an eye
      opener for me. I immediately asked myself why the
      Japanese government hadn't been experiencing
      defacements on a greater magnitude. I would assume
      that, for the most part, the United States rash of
      defacements was largely attributed to the fact that NT
      was a popular choice among our government. It did take a
      little more digging to find out what the Japanese servers
      were vulnerable to. I seriously believe it's going to take a
      lot more than the help of a few individuals to turn this up. 

      Why is this such a big deal? I have no idea. This sort of
      thing happens every day at an exponential magnitude here
      in the United States. My guess as to why the Japanese
      government has been granted amnesty for so long by the
      defacement community is probably the fact that defacers
      didn't even really knew those sites existed. However, now
      that these defacements have blown up and are in the
      public eye, I feel it is a matter of time before others follow
      suit. The preparedness level of the ITs involved seems
      extremely low and it seems way too late to begin a crash
      course in systems administration. 

      There is no real solution to this problem. Perhaps if
      preventative measures are quickly put into action [short
      of taking the sites offline], they have a good chance of
      averting some of the danger. The surprising factor is that
      in a fifteen minute period of goofing around, approximately
      three-fourths of the sites I checked had some exploitable
      feature. I informed who I could get a hold of. My fear is
      that if someone had obviously malicious intentions[i.e. the
      pro-Chinese, anti-Japanese hacktivist groups] and
      conducted a much more in-depth audit of the systems,
      they would find a lot more than I did. 

      For now, damage control and politics is all that I expect to
      see for the next few days.

      Student charged with hacking

      Fugitive: Prosecutors say he broke into Palo Alto firm, then fled to Bulgaria. 

      BY HOWARD MINTZ
      Mercury News Staff Writer 

      A federal grand jury in San Jose on Wednesday indicted a former Princeton 
      University student suspected of hacking into the computer system of a Palo 
      Alto e-commerce company and stealing nearly 2,000 credit card numbers.

      In the government's latest attempt to hunt down a computer hacker, federal 
      prosecutors brought charges against Peter Iliev Pentchev, a 22-year-old 
      native of Bulgaria who is believed to have fled the United States after 
      school officials confronted him about his computer activities.

      According to the U.S. Attorney's office in San Jose, Pentchev left the 
      country in late 1998, shortly after the alleged hacking incident occurred. 
      Law enforcement officials believe Pentchev went to Bulgaria and were 
      unclear Wednesday what diplomatic obstacles there may be to returning him 
      to this country to face charges.

      The four-count indictment charges Pentchev with violating federal computer 
      laws by hacking into an undisclosed Palo Alto company between Nov. 20 and 
      Dec. 19, 1998, stealing at least 1,800 credit card numbers, as well as 
      user names and passwords of that company's customers. The indictment does 
      not specify the company, and federal officials declined to name it.

      But Assistant U.S. Attorney Mavis Lee, who is prosecuting the case, said 
      the hacking incident shut down one of the company's Web servers for five 
      days and caused enough chaos in its database that it cost the firm more 
      than $100,000 to restore its security system.

      Authorities have no evidence that Pentchev used the credit card numbers to 
      commit fraud.

      Federal law-enforcement officials do not believe there is a link between 
      Pentchev and a computer intruder who earlier this month attempted to 
      extort $100,000 from Internet music retailer CD Universe, claiming to have 
      stolen as many as 300,000 credit card numbers. The alleged extortionist 
      was suspected of operating somewhere in Eastern Europe.

      That hacker began posting more than 25,000 allegedly stolen card numbers 
      on a web site Christmas Day. The site eventually was shut down, and 
      thousands of customers who had shopped at CD Universe canceled their 
      cards.

      In the Bay Area case, investigators said they were able to trace the 
      computer intrusion to Pentchev because he left evidence in log files in 
      the company's computer system. ``He wasn't careful about mopping up after 
      himself,'' Lee said.

      Princeton University officials confronted Pentchev about the allegations 
      in December 1998, and he disappeared shortly thereafter. If convicted, 
      Pentchev faces a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison.

      Online bank allowed easy scam      Automatic withdrawals in the spotlight 
      as criminals stole with ‘help’ of legitimate finance Web sites By Bob 
      Sullivan MSNBC

      Jan. 28 — One day in mid January, Imad Khalidi arrived at work at his auto 
      dealership in Maine to discover $21,000 had been removed from his company’s 
      bank account. It had gone to pay for merchandise ordered from Gucci in San 
      Francisco and was automatically deducted from Auto Europe’s account. That 
      began a hellish 10 days for the company, which was caught in the middle of 
      an online banking nightmare involving the newest Web bank, X.com. And it 
      was not the only case of misappropriated funds surrounding the Web site.
 
      SOMEONE HAD GOTTEN hold of Auto Europe’s                bank account 
      information and, after attempting a few fraudulent withdrawals, posted the 
      information on the Internet. “Use this account for your x.com and Wingspan 
      transfers,” the criminal wrote in an ominous post to a newsgroup after 
      citing the account numbers. “Account has millions of dollars in funds, and 
      can’t notice a mere US $25,000 a week debit. They get their statements 
      quarterly.” For the next 10 days, Khalidi said, there were four or five 
      automatic withdrawals attempted daily by criminals using X.com or online 
      banking competitor Wingspan. The original Gucci charge — and some of the 
      subsequent charges to the Portland, Maine, company’s accounts — were 
      funneled through online bill payment assistant CyberBills.com. CyberBills 
      acknowledged its system was used in the attempted fraud but declined to 
      offer details, citing an ongoing investigation. Wingspan did not 
      immediately return phone calls. In each case, the fraudulent charge was 
      reversed by the company’s local bank — but the charges did get through the 
      online companies, highlighting the security drawbacks that can come with 
      convenient Internet banking. “What’s most appalling is they said it ‘was a 
      designed feature.’ ” — ELIAS LEVY SecurityFocus.com X.com, which launched 
      in mid-December, came under scrutiny Friday from a security group when a 
      customer pointed out just how easy it was to trick the service into 
      stealing money from someone else’s bank account. Users opening an X.com 
      account were given the option to fund the account with a bank transfer, 
      and only had to supply a bank account number and routing number — printed 
      at the bottom of every check. This structure allowed X.com customers to 
      easily withdraw money from victims’ accounts, and they did. One bragged on 
      a newsgroup that he had lifted $4,500. The company, which added security 
      measures that stopped the scam Jan. 21, said it knows of only six bad 
      charges, totaling less than $10,000. CEO Bill Harris said there may be 
      more victims who have not yet noticed fraudulent charges. Word of the easy 
      money started to spread on Internet newsgroups in early January, well 
      before X.com addressed the flaw, as thieves bragged back and forth about 
      their successful swindling. 

      Harris conceded the company wasn’t aware of the cyber taunting. “I wouldn’t
      at all be surprised if we weren’t aware of what was in those newsgroups,” he 
      said. The ease with which  criminals could withdraw money  from victims’ 
      accounts disturbed Elias Levy, who runs  SecurityFocus.com, an Internet 
      security information service. The Web site issued a release about 
      the problem on Friday. “What’s most appalling is they said it 
     ‘was a designed feature,’ ” Levy said. The company wanted to make 
     online banking as simple as possible, so it allowed 
     depositors to skip a step like sending in a voided check to 
     verify their identity. “It was a calculated risk. Obviously they 
     calculated wrong.” 

     Harris said a series of new company policies make X.com safe; 
     it now only allows transfers between accounts held under the 
     same name, for example. He said the changes have been well 
     received by customers and stopped short of saying his company has 
     committed a serious security snafu. “I don’t think a mistake 
     was made,” he said. “If we had to do it all over again, I’m not 
     sure we would start without a canceled check procedure.” A 
     spokesperson for Cyberbills said customers must provide physical 
     proof they own an account before they are allowed to draw funds 
     from it to pay bills. But Khalidi was critical of X.com — and 
     Wingspan and CyberBills — for acting slowly in response to his 
     company’s crisis. “It took them more than one week (to stop the 
     criminal activity),” he said. “The only reason they knew we 
     were getting hit was because we told them.” 

                 
     CyberBills disputes that, saying it kept the account                
     open during that time at Auto Europe’s request. The 
     company also claims to have discovered the scam itself 
     using “internal security procedures.” 

     He believes the scam artist posted the account information 
     on the Internet to flood it with fraudulent charges, 
     creating a smoke screen that would make tracking the 
     criminal harder for investigators. Auto Europe’s Net 
     experience should be a lesson to other businesses, he 
     said. Even if they have no dealings at all on the 
     Internet, they can still be a victim of an Internet scam. 
     “As long as you are vigilant you can protect yourself,” he 
     said. “We check our accounts every day.”

      Ferreting Out Spies
      Program To Detect Classified Information In E-Mail 


      By Frank Munger
      Scripps Howard News Service
      K N O X V I L L E, Tenn., Jan. 26 — Work reportedly
      is progressing toward an autumn pilot project
      with Ferret, an artificial-intelligence concept
      that’s being developed at the Y-12 nuclear
      weapons plant to scan e-mail for classified
      information. 
           “Right now we seem to be pretty much on track,” said
      Peter Kortman, program manager at Lockheed Martin
      Energy Systems, the contractor operating Y-12 for the
      federal government. 

      Still in Initial Stages
      “We’re still in the initial stages, and the tough issues are
      being ferreted out (pun intended, presumably),” Kortman
      said. 
           One of the issues being addressed is how Ferret
      (formerly called Pherret) deals with the informal lingo
      sometimes used in e-mail. Apparently the system does
      quite well with the language used in formal documents and
      technical reports. 
           The initial use for Ferret would be to scan reports or
      messages that involve information related to nuclear
      weapons. It would help ensure that the information to be
      released freely and publicly does not contain classified
      matter. 
           Interestingly, the Ferret system can only be used on
      classified computer systems, according to Kortman. 
           Why? 
           Kortman explains: “In order to detect classified
      information, you have to have a pretty good idea of what
      it is. Therefore, that means the Ferret structure and
      knowledge base is really classified.” 
           Therefore, if Ferret was set up on an unclassified
      system, some clever person might be able to ask
      questions, play with information and phrase things
      differently until ultimately concluding — through trial and
      error — that certain items are classified. 

      Determining Ferret Likes, Dislikes
      “You could determine from your questions what Ferret
      likes and what Ferret doesn’t like,” Kortman said. 
           One of the time-consuming tasks associated with a
      prototype system like Ferret is feeding it information to
      help develop a knowledge base. That involves going rule
      by rule in classification guides, topic by topic, trying to
      incorporate as many descriptions of the same information
      as possible. 
           Once that information is there, however, Ferret has the
      capability to interpret and identify much, much more in
      terms of concepts and word relationships. 
           “We have a weapons expert working with us ... and
      using his experience and expertise to ask Ferret different
      types of questions,” Kortman said. 
           It’s impossible, of course, to make a system foolproof
      because there are so many ways of saying things, and
      Ferret won’t break down codes and muzzle spies. It’s
      main task is to help prevent the inadvertent, accidental
      release of classified information. 
           But this little slice of artificial intelligence is expected to
      do that task at least as well as some of the plant’s top
      classification reviewers and probably do it a lot faster. 
           “What we’re finding is that Ferret does remarkably
      well,” Kortman said. “I’m very happy with it.” 
           In a recent issue of Lockheed Martin Today, the
      developers of Ferret offered a simple description of how
      the system works: 

      Protecting Classified Recipes
      Suppose you run a restaurant and want to protect the fact
      that the secret ingredient in your hugely popular coffee
      pastries is cappuccino. 
           In making up a new menu, your assistant pens this
      description of the pastries: “Our chef highly recommends
      his deliciously moist chocolate cake imbued with the
      richness and warmth of strong, creamy coffee.” Makes
      you want one on the spot, but would Ferret like it? Let’s
      see. 
           Ferret would “know” that cake is a pastry. It also
      would know that cappuccino is generally espresso with
      extra milk or cream and chocolate added. It associates
      “creamy” with extra cream or milk, and it is reasonably
      sure, in a restaurant context, that “strong” and “coffee”
      together implies “espresso.” 
           Voila! Ferret concludes that your menu suggests pastry
      with cappuccino and, hence, that it contains “classified
      information.” Send that menu back to the kitchen!

      WASHINGTON (January 27, 2000 6:35 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
      Some readers who bought copies of USA Today on Thursday did double-takes 
      after a group of peace activists wrapped some papers in a fake front page 
      with the masthead: "USA Decay." 

      Officials with USA Today said they did not know how many streetside 
      newspaper boxes had been targeted or how many newspapers were affected, 
      but the group claimed to have hit boxes in nine cities, including Boston, 
      New York,       Washington, Denver and San Francisco. 

      The organization that claimed responsibility calls itself Shiftdough.org. 
      In a press release, the group described its members as a "collection of 
      activists who call for shifting dough out of the Pentagon budget and into 
      human needs,"       such as education, health care and the environment. 

      The release gave no information on how to contact the members, and on the 
      Web site, they acknowledge trying to conceal their identities. The site is 
      hosted by a Burlington, Vt., company and is registered to Michael Dorfman 
      of Floro,       Norway. 

      "I set up the Web site and put together the list of the links. That was my 
      contribution, but I was not involved at all in this newspaper action," 
      Dorfman said Thursday when contacted by phone. "Shiftdough is kind a loose 
      affiliation of       activists. I definitely support what it stands for." 

      But Dorfman said he did not know how many people were members of the 
      group, how many newspaper boxes had been hit, or who was responsible for 
      altering the newspapers. 

      Bob Dubill, executive editor of USA Today, said the newspaper's lawyers 
      were checking whether the group's action was a violation of any state or 
      federal laws. He said he learned of the mock pages from readers and 
      employees. 

      "We're looking into the matter," said Dubill, declining to comment 
      further. 

      The fake front page, made to resemble the real thing, probably would not 
      have fooled anyone for long. One headline read "Pentagon to Throw Bombs 
      Away," and another was "Defense, Education Departments to Merge." The 
      "Newsline       section" of the real paper was renamed "Newslime." 

      The spoof of the newspaper also offered the following travel tip
      "Call your travel agent to see if your destination country is 
      currently in the process of being bombed by the USA."

      Nando;
      
      (Site spewed raw HTML data at me, if anything is messed up blame me, k? k. - Ed)
      
      (January 30, 2000 12:14 a.m. EST 
      
      - A few days ago, I picked up a new computer modem at a local retailer. 
      As  the sales clerk was preparing a receipt, she asked for my Social 
      Security number. When I asked her why she needed that, she told me it 
      was "policy." I politely told her that I did not want to give it to 
      her. She seemed surprised and then dashed away to confer with a 
      superior. When she returned, she told me my number would not be 
      needed. 
        
         The sales clerk had technically not done anything illegal - she had 
      just asked for my Social Security number. If I had given it to her, her
      company, part of a national chain, would have had access to scads of 
      information about  me that has nothing to do with computer modems, but
      that they might have been able to sell to other businesses eager for 
      details on my credit history and buying habits. 
      
        It's just this kind of "policy" that is at the heart of Simson 
      Garfinkel's "Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st 
      Century." Garfinkel, who wrote about technology for the 
      Christian Science Monitor in the early 1990s, argues convincingly
      that our privacy is under assault from a variety of sources, including
      government agencies, talented computer-geek teens next door (or in 
      Timbuktu!), but most consistently from "capitalism, the free market,
      advanced technology, and the unbridled exchange of electronic information." 
       
        O'Reilly Books, the publisher of "Database Nation," compares it 
      to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," the book that almost 
      single-handedly started the environmental movement in the '60s. 
      Garfinkel is not the elegant writer that Carson is, but it's still not 
      a bad comparison. While issues of privacy have been debated far more 
      today than environmental concerns were in Carson's era, Garfinkel is 
      the first to decisively and persuasively marshal all the information 
      to show how privacy is under constant attack, often by people who 
      claim to have our best interests at heart. 
      
        It's this emphasis on the role that capitalism and the free market 
      play in diminishing our privacy in the name of making money that will 
      no doubt upset the most people. But as Garfinkel writes, the evidence 
      can't be ignored. These days, advertisers, venture capitalists, and 
      marketers demand more and more personal information about customers 
      before they'll advertise in the media, or back a new start-up, or 
      invest in an established company. Consequently, we're being asked for 
      more and more personal information from corner stores, online 
      retailers and mail-order firms. 
       
        Sometimes that information is gathered without our permission, as 
      shown by the recent Electronic Privacy Information Center report on 
      online retailers. (Not a single firm in the top 100 online retailers 
      had adequate privacy protection practices, and several dozen employed 
      ads that track your movements online even after you've left their 
      site.) 
       
        What I enjoyed most about "Database Nation" was Garfinkel's 
      ability to write about privacy issues without ranting or raving. The 
      picture he paints is clear, sharp, and focused - a wake-up call rather 
      than a fire alarm. And unlike many authors who only point to problems, 
      Garfinkel offers sound advice about alternatives to many 
      privacy-damaging practices. 
       
        For instance, he acknowledges the importance of protecting the 
      public against acts of terrorism. But he says this can be done without 
      infringing on the rights of private citizens or casting a wide net of 
      suspicion over an entire ethnic or religious group. What is required, 
      he writes, is careful planning and thoughtfulness about difficult 
      issues - something most government and private organizations are not 
      willing to do. 
       
        But Garfinkel's most interesting and probably most controversial 
      thesis is that government, rather than being the Big Brother of 
      George Orwell's "1984," is the average citizen's best friend in the fight
      to protect privacy - and that vigorous, muscular legislation, as opposed 
      to voluntary  standards, is the best way to protect citizens' rights. 
      <P> Garfinkel's book comes at a good time. Many experts believe that 
      privacy and security issues will ultimately dwarf the Y2K hysteria of 
      the past two years. "Database Nation" gives a way to detect the 
      privacy land mines in our culture and ultimately disarm them.

       (IDG) -- On Monday, January 24,
       authorities in Norway searched the
       home of Jon Johansen, a 16-year-old
       Norwegian member of the Masters of
       Reverse Engineering (MoRE) -- the
       group which created the DeCSS DVD playback utility for Linux. Jon and his
       father Per Johansen have both been indicted by Norway's Department of
       Economic Crime. 

       LinuxWorld talked to Jon about DeCSS, the investigation, the controversy
       -- and about why he feels that this case is at the same time so ridiculous and
       so important. 

       LinuxWorld: How did this whole thing start? How did you get involved
       with DVD and DeCSS? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, I got involved with DVD about two years ago. I
       bought my first DVD-ROM and an MPEG-2 decoder card. And, about at
       the end of September last year, I got in contact with a German computer
       programmer and a Dutch computer programmer, and we decided that it was
       time to add DVD support to Linux -- and, of course, to other operating
       systems, such as FreeBSD. 

       LinuxWorld: Had you expected any problems
       like this when you set about to make the player?

       Jon Johansen: We knew that they would probably go after someone. But
       when [Norwegian authorities] visited me yesterday with a search warrant, I
       really hadn't expected them to, because it's been about two or three months
       now since [the subject] first appeared in the media and, well, to me, that's a
       pretty long time. 

       LinuxWorld: You removed the code from
       your Webpages when they asked you to,
       and have been cooperating with what they
       have asked of you, is that right? 

       Jon Johansen: Actually, I was only linking
       [to the source code] and they wanted me to
       remove the link -- which I did, so that I
       could think it over. And then the link
       appeared again on my Website at the end
       of the week. 

       LinuxWorld: Did they question you at your
       house? 

       Jon Johansen: No. They took me to the
       local police station. But my father was sick,
       so they questioned him here at home. 

       LinuxWorld: But they just took you in for
       questioning -- they didn't arrest you or
       anything like that? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, the biggest Norwegian newspaper regarded this as an
       arrest, since they hadn't told us that they were coming and they brought me
       in. So the biggest Norwegian newspaper looked upon that as an arrest. 

       LinuxWorld: But did they give you a choice to not go in for questioning? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, of course I do have the right to have an attorney
       present. So I [could have] told them that I did not want to do it without an
       attorney, [and] they would have had to call my attorney and schedule an
       appointment. 

       LinuxWorld: And you didn't do that. 

       Jon Johansen: No, I didn't do that. 

       LinuxWorld: Why? 

       Jon Johansen: Basically, because I didn't have anything to hide. So I
       decided to cooperate. 

       LinuxWorld: The code that you wrote -- now, is it called DeCSS or is it
       CSS-auth? 

       Jon Johansen: It's called DeCSS. 

       LinuxWorld: OK. Because I've seen conflicting media reports on that, and
       other things. Like, some say that you are 15, others say you are 16. 

       Jon Johansen: I'm 16 now, I was 15 when it happened ... and the
       encryption code wasn't in fact written by me, but written by the German
       member. There seems to be a bit of confusion about that part. 

       LinuxWorld: The other two people that you had worked with to make the
       player are remaining anonymous -- is that right? 

       Jon Johansen: Yes, that is correct. 

       LinuxWorld: Do you think they will try to find out who they are from the
       data on your computer? 

       Jon Johansen: Yes, probably. They also asked what I knew about them.
       But I don't have the identity of any of them. I only had the nicks that they
       used on Internet Relay Chat. 

       LinuxWorld: And did you give those up? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, lately they have been changing nicks from time to
       time. So I gave one of the nicks they had used before. 

       LinuxWorld: Do you know why they want to remain anonymous? 

       Jon Johansen: They are both a lot older than me, and they are employed.
       So I guess they just didn't want the publicity, and they were perhaps afraid
       of getting fired. 

       LinuxWorld: And why is your father involved in this? 

       Jon Johansen: Basically because he owns the domain [at which] my
       Webpages were located. 

       LinuxWorld: And how do your parents feel about this whole thing? 

       Jon Johansen: They consider it [to be] just as stupid as I do. The charge is
       totally off-topic. It doesn't have anything to do with reality. 

       LinuxWorld: Do you know why they took your cell phone? 

       Jon Johansen: I asked them why, and they said that they considered it to
       be so advanced that they had to take it in, because it was a Nokia 91-10.
       And I did have, in fact, a backup of the source on it. 

       LinuxWorld: And do you know what is going to happen next? 

       Jon Johansen: They are currently investigating, and I still haven't received
       my computers back. So I have ordered a new one today, which I will be
       receiving on Friday. Which is a bit too late, because ABC News is coming
       tomorrow, and I was supposed to demonstrate DVD playback under Linux.
       So I'm going to call some people now and try to get hold of a computer with
       a DVD-ROM and get Linux installed on it. 

       LinuxWorld: So, can DeCSS in fact in any way be used for pirating? I
       mean, I realize that isn't the purpose for which it was written. 

       Jon Johansen: Well, yes, it can be used for pirating. Because you can
       decrypt a DVD disk and put it on your hard drive and then you can convert
       it, say, to VCD and then post it on the Internet. But tools to do that had
       already been available on the Internet, long before DeCSS, which was also
       a complete digital solution which gave you the same quality. So DeCSS
       didn't introduce anything new for pirating and had already been available. 

       LinuxWorld: So why do you think they are going after you, and not the
       authors of the other tools? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, the authors of the other tools are, as far as I know,
       anonymous. And [in] the charge, they say that the encryption is copy
       protection. But that's not correct at all. Anyone with a little computer
       experience knows that anything can be copied bit-by-bit with the right
       equipment. 

       LinuxWorld: And the authors of the other tools didn't break the
       encryption? Those previous tools had been written for the Windows
       platform, is that right? 

       Jon Johansen: Yes. There was one tool, I think it was called DVD-rip,
       which I believe actually hacked in to the Xing DVD player and then, when
       the Xing DVD player had decrypted the MPEG stream, the DVD-rip utility
       dumped that stream to disk and you had yourself an unencrypted DVD
       movie. 

       LinuxWorld: Well, it seems then all the more that they should be going after
       those other authors. 

       Jon Johansen: I guess it is because those other tools haven't received any
       media attention. But perhaps they don't even know about them -- but I
       would think that they do, because they are not that stupid. 

       LinuxWorld: Why did you decide to come forward and to not to remain
       anonymous? 

       Jon Johansen: We discussed it in the group and they thought it was OK,
       and I think the first reporter I talked to was from Wired. I think it was
       Declan [McCullugh], and he asked me if he could publish my name, and
       since we had already talked it over in MoRE, I said yes. 

       LinuxWorld: Are you sorry now that you did? 

       Jon Johansen: Not really, because I think the fight we are now fighting is a
       very important fight for free speech and for the open source community. 

       LinuxWorld: Why is it so important? 

       Jon Johansen: Basically, if reverse engineering is banned, then a lot of the
       open source community is doomed to fail. Because [you need to
       reverse-engineer] when creating software for compatibility with, for
       example, Microsoft Windows. For example, Samba was totally dependant
       on reverse engineering. Of course, the whole computer industry was allowed
       to reverse-engineer IBM's BIOS. 

       LinuxWorld: What was your reaction to the injunctions in the US? 

       Jon Johansen: I was a bit surprised, but then I read about how EFF [the
       Electronic Frontier Foundation] had presented the defense. And, if what I
       read on Slashdot about that was true, then I don't understand how exactly
       EFF could have argued that way. 

       LinuxWorld: Why? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, what I read on Slashdot was that they basically said
       that the encryption was bad, and it was kind of their fault. And I don't
       understand why they used those arguments. 

       LinuxWorld: What kind of arguments would you have expected, or what
       kind of arguments do you think might have been better? 

       Jon Johansen: I would have expected for them to try to explain to the
       court that this had nothing to do with copying, because encryption does not
       prevent copying -- which the DVD CCA [Copy Control Association] and
       MPAA are claiming. And everybody knows that even if something is
       encrypted you can still copy it if the reading of the data goes through
       decryption. 

       LinuxWorld: At the hearing I attended, the defense did argue that the DVD
       encryption was flawed. At the same hearing, the plaintiffs had some really,
       some pretty strong feelings about the way people have been acting when
       they repost the code. Do you know about that? 

       Jon Johansen: I did actually read on Slashdot where the plaintiffs had
       actually read from Slashdot debates. 

       LinuxWorld: Exactly. And they picked out only the ones which were saying
       things like "fuck the law." And so they picked those out on purpose and they
       said, "Look at these people. They don't want to play back movies. They are
       saying 'fuck the law.'" So do you have anything to say to people about that? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, that's really sad that they can't behave, because they
       should have known that the plaintiffs would have used something like that
       against us. They should stop doing things like that and help inform the media
       that this has nothing to do with copying but [rather has to do with] with
       playback. 

       LinuxWorld: How best can people help to do that? 

       Jon Johansen: Well, first of all they could head over to OpenDVD.org,
       and see what's written there, and then perhaps call or email their local media,
       and inform them about the case. 

       LinuxWorld: Thanks, Jon, for talking to us. We wish you the best of luck.

                        No Security Breach
                        Occurred, Online Bank
                        Says 
                        January 31, 2000: 2:23 p.m. ET


      SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A. (NB) -- By Kevin Featherly,
      Newsbytes. Officials at X.com are crying foul at the way an alleged "security
      breach" was played in the media last week, after reports surfaced that
      suspected thieves had accessed the online bank's Web site and transferred
      money to X.com accounts from unrelated accounts in other banks. 
       Bill Harris, X.com's CEO and the former CEO of Intuit, told Newsbytes this
      weekend that there was never a security breach or software bug in the X.com
      online banking system. Also, he said, the system was changed to a more
      tightly controlled one prior to reports surfacing in the media. 
       Harris acknowledged that six unauthorized transactions totaling less than
      $10,000 combined had taken place sometime between mid-December, when
      the company launched for business, and mid-January, when the system was
      changed. He acknowledged that the six transactions were "suspicious," and
      said they are being investigated. 
       "We had these six instances where people said (they) had unauthorized
      transfers," Harris said. "As a result, based on our own internal analysis, we
      instituted as of (Jan. 22) a policy where no transfers (were possible) without a
      voided check." 
       Until Dec. 22, Harris said, it was possible for customers to make
      transactions of up to $2,500 to or from other banks via the Web without having
      to send in voided copies of checks by fax. For two weeks or so at the
      beginning of the company's history, it had been possible to make a maximum
      of $15,000 in transfers to or from other banks without sending in voided checks.
      Now, all transactions must be preceded by a faxed copy of a voided check. 
       The system fell under scrutiny last week after the New York Times ran a
      story detailing the unauthorized money transfers, and referring to the issue as a
      security breach. 
       Meanwhile, Newsbytes quoted Elias Levy, chief technology officer at San
      Francisco-based SecurityFocus.com, who said that his company confirmed
      there was a problem by setting up an account with X.com, and attempting to
      perform a transfer from one SecurityFocus staff member's bank account into an
      X.com account created in another employee's name. Within a couple of days,
      the money transfer went through, Levy said. 
       SecurityFocus.com then alerted X.com to the problem. But the bank had
      already changed the system to a more restrictive one by then, Levy said. 
       X.com's Harris said that nobody from SecurityFocus talked to any
      management staff at the online bank, but said it might be accurate, as Levy
      indicated, that he had talked to bank technicians to alert them to what they had
      done. 
       In any case, Harris said, there was never a security problem. "The issue is
      one of policy and what policy do we use to allow people to do electronically,"
      Harris said. "The policy that we had been using was one where, up to a certain
      limit people were allowed to do electronic fund transfers to and from their own
      bank account by entering in the numbers of those bank accounts. That's
      actually a practice that is fairly common." 
       Harris compared the practice to the method many e-commerce sites use to
      transact with credit card holders. Many times, he said, purchases are made in
      which there is no physical evidence verifying a cardholder's validity. The
      account numbers are inputted into Web forms, and the transaction takes place.

       "Obviously, with either a credit card or bank account number, if you accept
      that information from an individual without seeing the physical card or physical
      check, there's a chance that the person might get it wrong - mis-enter it or
      misspeak or misinterpret the wrong number," Harris said. "Or, they may
      consciously provide the wrong number." 
       Harris has a point, says Rob Leathern, a Jupiter Communications analyst
      familiar with online banking. Bank fraud is fairly common in the traditional world,
      he said, and if there were only six unauthorized transactions from X.com, the
      percentage of their clients victimized by fraud may actually be smaller than is
      typically found in the brick-and-mortar banking industry. 
       However, reality is one thing, perceptions another. The issue at X.com was
      sufficiently severe to prompt David Kennedy, director of research services at
      computer security firm ICSA.net, to call on the company to go out of business. 
       Such draconian measures are hardly called for, says Leathern, who thinks
      the matter has been blown out of proportion in the press. Still, being an online
      bank with a high-profile CEO makes the company vulnerable to such
      accusations, Leathern said. And because the public at large is not yet
      comfortable with online banking, the bar for security must be set higher at
      companies like X.com, he said. 
       "I do think that they do need to pay close attention to this kind of stuff,
      because there is attention," Leathern said. "With a bank, someone is trusting
      you with their money, so they need to be real careful about the way they
      manage the consumer's expectations and their concerns. I think to a certain
      extent, they have to pay more attention to stuff." 
       X.com is a division of La Jara, Colo.,-based First Western National Bank.

      That's Where the Money Is
      Hold Onto Your Wallet, Because
      Computer Crime Is Growing Up 
 
      By Robert X. Cringely 
 
      Several years ago at the very first DefCon hacker's
      conference in Las Vegas, Dan Farmer sat like a rock star
      in the back of the meeting room in the old Sands Hotel.
      Dressed entirely in black leather with shoulder length
      flaming red hair, Dan sat trading kisses with two girls
      while the other speakers droned on. In a culture where
      nerds speak of women generally as a concept rather than an experience, to see
      a techie with groupies was a phenomenon. It got even better when Dan finally
      took his turn at the podium and I learned his position in those days was head of
      network security for Sun Microsystems. And his message to this room half-filled
      with young computer criminals and half-filled with Feds trying to not look like
      Feds was that their efforts were pathetic and boring. Farmer urged them, if they
      were going to insist on trying to break-in to his network, that they at least come
      up with techniques that were more clever, more deserving of his attention. 
 
      This scene has returned to my memory many times since, but especially lately as
      a new batch of computer criminals seems to be at work. You've seen the
      stories. Moving-on from simple destruction and mayhem, the new game is
      blackmail. Some smart kid steals a few thousand passwords or credit card
      numbers, then uses that theft to extort money from ISPs and e-commerce sites.
      Only it doesn't work. So far as we know, the ISPs and e-commerce people
      aren't paying-up. Or are they? Whether they are or not, I am sure that Farmer
      would find it boring. I know I do. 
 
      Since I have in the past known a few people operating on the shady side of
      computer law, my take on this extortion racket is that they are trying to create
      what they believe to be a victimless crime. Of course it isn't victimless at all. The
      other attraction is the juvenile satisfaction of trumpeting the crime: "I did this to
      you, now pay-up." Professional criminals would rather their crime go
      undetected. These are not professionals. 
 
      What we are seeing, though, is a progression of criminal acts headed in an
      escalating direction. There will come a time when ego will be put aside and
      somebody is going to steal some major bucks. And if the FBI or any other
      organization says it can't be done, well, they are wrong. It will happen. 
 
      The point of this column is to give the lay reader a sense of where we currently
      stand in this war to protect our bytes from being bitten. This is another one of
      those columns the nerds will see as simplistic and useless, except I pretty much
      guarantee a close reading will tell most of them something they didn't know
      before. 
 
      So, in a world where money isn't greenbacks anymore but electrons flowing
      through a global network, where teenagers seem to crack Pentagon computers
      with impunity, where most of us have no idea at all how any of this is
      accomplished or how to protect ourselves, is our wealth really secure? What's
      to keep some kid from stealing our IRAs and Keoghs, our CDs and mutual
      funds, even our identities? Just how safe is our information and, by implication,
      our money? Are the ways we do business going to have to change? The bad
      news says that nothing is secure. With enough effort, every technology that we
      have to protect the data we call money can be broken. The good news is that it
      nearly always costs more to gain access to our holdings than those holdings are
      worth. If it costs $100,000 to steal $10,000, nobody will even bother -- or
      that's the theory. 
 
      What keeps you from losing your credit card number to some thief when you
      buy a book or CD at Amazon.com? This is the key question that dogs the
      proponents of consumer E-commerce. Forget that we hand the same credit card
      without hesitation to a waiter who might be a career felon, or give the number
      over the phone to a salesperson who might be working on a telephone bank in
      some minimum-security prison. People distrust machines, and they are not at all
      embarrassed to express that distrust. So what's to keep Amazon.com or
      someone else from stealing our information? 
 
      Beyond simple morality and ethics, there are two things keeping Amazon.com
      from robbing us blind: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wants to remain a billionaire,
      and our credit-card information is scrambled, or encrypted, before it is sent over
      the Net. Bezos knows he makes more money by selling books than he could by
      stealing from his customers, so he doesn't steal. That keeps Amazon honest.
      Scrambling the credit card information makes an honest person of everyone else
      who might be in a position to snoop on your shopping session -- say, a
      technician at your Internet service provider. To make sure your credit card
      numbers remain private, use only Internet merchants that offer secure
      transactions. Before you push that "send" key, make sure the URL line on your
      web browser starts with "https," not just "http," or ends with "shtml." These
      mean your outgoing data is being encrypted. 
 
      Before we get too far into data encryption, understand that the single most
      popular technique for gaining access to online data is called by its proponents,
      "social engineering." This is strictly non-technical. Social engineering is a crook
      tricking us into giving him our Internet password or finding it by searching
      wastebaskets or looking over shoulders. Why bother to bring in the heavy
      computing firepower to crack a password if people will hand theirs over to
      someone who claims to be a customer service representative from the Internet
      service provider? This is why America Online makes such a point of reminding
      its users that the company will never ask them for their passwords. Social
      engineering is a greater threat than all the criminal supercomputers in the world. 
      
      Nearly all Internet commerce is protected, in whole or in part, by cryptographic
      software derived from the late-1970s work of three mathematicians at MIT --
      Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The Rivest, Shamir,
      Adleman algorithm, generally known as simply RSA, represents both a method
      of scrambling a message between two parties in a way that allows the message
      to be decoded only at its intended destination and a way of identifying the
      parties to each other. 
      
      The patented RSA algorithm comes in several levels of security, defined by the
      size of prime numbers that are used to generate both the encoding and decoding
      keys. Nearly all RSA codes use at least 512-bit numbers. (If your browser
      mentions 40-bit or 128-bit, this is just geekspeak for a complementary
      technology that works with RSA, trust me.) That's plenty secure for most
      purposes, though these days many web browsers and serious e-commerce sites
      have stepped up to 1,024-bit RSA, and the super-paranoid can encode their
      e-mail messages with 2,048- or even 4,096-bit encryption. More bits means it
      takes longer to encrypt and decrypt data, but the data is much more secure. 
      
      Some forms of encryption are cracked through a brute-force method that simply
      applies a mathematical test to the zillions of possible solutions until one is found
      that can decode the target message. RSA requires more sophisticated
      approaches. Five-hundred-twelve-bit RSA was cracked for the first time last
      August by 292 computers running on and off for seven months -- a total of 35
      years of computing time. What is significant about this is that earlier in this
      decade, the best guess said it would take 50,000 years of computing time to
      crack 512-bit RSA. 
      
      So it would take a massive effort to crack your credit card transaction, and
      that's only if your transaction could be isolated from the millions of others
      happening each day. On the face of it, e-commerce looks pretty secure. But
      there is a dark side to all this, which is the ability to use the Internet itself as a
      means to gang thousands, even millions, of computers together to attack such a
      problem, possibly without the computer owners' being aware their machines are
      being used. Take comfort that such firepower would more likely be applied to
      cracking some giant interbank money transfer than to gaining access to your
      Discover card. 
      
      To keep our money secure, the trend is toward harder and harder encryption
      using more bits. In this way, it is still quite easy to remain comfortably ahead of
      the criminal community. RSA 1,024-bit encryption is still wondrously secure, to
      say nothing of 2,048 and 4,096. For the spies among us who don't even trust
      RSA, there are whole new classes of codes based on elliptical mathematical
      functions that look to be even harder to crack. But just as cracking 512-bit RSA
      dropped from 50,000 years of computing time to 35 in less than a decade, the
      real concern among users of cryptography is that a breakthrough -- a secret
      breakthrough -- will allow devices to accomplish in seconds what used to take
      years. Just such a device was described last fall in a now discredited story in
      The Times of London. The handheld device was supposed to have been
      invented at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science and was claimed to crack
      512-bit RSA in microseconds. 
      
      Such a device is probably decades away, but then cracking 512-bit RSA was
      supposed to take 50,000 years and turned out not to. There is no way of
      knowing when a breakthrough in quantum computing or another field will make
      such a device possible. But I can tell you how to know when it has happened.
      The inventors of such a device wouldn't be content with stealing credit card
      numbers or siphoning pennies from checking accounts. These would be big
      thinkers. They would have the ability to literally take control of the world
      financial system with their device. So we'd awaken one day to a
      back-to-the-future moment in which some gargantuan shift of resources would
      have taken place in a manner that would be difficult or impossible to reverse.
      These are, after all, only the electronic equivalent of ledger entries we are talking
      about. And on that fateful morning we would wake to find that Russia was
      suddenly the economic superpower and that the U.S. was begging for foreign
      aid. 
      
      Now THAT would impress Dan Farmer.

      With the cold war all but over international spies need
      new employment. many of them are earning a living
      snooping around on the internet. With their services for
      hire anyone can get the information they desire.

                                                             By David Ignatius
                                                              WASHINGTON POST

       WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 —  So you think your computer communications are safe
       and secure? Hah! You poor, deluded, vulnerable fool. Experts in the 
       security business confide that most computer networks are wide open to
       attack by dedicated hackers. Indeed, they describe some real-world 
       electronic assaults that would make your bytes turn into bits.
       
       WANT TO BREAK into one of Switzerland’s most
       famous private banks and look at its accounts? Not a problem. 

       Want to break into the computer of a key government agency of a big 
       European country and read messages tasking its security officers? Not
       a problem. 
       
       Want to crack corporate networks and read the e-mail traffic? Not a
       problem. In fact, that’s so easy it’s done routinely.
                
       HACKERS FOR HIRE 
          We’re not talking here about electronic intercepts by
       the National Security Agency or black-bag jobs by the
       CIA, mind you. These operations are conducted by the
       growing global network of private security consultants, using
       sophisticated hacking tools that most of us don’t begin to
       understand. 
    
            An example of the hackers’ tool kit is something called
       a “packet sniffer.” Once the hacker gains access to the
       electronic transmissions passing through a computer
       network (which isn’t as hard as you might think) the packet
       sniffer allows him to read the electronic bundles of
       information — those little ones and zeros streaming over the
       Net — and translate them into readable computer files. An
       apprentice hacker can download the software needed for a
       packet sniffer from one of many sites on the Net. 
                
       IN FROM THE COLD 

       'Companies are much more vulnerable to electronic attack
       than they realize: corporate firewalls are laden with
       hidden trapdoors that give access to hackers. '

                What’s happening, in effect, is the privatization of some
       of the most powerful tools traditionally used by intelligence
       agencies — which allow them to overhear our
       conversations and read our mail. The new privateers are
       mostly former spies and law enforcement officers — from
       Washington to Paris to Moscow to Canberra — who are
       out now, and offering their skills on the open market.
       They’re working with former colleagues and liaison contacts
       around the world — and with the hacker underground — to
       get the information they need. 
              “The Cold War is over,” explains one member of this
       private security brotherhood. “People in police and security
       services are just trying to make money.” One ripe source of
       information is the hundreds of agents overseas who were
       dumped by the CIA in the budget cuts of the mid-’90s.
       Many of them are freelancing now.
              
       HOW TO HIRE A SPY
              If you want access to this network, you can start by
       contacting one of the high-powered Washington or New
       York law firms. They, in turn, will contact a private security
       firm, which will contact a consultant, who will contact
       another consultant, who will work with hackers, cops,
       second-story artists — whoever is needed to get the job
       done. 
              Typically, the person who initiates a request for
       information at one end of the chain has no idea who actually
       obtains it, or what methods were used. The sources are
       shielded by what are known in the spy world as “cut-outs.” 
              If you saw the 1998 movie “Ronin,” you have an idea
       of how the security brotherhood works. The Ronin are
       modern-day equivalents of samurai warriors who have been
       decommissioned after a war and are wandering the
       landscape looking for work. The movie’s plot is fanciful, but
       the portrait it draws of a fraternity of ex-spooks for hire is
       quite accurate.
              
       COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
       
       ‘The Cold War is over. People in police and security services are just
        trying to make money.’ IN PRIVATE SECURITY SPECIALIST
        
              Companies that want to protect themselves against
       these electronic attacks should consider investing in
       counter-intelligence. An example of what’s available comes
       from Michael L. Puldy, who heads IBM’s Emergency
       Response Service. He runs a group of about 100 people
       worldwide, who help IBM clients clean up the damage from
       electronic break-ins and try to prevent them from happening
       in the first place. 
              Puldy explains that companies are much more
       vulnerable to electronic attack than they realize. They may
       think they’re protected by so-called “fire walls” that screen
       who gets into the network. But if the fire-wall software is
       installed right out of the box, it usually contains default
       passwords and other trapdoors that allow smart hackers to
       get in. 
              Puldy’s group mainly does electronic “perimeter
       checks,” looking for holes in a company’s network, along
       with installing “intrusion detection monitors,” which sense
       when a hacker is trying to break in. 
              
       ETHICAL HACKING 
       One ripe source of information is the hundreds of agents
       overseas who were dumped by the CIA in the budget cuts of 
       the mid-’90s. Many of them arefreelancing now.... 

              But IBM also offers a more aggressive “Ethical
       Hacking Service,” which for a fee will actually break into
       your system and show just how vulnerable it is. Puldy says
       that IBM’s ethical hackers can penetrate more than 75
       percent of the systems they attack. Once inside, they can
       find password files, break into the corporate e-mail server
       and read everyone’s mail — sometimes even get into the
       CEO’s hard drive and read his most private files. 
              Packet sniffers are the enemy, in Puldy’s world. He
       says that cable modems are especially vulnerable, because
       given most existing cable technology, it’s easy to read the
       other computers on a neighborhood cable loop. “If you’re
       on the neighborhood ring, you can put a sniffer on the cable
       and watch everything I do on my computer — stock trades,
       passwords, e-mails, everything,” says Puldy. It’s harder to
       crack “digital subscriber line” or DSL technology that’s
       used to provide high-speed connections over phone lines —
       but not impossible. 
              “Given enough time and effort, you can break into
       anything you want to,” says Puldy. 
              Civil libertarians still seem to focus their angst on
       privacy threats from government intelligence and
       law-enforcement agencies, but they’re way behind the time.
       Like everything else in the global economy, snooping has
       been privatized.

      this first issue, but we'll have to see.  I'd like to see this zine
      diverge a little from the standard 'security info' theme and get into

            *** My Life As A Happy Hacker : Kynik
      ***********************************************************************
      
      A long time ago (probably 3-4 years) on a computer lab workstation far,
      far away (ok, it was the Midwest) I discovered the Happy Hacker in my
      quest for knowledge of the computer sort.  I found it after sifting
      through search engine results of the keyword 'hacker'.  I had been
      inspired by such movies as "Wargames" and "Sneakers" and realized that
      there was a lot more to this computer thing than Doom and Microsoft Word.
      Having realized this, I dove headfirst into the web, trying to find a
      place that suited my wants and actually had an air of intelligence.
      
      Many of the sites I found were crude and obviously created by
      middle-school-aged kids looking to mess with their friends on AOL.  Two
      things I found caught my attention immediately: Silicon Toad and The Happy
      Hacker mailing list.  I proceeded to download a whole pile of programs
      from Silicon Toad's site, and played with them on my computer at home, but
      beyond that, didn't do too much.  I checked in on it every once in awhile,
      until the site disappeared.  I kept on getting the happy hacker
      newsletter, and found out how to do some neat, trivial things such as
      changing my Windows 95 splash screen for startup and shutdown.
      
      Then I began to read about some of the things that people had done with
      their computers, and against the list founder, Carolyn Meinel.  I didn't
      think too much about this at the time, but kept my interested fascination
      with the whole 'hacker culture' as I progressed with my Computer Science
      degree.  I continued to receive the digest, and towards the end of 1998, I
      got a Happy Hacker digest with a request for a new UNIX editor.  Having
      read most of the info out there about Carolyn Meinel and the general
      consensus about her, I thought about it carefully before I sent in an
      application.  I realized the stigma that currently goes along with CPM and
      the Happy Hacker name, but after consideration, I thought I'd try to keep
      alive the idea that got me into the Happy Hacker in the first place:
      Knowledge and Ethics.  Granted, CPM is currently more interested in money
      and promoting herself than educating and instilling ethics, from what I've
      seen.
      
      I emailed her, and asked if the position was still available.  She asked
      me to write a Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Hacking (GTMHH) on any topic I
      chose.  I chose to write a beginner's guide to C++, since there already
      was one for C.  Well, I sent her a small piece of what I had written, and
      she advised me that Guide submissions are generally much longer.  So I set
      off to flesh it out and expand on the parts she said were somewhat
      lacking.  I got about 2/3 of the way through it, and grad school and work
      took precedence.  A few weeks later, totally to my surprise, I got an
      email from Carolyn asking me if I wanted the position.  I said yes, we
      exchanged our PGP keys, I got the passwords to the unixeditor POP account,
      and I started reading submissions and putting them together to form the
      Happy Hacker UNIX digest.  To see the digests, as they were submitted to
      Carolyn, go to the following URL:
      
      http://fire.gh0st.net/hh/index.html
      
      The first few digests were pretty weak, as most of the questions I got
      were rather bland, and I was still getting the feel of the position.  I
      got very few flames, and a lot of praise.  I realized that I might
      actually be making a difference to some people, trying to help them
      understand the basics (and some details) of UNIX and computer security.
      When I heard that Carolyn had moved the HH mailserver over to an
      AntiOnline computer, I wasn't thrilled, but I really didn't care all that
      much at the moment.  Keydet89, the windows editor, apparently left because
      of this, which was rather sad, because he always had good perl snippets in
      his digests.  (Send me an email keydet, if you wanna tell about your
      experience, or write some articles :)
      
      Then I thought about it.  I looked back at AntiOnline's features section,
      and I thought about JP's article on "Hacker Profiling".  Pieces started to
      fit together.  I thought about the possibility that JP was making copies
      of any mails that I received as a submission and adding them to his pile
      of material to be filtered and info to be added to the 'hacker database'.
      See, a lot of times I'll be sent an email claiming to have broken into a
      site and wanting to know what to do from there.  (Or, someone requests me
      to break into a site for them -- which I'd consider doing, provided you're
      paying me and the site is yours.)  In the second-last HH digest, I
      included a link to my PGP key, and an alternate email address that people
      could write to.  I'd say about half of the respondents used the other
      email address... and 2 or 3 used the PGP key.  I realized that I needed a
      bit more creative freedom, without eyes peeking over my shoulders.
      
      So, I teamed up with some people I had met online, and had been working
      with for a little while, and offered to create a new zine, with an
      emphasis on computers, security, and music.  I wanted to give the people
      that needed a certain amount of mentoring a chance to get some people to
      talk to if they needed help.  I found out that there was a similar group
      of people working on a project similar to the Happy Hacker wargames, but
      cooler, and I started hanging out with them as well.  So, here ends my
      Happy Hacker story.  I know I've left out some minor details, but don't
      worry, they weren't that important.  Let's have a big round of applause
      for the gh0st.net and FireStorm guys!  Hopefully the projects will pick up
      soon, and there will be more to see on both the fire.gh0st.net and
      www.gh0st.net sites.

            *** Onion Routing : Kynik
      ***********************************************************************
      
      While it seems that the term "Onion Routing" may be copyrighted, I feel
      that it is a good description of the technology.  Onion Routing is an
      Internet-based system to prevent eavesdropping and traffic analysis. The
      name "Onion Routing" is appropriate, since it is based upon adding several
      layers of encryption to a message (and removing them) as it is passed
      along the network, as one might remove the layers of an onion.  (I suppose
      one could also call it 'artichoke routing' too ;)  This is essential to a
      network where privacy and anonymity is important.
      
      "Well, so what about privacy, everything I'm sending to that site is
      encrypted with SSL, anyways", you may say.  That's all fine and dandy, but
      chances are, anybody monitoring you knows at least that you've been there,
      since the destination address is plainly readable in the IP header.
      That's where the anonymity portion comes in.  Someone between you and the
      website you're visiting is _not_ able to tell (easily) where you're going,
      or even where you're coming from.  There are two notable systems in
      use/development today (at least what I've initially found).  They are:
      
      Freedom - "Internet Identity Management System"
      http://www.zeroknowledge.com/products/
      
      The Onion Router Project (US Naval Research Lab)
      http://www.onion-router.net/
      
      There are some differences between the two, but I'm not going to analyze
      them.  Now, how does this all work, you ask?  The scheme is built upon
      public-key encryption (of varying strengths) and a 'private' network of
      routers.  Basically, your packet doesn't take the direct route across the
      net like you'd expect it to.  Instead, it is sent to a specialized
      computer which runs the 'onion routing software'.  That 'onion router'
      (OR) hands the packet off to the next designated OR, which continues to
      forward it on, until the last OR designated finally delivers it to the
      true destination.  I don't want to get into the mechanics for establishing
      routes and vendor-specific details like Freedom's Anonymous Mail Proxy,
      but instead I will explain the generic mechanism that allows you to send
      anonymous, private traffic across the internet via onion routing.
      
      A fairly good paper, by Goldschlag, Reed and Syverson, entitled, "Onion
      Routing for Anonymous and Private Internet Connections," does a thorough
      job of explaining this technology:
      
      http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/CACM-1999.pdf
      
      From the paper:
      
        Onion Routing operates by dynamically building anonymous connections
        within a network of real-time Chaum Mixes.  A Mix is a store and forward
        device that accepts a number of fixed-length messages from numerous
        sources, performs cryptographic transformations on the messages, and
        then forwards the messages to the next destination in a random order.
        A single Mix makes tracking of a particular message either by specific
        bit-pattern, size, or ordering with respect to other messages difficult.
        By routing through numerous Mixes in the network, determining who is
        talking to whom becomes even more difficult.  Onion Routing's network of
        core onion-routers (Mixes) is distributed, fault-tolerant, and under
        the control of multiple administrative domains, so no single onion-
        router can bring down the network or compromise a user's privacy, and
        cooperation between compromised onion-routers is thereby confounded.
      
      Freedom's system might be slightly different in implementation, but again,
      I'm ignoring details, and loving every minute of it!  When a specific
      message needs to be sent through the onion-routed network, several layers
      of encryption are placed on the message, along with sufficient information
      to describe the path on a step-by-step basis.  This way, each onion router
      along the way uses its own public key to decrypt the whole 'onion', at
      which point it recognizes the next onion router in the route, and forwards
      the partially-decrypted message to it.  When the enveloped message
      eventually reaches the final onion router, it is decrypted to cleartext,
      and the message is passed to the destination, not too differently from if
      the source host had simply connected in the clear over the Internet,
      except for the fact that it was made virtually untraceable for the
      duration of its trip from end to end.
      
      Feel free to send me questions and commentary on anything I may have

            *** The gh0st.net Project (Part 1 of 2): Phatal
      ***********************************************************************
      
        Gh0stnet in its simplest and most basic form is a security model.  As a
      security model, gh0stnet's integrity is maintained by the fact that it
      protects access, whether this be access to data or some other resource
      makes no difference.  Complication occurs when we examine gh0stnet's
      purpose.
      
        The theme is not necessarily to provide an ultra-secure network... it's
      simply to provide security.  Whether the provision of security is done
      well or even in a rational manner is up to us as developers.  Further
      complicating this matter is the concept of providing a security challenge
      or novelty to the public.  Are we targeting a specific group of people to
      benefit from gh0stnet?  As far as I'm concerned, no.  While we are all
      obviously aware that gh0stnet's existence specifically caters to a certain
      type of computer user, there's been no real intention to do so.  By virtue
      of not being funded by a corporation or the government and also by the
      virtue of being conceptualized by someone who spends the better part of
      his day immersed in computer security, the compsec underground will
      inevitably be an integral part of gh0stnet.  Hopefully this will be one of
      its greatest assets.
      
        Although the physical establishment of gh0stnet is still in the works, I
      have a feeling that's going to be the easy part.  I'm putting energy into
      gh0stnet with the intention that it will long surpass my interest.  As a
      field of study and a science, computer security is an evolving subject.
      If gh0stnet is to ever provide anything substantial to its public, it will
      have to reflect this.
      
      Development:
        This is the area that gh0stnet should be the most active in.  If there's
      one thing I hate it's purposeless work.  What I hate more than purposeless
      work is being bored.  From my perspective, I would prefer to do more than
      set up a number of boxes to let people hammer into the ground.  It would
      be fun to look at the logs for a while, but ultimately it would become
      boring.
      
        I'm interested in using gh0stnet as a testbed for alternative,
      ingenuitive, and challenging security concepts.  This would provide tons
      of fun for us, something interesting to give to the users besides boxen to
      break into, and more than likely create some very interesting offspring.
      Software or hardware, it's all a matter of what contributions we as
      individual developers have to offer.
      
      Participation:
        This is an area that I tend to give a lot of thought to. As "developers"
      we really do more than just develop.  We maintain and administer gh0stnet.
      This is not a job. Participation is totally interest-based.  I'm not one
      to force people into doing something that they don't want to.  If it
      appears that the role you're taking in this project is not quite what you
      want or what you expect, it's important that you speak up.  I sacrifice a
      lot of my free time for this but I don't neccessarily expect others to.
      The project does have a well-defined vision/goal that I may be relatively
      inflexible about, but not unapproachable.  What I will be very wary of is
      the inclusion of other individuals outside of my sphere of influence.
      This is a delicate project from my standpoint, so I'm a little touchy as
      to who deals with it.  To have one person on board who doesn't quite see
      the goal or has some other motives besides the prosperity of gh0stnet
      would have a negative impact on the project.  Stating this here serves no
      other purpose than for you folks to be aware that I want a shiny, happy,
      rosey environment in which I deal with people who I know and trust.  Not
      that I don't like contributions, but network management and planning
      should pretty much be kept between us developers.
      
        The most important part of getting this off the ground will be the
      communication that goes on between all of us.  Hopefully most of the
      communication will be occurring on the gh0st.net box, courtesy of TF.
      Toxy has also been threatening to start a mailing list and that sounds
      kick ass to me.  Natas, kp2, and I live in the same state and hopefully
      we'll all be getting drunk together soon ; ).

      [Editor's note: I've taken the liberty to publish this article by Fire

      its original form, except for formatting to fit the page, and minor
      spelling corrections.]
      
        To most of the people whom will read this, I have no credibility - why
      should you listen to me?  Well, because if you read any farther, I'm sure
      you will find that I'm not writing about anything extreme; these are our
      rights.
      
        Recently, in retaliation to school violence, people are working to
      suppress information pertaining to explosives; keep it out of the hands of
      youngsters.  Although, this movement is not focusing on just that, rather
      make an exception to our rights, and quiet what we don't want people to
      hear.  You see, this country is based on tolerance.  Some may be
      prejudiced, but we as a whole, in this country, don't just go off destroy
      the minority.  We tolerate it, because if one day our rights are
      threatened, we can count on other people to fight with us.  It's about
      power of people, and not everyone can get what they want - so we must be
      tolerant, even if we don't totally agree with it.
      
        The movement is contradicting itself.  People want to educate the masses
      into an objective whole, yet want to shut out information, and take the
      philosophy, "Ignorance is bliss".  We should work towards happiness,
      because anyone can learn to KILL; bombs, guns, knives, etc. are beside
      the point.  People kill because of many reasons, and "now they can" isn't
      it.
      
        The general public is quick to say that bombs, guns, and "outcasts"  are
      the reason for this school violence problem.  Wrong.  Students don't kill
      just because they _can_, it's because, perhaps they're miserable?  Perhaps
      they're implementing the violence many students just think about?  My
      opinion is yes; I've even tempted to say majority by far think about
      violence as an outlet.
      
        "Wackos" just don't think about violence; everyone does and sometimes we
      actually do what we plan.  I'm not trying to justify what these people do,
      but I'm saying this isn't just some isolated cases.  Something is wrong.
      I personally think it's new presures in society today and the school
      enviroment.  Keep in mind that the basic idea/concept of how school works
      has never changed.  This "concept" isn't education, it's the enviroment,
      which is stressful and obviously causes violence.  You may say something
      to the effect, "Stress is a natural part of life".  I agree with you, but
      these are CHILDREN we're talking about, and they obviously can't cope.
      
        Back on the subject of unalienable rights. If we make an exception,
      we'll find ourselves taking away our own rights, _one_by_one_.  There is
      NO exception, these are our RIGHTS!  There will always be someone you
      disagree with, but you'd better respect THEIR freedom, if you want them to
      respect YOUR freedom.  Because one day, your thoughts may not fit in with
      the majority.
      
      End points:
      
        People in the Untied States of America have the right of press; we can
      write about anything and everything.  If you dont like it, leave. See how
      other goverments deal with these things, and tell me how much you hate
      liberalism.
      
        Leave and go to a country where you can't say jack, and tell me how much
      you'd like to shut up those boisterous protestants.  This issue isn't
      something new.  Censorship itself is an exception we've made, and it's
      wrong.

      1. Introduction
      
      Here it is the first issue of Digital Defiance.  Let me provide some background info, On 
      June 13th of 1999 after the PLA 919 site had been taken down due to the fact that Code Zero 
      it's former founder had moved I decided to put PLA 919 back on the net.  July 1st of 1999 
      Pyro joined up with PLA 919, it was the start of a good friendship.  germ a friend of mine had 
      joined but was not prodominantly in the scene and so she left, Spy109 started PLA 252 and so
      he left.  On July 5th of 1999 I put out the first issue of PLA 919 along with an article or two
      from Pyro and two from germ.  After months of diliberation I decided I would freeze PLA 919 as
      a "zine" and keep it up as a page for NC phreaks to meet.  I didn't like the negative 
      connotations that arose with the acronym PLA and I felt that after some time I would do better 
      also with an independent organization.  Me and Pyro decided on Digital Defiance.  As of now
      the staff members of Digital Defiance are myself(Xenos), Pyro and a boy by the name of Toxis.
      Digital Defiance is situated at digital-defiance.hypermart.net but if you have this article you
      probally know that.  After the available funds are aquired I will be registering 
      www.digital-defiance.org.  As for now hypermart is great.  I hope that the readers of Digital
      Defiance are satisfied and will continue to be.  Now the cheezy part, SHOUTS:
      
      Pyro, Toxis, Geo, Tory, Kimmie, Ivy, Twinjames, Oktium, oreo, Claudia(better luck next time), 
      Gibson, Nikita, nite, Courtney, Yerba, heX, Subconcious, Myth, peak, Beaty,
      lots of other people that are going to beat me up after they see they aren't on here.
      
      Now on with the show.
      
      2. Feature of the Month: DialPad
      Well, I first came upon this one when I was looking for a way to get my computer to record my 
      prank calls directly, instead of to a tape recorder and then to my computer. One of my friends 
      suggested a service called DialPad so I checked it out. I was never able to DialPad to work 
      that way because the computer only records my side of the conversation well but the other side
      is left sounding faint and distant but the service is still kick-ass.
      
      So, what is DialPad? DialPad is a free online service that allows you to make uncharged calls 
      to about anywhere. It does not allow 900 numbers from what I can tell, so you phone sex freaks
      will have to take it elsewhere. Basically what happens is when you log into your account is 
      this nifty Java applet pops up which allows you to make phonecalls. You punch in the numbers 
      and then press dial and there you have it. You can even call someone else who is on the service
      if they are using dial pad at the same time but it sounds real messed up. Some other problems 
      I have encountered is that your voice seems kinda lowered and distorted to people on the phone
      that you call with DialPad but they can still make out what you are saying. In many ways that 
      is almost a plus as it makes for hilarious pranking. My personal favorite is calling 
      1-800-COLLECT and getting operator assistance. It's real fun to just trying to get into 
      conversations with the operators. 
      
      Now, you would probably hold back from pranking because you don't feel like getting in trouble,
      right? Well, actually, the ANI always seems to return an "Unknown Number" and I have tested 
      this on many different ANI's and VMB's and even the freaking operators seem to be stumped. For
      example, a couple times, I have called up an operator and in the background, in the bakaround 
      I heard a lot of funny stuff. Some of them were saying "God damn it, who is this guy!?" and 
      "Man, where are those little fuckers calling from?!". I laughed my ass of while they bitched
      to their coworkers and then hung up on me. One time, I called an operator and I mentioned that 
      I had been pranking them a lot that night (jist to piss her off) and she said "Well, yes. We 
      have been getting a lot of reports of that kinda thing." So, I asked what my number that I was 
      calling from was and well I could practically hear her head almost explode as she said that it
      "was none of my business!" This made me laugh because it was my business. I mean, I was calling
      from that number. It goes to show you that they really cannot trace you.
      
      So, stop by DialPad.com and have fun. One thing I suggest is that you give 'em fake info so if 
      they do get that far, they wont get any further. Have fun and be careful!
      
      3. Intercom Fun
      
      So hmmm its rainy today and you are really bored?  I have the remedy, your not paying the money
      for long distance calls to friends, your tired of TV, being a conf. whore just isn't settling
      with your stomach so, you give stuff away free at K-Mart.  Wait you say, I don't want to go to
      K-Mart and those of you underage are saying you can't drive, so why not take the PA.  
      
      The Planning:  
      There isn't much planning on my case cause I come up with fake names like that and fake titles
      and posistions in companys like that so just go grab your phone book(if you don't have on and
      say your a phreak go get one now before I beat you up)and look for the addresses of two 
      different K-Marts(you can substitute Target, Wal-Mart, etc..) Dial the target K-Mart and repeat
      something similar to the following, "Hi this is Jake Watson over at the Hamilton store, are you
      guys having some problems with your PA system(some people say intercom)"  be sure to have 
      gotten the manager first most of the time the other employees are just plain dumb.  He will 
      tell you know of course at which point you will say "Well we have been and I don't know what is
      going on, usually we use #50 and I remember the old manager said you guys had the same type
      system as us.  I was just wondering"  Let him get some words in it makes him feel special he 
      will probally just tell you that its working fine for him he doesn't know what's wrong.  You
      might even want to make up a sympton first like its giving you static when you press #50 or 
      something like that.  Then say "Well what is the extension you guys over their use?".  Hey will
      tell you after all you are over at the Hamilaton street store why would he suspect you are just
      some no good punk trying to give away his store?  Say well thanks anyway and say you will try
      that and have a good day and all that.  
      
      The Strike:
      Later on call the store back, you will probally get the help desk or something, I recommend 
      getting transfered to gardening or toys or something cause the help desk will probally say no 
      when you asked to be transfered to extension #8090 and they recongize its the PA extension.  
      Some places like Target I have heard will just transfer you back to the help desk if you ask 
      to be transfered.  Sometimes you get places that are like just hit #something when I put you 
      on hold.  Then hit the intercom extension.  You can stuff all sorts of stuff.  At a BeyondHope 
      convention they told everyone in the store that everything on Isle 4 was free, maybe say you 
      are the manager and spout racist statements.  In the end no one really gets hurt and you are 
      happy.  I once thought of getting a friend to be in electronics and then say everything there 
      was free.  I knew that if everyone grabbed stuff the alarms would go off like mad and your 
      friend could slip by un-noticed.  I don't recommend theivery though.
      
      Ok so I have told you what to do with K-Mart.  What about school fun.  This was actually an
      idea I had early on when I first went to school and it was actually done as a senior prank by
      some other guys.  Most schools if not all schools have an intercom system to page teachers and
      students when they need them to suspend them or bitch at them for showing bad movies or 
      something of that nature for either students or teachers.  Fortunate for the average student
      most school employees are really stupid when it comes to the technological aspect of their
      work.  For instance, my school allows use of all extensions from any phone hooked up to the 
      school's phone line.  So say you were a senior and you drilled a hole in the side of the 
      trailor and ran it out to the parking lot and played some vulgar tape after pressing #00 you 
      would have it played throughout the school just because you have an extension.  You might try
      a manual hand scan of the phone numbers that your school owns, just a tip on that.  Get any 
      number of your school and the first five digits are the ones it owns like 856-79XX or something
      like that.  Sometimes you might find that your school runs a PBX and that you can abuse them 
      further.  Getting the extension numbers isn't hard they are probally posted behind the desk in
      the office just because the secretarys are too dumb to remember them.  So just try to find a 
      number for the school that will give you and outside line or beige off the side or something
      like that.  
      
      A lot of diff. places use paging systems that are often times tied into the PBX system or have
      the phone systems integrated into them.  Try using the line "Can I get an outside line" a lot
      and mention you are from so and so department or you are testing such and such.  Sorry for the
      brief cut off of information I had started this in the mood to write a really large article
      but I had stopped half-way through and had to come back to the zine and keep writing so its not
      as good as I planned it to be.
      
      4. COCOTS and other privately owned payphones
      
      ===
      Introduction
      ===
      
      Many of you have probably heard of COCOTs at one time or another. Maybe somebody mentioned it 
      briefly but you didn't know what one was. Well, simply put, COCOTs are privately owned 
      payphones not controlled by Ma Bell. COCOT stands for Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephone. 
      Sounds neat, eh. But where are these "COCOTs?" They are everywhere! They are at convenience 
      stores, malls, schools, clubs, and tons of other places like that. A convenience store down 
      the street from me happens to have three but how do I know that these phones are COCOTs? Well,
      some of a COCOT's distinguishing features include:
      
      -The COCOTs never have their phone number listed on them (they don't like you to have it)
      -They will not have the AT&T logo or whatever on them. This is mainly  because they use 
       expensive rip-off carriers so they can cash in.
      -They have some nifty stuff inside em (not visible but very detectable  as I will explain 
       later)
      -They are run on standard telephone loop lines instead of the "special"  payphone loops 
      
      There are some other unique things about them but those seem to stand out in my mind the most. 
      Plus, those are the best ways to identify them. The not having the local phone company logo on 
      them is probably enough to pick one out by it self alone already but I have been tricked by 
      this one GTE phone at my High School. The GTE logo was hidden but I did see that it's phone 
      number was listed so you can see that they are pretty easy to pick out of a lineup by checking
      for the features I listed above.
      
      In this article, I will try to keep the information as factual as possible but I may get into 
      theory a little bit with the things IM not sure of.
      
      
      ===
      The different types of COCOTs
      ===
      
      I've done some major research on COCOTs and I have gotten the most common ones you'll find and
      I will describe them here.
      
      -The Elcotel series 5
      
      Elcotell phones are pretty simple. They run on line power and will not do anything if 
      disconnected. They are pretty common and you could probably pick one out right after you had 
      dialed a number because faintly in the background you can hear the number being redialed (and
      pretty slowly too). These phones take the money after your call is over and they will ask for
      more if it is required in a fairly human like voice. It is pretty fun to call them and mess 
      around because when you call and their modem shuts up you can dial number and it thinks that 
      it is placing that call. If you call it and do nothing it will read out it's number and how 
      much money it has acquired. I have heard of another type Elcotel phone being used but I have
      never seen one.
      
      -The Ernest Telecom D1
      
      Once again this phone is not the only made by the company but it is the most common. This COCOT
      is unique in that it uses a fake dial tone which is hard to distinguish from a real one but 
      it's there. These guys work on a supplied power line and wont work if the power is out. These 
      particular phones have a nasty sounding robotic voice that gets kind of distorted sometimes 
      and when you call them a modem answers. Another model I have seen of theirs is the D3 which 
      uses a real dial tone but I wont get into to much depth with this one...
      
      -The Protel models
      
      There are a couple different protel phones in use today. Those are the Protel 2000, 4000, 7000,
      and 8000, models. From what I hear the 8000 and 4000 are fairly similar. I have personally 
      never run into these but I hear that they are more widely used along the western half of the 
      US. I don't know too much about them so I will just mention their existence.
      
      -The Intellicall phones
      
      The first of two models commonly used is the ultratel. These things are pretty old but you can
      still find em in rural areas. they aren't to much to look at and they have an annoying 
      computerized voice. These phones are pretty fickle about dialing procedures and they will get
      on your nerves pretty quickly. When you place a call and the receiving party answers the phone
      will play the 1 tone a couple times to prevent fraud but I have not heard of anyone doing 
      anything to mess with those anyway.
      
      The other model made by intellicall is the astrotel. it is newer and has a less annoying voice 
      that sounds more like an actual human. Now these phones happen to have a 14,400 baud modem 
      which is not bad for an ugly payphone. These phones also do the 1 tone thing when the phone is
      answered so if you plan on scamming these your out of luck.
      
      Well, there are probably a bunch more COCOT type phones out there but I mainly know of these. 
      If you know of any others of significance, send some info on them in and I may alter this 
      article to include that phone.
      
      
      ===
      So what's so cool about these phones?
      ===
      
      As you have read there are varied types of COCOTs and each is slightly different. And with each
      phone there are certain flaws. On some phones (I have not got the documentation of which) you
      can get real easy free calls, providing that the phone does not mute the microphone in the
      handset after you are hung up on. Getting any ideas? Well, on those nifty little phones you 
      can call up some random 800 number and when the number answers you, just keep quiet. They will
      get tired of listening to nothing and will then hang up on you. Now, instead of setting the
      phone back down you would wait and then hear a second dial tone. Now, you would be able to 
      punch in your real number and call up your friend. Well, not exactly. When the person on the 
      other line hangs up on you, the phone deactivates the keypad so you have to hang up to use it
      again. I have actually heard that in some instances the buttons will be locked in place. I 
      thought that was weird but it is still somthing you can bypass and in the same way too. You
      would whip out your trusty Radio Hack tone dialer and dial away. Yep, free calls. I have done 
      it a few times but at the time I could not pick out different types of COCOT models, so I don't
      remember which models allow that kind of thing. It can be done, all I need to do is keep 
      searching. Now, I have only heard other people's stories but they suggest to me that are easy 
      to red box. Since it is a regular line and the phone deals with everything by it self, the 
      phone company cannot catch you. I have not boxed a COCOT myself or even seen it done first 
      hand but I will probably try to box a COCOT someday. 
      
      
      Another nifty thing you can do with many COCOTs involves the modems that they have inside. 
      When a customer purchases a COCOT, they receive a couple things along with it. They will get a
      manual of course but in addition to that they will get a cool software package. With this, the
      owner can dial into the COCOT and communicate with the modem. That way, they can remotely find
      out how much money it has and maybe some other stuff depending on the model. If someone could 
      get their hands on that software, they would have some fun with it, IM sure.
      
      
      ===
      Alliance Teleconferencing
      ===
      
      Another cool thing to do with COCOTs is to set up an alliance teleconference. It is fairly 
      simpler than the name suggest with it's 5 dollar words and all. To set one up on a COCOT, you 
      would probably want some ulterior, nontraceable way of getting in touch with you (yep, this 
      requires social engineering). One method that comes to mind is setting up a Ureach account. 
      All you do is go to www.Ureach.com and you can get a 100% free VMB. Now getting back to 
      setting up that conference. So after you pick a target phone, you call the AT&T teleconference
      setup number at 1-800-232-1234 (there are others but this one is the single best I know of). 
      They will ask you for info and you just give them what you want them to know. After they ask 
      all that stuff they might want to know and they ask for the number they can reach you at, tell
      them that you are calling from your business phone (yes, it is suggested that you say it is 
      for a business conference) but you will be out for the next few days (or around how long it 
      may take to set up the conference) and that they may reach you at your VMB (yep, the one you
      set up and also try to make the VMB greeting sound legit as it will add to credibility). Now 
      you wait and they will call your VMB in a while with all the info you need. Once this is done
      you have a conference waiting to happen. 
      
      Note: It is not suggested that you use the admin. code to access the conference so that they 
      cannot prove that you were the one to have set it up in the first place. So when you get in 
      there and they ask you how you got into the "fraudulent" conference you simply say that some 
      guy online said to.
      
      
      ===
      Closing
      ===
      
      Well, I hope this was informative for you. I actually learned some stuff too while I was 
      gathering info. I would like to thank toxis for inadvertently giving me the idea to write this 
      article and I would also like to thank El Jefe for having an informative payphone website at 
      which i gathered info on specific COCOT models and Xenos for the info on dialing into the COCOT 
      modems.
      
      
      5. Various Call Tracing Devices and Services
      
      Caller ID - CNA - ANI - ANAC
      
      --
      
      How does the telco trace all those prank calls you've been making to that op
      who really turns you on? Well, if you're smart, they won't be able to use
      CallerID to get your number, but it is a possibility, so let's examine that
      first.
      
      The technical workings of CallerID are very easily found. A good text on it
      is available at http://www.flinthills.com/~hevnsnt/newbie/callerid.txt and
      tells you everything you'd never need to know is there. And it really would
      not make sense to write it all here, but here are the basics. When you make
      a call, it has a header (not unlike an ICMP header) which tells the CallerID
      box which every yuppie owns that you are calling from 1800-P00P-SEX and your
      name is Tom. This way, they can call you back, or bitch you out. But what if
      you're blocking CallerID info? How does that sexy op at Bell know your phone
      number? Well, either you gave it to her, or they used a service called ANI.
      
      ANI stands for Automatic Number Identifier. You can use ANI too. What ANI
      does, is it reads back your number. That simple. Don't worry about HOW it
      works, but know it does. ANI numbers are useful for you naughty beige boxers
      because it tells you the number you are calling from. This way, you can set
      up a conf for everyone in #2600. A close relative of ANI is ANAC.
      
      ANAC is really just ANI but local to an area code, and sometimes open to the
      public. ANAC stands for Automatic Number Announcement Circuit. In most areas,
      ANAC numbers are like Directory Assistance and have a 3 digit code. In some
      places, it is 711 or 200. Dialing it will read back your number. Same uses as
      above. And one thing useful for messing with people along with these is CNA.
      
      CNA is Customer's Name and Address. Any guesses as to what it does? It tells
      you the name of address of a specified phone number. I have successfully used
      411 to do this, without a true CNA service, or something like infospace.com
      which I recommend highly. If you're (God forbid) stalking someone, and you are
      calling them constantly, and want to know where they live, you could get their
      CNA and then go to teir house and show them your willy. Note: CNAs are almost
      never open to the public, so you can try to get the bitch at 411 to do it for
      you, or you could use one, albeit illegal.
      
      Something many people overlook is the ability to mess with someone through a
      combination of these, or get free 3-way-calling. What you do is, first, go to
      phreakers university in Canonsburg PA, remember, the Phone Fraud Fox says we
      are 'taught'. Take Social Engineering 1, 2, and 3. Now go to your neighbor's
      telco box, and hook up your beige box. Now call an ANI or ANAC and now you got
      their number. Next, get the CNA for that number. Now, call up the telco, its
      GTE here, soon to be Bell Atlantic ;-), and get them to add three way calling
      or ask them if its been installed yet, saying the service was giving you
      trouble. Act like the person whose name you got in the CNA record, and you're
      set. Now just run some line (you can get this by going with a friend,
      distracting the lineman, and having one of you grab a spool and toss it into
      a bookbag) to your house, and hook it into the rack of modular jacks, patch
      cable, and switches, and the light which tells if the line is in use. Now,
      whenever you want to three way call, clip after where you connected your line
      (could install a device which open/closes the circuit) so they cant pick up,
      and three way call your 31337 friends.
      
      6. Closing and Various Thoughts and Comments	
      
      I wanted to appologize for the fact that Toxis' article isn't like the rest of
      the zine, its just the difference between him using his text editor and me and Pyro ours and
      I don't feel much like fixing it out being as I have a lot of stuff to do aside from this. 
      - Xenos
      
      I am sorry for the slow upgrading I suppose of the Digital Defiance site like I said I have
      lots to do aside from this.  I have had some conflicts with other online related events that
      turned out to be fine but for a night I didn't get online.  I think that once the vacations 
      come etc... I will have time to pay more attention to the zine and the site and I will have 
      my laptop then so I can work on the articles everywhere.
      - Xenos
      
      We do accept article submissions for review and possible publishing them in Digital Defiance
      later issues.  This first issue only has a couple of articles because we wanted to start small
      and build up.  Feel free to send questions, comments, mail you want in the issues to 
      DigitalDefiance@juno.com
      - Xenos
      
      Hey, this is Pyro. I would like to thank the other members of Tele-Hell and Digital Defiance 
      for their continuing support in my efforts. I hope you all really like our first issue. This 
      has got to be one of the best things I have ever taken part in and IM glad I had the 
      opportunity to meet Xenos and be able to construct out very own zine, he truly is 13370. Well, 
      that's about it for now. Oh, and if you want personalized graphics (smell a shameless plug?) 
      drop me a line.
      
      Thanks again...

      DAY OF ACTION PLANNED AGAINST MOTION PICTURE
      ASSOCIATION IN 100 CITIES 
 
      Members of the hacker and open source communities
      worldwide, along with various civil liberties groups, are
      planning a massive leafletting campaign on Friday,
      February 4 to call attention to the recent attempts by the
      Motion Picture Association of America to shut down
      thousands of websites. 
 
      Lawsuits have been filed against hundreds of people, as
      well as an Internet Service Provider and a magazine, for
      having information the MPAA wants to keep secret. 
 
      The controversy centers around a computer program
      known as DeCSS, thought to be written by a 16 year old
      in Norway. The program defeats the encryption scheme
      used by DVD's which prohibits them from being viewed on
      non-approved machines or computers. It also enables
      DVD's from one country to be played in another, contrary
      to the wishes of the movie industry. It does NOT facilitate
      DVD piracy - in fact, copying DVD's has been possible
      since their introduction years ago. In its press releases on
      the subject, the MPAA has claimed that this is a piracy
      issue and they have subsequently succeeded in getting
      injunctions against a number of sites that had posted the
      program in the interests of free speech. 
 
      This is in effect a lawsuit against the entire Internet
      community by extremely powerful corporate interests. The
      lawsuit and the various actions being planned promise to
      be a real showdown between two increasingly disparate
      sides in the technological age. The consequences of losing
      this case are so serious that civil libertarians, professors,
      lawyers, and a wide variety of others have already
      stepped forward to help out. 
 
      Friday's action will be coordinated in 74 cities throughout
      North America and 26 cities in other parts of the world.
      Leafletting will take place outside theaters and video
      stores in these cities - all of which participate in a
      monthly "2600" gathering. 2600 Magazine has been named
      in two lawsuits regarding the DeCSS program and has
      joined with the the growing number of people who will
      fight these actions by the MPAA until the end. 
 
      The lawsuit has been filed by the Motion Picture
      Association of America, Columbia/Tristar, Universal City
      Studios, Paramount Pictures, Disney Enterprises,
      Twentieth Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios,
      and Time Warner Entertainment.

      DoubleClick under email attack for consumer profiling plans 
     By Evan Hansen Staff Writer, CNET News.com February 2, 2000, 5:35 p.m. PT 

     update A consumer advocacy group has organized a protest against 
     DoubleClick, encouraging the public to email complaints about the online 
     marketing giant's privacy policies to the company and 60 of its clients. 

     The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) unveiled the campaign 
     yesterday, calling for a stop to what it describes as DoubleClick's efforts 
     to use its relationships with prominent Internet companies to track the 
     online activities of millions of individuals and tie them to those 
     individuals' offline activities. 

     DoubleClick denied that it collects information on personally identifiable 
     individuals in an email response to the campaign sent to it clients 
     yesterday. 

     "DoubleClick does not use highly sensitive information for profiling such 
     as health information, detailed financial information, information of a 
     sexual nature and information on children," the email reads. "DoubleClick 
     will not link personally identifiable information about a user to online 
     behavior without first giving that user notice and the choice not to 
     participate. 

     "DoubleClick does not and cannot know the identity of a user online unless 
     that user has provided that information to an Abacus Online participant who 
     has provided the user with the appropriate notice and choice." 

                            Gregg Bishop, the vice president for technology 
                            operations at DoubleClick client TheStreet.com, said 
                            his company began receiving emails from the protest 
                            list at about noon yesterday. He said he had 
                            received 2,200 emails from the campaign by early 
                            this morning. 

                            "The first thing we did was turn around and contact 
                            DoubleClick," he said. "We were told that what the 
                            CDT is doing is legal." 

                            Bishop said TheStreet.com does not share information 
                            about its customers with DoubleClick. He said the 
                            company will post a policy regarding its 
                            relationship with DoubleClick on its Web site and 
                            refer people who complain through the CDT's email 
                            distribution list to that statement. 

                            "I've only noticed one complaint that has come from 
                            our more than 100,000 actual customers," he said.

                            The protest comes after DoubleClick last week 
                            quietly published a new privacy policy that 
                            discloses plans to create a database of consumer 
                            profiles that would include each user's name and 
                            address; retail, catalog and online purchase 
                            history; and demographic data. 

                            The database, which DoubleClick says will only be 
                            seen by the company itself, is intended to help the 
                            targeted marketing efforts of its nascent U.S.-based 
                            Abacus Alliance--an outgrowth of its recent 
                            acquisition of direct marketer Abacus Direct. 

     Until recently, DoubleClick's policy was to refrain from correlating 
     personal information with its 100 million cookies, which are scattered 
     worldwide. But the new database will rely on the cookies, which the company 
     places on Net users' computers to record surfing habits and display 
     pertinent advertising. Net users aren't informed when they are given a 
     DoubleClick cookie unless their browser is preset to do so, but they can 
     "opt out" through the company's Web site. 

     The CDT Web site gives consumers instructions on how to remove the cookies 
     from their computers and opt out of the system. It also includes a form 
     letter that visitors can elect to send to the public email addresses of 
     DoubleClick's CEO and 60 of the company's clients. 

     CDT spokesman Ari Schwartz said the DoubleClick clients targeted in the 
     campaign were culled from DoubleClick's Web site and SEC filings. The email 
     is being distributed through a mailing list dubbed "doubleclickwatch." 
     Targeted companies have the choice of opting out of the list by replying to

     Schwartz said the CDT did not know which sites might be involved in 
     providing personal information to DoubleClick to link online and offline

      InternetNews.com Correspondent 
                                                        E-Commerce News Archives 

      Another e-commerce site has been turned inside out by a cracker. Someone 
      calling himself "Curador" claims to have stolen the entire sales database of an 
      unidentified online site, including more than 5,000 credit card numbers. 

      Around 1,000 of the stolen card numbers were posted by Curador late Monday 
      night at a personal Website hosted by Xoom.com, the online homesteading 
      site owned by NBC interactive (NBCI) . After being notified about the 
      Curador site, Xoom took it offline late Tuesday morning. The site, minus 
      the credit card data, is mirrored here. 

      Later Tuesday, Curador resurfaced at Geocities, where he posted what he 
      claimed was the credit card number of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. 

      While the incident echoes the break-in and extortion attempt at 
      CDuniverse.com earlier this month, Curador implied his motives were purely 
      educational. 

      "Maybe one day people will setup their sites properly before they start 
      trading because otherwise this won't be the last page I post to the NET," 
      wrote the cracker in a message at his site. 

      No common shopping patterns were immediately apparent among the handful of 
      shoppers contacted by InternetNews and whose credit cards were stolen and 
      posted at the Curador site. 

      Leslie Lowdermilk, a research analyst in Texas, said she began shopping 
      online this past holiday season, drawn by the convenience. Noting that 
      card holders are generally responsible for only the first $50 of 
      fraudulent charges, Lowdermilk said the incident hasn't scared her off 
      from making future online purchases. 

      "When faced with either going to the mall at Christmas time or sitting in 
      the comfort of my own home and shopping, I would much rather shop over the 
      Internet than face the crowds. I think most places are reputable, and I've 
      know lots of people who've done lots of shopping and never had a problem," 
      she said. 

      In the message at the Curador site, the cracker suggests that he exploited 
      a weakness in Microsoft's (MSFT) SQL Server relational database. 

      "Greetz to my friend Bill Gates, I think that any guy who sells Products 
      Like SQL Server, with default world readable permissions can't be all 
      BAD," wrote the cracker. 

      According to Russ Cooper, operator of the NTbugtraq mailing list, SQL 
      server by default installs some files with world readable permission. But 
      Cooper denied that Microsoft's product was inherently insecure. 

      "Most commercial software packages install with loose or nonexistent 
      permissions so that you can get them working easier and then lock it down. 
      And most people don't," Cooper said. 

      Notice of the break-in was sent to HackerNews.com early Tuesday morning. 
      The message headers suggest it was sent using a dial-up account at Global 
      Internet in the United Kingdom. 

      According to Space Rogue, one of the operators of the HackerNews site and 
      a security expert with consulting firm AtStake, the victimized site was 
      apparently storing credit card numbers on its Web server, despite repeated 
      warnings by security experts that the data should instead be transferred 
      to a secure server not connected to the Internet. 

      "You'd think it was common sense, but every other week we have another 
      ecommerce site that's vulnerable and attacked, and I don't know how long 
      it's going to take for people to learn,"
      said Space Rogue.

      U.S. cyber-attack protection plan draws
      criticism 
      
      By Jennifer Jones 
      
      Privacy advocates Tuesday raised red flags before a U.S. Senate Judiciary 
      Subcommittee looking into privacy implications of President Clinton's plan 
      to safeguard critical systems against cyber attacks. 

      Critics of the plan charged specifically that the Clinton Administration 
      is relying "too heavily on monitoring       and surveillance" instead of 
      simply focusing on making systems more secure, according to Marc 
      Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
      (EPIC). 

      The Clinton Administration last month released its first "blueprint" for 
      protecting critical government and       private sector systems against 
      hackers. 

      Called the National Plan for Information Systems Protection, the plan 
      eventually will loop in critical systems       for communications, 
      transportation, and financial services. 

      "There is disagreement as to whether an intrusive, government-directed 
      initiative that views computer       security as almost solely defending 
      'our cyberspace' from foreign assault is the right way to go," Rotenberg 
      said in prepared testimony. 

      EPIC officials especially took exception to the plan's inclusion of a 
      Federal Intrusion Detection Network       (FIDNET). Under the plan, a 
      single government agency would be allowed to monitor communications across 
      all federal networks. 

      Rotenberg argued that FIDNET would require notification to all users of 
      federal systems, including       government employees and the public, or 
      would break various privacy statutes including wiretapping guidelines. 

      EPIC officials also said that the government's security policy overall has 
      been inconsistent because it has       prevented availability of some 
      encryption and security tools. 

      John Tritak, director of the President's Critical Infrastructure Assurance 
      Office, however, countered that the       plan, dubbed Version 1.0, is 
      still in its preliminary stages. 

      "The plan is designated Version 1.0 and subtitled 'An Invitation to a 
      Dialog' to indicate that it is still a work in       progress and that a 
      broader range of perspectives must be taken into account if the plan is 
      truly to be national in scope and treatment," Tritak said. 

      Part of the unfolding plan calls for a partnership between Fortune 500 
      companies and all levels of       government to work out details for 
      safeguarding computers. 

      The U.S. Chamber of Commerce this month will hold an initial meeting on 
      private sector contributions to       and participation in the plan. 

      Privacy must play a key part in any efforts to hone details of the plan, 
      Rotenberg warned. 

      "I urge you to proceed very cautiously. The government is just now digging 
      itself out of the many mistakes       that were made over the past decade 
      with computer security policy. This is not the best time to be pushing an 
      outdated approach to network security," Rotenberg said.

      Cyber Safe or Gov't Surveillance? 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      10:40 a.m. 1.Feb.2000 PST WASHINGTON -- A government plan to monitor 
      networks for intrusions goes too far and will lead to increased 
      surveillance and privacy violations, a civil liberties group told a Senate 
      panel on Tuesday. 

      The Electronic Privacy Information Center said a memo it obtained last 
      week shows that the Clinton administration's FIDNET proposal for 
      "information systems protection" will result in unwarranted spying on 
      Americans. 

      Documents the group received through a Freedom of Information Act request 
      indicate the administration is considering broad access to credit card and 
      phone records of private citizens and monitoring of government workers'       
      computers, EPIC director Marc Rotenberg told the Senate judiciary 
      subcommittee on technology and terrorism. 

      "The FIDNET proposal, as currently conceived, must simply be withdrawn. It 
      is impermissible in the United States to give a federal agency such 
      extensive surveillance authority," Rotenberg told the panel chaired by Jon 
      Kyl, an Arizona       Republican. 

      The privacy problems of FIDNET and similar government efforts are 
      exaggerated, said Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office director John 
      Tritak. 

      "FIDNET is intended to protect information on critical, civilian 
      government computer systems, including that provided by private citizens. 
      It will not monitor or be wired into private sector computers," Tritak 
      said. "All aspects of the       FIDNET will be fully consistent with all 
      laws protecting the civil liberties and privacy rights of Americans." 

      Tritak showed up to discuss the so-called "National Plan for Information 
      Systems Protection, Version 1.0," which the government released in 
      January. It calls for additional government spending to thwart a "highly 
      organized, systematic       cyberattack by hostile powers or terrorist 
      organizations." 

      The 199-page plan includes a chapter titled "protecting privacy and civil 
      liberties." The chapter calls for an annual "public-private colloquium" 
      and review of privacy practices by "appropriate authorities." 

      But it does not say the CIAO will reveal even summaries of its activities 
      -- the sort of regular review required of federal prosecutors who ask for 
      wiretaps of phone lines. "Nowhere does the Plan answer such questions as 
      what formal       reporting requirements will be established, what 
      independent review will be conducted, and what mechanisms for public 
      accountability and government oversight will be put in place," EPIC's 
      Rotenberg said. 

      Also testifying was Frank Cilluffo, deputy director of the organized crime 
      project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. CSIS has 
      close ties to the military, and last month appointed soon-to-be former 
      deputy secretary of       defense John Hamre as its president and CEO. 

      Cilluffo sided with CIAO: "Throughout history, the first obligation of the 
      state has been to protect its citizens. Today is no exception." 

      "Overall, I think the [CIAO] plan does an excellent job identifying gaps 
      and shortfalls within the federal government, and charting an initial 
      course of action to address them. My major concern is that it does not do 
      enough," Ciluffo said.

      FIDNET, the part of the overall CIAO plan aimed at detecting intrusions 
      into federal computers, came under fire last summer. Civil liberties 
      groups and some legislators warned it could be too intrusive and could 
      monitor the       private-sector Internet. 

      The Justice Department didn't help matters by replying last September in a 
      letter that said FIDNET would not -- at least, as currently "envisioned." 

      During the hearing Tuesday, CIAO's Tritak echoed what other law 
      enforcement representatives have said: "One person with a computer, a 
      modem, and a telephone line anywhere in the world can potentially break 
      into sensitive       government files, shut down an airport's air traffic 
      control system, or disrupt 911 services for an entire community." 

      A top FBI official said the same thing in January, warning that electric 
      power is vulnerable to miscreant hackers. But a person close to the North 
      American Electric Reliability Council -- a trade association of electric 
      power generating companies -- told Wired News that he wasn't aware of any
      power control computers hooked up to telephone lines or the Internet.

      Microsoft is claiming a sales increase in Estonia, Latvia

      campaign there. Microsoft has reported that while
      piracy rates in these countries are still above 72% (they
      were as high as 92% in some of countries) software
      sales have increased by as much as 500%. (Interesting
      how absolutely no other factors contributed to the
      increase in sales over the six month period, at least
      according to MS.)

     VILNIUS, Lithuania (February 1, 2000 11:59 a.m. EST 
     http://www.nandotimes.com) - An anti-piracy software campaign recently 
     launched in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has 
     significantly lifted Microsoft's sales in the region, a company official 
     announced Tuesday. 

     "It was a tremendous success and we are starting to build our business in 
     these countries," Bo Cruse, Microsoft managing director for the Baltic 
     region said at a briefing in Vilnius. 

     At the end of the six-month campaign, Microsoft's sales in January were up 
     around 500 percent in Lithuania, and 300 percent in Estonia and Latvia. 

     Software piracy remains common in the Baltic states. According to 
     Microsoft's estimates the percentage of illegal software dipped only from 
     92 percent to 81 percent in Lithuania, from 90 percent to 85 percent in 
     Latvia and from 86      percent to 72 percent in Estonia following the 
     legalization campaign. 

     The average for Europe is about 40 percent and for the Nordic countries 
     about 35 percent, according to Norvald Heidel, Microsoft's anti-piracy 
     manager for the Baltic and Nordic regions. 

     Microsoft and the Business Software Alliance also worked with police and 
     computer sellers to promote enforcement of software licenses. 

     More than 30 court cases have been filed for copyright infringement 
     following a crackdown on resellers and private users. 

     A Lithuanian government official admitted that 40-60 percent of the 
     government's software is illegal, and said that nearly $1 million would be 
     needed to buy legal copies.

      From PC World Online The Web Is a Hacker's Playground by Christina Wood 

      I don't scare easily. But I've been terrified twice in the past year. The 
      first       time it happened was while I watched The Blair Witch Project 
      at a local theater. The second time was during a demonstration of a new 
      software product. Now, I've seen a million software demos, and in the vast 
      majority of these my biggest fear is that I'll fall asleep. This time, 
      though, I found myself perched on the edge of my seat. Eran Reshef, 
      cofounder and vice president of Perfecto Technologies, was showing me why 
      he thinks the world needs his company's product, a security package 
      (priced at upward of $50,000) that is designed to protect Web sites from 
      hacker attacks. 

      As I sat there watching, Reshef demonstrated how he could transform just 
      about       any Web site into his own personal playground. And though 
      Reshef and most of his technical staff are former members of an elite 
      technical unit in the Israeli Army, he denied that he possesses the 
      hacking talents of a once-in-an-eon technical genius. In fact, Reshef was 
      careful to characterize his skills as fairly common. He said that 
      practically anyone who can put up a Web site--and has a burglar's moral 
      code--can take a site down. Those same skills can be used (and this is 
      when I really got frightened) to plunder a site for confidential 
      information about its users. 

      I don't want to alert any hackers out there to security holes that are 
      waiting       to be breached. So I won't mention the names of the Web 
      sites I saw Reshef gain access to­-but they're ones you know, maybe even 
      ones you do business with. Reshef would spend 15 minutes or so editing 
      HTML code and performing other technical tricks...and then I'd see the 
      names and passwords of a site's programmers scroll across his computer 
      screen. 

      He dropped items into his shopping cart at various e-commerce sites, 
      including       the online home of a major computer vendor, and then 
      changed their prices at will. He also downloaded customer information from 
      an airline's frequent-flyer site, and he described to me how he was able 
      to make trades from the account of the CIO of a large online brokerage 
      firm--while the CIO looked on. 

      "This is bad," Reshef announced at one point in his demonstration for me. 
      "The       game is over--I can do anything I want [at this site] right 
      now." Gulp. 

      Protection Racket? 

      Reshef didn't have to hack around firewalls or break encryption. He 
      accomplished       his break-ins using only his Web browser, some 
      know-how, and maybe a little programming code. Reshef (and presumably 
      hackers who use their abilities less benignly) hunts around Web pages for 
      little programming mistakes. These subtle errors--Reshef says most 
      programmers make them from time to time--offer knowledgeable snoops points 
      of entry to a site's server. And once they have that access, they can 
      cause all kinds of mayhem. 

      Not that Reshef would--he's a nice guy. In fact, one analyst I spoke to       
      described him as a Boy Scout. And the break-ins he performed were done 
      only after obtaining the permission of the sites' proprietors. But in 
      retrospect, I can't help imagining him appearing in an episode of the HBO 
      series The Sopranos selling protection against the depredations of a 
      frightening group of high-tech wise guys. 

      Shortly after taking in Reshef's demonstration, I saw a report of a 
      popular news       site (which will also remain nameless) being taken 
      completely down by an unknown hacker or hackers. I called the site manager 
      to see whether the break-in involved the kind of hacking Reshef showed me. 
      She said no. The site had simply had a problem with an FTP server, which 
      was now fixed. Besides, she told me, the kind of thing I was describing to 
      her was impossible. "Did you ever think maybe you were getting a snake-oil 
      pitch?" she asked. "'Here's the disease, now here's the medicine you need 
      to cure it?'" That's a reasonable question, I thought. 

      So I did some checking. 

      "The problem that Perfecto is targeting is right on the money," counters 
      Mike       Zboray, vice president and research director for the Gartner 
      Group, an industry research firm. "Take a look at your typical Web server 
      configured for use on the Net. The people who do that configuration are 
      not terribly meticulous about the underlying code, and they aren't 
      meticulous about how they have safeguarded the content they have created. 
      When it works, they put it up. Is that good enough for e-commerce? 
      Probably not." 

      For quite a while, Zboray has been warning his clients to be diligent 
      about       protecting their Web sites from this kind of intrusion, either 
      by plugging holes themselves or, more recently, by buying Perfecto's 
      software. But to make his point, he has sometimes been forced to perform a 
      little hacking of his own. "I'm not nearly as good at this as Reshef is, 
      but I have been able to get complete access to servers. I do it just to 
      demonstrate how people are exposed." 

      A similar demonstration by Reshef persuaded Quote.com's Kaj Pedersen that 
      his       site needed Perfecto. "The selling point for me was when Reshef 
      changed my password and was able to get my access privileges to the site," 
      explains Pedersen, vice president of engineering at the financial market 
      data site. 

      Okay, I'm scared. And naturally, my first concern is for my own wallet. I       
      practically live on the Internet. Are my life and finances an open book 
      for every intelligent reprobate who has a browser? That depends. 

      "If I were a vendor, I would be deathly afraid," says Zboray. "If I were a 
      bank       I would be deathly afraid. And anyone who is doing a company 
      extranet should definitely worry if they have sensitive company data out 
      there." 

      On the other hand, Zboray believes, consumers shouldn't panic about the 
      state of       security on the Web. "I'm not afraid of using my credit 
      card [at e-commerce sites]--the credit card companies are shielding me 
      from responsibility for any fraudulent charges of more than $50." Much the 
      same is true at online banks: A bank's FDIC insurance shields your account 
      from loss if your bank--online or otherwise--is robbed. 

      Watching Your Wallet 

      Despite such reassurances, you still need to be careful where you take 
      your       business online. "Most sites that are doing e-commerce should 
      have some kind of security statement with regard to how your transactions 
      are secured," suggests Matthew Devost, senior analyst for Security Design 
      International, a company that provides security consulting to large 
      corporations and e-commerce companies. Look for that statement and read it 
      carefully before you provide personal information to a site. 

      If a site doesn't carry such a statement, and you're doing more than 
      making a       purchase there, call and grill a knowledgeable company 
      representative on how safe the site is. Ask if the site uses an outside 
      firm to test its security. Companies generally don't like to provide much 
      detail--because they don't want to give away any secrets--but you need to 
      make sure that they're taking measures to protect their site from 
      intruders. 

      "At the moment, only a small percentage of people call us to ask about       
      security," says Quote.com's Pedersen. "It's mostly those who understand 
      the technology and are concerned about how we will protect their personal 
      data concerning their net worth. But I think these questions will become 
      increasingly common as people begin to understand the vulnerabilities. I 
      think people should be asking these questions." 

      No Safety in Numbers 

      Of course, the Web will never be entirely free of security threats. "There 
      are a       lot of smart people out there," says Devost. "And they will 
      always find a way in if there is something they want." And unfortunately, 
      there's no easy way to tell how safe a site is. That's partly because 
      sites are reticent about divulging security information and partly because 
      many sites are unaware of the risks. 

      "I see a time where there might be a Good Housekeeping­style seal of 
      approval       for the security of sites," says Devost. "There are 
      organizations that do that now for privacy. Why not for security?" 

      Oh, and another thing. If you're a Web site manager, don't make the 
      mistake of       challenging a hacker. I told Eran Reshef about the news 
      site's suggestion that Perfecto's business model was nothing more than a 
      snake-oil pitch. Within 30 minutes, Reshef told me, Perfecto had gained 
      access to the source code on the news site's server. He added, "That means 
      I can do pretty much anything, including shut down the site." 

      But since Reshef is a Boy Scout, the Web site in question managed to 
      escape       unscathed--this time. But if I had a Web-based business--or 
      any plans to open one--I'd be thinking very seriously about hiring a 
      bodyguard.

      Cross-site scripting has become such a major concern it
      is has finally prompted CERT to release a security
      advisory. The problem is that no one verifies input data
      on a web form or when dynamically generating pages.
      This allows someone to potentially insert damaging code
      that will be automatically run. No one has been
      victimized yet but the potential risk is huge, effecting
      every browser and web page. To protect yourself from
      this risk CERT recommends that you turn off cookies, all
      java and "Not Engage in Promiscuous Browsing".

      Systems Affected

           Web browsers 

           Web servers that dynamically generate pages based on unvalidated 
           input 

      Overview

      A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script in a 
      dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from untrustworthy 
      sources. This can be a problem when a web server does not adequately 
      ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to prevent unintended 
      execution of scripts, and when input is not validated to prevent malicious 
      HTML from being presented to the user. 

      I. Description

      Background

      Most web browsers have the capability to interpret scripts embedded in web 
      pages downloaded from a web server. Such scripts may be written in a 
      variety of scripting languages and are run by the client's browser. Most 
      browsers are installed with the capability to run scripts enabled by 
      default. 

      Malicious code provided by one client for another client

      Sites that host discussion groups with web interfaces have long guarded 
      against a vulnerability where one client embeds malicious HTML tags in a 
      message intended for another client. For example, an attacker might post a 
      message like 

           Hello message board. This is a message. <SCRIPT>malicious 
           code</SCRIPT> This is the end of my message.

      When a victim with scripts enabled in their browser reads this message, 
      the malicious code may be executed unexpectedly. Scripting tags that can 
      be embedded in this way include <SCRIPT>, <OBJECT>, <APPLET>, and <EMBED>. 

      When client-to-client communications are mediated by a server, site 
      developers explicitly recognize that data input is untrustworthy when it 
      is presented to other users. Most discussion group servers either will not 
      accept such input or will encode/filter it before sending anything to 
      other readers. 

      Malicious code sent inadvertently by a client for itself

      Many Internet web sites overlook the possibility that a client may send 
      malicious data intended to be used only by itself. This is an easy mistake 
      to make. After all, why would a user enter malicious code that only the 
      user will see? 

      However, this situation may occur when the client relies on an 
      untrustworthy source of information when submitting a request. For 
      example, an attacker may construct a malicious link such as 

           <A HREF="http://example.com/comment.cgi? mycomment=<SCRIPT>malicious 
           code</SCRIPT>"> Click here</A> 

      When an unsuspecting user clicks on this link, the URL sent to example.com 
      includes the malicious code. If the web server sends a page back to the 
      user including the value of mycomment, the malicious code may be executed 
      unexpectedly on the client. This example also applies to untrusted links 
      followed in email or newsgroup messages. 

      Abuse of other tags

      In addition to scripting tags, other HTML tags such as the <FORM> tag have 
      the potential to be abused by an attacker. For example, by embedding 
      malicious <FORM> tags at the right place, an intruder can trick users into 
      revealing sensitive information by modifying the behavior of an existing 
      form. Other HTML tags can also be abused to alter the appearance of the 
      page, insert unwanted or offensive images or sounds, or otherwise 
      interfere with the intended appearance and behavior of the page. 

      Abuse of trust

      At the heart of this vulnerability is the violation of trust that results 
      from the "injected" script or HTML running within the security context 
      established for the example.com site. It is, presumably, a site the 
      browser victim is interested in enough to visit and interact with in a 
      trusted fashion. In addition, the security policy of the legitimate server 
      site example.com may also be compromised. 

      This example explicitly shows the involvement of two sites: 

           <A HREF="http://example.com/comment.cgi? mycomment=<SCRIPT 
           SRC='http://bad-site/badfile'></SCRIPT>"> Click here</A> 

      Note the SRC attribute in the <SCRIPT> tag is explicitly incorporating 
      code from a presumably unauthorized source (bad-site). Both of the 
      previous examples show violations of the same-source origination policy 
      fundamental to most scripting security models: 

           Netscape Communicator Same Origin Policy Microsoft Scriptlet Security 

      Because one source is injecting code into pages sent by another source, 
      this vulnerability has also been described as "cross-site" scripting. 

      At the time of publication, malicious exploitation of this vulnerability 
      has not been reported to the CERT/CC. However, because of the potential 
      for such exploitation, we recommend that organization CIOs, managers, and 
      system administrators aggressively implement the steps listed in the 
      solution section of this document. Technical feedback to appropriate 
      technical, operational, and law enforcement authorities is encouraged. 

      II. Impact

      Users may unintentionally execute scripts written by an attacker when they 
      follow untrusted links in web pages, mail messages, or newsgroup postings. 
      Users may also unknowingly execute malicious scripts when viewing 
      dynamically generated pages based on content provided by other users. 

      Because the malicious scripts are executed in a context that appears to 
      have originated from the targeted site, the attacker has full access to 
      the document retrieved (depending on the technology chosen by the 
      attacker), and may send data contained in the page back to their site. For 
      example, a malicious script can read fields in a form provided by the real 
      server, then send this data to the attacker. 

      Note that the access that an intruder has to the Document Object Model 
      (DOM) is dependent on the security architecture of the language chosen by 
      the attacker. Specifically, Java applets do not provide the attacker with 
      any access to the DOM. 

      Alternatively, the attacker may be able to embed script code that has 
      additional interactions with the legitimate web server without alerting 
      the victim. For example, the attacker could develop an exploit that posted 
      data to a different page on the legitimate web server. 

      Also, even if the victim's web browser does not support scripting, an 
      attacker can alter the appearance of a page, modify its behavior, or 
      otherwise interfere with normal operation. 

      The specific impact can vary greatly depending on the language selected by 
      the attacker and the configuration of any authentic pages involved in the 
      attack. Some examples that may not be immediately obvious are included 
      here. 

      SSL-Encrypted Connections May Be Exposed

      The malicious script tags are introduced before the Secure Socket Layer 
      (SSL) encrypted connection is established between the client and the 
      legitimate server. SSL encrypts data sent over this connection, including 
      the malicious code, which is passed in both directions. While ensuring 
      that the client and server are communicating without snooping, SSL makes 
      no attempt to validate the legitimacy of data transmitted. 

      Because there really is a legitimate dialog between the client and the 
      server, SSL reports no problems. Malicious code that attempts to connect 
      to a non-SSL URL may generate warning messages about the insecure 
      connection, but the attacker can circumvent this warning simply by running 
      an SSL-capable web server. 

      Attacks May Be Persistent Through Poisoned Cookies

      Once malicious code is executing that appears to have come from the 
      authentic web site, cookies may be modified to make the attack persistent. 
      Specifically, if the vulnerable web site uses a field from the cookie in 
      the dynamic generation of pages, the cookie may be modified by the 
      attacker to include malicious code. Future visits to the affected web site 
      (even from trusted links) will be compromised when the site requests the 
      cookie and displays a page based on the field containing the code. 

      Attacker May Access Restricted Web Sites from the Client

      By constructing a malicious URL an attacker may be able to execute script 
      code on the client machine that exposes data from a vulnerable server 
      inside the client's intranet. 

      The attacker may gain unauthorized web access to an intranet web server if 
      the compromised client has cached authentication for the targeted server. 
      There is no requirement for the attacker to masquerade as any particular 
      system. An attacker only needs to identify a vulnerable intranet server 
      and convince the user to visit an innocent looking page to expose 
      potentially sensitive data on the intranet server. 

      Domain Based Security Policies May Be Violated

      If your browser is configured to allow execution of scripting languages 
      from some hosts or domains while preventing this access from others, 
      attackers may be able to violate this policy. 

      By embedding malicious script tags in a request sent to a server that is 
      allowed to execute scripts, an attacker may gain this privilege as well. 
      For example, Internet Explorer security "zones" can be subverted by this 
      technique. 

      Use of Less-Common Character Sets May Present Additional Risk

      Browsers interpret the information they receive according to the character 
      set chosen by the user if no character set is specified in the page 
      returned by the web server. However, many web sites fail to explicitly 
      specify the character set (even if they encode or filter characters with 
      special meaning in the ISO-8859-1), leaving users of alternate character 
      sets at risk. 

      Attacker May Alter the Behavior of Forms

      Under some conditions, an attacker may be able to modify the behavior of 
      forms, including how results are submitted. 

      III. Solution

      Solutions for Users

      None of the solutions that web users can take are complete solutions. In 
      the end, it is up to web page developers to modify their pages to 
      eliminate these types of problems. 

      However, web users have two basic options to reduce their risk of being 
      attacked through this vulnerability. The first, disabling scripting 
      languages in their browser, provides the most protection but has the side 
      effect for many users of disabling functionality that is important to 
      them. Users should select this option when they require the lowest 
      possible level of risk. 

      The second solution, being selective about how they initially visit a web 
      site, will significantly reduce a user's exposure while still maintaining 
      functionality. Users should understand that they are accepting more risk 
      when they select this option, but are doing so in order to preserve 
      functionality that is important to them. 

      Unfortunately, it is not possible to quantify the risk difference between 
      these two options. Users who decide to continue operating their browsers 
      with scripting languages enabled should periodically revisit the CERT/CC 
      web site for updates, as well as review other sources of security 
      information to learn of any increases in threat or risk related to this 
      vulnerability. 

      Web Users Should Disable Scripting Languages in Their Browsers

      Exploiting this vulnerability to execute code requires that some form of 
      embedded scripting language be enabled in the victim's browser. The most 
      significant impact of this vulnerability can be avoided by disabling all 
      scripting languages. 

      Note that attackers may still be able to influence the appearance of 
      content provided by the legitimate site by embedding other HTML tags in 
      the URL. Malicious use of the <FORM> tag in particular is not prevented by 
      disabling scripting languages. 

      Detailed instructions to disable scripting languages in your browser are 
      available from our Malicious Code FAQ: 

           http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html 

      Web Users Should Not Engage in Promiscuous Browsing

      Some users are unable or unwilling to disable scripting languages 
      completely. While disabling these scripting capabilities is the most 
      effective solution, there are some techniques that can be used to reduce a 
      user's exposure to this vulnerability. 

      Since the most significant variations of this vulnerability involve 
      cross-site scripting (the insertion of tags into another site's web page), 
      users can gain some protection by being selective about how they initially 
      visit a web site. Typing addresses directly into the browser (or using 
      securely stored local bookmarks) is likely to be the safest way of 
      connecting to a site. 

      Users should be aware that even links to unimportant sites may expose 
      other local systems on the network if the client's system resides behind a 
      firewall, or if the client has cached credentials to access other web 
      servers (e.g., for an intranet). For this reason, cautious web browsing is 
      not a comparable substitute for disabling scripting. 

      With scripting enabled, visual inspection of links does not protect users 
      from following malicious links, since the attacker's web site may use a 
      script to misrepresent the links in the user's window. For example, the 
      contents of the Goto and Status bars in Netscape are controllable by 
      JavaScript. 

      Solutions for Web Page Developers and Web Site Administrators

      Web Page Developers Should Recode Dynamically Generated Pages to Validate 
      Output

      Web site administrators and developers can prevent their sites from being 
      abused in conjunction with this vulnerability by ensuring that dynamically 
      generated pages do not contain undesired tags. 

      Attempting to remove dangerous meta-characters from the input stream 
      leaves a number of risks unaddressed. We encourage developers to restrict 
      variables used in the construction of pages to those characters that are 
      explicitly allowed and to check those variables during the generation of 
      the output page. 

      In addition, web pages should explicitly set a character set to an 
      appropriate value in all dynamically generated pages. 

      Because encoding and filtering data is such an important step in 
      responding to this vulnerability, and because it is a complicated issue, 
      the CERT/CC has written a document which explores this issue in more 
      detail: 

           http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html 

      Web Server Administrators Should Apply a Patch From Their Vendor

      Some web server products include dynamically generated pages in the 
      default installation. Even if your site does not include dynamic pages 
      developed locally, your web server may still be vulnerable. For example, 
      your server may include malicious tags in the "404 Not Found" page 
      generated by your web server. 

      Web server administrators are encouraged to apply patches as suggested by 
      your vendor to address this problem. Appendix A contains information 
      provided by vendors for this advisory. We will update the appendix as we 
      receive more information. If you do not see your vendor's name, the 
      CERT/CC did not hear from that vendor. Please contact your vendor 
      directly.

      Experts warn of Web surfing risk
      sBY TED BRIDIS Associated Press Writer 

      WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top computer experts warned Internet users 
      Wednesday about a serious new security threat that       allows hackers to 
      launch malicious programs on a victim's computer or capture information a 
      person volunteers on a Web site, such as credit card numbers.

      The threat, dubbed ``cross-site scripting,'' involves dangerous computer 
      code that can be hidden within innocuous-looking links to popular       
      Internet sites. The links can be e-mailed to victims or published to 
      online discussion groups and Web pages.

      The vulnerability was especially unusual because it is not limited to 
      software from any particular company. Any Web browser on any computer 
      visiting a complex Web site is at risk.

      No one apparently has been victimized yet. But the risks were described as 
      potentially so serious and affected such a breadth of even the largest, 
      most successful Web sites that the industry's leading       security group 
      said nothing consumers can do will completely protect them.

      Only a massive effort by Web site designers can eliminate the threat, 
      according to the CERT Coordination Center of Carnegie Mellon University 
      and others. Software engineers at CERT issued the warning       Wednesday 
      together with the FBI and the Defense Department.

      The problem, discovered weeks ago but publicly disclosed Wednesday, occurs 
      when complex Internet sites fail to verify that hidden software code sent 
      from a consumer's browser is safe.

      Experts looking at how often such filtering occurred found that Internet 
      sites failing to perform that important safety check were ``the rule 
      rather than the exception,'' said Scott Culp, the top security       
      program manager at Microsoft.

      ``Any information that I type into a form, what pages I visit on that 
      site, anything that happens in that session can be sent to a third-party, 
      and it can be done transparently,'' Culp warned. He added: ``You       do 
      have to click on a link or follow a link in order for this to happen.''

      The dangerous code also can alter information displayed in a consumer's 
      Web browser, such as account balances or stock prices at financial sites. 
      And it can capture and quietly forward to others a Web       site's 
      ``cookie,'' a small snippet of data that could help hackers impersonate a 
      consumer on some Internet pages.

      ``It really goes across a huge number of sites,'' said Marc Slemko, a 
      Canadian software expert who studied the problem. Slemko said 
      Internet-wide repairs will be ``a very, very major undertaking.''

      In the interim, experts strongly cautioned Internet users against clicking 
      on Web links from untrusted sources, such as unsolicited e-mail or 
      messages sent to discussion forums.

      They also recommended that consumers at least consider preventing their 
      Web browser software from launching small programs, called scripts. But 
      they acknowledged that many Internet sites require that       function to 
      operate.

      ``A large number of sites simply aren't usable'' without those functions, 
      Slemko said.

      Microsoft said it planned to publish full details and step-by-step instructions
      for consumers at its Web site, www.microsoft.com/security. (PROFILE (CO:Microsoft

      Was Bill Gates' Credit Card Number Online? Teen Claims It Was One of Hundreds 
      He Posted 

      Feb. 1, 2000 

      By David Noack 

                           NEW YORK (APBnews.com) -- A self-proclaimed teenage 
                           "cracker" who claims to have gotten into the database 
                           of an e-commerce site has posted hundreds of credit 
                           card numbers online -- including one he says belongs 
                           to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. 

                           The 18-year-old uses the name Curador, which means 
                           custodian. In an e-mail message today, he said he had 
                           posted 1,000 credit card numbers and promised to post 
                           another thousand in the next two days. 

      Curador disowned the term "hacker" on the grounds that he trespasses on 
      sites but does not destroy data. Instead, he prefers the word "cracker." 

      The credit card numbers were posted on a personal home page at Xoom.com, 
      which is part of the family of NBCi, a subsidiary of the broadcasting 
      network. Xoom removed the page at around 12:30 p.m. today.

      Visitor to page blew whistle 

      Roger Maes, director of investor relations for NBCi, said the company 
      received information early today that a Web site was posting credit card 
      information. Maes could not say how long the site had been online or how 
      many people might have viewed it. He said the company is reporting the 
      incident to the "proper authorities." 

      "We have a dedicated group internally who all they do is monitor terms of 
      service violations, and we also encourage our visitors as well as other 
      home page members to report any terms-of-service violations," Maes said. 
      "We were actually alerted by a visitor. I went there, actually saw it, and 
      it was removed in a couple of minutes." 

      He declined to say who registered the Web site. 

      Adam Sohn, a Microsoft spokesman, called the story about alleged posting 
      of Gates' credit card number "dubious and fraught with errors." 

      "It's unfortunate that folks are doing this kind of thing. It's 
      irresponsible and criminal," said Sohn. 

      Claims to have 5,000 more 

      Curador claims to have at least 5,000 credit card numbers that he got 
      while hacking into an online mall based in Thailand. 

      "I Intend to Post another 1,000 Cards in the Next 48 Hours the Rest, I 
      will keep in my collection, what you have to remember is that although I 
      only have 5,000 numbers, I can extrapolate a few valid card numbers from 
      each of those 5,000 Cards," Curador said in an e-mail. 

      Curador denied any financial motive. 

      "My main motive was boredom, pure and simple so I did this little crack, 
      E-Commerce sites beware because I am Posting from more sites soon," 
      Curador warned. 

      Curador's message 

      Information about the alleged hacking incident was posted to one of the 
      hacking-related mailing lists. Part of the message reads: 

      "The Site Is A List Of Stolen CC Numbers Over a Thousand, Read more there. 
      I hope you like my work? If ya want Interviews E-mail me the 
      Questions.)...byebye" 

      "I did not demand money from the e-commerce site, who are blissfully 
      unaware that I have put these numbers on-line," Curador said. "In the Next 
      48, Hours, I Will Post a Link to their site, Plus (maybe) the Names & 
      Address of the People who's Numbers I Post, But only if I can be bothered. 
      You can check if these are real the same way I did go visit any porno 
      site, and enter the card numbers you will be approved and that is the only 
      proof I can offer." 

      'Not a great feat of magic' 

      One computer security expert, who did not want to be named, called this 
      latest incident the equivalent of "Dumpster diving," referring to a 
      practice by some teenagers who go into trash bins in the back of buildings 
      to get carbon copies of credit cards. 

      "You don't have to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do this. You have 
      to know how to turn a computer on and that's about it. This is not great 
      feat of magic for these kids," he said. 

      From examining the header information on the e-mail message, the security 
      expert believes the sender is in the Colorado Springs, Colo., area. 
      Curador, however, insists he is in Europe. 

      The security expert said the so-called e-commerce hacking incidents do not 
      take any great computer skills. 

      'Not breaking into anything' 

      "They are not breaking into anything," he said. "What they are doing is 
      going to the Web site, using the CGI's [common gateway interface] and 
      they're making the CGIs dump out credit card databases and they're using 
      Microsoft's SQL Server [standard query language]. They are connecting to 
      an SQL port and downloading databases." 

      The security expert said many e-commerce sites sacrifice security in favor 
      of ease of access and purchase. 

      "An e-commerce site cannot be secure and convenient, and if it's not real 
      convenient, people aren't going to use it. The problem is that companies 
      that have e-commerce are trying to rake in all this money, but they 
      seriously lack security, and they know it. They don't want to implement it 
      because it may require a few more clicks or it is a little more 
      complicated," he noted. 

      He suspects that the people responsible for this latest action also 
      perpetrated the CD Universe intrusion, though a Russian hacker named 
      "Maxus" claimed responsibility. The security expert said he believes 
      "Maxus" is really a group of teens in Colorado Springs. 

      'General lack of security' 

      Space Rogue, editor of the Hacker News Network and a research scientist at 
      the newly formed e-commerce security company @Stake, said the hacking 
      claim might be true. 

      "I have no reason to doubt it took place. Considering the general lack of 
      security on e-commerce sites as evidenced by all the recent blunders [such 
      as] CD Universe, Outpost.com, Northwest Airlines. It doesn't really 
      surprise me," said Space Rogue. 

      He said that posting the credit card numbers and not citing the vandalized 
      e-commerce site is wrong. 

      "As for actually posting the numbers to the Net, that's something I don't 
      agree with," Space Rogue said. "The fact that the company in question was 
      not mentioned nor the details of the hole is completely irresponsible." 

      The credit card posting follows the highly publicized hacking into the 
      database of music e-retailer CD Universe. "Maxus" claimed to have stolen 
      information on 300,000 credit cards. Maxus began posting numbers online 
      after the company refused to pay him $100,000.

94.0  HNN: Feb 3rd:  IETF Says No To Inet Wiretaps 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      The Internet Engineering Task Force has issued a
      resounding no to Internet wiretaps. They said that they

      Thumbs Down on Net Wiretaps 
      by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m. 3.Feb.2000 PST       WASHINGTON -- It took four months, a grim 
      debate, and thousands of mailing list messages, but the group that sets 
      Internet standards has decided not to support wiretapping. 

      The executive committees of the Internet Engineering Task Force dismissed 
      the idea with characteristic understatement, saying they would not 
      "consider requirements for wiretapping" in protocols. 

      The 15 KB draft document released this week caps an unusually public 
      debate inside IETF that was marked by an FBI call to permit wiretaps, 
      Congressional condemnation of the idea, and a flame-ridden mailing list 
      called "raven" that       lived up to its homophonous name. 

      But in the end, most members of the loose-knit group that met here in 
      November opposed the idea, and the draft written by the Internet 
      Architecture Board and the Internet Engineering Steering Group is the 
      result. 

      There's some precedent for the IETF refusing to bow to direct or indirect 
      government pressure to build surveillance into the Internet. In a 
      now-famous draft called RFC 1984, the group denounced easily breakable 
      encryption and       endorsed secure communications. 

      Under the organization's procedures, this week's draft statement is not 
      yet final and members can offer changes. But a member of the drafting 
      group said he anticipates no serious alterations. 

      "The only thing I expect is wording changes," says Jeff Schiller, an MIT 
      network manager and IESG member. "I think the community has pretty much 
      told us what they want to see here. I would not expect the community to do 
      a       180-degree about-face." 

      Yet even wording can be divisive. It didn't take long for raven list 
      members to complain that the IETF's definition of "wiretap" would allow 
      future protocols to support broad surveillance -- as long as the 
      interception wasn't targeted at       specific people. 

      "This is outrageous," wrote Ed Stone. "A third party taps a communication 
      in secret, but the selection is NOT targeted to a SPECIFIC person, so it 
      is not 'wiretapping.' This is simply incredible!" 

      IETF chairman Fred Baker did his best to mollify the critics, and -- for 
      once -- there seemed to be only a few. 

      "Maybe you can offer some better text," Baker replied. "What we were 
      trying to say was that when one puts a sniffer on an Ethernet for network 
      management purposes for a purpose unrelated to capturing a user's content 
      [such as       trying to collect usage statistics] this was not 
      wiretapping." 

      Administrators regularly monitor Internet traffic flow to determine things 
      like what percentage of traffic is devoted to the Web compared to email, 
      and tools like MCI's vBNS make it easy. (One 1998 paper calculated that 
      roughly 70       percent of traffic at one node was Web usage.) 

      If there's no serious opposition, the draft will become an Internet 
      standard.

       Health Sites Violate Their Own Privacy
       Standards, Study Finds

       By JERI CLAUSING  

              ASHINGTON -- Internet health sites collect some of the most
              personal information about their users, but few follow their own
       declared policies about maintaining the privacy of that data, according to
       a survey made public Tuesday. 

       The study, by the California HealthCare Foundation, found that 19 of the
       top 21 health sites had privacy policies, but that most failed to follow
       their stated practices. And none of the sites followed fair information
       practices as defined by the Federal Trade Commission. 

       The survey comes as policy makers are more closely scrutinizing the
       privacy practices of Web sites to determine whether new laws are
       needed to regulate online marketers. Privacy advocates said the study
       proved that the Internet industry has failed in its attempts to police itself in
       the area of online privacy. 

       "This is about the 7,000th piece of conclusive
       evidence that self-regulation is not working," said
       Jason Catlett, founder of Junkbusters Corp., a
       company that helps people and companies protect
       their privacy online. 

       The study's author's, however, were less
       judgmental, comparing the online health industry to
       an awkward adolescent who has yet to understand
       all the implications of his actions. 

       Richard M. Smith, an Internet security analyst, and
       Janlori Goldman, director of the project, said
       Internet health sites are well aware that consumers
       expect the information they supply to be
       confidential. They said they believe many of the sites are unaware that
       third-party advertisers and service providers have access to the personal
       information they are collecting. 

       The technological mechanisms behind the privacy violations, Smith said,
       include the use of "cookies," which track Web surfers' movements online,
       and banner ads, which in some cases can pick up the information entered
       by visitors on the pages where they are displayed. 

       The combination can enable advertising companies like DoubleClick to
       build detailed profiles of consumers and of the information they seek
       online. 

       For example, Smith said, some companies that place banner ads would
       be able to pick up an e-mail address entered by someone visiting a Web
       page about AIDS, even if the visitor never clicked on that ad. The
       address could then be matched with the Web "footprints" left on that
       computer by implanted cookies. 

       Many consumers and even Web site operators are unaware that
       advertisers have such technical capabilities, which allow them to build
       huge databases of consumer behavior, Smith said. 

       "It's complicated," Smith said. Some of the privacy violations "are
       accidental, and some are on purpose. Some (sites) really don't know that
       DoubleClick is collecting addresses," he said. 

       Catlett, a technical expert who previously worked for the data mining
       division of AT&T, said he thinks it is very plausible that many Web sites
       are unknowingly violating their own privacy policies. 

       "A lot of these sites are being set up in great haste, and often without
       sufficient knowledge or attention to the leakage that takes place with
       online advertising," he said. 

       Still, Catlett said, "It's horrifying but not surprising that medical sites are
       doing as poor a job on privacy as used car trading sites." 

       "I think probably medical sites are not doing any worse of a job on
       privacy as other e-commerce sites, but the public's expectations and
       need for privacy in a medical site is so much greater that the truly
       horrendous prevailing levels of privacy on the Web are just ludicrous," he
       said. 

       Although privacy advocates for years have been calling on Congress to
       pass a law setting rules for Internet sites to follow when collecting
       personal information, the Clinton administration and the Federal Trade
       Commission have sided with the Internet industry, which says it needs a
       chance to prove that marketers and online merchants can police
       themselves. 

       FTC officials on Tuesday had no comment on the study. This spring the
       commission is expected to issue its third annual report to Congress on the
       state of online privacy and whether it thinks new laws are needed. 

       The study's authors declined to get into the political debate over whether
       new laws are needed, saying they conducted the survey in hopes of
       providing the industry with the information it needs to better meet
       customers' online privacy expectations. 

       "The goal of the California HealthCare Foundation is to be a broker in
       this rapidly changing arena," said Mark D. Smith, president of the group,
       which presented its study during a summit on online health ethics.

       San Jose Sentencing For Sale of Pirated Programs

       A British citizen has been sentenced in U.S. District Court in San Jose to
       27 months in prison for selling pirated copies of popular computer programs.

       Lawrence Warmate, 40, was sentenced by Judge Ronald M. Whyte on Jan. 31.
       Warmate pleaded guilty to reproducing and selling computer software such as
       Microsoft Excel, Lotus 123 and Auto Desk AutoCAD. The pirated software was 
       valued at between $350,000 and $500,000 by the court.

       Warmate was originally indicted by a federal grand jury in April 1996.

      Online store security holes let hackers buy at cut
      price
    
      A security hole in some web-based shopping cart systems allows shoppers to edit the
      data and buy items at reduced prices, according to an ISS (Internet Security Systems)
      X-Force security alert issued this week. 
    
      According to X-Force, 11 shopping cart applications used by e-commerce sites are
      vulnerable to this kind of malicious tampering. Some shopping cart applications use
      hidden fields in HTML forms to hold parameters for goods in an online store, and this
      is one potential security hole. If the attacker changes the price in the form on a local
      machine then loads the page into the browser, the item can be added to the cart at the
      modified price. 
    
      If hidden discount fields are used it's also possible to modify these and get discounts
      on items without modifying the price in the form. From the vendors point of view this
      gets really nasty if credit card orders are processed in real time, and it's difficult to
      verify that the correct price is being used before the credit card is charged. 
    
      X-Force also says that price changing is possible where an item's price is listed in a
      URL. "When clicking a link, the CGI program will add the item to the shopping cart with
      the price set in the URL. Simply changing the price in the URL will add the item to the
      shopping cart at the modified price. Shopping cart software should not rely on the web
      browser to set the price of an item." 
    
      Most of the sites affected have begun modifying their software to plug the holes, says
      X-Force. ®

      (Mainly a freq list, no big whoop, go check it out if you're
      interested, i've printed the Tempest article below - Ed)
      
      
      (This site isn't new to me, there is a LOT of information on 
      intrusion countermeasures and bug detection on the net, tscm 
      provides some of the best. - Ed )
      
      Tempest:
      
      Introduction

      When a new consumer electronic device such as a computer, DVD player, 
      blender, electric razor or other modern electronic marvel is offered for 
      sale to the public the manufacture has to gain a special certification or 
      authorization from the FCC. This process ensures that when the consumer 
      uses the device that they will not interfere with other sdevices in the 
      area. For example we don't want a DVD player or blender to accidentally 
      jam all the TV, and cellular telephones in a five-block area due to a 
      poor product design. 

      The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and its foreign equivalent 
      has created a series of formal standards which new equipment is evaluated 
      against before it is offered to the public. 

      These new products are taken into a specialized laboratory, and an 
      engineer completes a complicated battery of tests. These test results are 
      then sent to the FCC who then approves or denies the
           authorization.

      When modern electrical devices operate they generate electromagnetic 
      fields. Digital computers, radio equipment, typewriters, and so on 
      generate massive amounts of electromagnetic signals
           which if 
      properly intercepted and processed will allow certain amounts of 
      information to be reconstructed based on these "compromising emanations". 
      Basically anything with a microchip, diode, or transistor, gives off these 
      fields.

      Compromising emanations are these unintentional intelligence-bearing 
      signals, which, if intercepted and analyzed, potentially disclose the 
      national security information, transmitted, received,
           handled, or 
      otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment. 

      These compromising emanation signals can then escape out of a controlled 
      area by power line conduction, other fortuitous conduction paths such as 
      the air conditioning duct work, or by simply
           radiating a signal into 
      the air (like a radio station).

      An excellent example of these compromising emanations may be found in 
      modems and fax machines which utilize the Rockwell DataPump modem chip 
      sets and several modems made by U.S.
           Robotics. When these modems 
      operate they generate a very strong electromagnetic field which may be 
      intercepted, demodulated, and monitored with most VHF radios. This is 
      also a very serious problem with many speaker phone systems used in 
      executive conference rooms.

      This is also a very serious problem with many fax machines, computer 
      monitors, external disc drives, CD-R drives, scanners, printers, and 
      other high bandwidth or high speed peripherals.

      If an eavesdropper is using high quality intercept equipment the signal 
      may be easily acquired several hundred feet or more away from the target. 

      In the consumer markets a slight amount of signal leakage really does not 
      present a problem, however; if a computer processing classified 
      information has a leak the results could be devastating. 

      To deal with this "signal leakage" issue the government developed a 
      series of standards which lay out how equipment should be designed to 
      avoid such leakage. The TEMPEST standard are really
           nothing more 
      then several industry measurements standards which were adjusted by the 
      NSA (they gave it steroids).

      Really the only difference between a TEMPEST approved computer, and a 
      consumer computer is that the NSA TEMPEST approved one will be in a 
      special heavy metal case, will have special
           shielding, a modified 
      power supply and a few other modifications which increase the price by at 
      least 40 times.

      

      About TEMPEST

      TEMPEST is an official acronym for "Telecommunications Electronics 
      Material Protected From Emanating Spurious Transmissions" and includes 
      technical security countermeasures; standards, and
           instrumentation, 
      which prevent (or minimize) the exploitation of security vulnerabilities 
      by technical means. TEMPEST is nothing more then a fancy name for 
      protecting against technical surveillance or eavesdropping of UNMODIFIED 
      equipment (the unmodified part is important). 

      Other popular, but unofficial names for TEMPEST are "Transient Emanations 
      Protected From Emanating Spurious Transmissions", "Transient 
      Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard",
           "Telecommunications 
      Emission Security Standards", and several similar variations (including: 
      "Tiny ElectroMagnetic Pests Emanating Secret Things").

      TEMPEST was "invented" in 1918 when Herbert Yardley and his staff of the 
      Black Chamber were engaged by the U.S. Army to develop methods to detect, 
      intercept, and exploit covert radio
           transmitters. The initial 
      research identified that "normal unmodified equipment" was allowing 
      classified information to be passed to the enemy through a variety of 
      technical weaknesses. A classified program was then created to develop 
      methods to suppress these "compromising emanations". However, the actual 
      acronym known as TEMPEST was only coined in the late 60's and early 70's 
      (and is now considered an obsolete term, which has since, been replaced 
      by the phrase "Emissions Security" or EMSEC).

      TEMPEST products exist, however; they are highly restricted and 
      controlled SIGINT/COMINT (Signals or Communications Intelligence) 
      products and are CIA/NSA grade surveillance goodies. Such
           products 
      are only available from a very small number of defense or intelligence 
      contractors, and only to those with really serious security clearances. 
      TEMPEST products are not sold at Radio Shack, by private investigators, at 
      spy shops in New York City, or by security "experts". 

      TEMPEST and it's associated disciplines involve designing circuits to 
      minimize the amount of "compromising emanations" and to apply appropriate 
      shielding, grounding, and bonding. These
           disciplines also include 
      methods of radiation screening, alarms, isolation circuits/devices, and 
      similar areas of equipment engineering.

      TEMPEST disciplines typically involve eliminating or reducing the 
      transients caused by a communication signal and the resulting harmonics. 
      These signals and their harmonics could allow the
           original signal to 
      be reconstructed and analyzed.

      

      TEMPEST Approved Devices 

      A TEMPEST approved device (see below) is one that meets stringent 
      technical requirements. The electromagnetic waves it emits have been 
      reduced through shielding or other techniques to a
           point where it 
      would be extremely difficult for a hostile intelligence agent to gather 
      information from the electromagnetic waves and disclose the classified 
      information being transmitted.

           TEMPEST Approval - Type 1: A classified or controlled cryptographic 
           equipment, assembly, component, or item endorsed by the National 
           Security Agency (NSA) for securing
                     telecommunications and 
           automated information systems for the protection of classified or 
           sensitive U.S. Government information exempted by the Warner 
           Amendment for use by the U.S. Government and its contractors, and 
           subject to restrictions in accordance with the International Traffic 
           in Arms Regulation.

           TEMPEST Approval - Type 2: An unclassified cryptographic equipment, 
           assembly, component, or item endorsed by the National Security 
           Agency for use in telecommunications and
                     automated 
           information systems for the protection of unclassified but sensitive 
           information. Type 2 equipment is exempted by the Warner Amendment. 
           Type 2 is available to U.S. Government departments, agencies, 
           sponsored elements of state and local government, sponsored U.S. 
           Government contractors, and sponsored private sector entities. It is 
           subject to restrictions in accordance with the International Traffic 
           in Arms Regulation.

           TEMPEST Approval - Type 3: An unclassified cryptographic equipment, 
           assembly, component, or item that implements an unclassified 
           algorithm registered with the National Institute of
                     
           Standards and Technology (NIST) as a FIPS for use in protecting 
           unclassified sensitive, or commercial, information. This definition 
           does not include Warner-Amendment-exempt equipment.

      

      Test Equipment for a TEMPEST in a TEAPOT

      While SIGINT deals with the interception and analysis of "compromising 
      emanations", TEMPEST is the protection of those "emanations". TEMPEST, 
      TEAPOT (as in "TEMPEST in a TEAPOT"),
           NONSTOP, SKIPJACK, HIJACK, and 
      TSCM are all related standards and protocols which deal with containing 
      "compromising emanations". TEMPEST generally deals specifically with 
      shielding, bonding, and grounding (it is a counter-surveillance science, 
      and has nothing to do with actual surveillance or reading or 
      reconstructing these emanations).

           TEAPOT refers to the investigation, study, and control of 
           intentional compromising emanations such as those hostilely induced 
           or provoked from telecommunications and computer equipment.

           TSCM includes all countermeasures employed to prevent or detect the 
           interception of sensitive, classified, or private information. TSCM 
           is typically an inspection by a technician or engineer of
                     
           a physical item or place (briefcase, automobile, office, home, boat, 
           etc...). The purpose is to locate possible covert surveillance 
           devices (bugs), technical security weakness, and technical security 
           hazards.

      TEMPEST test equipment is very expensive, and is very highly controlled 
      military products (usually classified). While a number of U.S. companies 
      offer such equipment they will only sell it to
           government agencies. 
      Beware of anybody who tries to foist a security product onto you and 
      claims it involves TEMPEST technology. 

      Such equipment utilizes both extremely narrow bandwidths (often 100 Hz or 
      less), and very wide bandwidths (above 50 MHz). This kind of equipment 
      also must use super stable time bases, which
           are very expensive. 
      Even the most basic models of this kind of equipment cost hundreds of 
      thousands of dollars. Of course such equipment is quite inappropriate for 
      eavesdropping (there is no such thing as a "TEMPEST Eavesdropping 
      System").

      

      Van Ecking

      In 1985 Wim van Eck (an engineer in the Netherlands) published a white 
      paper entitled "Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An 
      Eavesdropping Risk?" which discussed potential
           methods which could 
      be used for eavesdropping on video monitors. 

      The "van Eck receiver" was based on older video monitors which utilized a 
      composite video signal with little or no RF/EMI shielding. These video 
      signals were typical broadcast base-band video
           signals, and the 
      monitors were generally un-shielded which radiated tremendous amounts of 
      RF energy. Very often when these types of monitors were placed near a 
      television set the video monitor would interfere with the television and 
      the "computer stuff" would appear and interfere with the Dallas and 
      Charlies Angels re-runs. Since these monitors utilized the same timing 
      signals and waveform parameters as commercial video signals the display of 
      the signals was very easy and required only a few dollars on components 
      to stabilize the signal.

      

      RAID or Raster Analysis

      Effectively what van Eck did was to point out a well-known hardware 
      security vulnerability that existed in composite computer monitors. His 
      paper covered methods that could be used to exploit this
           
      vulnerability, and brought "emission analysis" to public attention when 
      it was published. Of course every "lid, kid, con-artist, crank, and 
      crackpot" came forward and anointed him or herself an expert on van Eck 
      and TEMPEST technology.

      What Wim van Eck presented is actually called RAID or "Raster Analysis" 
      which is the reconstruction of high bandwidth composite signals which are 
      based on a repeating synchronization signal
           (such as Radar, Video, 
      and so on). A brief tutorial on raster or video signal analysis may be 
      found at the following link http://www.tscm.com/TSCM101video3.html

      

      Lids, Kids, Con-Artists, Cranks, and Crackpots

      It should be mentioned that the only place in the United States that a 
      person can learn anything about TEMPEST is a special school taught and 
      sanctioned by the National Security Agency. Once a
           technician or 
      engineer completes the appropriate training the NSA will actually certify 
      them as a "TEMPEST Technician" or "TEMPEST Engineer" and they will then 
      be authorized the work on or design TEMPEST approved equipment. The (very 
      expensive) courses are only offered to a limited number of people who 
      have a very high level of security clearance, and who will be working 
      with such equipment on a regular basis.

      While van Eck's engineering and white paper was quite legitimate a number 
      of con-artists capitalized on the paper to sell special screening boxes, 
      "van Eck receivers", and special "Classified CIA
           intercept systems". 

      These products are generally considered a rather old hoax, but the con 
      artists are still racking in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling 
      bogus toys. Such a system only requires about $15 to
           construct a 
      special amplifier or timing circuit. The method is a "no-brainer" which 
      any college freshman could do

      Intercepting a composite video signal from an older unshielded monitor is 
      actually quite simple, HOWEVER; the modern computer monitors sold today 
      rarely use a composite video signal. Also, due
           to the serious 
      shielding and emission standards required by the FCC the presence or 
      interception of such signals is virtually nil (even at close distances).

      

      Keep Your Wallet in Your Pocket

      Many people, including the members of the media, have been swallowing 
      what is falsely claimed to be TEMPEST simply because they neither 
      understand the science nor will they do even simple
           research or 
      inquiries on a vendor who claims to be a TEMPEST expert.

      The majority of TEMPEST surveillance "demonstrations" are actually rigged 
      or grossly misrepresented (the spy might as well become a psychic and 
      start channeling Ramtha via his big toenail).

      In the past few years there have been quite a few "TEMPEST experts" that 
      demonstrate what they claim will intercept "TEMPEST signals". Most of the 
      Tempest/Van Eck surveillance products out
           there are nothing more 
      then a scam run by thieves, con men, scam artists, liars, thieves, snake 
      oil salesman, felons, and mental patients (no kidding).

      Seriously, if such a person attempts to peddle would-be TEMPEST products 
      on you, ask about their current probation status, prior criminal 
      convictions, and ask about the last time they talked with a
           
      psychiatrist or other mental health professional (and then watch them run 
      out the door). 

      Several firms have even gone so far as to pre-record the display of a 
      computer monitor (with a video camcorder no less) and then conceal a 
      playback VCR in a fancy looking demonstration box. The
           victim pays 
      the "TEMPEST expert" $20,000 for an identical box and never sees there 
      money again, nor do they ever get a magical TEMPEST box. After several 
      months the victim tries to contact the con artist only to find the phone 
      number given goes to a beeper (the owner of which refuses to re-contact 
      the victim).

      

      The Law 

      Keep in mind that if somebody offers you any type of van Eck "intercept" 
      or TEMPEST surveillance system that they are committing a serious federal 
      felony. In the event that you are gullible enough
           to actually pay 
      the con artist then YOU have committed a serious federal felony. Also, if 
      you attempt in any way to obtain the equipment, or engage in any kind of 
      activity to help someone else obtain the equipment that is also illegal 
      (even if it's a hoax).

      You will leave eavesdropping and interception equipment alone unless you 
      have a strong desire to have extended discussions with the nice agents 
      from the FBI. They would be quite happy to talk
           to you regarding 
      your upcoming indictment and your "all expenses paid vacation at a 
      federally operated vacation resort".

      Remember that ANY possession, attempted sale, attempted purchase, or 
      building of such a surveillance product or device is highly illegal 
      unless you are under a very specific government contract
           (even if it 
      is a hoax). 

      The building, possession, sale, or advertising of any device designed or 
      developed to exploit signal leakage or compromising emanations is a very 
      serious criminal act in the United States unless
           you are under a 
      very specific government contract (or are a police officer with a 
      legitimate court order).

      Also, any device, or system which is primarily useful for the 
      interception of communications is also illegal, and the justice system 
      takes a very dim view of people who try to skirt the law by playing
           
      cute word games.

      A founding member of Pirates With Attitudes, Robin

      U.S. District Court in Boston. According to an FBI
      affidavit, the PWA is a highly structured organization
      and the investigation is ongoing. One of the conditions
      of his bail agreement is that Rothberg must let the FBI
      spot check his e-mail.

      FBI nabs Chelmsford man in software piracy ring 
      by Andrea Estes 
 
      Friday, February 4, 2000
 
      Federal officials say they've captured a leader of a worldwide band of
      e-pirates who surf the cyberseas in search of software plunder. 
 
      Robin Rothberg, 32, of Chelmsford, is a founding member of Pirates
      with Attitudes, an international crew that steals popular titles from
      powerful companies and gives them away to its members for free, the
      FBI says.
 
      The group, snared by FBI agents in Chicago, is sophisticated and
      devious enough to have sought after software before it hits the
      shelves, authorities said.
 
      In December, FBI agents found Windows 2000 - which still hasn't
      been released - and Office 2000 premium, a program given to select
      customers for testing purposes.
 
      In all, agents found enough software to fill the memory of 1,200
      average-sized personal computer hard drives.
 
      Rothberg, who until last week was a notebook software engineer for
      NEC Computer Services in Acton, was arrested yesterday and
      charged with conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Boston. Wearing a
      long ponytail and black leather jacket, he pleaded not guilty and was
      released without bail.
 
      According to an FBI affidavit, Pirates with Attitudes is a highly
      structured organization with different members assigned different
      tasks.
 
      ``Suppliers'' steal the programs from major software companies.
      ``Couriers'' deliver the files to PWA and ``crackers'' strip away the
      security codes that prevent piracy.
 
      The group, overseen by a council, screens members to ``minimize the
      risk of detection by authorities,'' according to an affidavit filed by FBI
      Special Agent Michael Snyder of Chicago.
 
      Rothberg, who is alleged to be a member of the council, was arrested
      after an informant helped steer Snyder, an MBA and computer expert,
      through its maze-like system.
 
      Agents located PWA's internet site, ``Sentinel,'' which is accessible
      only to authorized users.
 
      ``Members maintain access to PWA's site by providing files, including
      copyrighted software files obtained from other sources, and in turn
      are permitted to copy files provided by other users,'' wrote Snyder.
 
      ``Using the confidential informant's access codes, FBI agents logged
      onto Sentinel and viewed a directory listing thousands of copyrighted
      software titles available for downloading by PWA members,'' he wrote.
 
      So far only Rothberg has been arrested. Chicago authorities
      yesterday said the investigation is continuing.
 
      ``In the simplest terms, it's an organization that allowed its members
      to upload software to a site configured so it could store a substantial
      amount of software,'' said assistant United States Attorney Lisa
      Griffin. ``They could then download it into their own computers.''
      Members give and take what they wish, officials said.
 
      ``It's a two-way street,'' said Randy Sanborn, spokesman for the
      United States Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Illinois.
 
      Officials wouldn't say whether members have to pay anything - such
      as a membership fee - for the service.
 
      Rothberg was downsized out of his job last week when the division he
      worked for ceased to exist, according to an NEC spokeswoman, who
      said the company has no plans to investigate Rothberg's job
      performance.
 
      Rothberg asked Magistrate Judge Robert Collings for permission to
      travel to California today for a job interview.
 
      And Rothberg said he had several more planned, his attorney Joseph
      Savage told Collings.
 
      Collings ordered him to stay off his computer except to look for a job,
      let the FBI spot check his e-mail, and get the court's permission if he
      wants to travel outside the Bay State.

     A 14-year-old boy who tried to extort $500 from a businessman
     after hacking into his computer will have to explain to police
     how he did it as part of his punishment. 

     The teenager, who can't be identified under the Young
     Offenders Act, demanded the payoff be put in a red bag and left
     at the end of his street, just north of Toronto, a family court
     sentencing hearing was told yesterday. 

     But the Toronto businessman, who also can't be identified
     under a court order, went to the police, and undercover officers
     secretly watched the teenager pick up the cash and take it
     home, the hearing was told. 

     When officers searched his home, they found the teen had also
     been making counterfeit $5 and $20 bills. 

     As well as explaining to police how he hacked into the
     businessman's computer, the teen must do 100 hours of
     community service, and serve two years probation. 

     Crown Attorney Calvin Barry said since the Grade 9 student
     was so good with computers he would likely do his community
     work teaching basic computer skills. 

     The teen pleaded guilty to extortion, mischief, unauthorized use
     of a computer, fraudulent possession of a password,
     possession of counterfeit money and possession of
     instruments for counterfeiting. 

     Barry told the court the west-end businessman, who runs a
     computer store, used an Internet chat line to communicate with
     his customers. 

     Someone hacked into his chat line account and changed the
     password, rendering his own secret code word useless. 

     The businessman was able to trace through the Internet the
     person who hacked into his account. When he E-mailed the
     teen, he was told he had to pay $500 for the new password, the
     court heard.

      contributed by William Knowles 
      The National Police Agency of Japan has requested
      $1.78 million from the country's fiscal 2000 budget to
      study electronic break ins. The agencies records
      indicate that there where 247 Internet crimes, including
      distributing child pornography, in Japan in 1999. This
      follows several high profile defacements of government
      web sites in recent weeks. 

      Associated Press - via Tampa Bay Online 
      http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGIGU35UA4C.html
      
      Reports: Japanese Police Moving to Counter
      Wave of Internet Crime 
      The Associated Press

      TOKYO (AP) - With hackers barraging government Internet sites,
      Japanese police announced plans to improve crime-fighting in
      cyberspace, newspapers reported Saturday. 

      Beginning late last month, unidentified hackers began a
      high-profile campaign to crack state sites. And despite its love for
      just about everything high-tech, Japan is far behind other countries
      when it comes to tackling online crime. 

      The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest paper, said the National
      Police Agency has requested $1.78 million from the country's
      fiscal 2000 budget to battle the problem. Police want to study how
      hackers break into Web sites and ensure user names are not
      being abused, the reports said. 

      Agency officials were unavailable for comment. 

      Agency figures showed that 247 Internet crimes, including
      distributing child pornography, were reported in 1999, nearly
      double the previous year, according to major Japanese
      newspapers. 

      A bill aimed at improving user verification, a so-called digital
      signature bill, is due to be submitted to parliament soon, the Asahi
      Shimbun reported. Digital signatures allow people to use the
      Internet to buy and sell goods and services, it said. 

      The police agency is urging that mandatory identity checks on
      people who apply for such signatures be made part of the bill, the
      paper said. 

      The proposed legislation comes on the heels of a new law
      parliament passed last summer to make it illegal to access sites
      without the proper clearance. It takes effect this month. 

      The Bank of Japan - the country's central bank - the Defense
      Agency, the Science and Technology Agency and the Transport
      Ministry have all reported being attacked by hackers, though they
      reported no damage. 

      However, hackers into the Science and Technology Agency's

      The web site of Philippine President Joseph Estrada was
      defaced last week. The site had one page altered with
      comments containing sexual innuendoes. Officials said
      that security practices for the site would be reviewed.

      Philippine president's Erap.com Web site vandalized
      by hacker Bloomberg 

      Friday, February 4, 2000

      A computer hacker broke into the Internet site of President Joseph
      Estrada, inserting a sexual innuendo on an electronic document in the
      first successful vandalism of the Philippine leader's Web presence.

      The prankster placed the phrase, including a mention of
      homosexuality, on a week-old briefing paper on oil prices that was
      posted by the Office of the Press Secretary to the www.erap.com
      site. The posting was on the web site for almost a day before being
      removed. 

      ``If I was older, I'd have a heart attack,'' said Ding Gagelonia,
      director of the Bureau of Broadcast Services, which oversees the
      site. 

      The intrusion comes a week after two Japanese ministries had their
      Web sites defaced, and highlights the potential embarrassment
      awaiting vulnerable computers of the government and private
      companies as more firms in Asia conduct their businesses over the
      Internet. 

      In the Japanese break-ins, the hackers erased data and placed links
      to pornography sites. 

      Gagelonia said it was the first time the site, established in June 1998
      to promote the policies of Estrada and obtain feedback from the
      public, had its contents altered. 

      Previously, the site was the target of ``mail-bomb'' attacks where
      pranksters tried to shut it down by overloading its e-mail system.
      Those attacks were repulsed, he said. 

      The site, which has a computer server in the presidential palace and
      another one in Europe, will review its security procedures, Gagelonia
      said. DesignNet Philippines Inc., a unit of the Engstrom Group of
      Sweden, developed the site.

      The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act
      (UCITA) is still be pushed by powerful software
      companies through state legislatures across the nation.
      UCITA legislation would give software companies the
      ability to 'turn off' software remotely, it would provide
      for license agreements that could be changed with only
      an email notice, and it would ban critical software
      reviews through stronger license agreements. The
      software industry is aggressively lobbying for this
      legislation, saying that it is an overdue modernization of
      contract law to keep up with the pace of electronic
      commerce. It is expected that several states will
      actually pass this draconian law.

                      Why We Must Fight UCITA
                         by Richard Stallman
  
      UCITA is a proposed law, designed by the proprietary software
      developers, who are now asking all 50 states of the US to
      adopt it. If UCITA is adopted, it will threaten the free software
      community(1) with disaster. To understand why, please read
      on. 
  
      We generally believe that big companies ought to be held to a
      strict standard of liability to their customers, because they can
      afford it and because it will keep them honest. On the other
      hand, individuals, amateurs, and good samaritans should be
      treated more favorably. 
  
      UCITA does exactly the opposite. It makes individuals,
      amateurs, and good samaritans liable, but not big companies. 
  
      You see, UCITA says that by default a software developer or
      distributor is completely liable for flaws in a program; but it also
      allows a shrink-wrap license to override the default.
      Sophisticated software companies that make proprietary
      software will use shrink-wrap licenses to avoid liability entirely.
      But amateurs, and self-employed contractors who develop
      software for others, will be often be shafted because they
      didn't know about this problem. And we free software
      developers won't have any reliable way to avoid the problem. 
  
      What could we do about this? We could try to change our
      licenses to avoid it. But since we don't use shrink-wrap
      licenses, we cannot override the UCITA default. Perhaps we
      can prohibit distribution in the states that adopt UCITA. That
      might solve the problem--for the software we release in the
      future. But we can't do this retroactively for software we have
      already released. Those versions are already available, people
      are already licensed to distribute them in these states--and
      when they do so, under UCITA, they would make us liable. We
      are powerless to change this situation by changing our licenses
      now; we will have to make complex legal arguments that may
      or may not work. 
  
      UCITA has another indirect consequence that would hamstring
      free software development in the long term--it gives
      proprietary software developers the power to prohibit reverse
      engineering. This would make it easy for them to establish
      secret file formats and protocols, which there would be no
      lawful way for us to figure out. 
  
      That could be a disastrous obstacle for development of free
      software that can serve users' practical needs, because
      communicating with users of non-free software is one of those
      needs. Many users today feel that they must run Windows,
      simply so they can read and write files in Word format.
      Microsoft's "Halloween documents" announced a plan to use
      secret formats and protocols as a weapon to obstruct the
      development of the GNU/Linux system(2). 
  
      Precisely this kind of restriction is now being used in Norway to
      prosecute 16-year-old Jon Johansen, who figured out the
      format of DVDs to make it possible to write free software to
      play them on free operating systems. (The Electronic Frontier
      Foundation is helping with his defense; see
      http://www.eff.org/ for further information.) 
  
      Some friends of free software have argued that UCITA would
      benefit our community, by making non-free software intolerably
      restrictive, and thus driving users to us. Realistically speaking,,
      this is unlikely, because it assumes that proprietary software
      developers will act against their own interests. They may be
      greedy and ruthless, but they are not stupid. 
  
      Proprietary software developers intend to use the additional
      power UCITA would give them to increase their profits. Rather
      than using this power at full throttle all the time, they will make
      an effort to find the most profitable way to use it. Those
      applications of UCITA power that make users stop buying will
      be abandoned; those that most users tolerate will become the
      norm. UCITA will not help us. 
  
      UCITA does not apply only to software. It applies to any sort
      of computer-readable information. Even if you use only free
      software, you are likely to read articles on your computer, and
      access data bases. UCITA will allow the publishers to impose
      the most outrageous restrictions on you. They could change
      the license retroactively at any time, and force you to delete
      the material if you don't accept the change. They could even
      prohibit you from describing what you see as flaws in the
      material. 
  
      This is too outrageous an injustice to wish on anyone, even if
      it would indirectly benefit a good cause. As ethical beings, we
      must not favor the infliction of hardship and injustice on others
      on the grounds that it will drive them to join our cause. We
      must not be Machiavellian. The point of free software is
      concern for each other. 
  
      Our only smart plan, our only ethical plan, is...to defeat UCITA!
  
      If you want to help the fight against UCITA, by meeting with
      state legislators in your state, send mail to Skip Lockwood
      dfc@dfc.org. He can tell you how to contribute effectively. 
  
      Volunteers are needed most urgently in Virginia and Maryland,
      but California and Oklahoma are coming soon. There will
      probably be a battle in every state sooner or later.

      All of Yahoo.com was unreachable for several hours
      yesterday after what company officials claimed was a
      massive denial of service attack. While officials stress
      that there where no successful intrusions there still
      seems to be some confusion over what exactly
      happened. Some reports seem to indicate a bandwidth
      consumption attack with either Trinoo or TNF while
      other reports say that individual routers where pushed
      over and Wired says that it may have been due to
      'misconfigured equipment'. (I hope this is straightened
      out soon so that the rest of us can protect ourselves.)

      Hackers attack, overwhelm Yahoo! 

       Copyright © 2000 Nando Media Copyright © 2000 Associated Press

      
      By TED BRIDIS 

      WASHINGTON (February 7, 2000 8:36 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - 
      Computer vandals using a common electronic attack overwhelmed Yahoo!, the 
      most popular site on the Internet, and rendered the flagship Web directory       
      inaccessible for much of Monday. 

      Yahoo! Inc. spokeswoman Diane Hunt said the company, worth roughly $93 
      billion, was the victim of hackers flooding its equipment with repeated 
      electronic requests. The vandals did not gain access inside its computers, 
      she said. 

      The technique, called a denial of service attack, is similar to pranksters 
      repeatedly dialing a company's telephone number to block all other 
      incoming calls. 

      Hunt said technicians determined that a flood of data requests coming from 
      different computers on the Internet had overwhelmed its routers, which 
      help direct traffic for the Web site. 

      Technicians ultimately were able to identify the type of data and filter 
      it out, which restored service. 

      She said she was unaware whether the company had contacted the FBI, which 
      coincidentally warned Web sites last month about a specific type of denial 
      of service attack. 

      "Our first priority has been identifying what was happening and then 
      installing the filters to enable our users to access our services," Hunt 
      said. 

      In its advisory, the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center said 
      it was "highly concerned about the scale and significance of these 
      reports" and said vulnerabilities were "widespread, well-known and readily 
      accessible on most       networked systems."

      Yahoo Unplugged by Hackers

       Elinor Abreu, The Industry Standard

       Yahoo did not have a good day. A hacker attack rendered the Web's No. 1 
       portal intermittently inaccessible Monday. 

       Starting at about 10:30 a.m. PST, a coordinated, multi-point attack on 
       Yahoo's California data center shut down the site sporadically, a Yahoo 
       representative said. The so-called "distributed denial of service attack" 
       works by bombarding servers with so much        fake traffic that genuine 
       traffic cannot get through. Redundant servers allowed some visitors 
       access to the site.

       The company installed filters on its routers around 1:30 p.m. to block 
       fake traffic and open up bandwidth to legitimate users, the 
       representative said. No user information was compromised and some Yahoo 
       services, like Web-based e-mail and its virtual        shopping mall, 
       were believed to have been unaffected. The main site was inaccessible by 
       some as late as 4:45 p.m..

       Yahoo has had small, short-term outages in the past, but nothing on this 
       scale, the representative said. In August 1999, a glitch kept some 
       customers out of their e-mail accounts for a few hours. 

       However, that's nothing compared to the problems eBay, E-Trade, 
       Amazon.com and Egghead have experienced. For instance, eBay outages last 
       year - including one that lasted 22 hours - prompted infrastructure 
       upgrades that reduced revenues by $5 million        and resulted in a 26 
       percent drop in the company's stock price. 

       The attack corresponded with a so-called "birds of a feather" meeting to 
       discuss denial of service attacks at a conference in San Jose today 
       sponsored by the North American Network Operators group, said Russ 
       Cooper, editor of NTBugTraq. "I would        assume that whoever did it 
       was doing it to impress those people who were getting together to talk 
       about them." 

       The attack is fairly easy to do because there are Perl scripts and other 
       executables that circulate that only require a server address to be 
       inserted, he said. However, the fact that it was distributed indicates 
       that "somebody was putting some thought behind it;        coordinating 
       it," Cooper said. 

       Yahoo is ranked as the Internet's top Web site with 36.4 million unique 
       visitors in December, according to Media Metrix.

       Routers Blamed for Yahoo Outage 
       by Declan McCullagh and Joanna Glasner 
       
       5:00 p.m. 7.Feb.2000 PST 
       Most of the Yahoo network was unreachable for three hours on Monday as 
       the company weathered what it described as a widespread malicious attack 
       on its Web sites. 

       Attackers reportedly laid siege to the Internet's second most popular 
       destination at about 10:30 a.m. PST, snarling Yahoo's internal network 
       and denying millions of visitors access to mail, schedules, and the 
       directory service. 

       
       An engineer at another company that receives Internet access from the 
       same provider, Global Center, told Wired News the outage was due to 
       misconfigured equipment. 

       The person, who asked to remain anonymous, said that his firm also lost 
       connectivity through Global Center's Sunnyvale, California, facility 
       during the same time period due to apparent router problems, not hacker 
       attacks. 

       Details remained sketchy, with service provider Global Center blaming an 
       intentional surge in traffic and Yahoo claiming a cadre of as-yet-unknown 
       vandals fouled their system. No Web content appeared to have been altered 
       or        deleted. 

       A Yahoo spokesperson called it a "coordinated distributed denial of 
       service attack" against the company's San Francisco Bay Area data centers 
       that originated from multiple places at the same time. The representative 
       said the outage        caused an "intermittent ability to access some, 
       but not all, of our services." 

       But the offline sites rank among the most prominent. Yahoo's highly 
       visible yahoo.com, broadcast.com, and my.yahoo.com sites were 
       unreachable, although some other properties such as Geocities remained 
       unaffected. 

       A likely explanation: Geocities receives its connection from Exodus, 
       while the yahoo.com and other affected sites connect to the Internet 
       through Global Center. 

       "The Global Center network is not down. There've been no fiber cuts... 
       This is a specific attack on Yahoo by external forces," said Secret 
       Fenton, a spokeswoman for Global Center. "This affected accessibility to 
       Yahoo, [which] hosts        servers for its site at Global Center." 

       Global Center -- formerly FrontierNet -- is owned by Global Crossing, a 
       Bermuda telecommuniations firm. Other Global Center customers, such as 
       Ziff Davis, MP3.com, and eToys.com, did not report any glitches. 

       Neither Yahoo nor Global Center representatives provided technical 
       details, but the snafu seemed to originate with a router, and experts 
       began speculating on what could have been the cause. 

       Jeff Schiller, MIT's network manager, said that a denial of service 
       attack could be mistaken for router failure at first. 

       "They might have thought they had a bad card in a router, and they shut 
       down the router and replaced the card, and the problem didn't go away," 
       Schiller said. "They probably replaced equipment and then discovered that 
       it didn't        solve the problem." 

       Schiller speculated that any assault might have been a "Tribal Flood 
       Network" attack. "If this is a denial of service attack, this is the one 
       of the first attacks against a public business." 

       The outage had the unusual effect of boosting the companies' shares. 
       Global Crossing closed Monday at 50 5/16, up 1 1/8. Yahoo ended at 354, 
       up half a point.

       On the Motley Fool discussion groups, investors kvetched that they 
       couldn't access their mail, news, or movie info -- while scratching their 
       heads over the apparent non-effect of the snafu. "Usually, when a portal 
       has an outage the        stock price goes down. Yahoo is holding up 
       surprisingly well," one person wrote.

       Keynote Systems, an Internet monitoring firm, said the Yahoo outage began 
       between 10:15 and 10:30 a.m. (PST). 

       According to Media Metrix, only America Online reaches more people online 
       than Yahoo.

      Launching a Counteroffensive in
      Cyberspace
      Program Training Corp of Experts in Computer Security

      By Vernon Loeb
      Washington Post Staff Writer
      Saturday, February 5, 2000; Page A03 

      LIVERMORE, Calif.—Eric Thomas hacks into Jason Arnold's computer
      with a few simple keystrokes, sniffing Arnold's password, hijacking his
      online session and stealing all the data on his screen.

      It's easy enough. Thomas launches the attack, an ingeniously malicious
      script of Czech origin that he's downloaded from the Internet, without
      Arnold ever knowing what hit him.

      "I'm watching everything he's doing right now," Thomas says, peering at his
      computer screen. He types in another command and declares victory: "I've
      taken over his connection!"

      As it happens, Thomas and Arnold are seated 10 feet apart here at the
      Northern California branch of Sandia National Laboratory, the nation's
      best-equipped computer attack simulation center. This is a place where it
      is quickly apparent that the thrust and parry between cyber-attackers and
      cyber-defenders has evolved further than non-experts may realize--and
      that the defenders are not as hapless as the American public may think.

      Both Thomas, 20, and Arnold, 18, are students at San Jose State
      University with a flair for computers. And both are just the type President
      Clinton had in mind last month when he proposed a national scholarship
      program to train cyber-security experts in return for four years of public
      service once they graduate.

      The two young men are part of the vanguard, already enrolled in Sandia's
      College Cyber Defenders Program, an initiative of computer security guru
      Fred Cohen. A principal member of Sandia's technical staff, Cohen, 43, is
      credited with inventing the computer virus as a graduate student at the
      University of Southern California in 1983. Like Clinton, he believes the
      current security environment is more precarious than ever, having spent the
      past 17 years pioneering defenses against all forms of cyber-attack.

      The attackers are becoming bolder and more sophisticated, Cohen said,
      while most people using computers know little--and seem to care even
      less--about protecting their machines. "This disconnect between
      technology and how people behave is getting broader, not narrower,"
      Cohen said.

      But within the federal government, the picture is more encouraging. The
      Pentagon's computer defenses have improved by "an order of magnitude
      over the past five years," according to Cohen. While the government still
      makes its share of blunders in cyberspace, he said, its combined expertise
      for defending computer systems and waging cyberwar "is probably the
      best in the world--by a long ways."

      Such prowess isn't always readily apparent, with hackers taking down
      federal Web sites with regularity and Clinton sounding the alarm about
      cyber-terrorism in his budget proposal for fiscal 2001, which contains $2
      billion in computer defense initiatives.

      But the Pentagon started funding the government's first computer
      emergency response team, or CERT, at Carnegie Mellon University 12
      years ago after the so-called Morris "worm" was unleashed on the Internet
      and spread to 6,000 computers. Now most federal departments and
      agencies staff their own CERTs, the infantry in a growing cyber-security
      command structure.

      At the FBI, the National Infrastructure Protection Center is responsible for
      fighting cyber-crime, taking many of its leads from CERTs throughout the
      executive branch. At the Pentagon, a newly created center in Arlington
      called the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Defense is responsible for
      coordinating all computer defenses throughout the military. And at the
      General Services Administration, the Federal Computer Incident Response
      Center plays the same role for all civilian computer defenses.

      The price tag for these forces this fiscal year: $1.5 billion.

      Cohen himself is a one-man computer defense conglomerate, beginning
      with an 18-member research staff on cyber-security he directs here at the
      California branch of Sandia, which has its headquarters in New Mexico.

      Dressed in blue jeans and Birkenstocks, he explains that he developed the
      Cyber College Defenders Program for much the same reason Clinton
      proposed the $25 million scholarship program. "Ph.D. researchers are very
      expensive, they're hard to find, and the [national] labs don't pay as much as
      Silicon Valley," Cohen said. "It's build or buy these employees--and you
      can't buy them. So you have to build them."

      The son of two physics professors, Cohen is also an adjunct professor at
      the University of New Haven in Connecticut and an expert in the nascent
      field of computer forensics--tracking digital crimes. And he runs a private
      consulting business, advising companies on how to protect their computer
      systems. One of his tactics is to show clients that they are theoretically
      vulnerable to attacks that could disable factories, cause chemical spills, or
      steal millions of dollars.

      With such experience, Cohen is deadly earnest about the threat of
      cyber-war. He joined Sandia's technical staff, he said, because he saw "the
      potential for attacks on the critical infrastructure that could cost millions of
      lives and change the course of nations."

      Lance J. Hoffman, director of the Cyberspace Policy Institute at George
      Washington University, said most experts believe it is only a matter of time
      before a disastrous computer assault takes place.

      "The government does have resources in computer security and
      information assurance," Hoffman said. "But there is no such thing as perfect
      security. . . . I hope Congress does not wait until the aftermath of a
      cyber-disaster to take action."

      In Sandia's cyber-defenders program, Cohen downloads attack programs
      posted on hacker Web sites and assigns his students to run them against a
      variety of operating systems, figure out how they work and devise ways to
      defeat them. The suggested defenses are then posted on the Internet.

      "Attackers share, but defenders don't share as well," Cohen said.

      With the program nearing its first anniversary, students working part-time
      for $10 to $12 an hour have already modeled 400 attacks. Cohen has
      1,800 more planned, and he figures his students will be caught up by the
      end of this summer, when the number of participants in the training
      program will double to 25.

      One day last month, Corbin Stewart, 28, who has a degree in history and
      is studying computer science at Las Positas Community College, launched
      his 100th simulated attack, a script called seyon exploit.sh.

      It comes with a disclaimer: "Please use in a responsible manner." But seyon
      exploit.sh was written with unconcealed malice, designed to allow whoever
      launches the code to gain root access to an improperly protected Unix
      operating system.

      "It's privilege expansion," Cohen said as Stewart fired away. "They
      become the super-user on your computer--they can read, write, modify
      anything. They can cause it to crash, they can use it to attack other
      computers, they can install sniffers, Trojan horses to get back in--it's all
      theirs."

      The threat, of course, is relative--and often grossly exaggerated, Cohen
      said.

      Hackers launching seyon exploit.sh or other commonly available attack
      scripts could damage somebody's home computer or business server,
      Cohen said, but it is highly unlikely that they could bring down U.S. military
      networks. Most hackers lack the expertise to penetrate sophisticated
      defenses or sustain their attacks, Cohen said. Hacking into a federal
      government Web site, he said, typically causes little more lasting damage
      than spray-painting a sign outside a government office.

      But when Clinton said last month that "hostile powers and terrorists can
      now turn a laptop computer into a potent weapon capable of doing
      enormous damage," he was not, in Cohen's opinion, exaggerating at all.

      A hacker may not be able to disrupt the Northeast's power grid, Cohen
      said, but the Russian government--with legions of computer scientists,
      years of expertise and a sophisticated understanding of how power
      systems work--probably could, if it wanted to.

      A Private Little Cyberwar 

      By Adam L. Penenberg 

      JAY DYSON KNOWS THE EXACT moment his life began to unravel. It was 10 a.m. 
      on Mar. 5, 1997, when Dyson, a techie for the National Aeronautics & Space 
      Administration in Pasadena, Calif., discovered that NASA had been hacked. 

      A gang puckishly named Hagis--Hackers Against Geeks in Snowsuits--had 
      commandeered the "root" directory of some NASA computers, gaining partial 
      control of the network and lacing it with password "sniffers" and "back 
      doors" to let them return at will.       They replaced NASA's home page 
      with their own, decrying commercialization of the Internet with an almost 
      comical ominousness. 

      "All who profit from the misuse of the Internet will fall victim to our 
      upcoming reign of digital terrorism," Hagis declared. "The 
      commercialization of the Internet stops here." 

      Dyson, part of a team charged with spotting intrusions and patching 
      security holes, took this all too personally. Then he made his first 
      mistake: He bashed Hagis online, posting the attack on his own Web site. 
      "You are just a bunch of lame kids," he wrote. 

      That seemingly meek counterpunch sparked a cyberwar over the next two 
      years, pitting Dyson, 37, against two Hagis members known as Euphoria and 
      Trout, or in hacker lingo, "u4ea" and "tr0ut." Hackers are often depicted 
      as mischievous antiheroes of the       computer revolution: Sure, they 
      break in, but they don't really hurt anyone. Jay Dyson's tale points up a 
      meaner side. 

      His foes hacked two Internet service providers to get to him. They cracked 
      his home business, harassed his wife and, he says, cost him his marriage. 
      The digital intruders could do most anything they wanted to harass Dyson 
      online; no one was able to stop them.       He fears his tormentors won't 
      cease--and now is plotting measures to stop them, himself. 

      "I look at the trail of destruction Euphoria and Trout have left, and I 
      still don't know anything about them," he says. "But I know my day will 
      come." 

      Iowa born and bred, Dyson discovered computers at age 6, when his father, 
      an IBMer, took him to work one night and showed him a mainframe sending 
      data to a teletype printer. "I was enthralled. Ihad to understand this 
      magic."At age 15 he vowed to work       for NASA someday. He dropped out 
      of college in 1983, went into high tech and started doing work for NASA in 
      1995. At work his nickname is "the pit bull.""Once I sink my teeth into 
      something,I don't stop until it stops struggling." 

      Dyson calls himself a "white hat" hacker who blocks break-ins and alerts 
      softwaremakers to security lapses. Online, he hangs out at hacker haunts, 
      trading quips and tracking break-ins. 

      Government sites are big game for hackers, and NASA is a natural target. 
      At first, Hagis seemed harmless. It has breached Yahoo and propeller-head 
      sites Slashdot and Rootshell. Each time, it engaged in a little 
      nanny-nanny-boo-boo and made demands for       the release of a jailed 
      hacker hero, Kevin Mitnick. When Hagis cracked the Greenpeace site last 
      year, it posted a warning: "Phree Kevin Mitnick or we will club 600 baby 
      seals." (Mitnick finished a five-year prison sentence last month.) 

      Dyson sympathized with Hagis' anticommercial sentiment but thought it 
      silly to make the point on a NASA site. In his digital diatribe, he said 
      it wasn't "what real hacking is about" and dared them to attack a 
      commercial site. 

      Instead, Hagis attacked him, prying into Dyson's home page on the Web to 
      rewrite his broadside to say: "You guys are elite" (deleting "lame"). 
      Dyson restored his page, and the intruders revised his directory file 
      names to read: "You will pay for your stupidity."       Dyson retorted: 
      "Can't you stand free speech?" 

      Evidently not. The hackers retaliated by taking down the Internet firm 
      that provided Dyson's access. They planted a "poison pill" that deleted 
      everything on the network. The firm, Nyx, had to shut down for two weeks 
      to fix it. 

      Dyson surfed hacker chat rooms and e-mail lists, asking where he might 
      find "u4ea" and "tr0ut." He didn't go to the police. "They have no 
      freaking clue." Things quieted down, but he started buying guns, including 
      a 9mm Intratec pistol, a .45, a shotgun and a       .357 Magnum. 

      In September 1997 Hagis hit Yahoo, and Dyson worried he would be next. 
      Three months later his home and home-business phones were disconnected. 
      The phone company said someone had ordered the cutoff; it wasn't Jay 
      Dyson. 

      Then u4ea and tr0ut struck again, breaking into the online account of 
      Dyson's wife, Kathleen, at the California Institute of Technology. They 
      left her a message: "All the Dyson family will pay for the mistakes of Big 
      Jay." 

      This frightened her. Kathleen began to cry for hours on end, and the 
      couple bickered constantly over Dyson's relentless pursuit of the hackers. 
      She ended up on disability, "due in no small part to the harassment," he 
      claims. 

      But he refused to end his digital jihad. In January 1998 tr0ut and u4ea 
      cracked into a second Internet-access firm that Dyson uses, PacificNet. 
      This time they sabotaged Dyson's home business site, Point-2-Point 
      Presence, a Web design firm, deleting files. As       Dyson took to the 
      keyboard to make repairs, they brazenly messaged him "live," slipping back 
      in through the access firm's Unix operating system. 

      Dyson asked what they wanted. "Stand on one leg, hop up and down three 
      times and say 'Hagisrules!'three times," they commanded. "Done," Dyson 
      typed back. He was trying to keep the hackers online long enough for 
      PacificNet to trace them. It did not       work. 

      The next day Dyson reported the incidents to NASA. He was ordered to 
      ignore Hagis. "All I ever wanted was to work for NASA, and they tell me if 
      I wanted to keep the job I love, I'd have to turn the other cheek,"Dyson 
      fumes. He dropped the case at work,       "but redoubled my efforts on my 
      own time." 

      Stephen Nesbitt, a director in NASA's Computer Crimes Division, says the 
      feud isn't an agency concern and suggests Dyson should call the FBI. 

      The only time the law intervened, Dyson says, was when FBI agents paid him 
      a visit last August while investigating the hack of the New York Times Web 
      site almost a year earlier. Somehow Dyson, in his surfing of hacker sites, 
      had drawn their attention. They       accused him of being "Sidekick 
      Slappy," a member of Hacking for Girlies, the gang that took down the 
      Times site. (Those who know Sidekick Slappy say this: Jay Dyson is no 
      Sidekick Slappy.) 

      Meanwhile, his marriage crumbled. Dyson's obsession alienated his wife, 
      and in June 1998 they separated. "My wife wanted to run and hide, and I 
      wanted to fight," Dyson says. They later divorced; she declines to talk 
      about it. 

      Feeling alone, Dyson started smoking and losing weight--more than 50 
      pounds in five months, 100 pounds eventually. Some NASA colleagues say he 
      should have dropped it. "Jay kept kicking at this beehive, then wondering 
      why he kept getting stung," says       one. 

      Then came an arrest in the NASA hack. In April 1998 the Royal Canadian 
      Mounted Police in Sudbury, Ontario, arrested Jason Mewhiney, now 23, and 
      charged him with 46 counts of criminal mischief, illegal entry and other 
      charges. Mewhiney's hacker handle:       tr0ut, police said. He pleaded 
      guilty last month to 12 counts and now is serving six months in jail. Says 
      Dyson: "He's fortunate the law got there first." 

      Online, tr0ut was malicious. In jail, Jason Mewhiney is clean-cut and 
      "very shy--until you put him in front of a computer," says Corporal Alain 
      Chabot, one of the arresting officers. "Sometimes these kids are Einsteins 
      in front of their screens, but drop them off       downtown without a bus 
      map, and they're helpless." 

      Dyson's other nemesis, u4ea, is still at large. Word in the hacker 
      underground is that u4ea is a mole, but an FBI spokeswoman denies it and 
      says an investigation continues. Dyson believes he has traced u4ea's 
      identity to that of a young man in the Washington       area, but he isn't 
      handing that information to the FBI. Dyson wants to exact his own revenge. 
      "I have no intention of dragging u4ea to the authorities," he says, 
      fingering his .45. "This is strictly between him and me. I will do 
      whatever it takes to see this end come
      about."

      An interesting question and answer session between
      Adam Penenberg of Forbes magazine and Space Rogue,
      editor of the Hacker News Network.

      Adam Penenberg is a senior editor at Forbes magazine and a regular
      contributor to the Forbes Digital Tool.

      
        I first met Space Rogue, founder of Hacker News Network (HNN), at 
        Defcon, the annual hacker/undercover agent convention held in Las Vegas. 
        Sipping beer and sweating from the Nevada heat, we sat next to each 
        other at a seminar on social engineering--how to trick people into 
        passing you information.

         Afraid of potential legal ramifications, Defcon organizers had banned 
         media from the event, but unlike Space Rogue, I wasn't sporting press 
         credentials; I figured that would be like putting a big "kick me" sign 
         on my butt. While a geek on stage tried to dupe a Microsoft tech 
         support operator, a Wired News reporter was ejected from the hall. Then 
         the bouncer turned on us.

         "You have to leave," he commanded Space Rogue, fingering his press 
         pass. "You," he said, pointing at me, "can stay."

         "But I'm Space Rogue," said Space Rogue, turning his badge around to 
         show the HNN sticker he had applied to the back.

         "From Hacker News? Sorry, man, you're cool," said the guard.

         Everyone in the hacking and computer security world knows Space Rogue. 
         In 1998, while a member of the L0pht Heavy Industries, a hacker think 
         tank       based in Boston, he testified before the U.S. Senate on the 
         state of government computer security. He is the publisher of Hacker 
         News Network, a resource as dear to the cyber-cognescenti as 
         Merriam-Webster's is to writers. Recently, Space Rogue, along with the 
         rest of L0pht, joined @Stake, a newly formed Internet security company 
         funded by the hot venture capital firm Battery Ventures.

         As for his real name, well, he won't tell me. But he did tell me a lot 
         about hobnobbing with senators, cyber-terrorists, white hats, script 
         kiddies and the reason Hacker News Network doesn't use the word 
         "hacker."

                Q: How did you get into hacking?

                A: That's like asking someone how he learned to read. I suppose 
                my first 'real' hacking experience was with an Osborne 1 and 
                CPM, when I taught myself BASIC. This was back in 1984. Or maybe 
                it was earlier than that, when I was a kid making homemade 
                flashlights out of discarded batteries so I could read at night 
                when I was supposed to be sleeping. After the Osborne I 
                graduated to the Commodore 64. I remember the local computer 
                store sold Elephant floppies for two dollars each. Then came a 
                Mac SE with dual floppies and 1 megabyte of RAM for $2,000. I 
                still have that machine and the original box it came in.

                Q: Why are the vast majority of hackers male?

                A: For the same reason most physicists and mathematicians are 
                male. Most girls are taught early on that technology is not 
                feminine, therefore taboo. Society is starting to change, 
                opening itself up to new acceptable       ideologies.

                Q: What exactly is L0pht? How did you come up with the name?

                A: The original location of L0pht Heavy Industries was in the 
                loft of an old warehouse in South Boston, where we stored unused 
                equipment, stuff like a Vax 11/780 that was too big to put in 
                your house. The Heavy Industries part came from a Japanese anime 
                film. Somewhere in the movie was company with a name like 
                Matsasumo Heavy Industries. We wondered, What the hell is a 
                'Heavy Industry'? But we thought it was cool so it stuck.

                Q: What was it like to testify before Congress in 1998?

                A: It was a great experience. Everyone we met, from the senators 
                to the       aides, were extremely nice, which we didn't expect. 
                They even let us use our 'handles,' so the name 'Space Rogue' is 
                permanently etched into our nation's historical record--which 
                blows me away when I think about it. We got copies of the 
                testimony from the government printing office, and it's pretty 
                amazing to see Space Rogue, Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn 
                all on the same page.

         Getting reimbursed for travel presented a problem as the accounting 
         office couldn't very well make out a check to 'Space Rogue,' so Senator 
         Thompson's office arranged it so we could get reimbursed in cash.

                Q: Why did you start the Hacker News Network?

                A: HNN started as a competition among a small group of friends 
                to see who could distribute hacker-related news the fastest. 
                Well, it wasn't really a competition, but I guess I won anyway. 
                We hope that HNN is providing a service to the community, this 
                is why it was originally started. In the beginning we were 
                trying to make money on the site, so we carried advertising. 
                This sort of went against the old-school hacker mentality, but 
                we weren't trying to get rich; we just wanted to make the site 
                self-sustaining. Since L0pht's merger with @Stake, we will be 
                removing thoseads completely over time. It is important for 
                @Stake to remain completely vendor-neutral, and advertising 
                doesn't allow us to do that.

                Q: What is @Stake and why is it unique among Internet security       
                consultancies? What is your relationship to @Stake?

                A: I am an employee of @Stake--actually I think my business 
                cards say       'Research Scientist,' and yes, they also say 
                Space Rogue. I honestly think @Stake is really going to shake up 
                the industry; I mean look at what L0pht has been able to 
                accomplish. Everything the eight of us did was basically as a 
                part-time endeavor with no funds. Take L0pht to the next 
                level--full-time staff, corporate muscle, some new 
                technology--and what do you get? You get @Stake.

                Q: What is the greatest misperception about hackers?

                A: The general public seems to think that hackers equal 
                criminals. I suppose depending on your definition of the word 
                that may be true, although it is definitely not my definition. 
                Because there are so many definitions of the word, HNN has 
                stopped using the words hacker and cracker altogether, because 
                it does not matter in what context I use the word, someone will 
                send me mail and tell me its wrong. This is kind of ironic, 
                since this is supposed to be the 'Hacker' News Network.

      
                Q: What is a 'white hat' hacker, and what is a 'script kiddie?

                A: Again the definitions vary, but in general a white hat hacker 
                is someone who uses hacking methodologies and techniques but 
                doesn't break the law. A 'script kiddie' is an old word in the 
                underground that is just now becoming popular in the mainstream 
                media. It describes someone who uses prewritten scripts to 
                exploit security vulnerabilities, instead of coding his 
                own--like an armed robber who knows nothing of ballistics or 
                expanding gas theory, but knows how to pull a trigger.

                Q: Why should companies hire hackers? How could they ever trust 
                them?

                A: Companies already hire hackers, they just don't know it. I 
                mean, there is no national hacker registry to check on someone's 
                hacker status. Any company that comes out and says 'We do not 
                hire hackers' is deluding itself. We have to work somewhere, and 
                more often than not we work at jobs that have cool technology. 
                Of course, criminals should not be trusted or hired. But 
                hackers, according to my definition, should be hired by every 
                company. Any employee who has an innate curiosity about the 
                systems he, or she, is working with, and who will not sleep 
                until problems are solved, would benefit any business.

                Q: Is cyber-terrorism a real threat, or is it all hype?

                A: When we testified before Congress about being able to disable 
                the       Internet, a lot of people thought we were joking. 
                Afterwards we received a lot of e-mail asking, "Hey, is this how 
                it's done?'" We were like, well, that's not the method we 
                thought of, but yeah that'd work. Of course, we have no 
                motivation to take down the Internet; it's where we live and 
                play and earn a living, so why would we destroy it?

         That said, governments are definitely hyping the threat of cyber-terrorism.
         While a threat does exist, I don't think it's as bad as some officials would
         lead you to believe. The scary part is governments are jockeying for position
         in the next 'cyberwar.' Over the last couple of years nations have been beefing
         up their cyber defenses. Defense is good; I have no problem with defense. But 
         countries seem to be preparing offensive cyber capabilities. Offense often 
         begets defense, so the escalation begins. And what happens when military 
         offensive capabilities start to trickle down into the private sector? 
         
         Now that is a scary thought.

      The Day the Internet Melted
      Monday's Denial of Service attack on Yahoo was
      repeated yesterday afternoon at Buy.com and quickly
      followed by attacks on Amazon, E-Bay, CNN and
      possibly even UUNet. Most of the sites where able to
      block the attack and where back online within an hour
      or two. The San Francisico office of the FBI has opened
      an investigation into the attack on Yahoo however it is
      unknown how far the investigation has gotten at this
      point. Some of the effected companies have also
      started their own investigations into how this has
      happened. A source close to one of the effected
      companies has told HNN that they have been able to
      trace the attack back to one end node where they
      found a list of up to ten thousand possibly compromised
      systems.

      Distributed Denial of Service attacks, DDoS
      Distributed Denial of Service attacks aren't new, they
      have been around for a while. The basic premise is to
      use a larger number of systems to request information
      from a single server, similar to a radio call in contest
      where potential contestants get busy signals. Seldom is
      data lost or access inside the targeted systems gained,
      however visitors to the site are prevented from
      accessing data. The large number of systems used to
      launch the attack can easily be controlled by one
      person. 

      The CERT Coordination center held a workshop
      concerning this type of attack back at the beginning of
      November.

      incident
      
                        By Staff Writer David Kleinbard
                        February 08, 2000: 8:19 p.m. ET


      NEW YORK (CNNfn) - The Internet was reeling Tuesday night as attacks by
      hackers on a number of high-profile Web sites continued.
          In the early evening Tuesday, CNN.com confirmed that it was the latest site
      to suffer.
          "At 7 p.m. EST, we were attacked by hackers. A denial of service attack
      occurred until 8:45 p.m. We were seriously affected. We were serving content
      but it was very inconsistent and very little," Edna Johnson, director of public
      relations for CNN Interactive, said in a statement.
          "By 8:45 p.m., our upstream providers had put blocks in place that are
      shielding us and we are now serving content."
          CNN.com and CNNfn.com are both owned by Time-Warner Inc. (TWX:
      Research, Estimates).
          The leading auction Web site eBay and the Internet-based discount retailer
      Buy.com were crippled Tuesday by outside attacks.
          And online retailing giant Amazon also came under siege late Tuesday.
           Amazon.com  Inc.'s   (AMZN: Research, Estimates) Web site was virtually
      shut down Tuesday with  problems that appeared similar to the failures that
      have hit  other popular Web sites in recent days.
          Amazon said in a statement that its site was inaccessible for more than one
      hour late Tuesday because a "large amount of junk traffic" was aimed at the
      company's computers, tying them up and preventing nearly all its customers
      from making purchases.
          
                  FBI investigates Yahoo! attack

          The incidents on Tuesday at Buy.com  (BUYX: Research, Estimates) and
      eBay Inc.(EBAY: Research, Estimates). came one day after a hacker
      onslaught knocked Yahoo!'s heavily trafficked web site out of service for about
      three hours. Yahoo!  (YHOO: Research, Estimates) said that it is cooperating
      with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in an investigation of who
      perpetrated the cyber attack.
              Tuesday's attack, which hit Buy.com around 11 a.m., came on the same
      day that the company did its initial public offering. The Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based
      seller of books, computer hardware, software, videos, and other items sold 14
      million shares at $13 each, raising $182 million. Buy.com's stock finished the
      day at 25 1/8, up 93 percent, despite the incident.
              "Around 11 a.m., we got hammered, and as a result had some difficulty
      getting the site back up," Buy.com's CEO, Gregory Hawkins, said in a
      televised interview with CNNfn. Hawkins said Buy.com is working with the
      company that hosts its web sites, Exodus Communications Inc., to determine
      how the attack occurred.
          Hawkins said that Buy.com appears to be the victim of the same type of
      cyber attack that crippled Yahoo! Inc.'s web site for about three hours on
      Monday. Yahoo!, the Internet portal based in Santa Clara, Calif. that is the
      world's most heavily trafficked web site, was shut down by what web security
      experts call a "denial of service attack." In that form of assault, a company's
      web servers are hit with such a large number of bogus requests that they
      cannot provide information to the site's legitimate users. It's like flooding a road
      with so many cars that other vehicles can't get through.
              eBay, a San Jose Calif.-based site where individuals buy and sell millions
      of diverse items each day, placed a notice on its site around 3:20 p.m. Pacific
      Standard Time that it had come under what appeared to be a denial of service
      attack generated by outside sources.
              "The attack appears to be affecting only the site's static pages, not its
      bidding, listing, and search functions," said eBay spokeswoman Kristin Seuell.
      "However, we have heard reports from the East Coast that people are having
      difficulty accessing the site." Static pages are those containing information that
      remains the same at all times.
              Internet security experts predicted on Tuesday that other commercial web
      sites will be hit by denial of service attacks in the future, even before they knew
      about the Buy.com incident.
              "There hasn't been a global solution yet to this problem," said Chris
      Rouland, director of the security research team at Internet Security Systems
       (ISSX: Research, Estimates) in Atlanta, Georgia, a major security software
      and consulting company. "If hackers can shut down Yahoo!, they can shut
      down anything they want tomorrow."
              Security experts were surprised that Yahoo! could be crippled by
      outsiders because the company's site has a reputation for having a high level of
      security and reliability. In fact, Tuesday's incident was Yahoo!'s first significant
      service interruption.
              "The Yahoo! web site is normally among the fastest and most reliable on
      the Internet," said Gene Shklar, vice president of public services at Keynote
      Systems Inc., (KEYN: Research, Estimates) a San Mateo, Calif. company that
      measures the performance and reliability of e-commerce web sites. "Yahoo!
      consistently delivers its home page during business hours in an average of 1.5
      seconds to T-1 connected locations around the U.S. with a reliability of 99.3
      percent or better."
              Keynote's stock soared 17 1/16 to 113 9/16 Tuesday, apparently in
      response to the media attention from Yahoo!'s service interruption. Yahoo!'s
      stock rose 19 1/8 to 373 1/8, as investors and analysts seemed pleased by the
      speed with which Yahoo! was able to recover from the attack.
              Lise Buyer, an analyst at CS First Boston, said in a research report
      Tuesday that the incident should have no impact on Yahoo!'s bottom line.
              "Given unused capacity and rapidly increasing pageviews, we expect the
      company will have no trouble making good on any advertising impression
      commitments. Therefore, we expect no impact on the company's operating
      statistics," Buyer said. 
              Yahoo! said Tuesday that it has been contacted by law enforcement
      agencies, including the FBI, that are investigating the incident.
              "We are doing our part to work with the authorities by gathering the
      electronic tracers and data available," a Yahoo! spokeswoman said. "We will
      be sitting down with them over the next few days to discuss the appropriate
      next steps. The FBI is one group we anticipate meeting with."
              Yahoo! has dense layers of encryption that protect the databases on its
      site. Yahoo!'s customer information and site data weren't compromised by the
      attack, a company spokeswoman said Monday.
              Yahoo! said that the bogus requests came from up to 50 different Internet
      addresses at rates of up to a gigabyte per second, which is considered to be
      an enormous amount of web traffic over a short period of time.
          
                    The history of the problem

              Denial of service attacks aren't new. In fact, both the FBI and CERT
      issued public warnings about them last year. CERT is part of the Software
      Engineering Institute, a federally funded research and development center at
      Carnegie Mellon University. Just a few hours before the attack on Yahoo!
      began, denial of service attacks were discussed at a meeting of the North
      American Network Operators' Group, one of the main organizations for the
      supervisors of computer networks.
              "Denial of service attacks occur periodically, but they are not as common
      as people trying to hack into a site, since hacking in enables you to alter the
      site's content and post something for everyone to see," Keynote's Shklar said.
              Internet Security Systems' Rouland said that there are four popular denial
      of service attacks, called Tribal Flood Network, Trinoo, TFN2K, and
      Stacheldraht. Hackers plan the attack in two stages. First, they surreptitiously
      place software "agents" on a network of computers that may have no
      connection to their actual target. Once these agents are in place, the hackers
      can direct all of the bandwidth capacity of that network at a target web site.
              "A master command wakes up the agents, identifies the target, and says
      go for it," Rouland said. Because these agents are installed using a backdoor
      method, they can be difficult to find, he said.
              Software that can trigger a denial of service attack is commonly traded by
      hackers over the Internet, said Scott Gordon, director of intrusion detection
      products at Axent Technologies  (AXNT: Research, Estimates) in Rockville,
      Md., another large Internet security firm. These programs include Ping of Death
      and SynFlood.
              "It's a safe bet that other significant sites will be hit by this type of
      attack," Gordon said. "It may be done for boasting rights or financial gain
      through data theft."
              The FBI and the Secret Service have joint responsibility for investigating
      computer crimes. Large cases are coordinated by the FBI's National
      Infrastructure Protection Center. Scott Charney, a principal at
      PricewaterhouseCoopers Investigations LLC in D.C., who used to run the
      Justice Department's computer crimes unit, said that it could be difficult to
      trace who originated the attack on Yahoo!. That's because hackers often direct
      their traffic through several different web sites before hitting their end target.
              "Sophisticated hackers don't attack in a straight line," Charney said.
      "They weave between sites. If one of these sites strips off the source
      information and throws it away, there can be a break in the chain for
      investigators."
              "Global connectivity, lots of open sites, poor security at some, and lack of
      tracing ability create an environment where if you are up to no good, you can
      flourish," Charney said.

      Was Yahoo Smurfed or Trinooed? 
      by Declan McCullagh 
      
      1:10 p.m. 8.Feb.2000 PST 
      Yahoo's agonizing three-hour crash was the most devastating reported 
      attack of its kind in the history of the Net, but it won't be the last. 

      Company officials said as-yet-unknown miscreants laid siege to the 
      Internet's second most popular destination at about 10:30 a.m. PST Monday, 
      snarling Yahoo's internal network and denying millions of visitors access 
      to mail,       schedules, and the directory service. 

      
      What's particularly disturbing: There may not have been anything Yahoo 
      could have done to prevent it. 

      Any Web site is vulnerable to so-called denial of service (DoS)attacks, 
      which have grown considerably more fearsome recently. Although their 
      methods vary, all attempt to clog the networks of the company that's being 
      targeted,       sometimes with devastating effect. 

      "What we're seeing is adolescent pranks going mainstream," says MIT 
      network manager Jeff Schiller. "This is the electronic equivalent. It just 
      has much more far-reaching impact." 

      DoS attacks are a particular favorite of malcontents, since they can be 
      done somewhat anonymously and since they require little technical skill. 
      Some, like "smurfing" and "fragging," are named after the software that 
      conducts the       exploit. 

      They've long been used to cripple Internet Relay Chat and other 
      low-profile sites -- Wired News reported on one incident in January 1998. 
      But they can also be used to assail even some of the best-defended 
      corporations, something       that's not exactly heartening to the 
      millions of people who now rely on the Web for calendars, scheduling, and 
      email. 

      One popular attack is called "smurfing." It works this way: A perpetrator 
      sends a stream of "echo" response-requests and pretends they're coming 
      from the victim's computer. The multipled replies overwhelm the targeted 
      network.       They also cause havoc inside the broadcasting (aka smurf 
      amplifying) computers that were used as unwitting reflectors. 

      
      Depending on the size of the intermediate network, a clever attacker can 
      easily increase the muscle of his assault. A 768 Kb/s stream of echo 
      packets multipled by a broadcast network with 100 machines can generate a 
      76.8 Mb/s flood directed against the target -- more than enough to 
      overwhelm any single computer. 

      The good news is that defenses against this kind of assault are 
      well-known. Computers can be modified to ignore echo requests. Cisco and 
      3Com have both released instructions to turn off broadcasting of them, and 
      Internet       Engineering Task Force RFC2644 says echo requests "must" be 
      disabled in routers by default. Since "smurf" attacks became well-known in 
      1997, their threat seems to have decreased. One report says, "We have seen 
      a reduction in average bandwidth used on a smurf attack from 80 Mbps to 5 
      Mbps. Additionally, there has been a [50 percent] reduction in the number 
      of noticeable smurf attacks." 

      But others have evolved to take their place. A December 1999 advisory from 
      Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team describes 
      trinoo and Tribe Flood Network (TFN) -- two programs that perform the kind 
      of       distributed denial of service attacks Yahoo said it experienced 
      on Monday. 

      The design is astonishingly clever and simple. The idea: Instead of a 
      single site launching an echo-packet-augmented attack, a large network can 
      assault a target in a coordinated and much more destructive manner. 

      Both trinoo and TFN rely on a master "handler" computer that signals a 
      network of slave "agent" machines when it's time to start an attack. The 
      human perpetrator must have already installed the trinoo or TFN daemons on 
      the dozens       -- or even hundreds -- of machines that will participate. 

      The remedy is simple, as long as everyone does it: Besides the 
      long-standing defenses against "smurf" attacks, system administrators 
      should look for hidden copies of trinoo or TFN binaries squirreled away 
      that might attack a remote       site like Yahoo when called into action. 

      Even newer programs have emerged that have in part replaced TFN, which 
      seemed to have peaked in popularity around September 1999. Some of the 
      more recent ones include stacheldraht -- German for "barbed wire" -- and 
      an       upgraded TFN2000. 

      The threat prompted CERT to release an advisory last month. Stacheldraht 
      agents have been spotted on Solaris machines, and a version appears to be 
      available for Linux as well. One big difference -- or improvement, if 
      you're the       person using it -- is that stacheldraht uses encrypted 
      communications to cloak its intentions from administrators who might be 
      monitoring the network. 

      In response, the federal government has become more involved. An alphabet 
      soup of agencies, including the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection 
      Center, the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, and FedCIRC are 
      asking Congress       for money and promising to defend the Net. 

      But companies that have invented the technology that runs the Net don't 
      seem to need help in fixing problems with it. A Yahoo source close to the 
      problem told Wired News that they hadn't contacted the Feds during their 
      trouble       yesterday because it would do no good. 

      Some measures the government is contemplating -- like increased 
      surveillance of the Internet to snare wayward hackers -- alarms civil 
      libertarians. The Electronic Privacy Information Center recently released 
      documents it obtained       that talk of increased electronic monitoring 
      of Americans. 

      "We have Feds that are overreacting to this," says MIT's Schiller, a 
      member of the IETF steering committee. 

      What needs to happen is for outdated rules to be repealed, he said. 

      "There needs to be a way network operators can [work together] in a way 
      that's immune from Sherman antitrust," he said. "We had a situation at 
      IETF where we couldn't have two people in the same room together by 
      themselves       since they were representatives of big competitors." 

      President Clinton's budget released Monday calls for sharply increased
      spending on computer security.

      Yahoo on Trail of Site Hackers 
      Reuters 
      
      3:50 p.m. 8.Feb.2000 PST SAN FRANCISCO -- Yahoo said Tuesday it was 
      meeting with the FBI to track down hackers who brought its site to a 
      standstill Monday, although the company expects no financial impact from 
      the incident. 

      "From a financial standpoint, there isn't any impact," said a Yahoo 
      spokeswoman. The company's stock surged 19-1/8 to 373-1/8 along with a 
      generally stronger Nasdaq market led by the Internet sector, as investors 
      ignored the       technical problem at the site. 

      Yahoo (YHOO), which generates much of its revenue through advertising, was 
      able to reschedule its ad spots to other positions without a significant 
      loss of revenue, the company said. But since an estimated 100 million 
      pages would       have been viewed during the two hours the site was down, 
      the company could potentially have lost as much as $500,000, analysts 
      said. 

      "We were contacted by the authorities regarding the situation that 
      occurred yesterday and we are doing our part to work with them," said the 
      Yahoo spokeswoman. 

      The company is gathering electronic data and attempting to trace the 
      source of the flood of messages that swamped its site and led to its 
      virtual shutdown. Yahoo declined to identify all of the authorities who 
      were involved in the       probe, but said specifically that the FBI was 
      included. 

      "We will be sitting down with them over the next few days to discuss the 
      appropriate next steps," the company said. 

      The attack has been narrowed to 50 Internet addresses, though computer 
      security experts said it would take time to track any hacker or hackers 
      sophisticated enough to have shut down Yahoo, one of the largest Internet 
      sites. 

      The attack is called a distributed denial of service attack, which is a 
      concerted move to inundate a Web site from many points. The attackers 
      disguise their identities by going though a series of networks and using 
      other computers to       do damage. Since computer programs are used, a 
      single person could have launched the attack, even though it appears to be 
      coming from many directions. 

      "The FBI may be able to do some back-tracking and coordination to find out 
      who did this," said Scott Gordon, director of intrusion protection at 
      Axent Technologies (AXNT), of Rockville, Maryland. 

      But investigators need to go behind the target computers to find the 
      command center that directed the attack and, "we're not going to get an 
      answer in the very near future," Gordon said. 

      Investigators noted that computer security services have been warning for 
      some time about attacks like the one launched on Yahoo. The protection, in 
      such cases, is to find the source of the problem and put a block on the 
      Internet       address from entering the site. The blocker, known as a 
      "rate filter" is aimed at putting a halt to the "mock traffic" that is 
      jamming the target site. 

      Yahoo installed that protection soon after the attack was launched and
      restored normal service by early afternoon. Service was normal on the 
      site Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.

     Systems Affected

          All systems connected to the Internet can be affected by 
          denial-of-service attacks. Tools that run on a variety of UNIX and 
          UNIX-like systems and Windows NT systems have recently been released 
          to facilitate denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, some MacOS 
          systems can be used as traffic amplifiers to conduct a 
          denial-of-service attack. 

     I. Description

     New Distributed Denial-of-Service Tools

     Recently, new techniques for executing denial-of-service attacks have been 
     made public. A tool similar to Tribe FloodNet (TFN), called Tribe FloodNet 
     2K (TFN2K) was released. Tribe FloodNet is described in 
     http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-99-07.html#tfn. 

     Like TFN, TFN2K is designed to launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks 
     from many sources against one or more targets simultaneously. It includes 
     features designed specifically to make TFN2K traffic difficult to recognize 
     and filter, to remotely execute commands, to obfuscate the true source of 
     the traffic, to transport TFN2K traffic over multiple transport protocols 
     including UDP, TCP, and ICMP, and features to confuse attempts to locate 
     other nodes in a TFN2K network by sending "decoy" packets. 

     TFN2K is designed to work on various UNIX and UNIX-like systems and Windows 
     NT. 

     TFN2K obfuscates the true source of attacks by spoofing IP addresses. In 
     networks that employ ingress filtering as described in [1], TFN2K can forge 
     packets that appear to come from neighboring machines. 

     Like TFN, TFN2K can flood networks by sending large amounts of data to the 
     victim machine. Unlike TFN, TFN2K includes attacks designed to crash or 
     introduce instabilities in systems by sending malformed or invalid packets. 
     Some attacks like this are described in 

          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-98-13-tcp-denial-of-service.html 
          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-97.28.Teardrop_Land.html 

     Also like TFN, TFN2K uses a client-server architecture in which a single 
     client, under the control of an attacker, issues commands simultaneously to 
     a set of TFN2K servers. The servers then conduct the denial-of-service 
     attacks against the victim(s). Installing the server requires that an 
     intruder first compromise a machine by different means. 

     Asymmetric traffic from MacOS 9

     MacOS 9 can be abused by an intruder to generate a large volume of traffic 
     directed at a victim in response to a small amount of traffic produced by 
     an intruder. This allows an intruder to use MacOS 9 as a "traffic 
     amplifier," and flood victims with traffic. According to [3], an intruder 
     can use this asymmetry to "amplify" traffic by a factor of approximately 
     37.5, thus enabling an intruder with limited bandwidth to flood a much 
     larger connection. This is similar in effect and structure to a "smurf" 
     attack, described in 

          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-98.01.smurf.html 

     Unlike a smurf attack, however, it is not necessary to use a directed 
     broadcast to achieve traffic amplification. 

     II. Impact

     Intruders can flood networks with overwhelming amounts of traffic or cause 
     machines to crash or otherwise become unstable. 

     III. Solution

     The problem of distributed denial-of-service attacks is discussed at length 
     in [2], available at 

          http://www.cert.org/reports/dsit_workshop.pdf 

     Managers, system administrators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and 
     Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are encouraged to read 
     this document to gain a broader understanding of the problem. 

     For the ultimate victim of distributed denial-of-service attacks

     Preparation is crucial. The victim of a distributed denial-of-service 
     attack has little recourse using currently available technology to respond 
     to an attack in progress. According to [2]: 

          The impact upon your site and operations is dictated by the 
          (in)security of other sites and the ability of of a remote attackers 
          to implant the tools and subsequently to control and direct multiple 
          systems worldwide to launch an attack. 

     Sites are strongly encouraged to develop the relationships and capabilities 
     described in [2] before you are a victim of a distributed denial-of-service 
     attack. 

     For all Internet Sites

     System and network administrators are strongly encouraged to follow the 
     guidelines listed in [2]. In addition, sites are encouraged to implement 
     ingress filtering as described in [1]. CERT/CC recommends implementing such 
     filtering on as many routers as practical. This method is not foolproof, as 
     mentioned in [1]: 

          While the filtering method discussed in this document does absolutely 
          nothing to protect against flooding attacks which originate from valid 
          prefixes (IP addresses), it will prohibit an attacker within the 
          originating network from launching an attack of this nature using 
          forged source addresses that do not conform to ingress filtering 
          rules. 

     Because TFN2K implements features designed specifically to take advantage 
     of the granularity of ingress filtering rules, the method described in [1] 
     means that sites may only be able to determine the network or subnet from 
     which an attack originated. 

     Sites using manageable hubs or switches that can track which IP addresses 
     have been seen at a particular port or which can restrict which MAC 
     addresses can be used on a particular port may be able to further identify 
     which machine(s) is responsible for TFN2K traffic. For further information, 
     consult the documentation for your particular hub or switch. 

     The widespread use of this type of filtering can significantly reduce the 
     ability of intruders to use spoofed packets to compromise or disrupt 
     systems. 

     Preventing your site from being used by intruders

     TFN2K and similar tools rely on the ability of intruders to install the 
     client. Preventing your system from being used to install the client will 
     help prevent intruders from using your systems to launch denial-of-service 
     attacks (in addition to whatever damage they may cause to your systems).

     Systems Affected

          All systems connected to the Internet can be affected by 
          denial-of-service attacks. 

     I. Description

     Continued Reports of Denial-of-Service Problems

     We continue to receive reports of new developments in denial-of-service 
     tools. This advisory provides pointers to documents discussing some of the 
     more recent attacks and methods to detect some of the tools currently in 
     use. Many of the denial-of-service tools currently in use depend on the 
     ability of an intruder to compromise systems first. That is, intruders 
     exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access to systems, which they then 
     use to launch further attacks. For information on how to protect your 
     systems, see the solution section below. 

     Security is a community effort that requires diligence and cooperation from 
     all sites on the Internet. 

     Recent Denial-of-Service Tools and Developments

     One recent report can be found in CERT Advisory CA-99-17. 

     A distributed denial-of-service tool called "Stacheldraht" has been 
     discovered on multiple compromised hosts at several organizations. In 
     addition, one organization reported what appears to be more than 100 
     different connections to various Stacheldraht agents. At the present time, 
     we have not been able to confirm that these are connections to Stacheldraht 
     agents, though they are consistent with an analysis provided by Dave 
     Dittrich of the University of Washington, available at 

          http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis 

     Also, Randy Marchany of Virginia Tech released an analysis of a TFN-like 
     toolkit, available at 

          http://www.sans.org/y2k/TFN_toolkit.htm 

     The ISS X-Force Security Research Team published information about trin00 
     and TFN in their December 7 Advisory, available at 

          http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise40.php3 

     A general discussion of denial-of-service attacks can be found in a CERT/CC 
     Tech Tip available at 

          http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html 

     II. Impact

     Denial-of-service attacks can severely limit the ability of an organization 
     to conduct normal business on the Internet. 

     III. Solution

     Solutions to this problem fall into a variety of categories. 

     Awareness

     We urge all sites on the Internet to be aware of the problems presented by 
     denial-of-service attacks. In particular, keep the following points in 
     mind: 

          Security on the Internet is a community effort. Your security depends 
          on the overall security of the Internet in general. Likewise, your 
          security (or lack thereof) can cause serious harm to others, even if 
          intruders do no direct harm to your organization. Similarly, machines 
          that are not part of centralized computing facilities and that may be 
          managed by novice or part-time system administrators or may be 
          unmanaged, can be used by intruders to inflict harm on others, even if 
          those systems have no strategic value to your organization. 

          Systems used by intruders to execute denial-of-service attacks are 
          often compromised via well-known vulnerabilities. Keep up-to-date with 
          patches and workarounds on all systems. 

          Intruders often use source-address spoofing to conceal their location 
          when executing denial-of-service attacks. We urge all sites to 
          implement ingress filtering to reduce source address spoofing on as 
          many routers as possible. For more information, see RFC2267. 

          Because your security is dependent on the overall security of the 
          Internet, we urge you to consider the effects of an extended network 
          or system outage and make appropriate contingency plans where 
          possible. 

          Responding to a denial-of-service attack may require the cooperation 
          of multiple parties. We urge all sites to develop the relationships 
          and capabilities described in the results of our recent workshop 
          before you are a victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack. 
          This document is available at 

               http://www.cert.org/reports/dsit_workshop.pdf 

     Detection

     A variety of tools are available to detect, eliminate, and analyze 
     distributed denial-of-service tools that may be installed on your network. 

     The National Infrastructure Protection Center has recently announced a tool 
     to detect trin00 and TFN on some systems. For more information, see 

          http://www.fbi.gov/nipc/trinoo.htm 

     Part of the analysis done by Dave Dittrich includes a Perl script named gag 
     which can be used to detect stacheldraht agents running on your local 
     network. See Appendix A of that analysis for more information. 

     Internet Security Systems released updates to some of their tools to aid 
     sites in detecting trin00 and TFN. For more information, see 

          http://www.iss.net/cgi-bin/dbt-display.exe/db_data/press_rel/release/1
          22899199.plt 

     Prevention

     We urge all sites to follow sound security practices on all 
     Internet-connected systems. For helpful information, please see 

          http://www.cert.org/security-improvement http://www.sans.org 

     Response

          http://www.sans.org/newlook/publications/incident_handling.htm 

     The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting criminal 
     investigations involving TFN where systems appears to have been 
     compromised. U.S. recipients are encouraged to contact their local FBI 
     Office.

117.0 Mixter's guide to defending against DDoS attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
            -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
      
      
                10 Proposed 'first-aid' security measures
              against Distributed Denial Of Service attacks
             -----------------------------------------------
      
      To say the least, coping with all the causes and security vulnerabilities
      that can be exploited for compromising hosts and launching Denial Of Service
      from them is very complex. In the long term, there is no simple, single method
      for protecting against such attacks; instead, extensive security and protection
      measures will have to be applied. For everyone whose systems are currently at
      risk, or who is generally worried, I am compiling a small list of easy and fast
      to implement methods to protect against those attacks.
      
       - Mixter
      
      
      Important things to do as a current or potential
      victim of packet flooding Denial Of Service:
      
      1) Avoid FUD
      FUD stands for fear, uncertanity, and doubt. The recent attacks have
      obviously been launched with provocating hysteria and overreactions in mind,
      due to the victims that have been targeted. It is very important to
      realize, that only a small amount of companies and hosts do have to
      fear becoming a victim of Denial Of Services. Those include top-profile
      sites like search engines, the most popular e-commerce and stock companies,
      IRC chat servers, as well as news magazines (for obvious purposes). If you are
      not amongst them, there is little reason for you to worry about becoming a
      direct target of DoS attacks.
      
      2) Arrange with your Internet uplink provider(s)
      It is very important that you have the assistance and cooperation from your
      direct backbone and uplink network providers. The bandwidth used in DDoS
      attacks is so major, that your own network probably cannot handle it,
      regardless of what you try. Talk to your uplinks, and make sure that they
      agree to helping you with implementing routing access control that limits
      the amount bandwidth and different source addresses that are let through
      to your network at once. Ideally, your uplink should be willing to monitor
      or let you access their routers in the case of an actual attack.
      
      3) Optimize your routing and network structure
      If you don't have only a host, but a bigger network, then tune your
      routers to minimize the impact of DoS attacks. To prevent SYN flooding
      attacks, set up the TCP interception feature. Details about this can be
      found at http://www.cisco.com or at your router manufacturer's hotline.
      Block the kinds of UDP and ICMP messages that your network doesn't require
      to operate. Especially permitting outgoing ICMP unreach messages could
      multiply the impact of a packet flooding attack.
      
      4) Optimize your most important publically accessible hosts
      Do the same on the hosts that can be potential targets. Deny all traffic
      that isn't explicitly needed for the servers you run. Additionally,
      multi-homing (assigning many different IPs to the same hostname), will
      make it a lot harder for the attacker. I suggest that you multi-home your
      web site to many physically different machines, while the HTML index site
      on those machines may only contain a forwarding entry to the pages on
      your actual, original web server.
      
      5) During ongoing attacks: start countermeasures as soon as possible
      It is important that you start the backtracking of packets as soon as
      possible, and contact any further uplink providers, when traces indicate
      that the packet storm came over their networks. Don't rely on the source
      addresses, as they can be practically be chosen arbitrarily in DoS
      attacks. The overall effort of being able to determine origins of spoofed
      DoS attacks depends on your quick action, as the router entries that allow
      traffic backtracking will expire a short time after the flood is halted.
      
      Important things to do as a current or potential victim
      of security compromise, break-in, and flood agent installation.
      
      6) Avoid FUD
      As a potential victim of a compromise, you should as well try not to
      overreact, instead take rational and effective actions fast. Note that the
      current Denial Of Service Servers have only proven to be written for and
      installed on Linux and Solaris systems. They are probably portable to
      *BSD* systems, but since those are usually more secure, it should not be
      a big problem.
      
      7) Assure that your hosts are not compromised and secure
      There are many recent vulnerability exploits, and a lot more of older
      exploits out. Check exploit databses, for example at securityfocus.com,
      or packetstorm.securify.com, to make sure that the versions of your server
      software are not proven to be vulnerable. Remember, intruders HAVE TO use
      existent vulnerabilities to be able to get into your systems and install
      their programs. You should be reviewing your server configuration,
      looking for security glitches, running recently updated software versions,
      and, this is most important, be running the minimum of services that you
      really need. If you follow all of these guidelines, you can consider yourself
      to be secure and protected from compromises to a reasonable extent.
      
      8) Audit your systems regularly
      Realize that you are responsible for your own systems, and for what is
      happening with them. Learn sufficiently enough about how your system and
      your server software operates, and review your configuration and the security
      measures that you apply frequently. Check full disclosure security sites
      for new vulnerabilities and weaknesses that might be discovered in the
      future in your operating system and server software.
      
      9) Use cryptographic checking
      On a system, on which you have verified that it has not already been
      broken into, or compromised, you are urged to set up a system that generates
      cryptographic signatures of all your binary and other trusted system files,
      and compare the changes to those files periodically. Additionally, using a
      system where you store the actual checksums on a different machine or
      removable media, to which a remote attacker cannot have access, is
      strongly recommended. Tools that do this, e.g. tripwire, can be found on
      security sites, like packetstorm.securify.com, and most public open source 
      ftp archives. Commercial packages are also available, if you prefer them.
      
      10) During ongoing attacks: shut down your systems immediately and investigate
      If you detect an attack emerging from your networks or hosts, or if you
      are being contacted because of this, you must immediately shut down your
      systems, or at least disconnect any of the systems from any network. If
      such attacks are being run on your hosts, it means that the attacker has
      almost-full control of the machines. They should be analyzed, and then
      reinstalled. You are also encouraged to contact security organisations, or
      emergency response teams. CERT (www.cert.org) or SANS (www.sans.org) are some
      places where you can always request assistance after a compromise. Also
      keep in mind, that providing these organisations the data from your
      compromised machine(s) left by the attacker is important, because it will
      help them tracking down the origin of the attacks.

118.0 HNN: Feb 9th;  Court Authorizes Home Computer Search 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/


      contributed by Mike 
      Northwest Airlines has received permission from a
      Federal Court to search the home computers of a dozen
      flight attendants. The search would look for evidence,
      incriminating emails or other documents. It is believed
      that the employees helped to organize a sickout at the
      airline. The search is currently on hold pending a
      possible settlement of the airline's lawsuit against the
      flight attendants union. 

      Scary quote of the day: "Business speech is not subject

      say whatever you want about a company." - John

      Court authorizes search of Northwest employees' home computers

      Eric Wieffering and Tony Kennedy Star Tribune
      Tuesday, February 8, 2000 

      Northwest Airlines last week began court-authorized searches of the home 
      computers of between 10 and 20 flight attendants, looking for private 
      e-mail and other evidence that the employees helped to organize a sickout 
      at the airline over the New Year's holiday.

      The search has since been suspended pending a temporary settlement of the 
      airline's lawsuit against Teamsters Local 2000, the union representing 
      11,000 flight attendants. But privacy advocates and attorneys not involved 
      with the case say Northwest's action may embolden other companies to more 
      aggressively monitor what employees say and do online from their home 
      computers.

      "If Northwest succeeds in gaining access to the hard drives of the home 
      computers of its employees, it will certainly put a chill on the uses 
      employees everywhere make of their home computers," said Beth Givens, 
      director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego.

      Northwest's action comes at a time when bills to protect individual 
      privacy have been introduced at the state and national level. In addition, 
      an increasing number of employees are learning, to their dismay, that 
      companies have the right to monitor their online activities at work. Last 
      month, for example, the New York Times fired 23 employees for sharing 
      bawdy e-mail messages.

      Northwest defended the search, noting that a federal court had authorized 
      it.

      "In the age we live in, the normal course of discovery includes taking 
      depositions, producing documents and these days more than ever looking 
      into the content of computers," said Jon Austin, a spokesman for 
      Northwest.

      "So many documents and communications these days are purely electronic in 
      nature," Austin said.

      But companies have rarely sought to search the home computers of their 
      employees. In the past, most such searches usually have been limited to 
      cases involving workers who've been accused of stealing company files, 
      passing on trade secrets to competitors or using insider information to 
      profit on the trading of company stock.

      Nor is all speech on the Internet protected by the First Amendment. 
      Increasingly, courts have been willing to help companies crack down on 
      so-called "cybersmearing" -- bad-mouthing companies or their management 
      online.

      "Business speech is not subject to the same protections as political 
      speech," said John Roberts, a Minneapolis attorney who specializes in 
      cyberlaw. "You can't say whatever you want about a company."

      The get-tough strategy is a new one for Northwest, too. In the spring of 
      1998, the company's mechanics, frustrated by the pace of contract 
      negotiations, began an unauthorized work slowdown that forced flight 
      delays and hundreds of cancellations. Union leaders disclaimed any 
      knowledge or authorization of the campaign, which employees advocated on 
      Web sites and message boards.

      Last month, however, Northwest sued the flight attendants union and some 
      of its members, alleging they had violated federal labor laws by 
      orchestrating a sickout. Judge Frank agreed with Northwest and issued a 
      temporary restraining order that prohibited the union from advocating any 
      work disruptions.

      New legal ground  

      Still, the Northwest case appears to break new ground because, in addition 
      to searching the office computers of union officials, Northwest got 
      permission to search their home computers and the home computers of 
      several rank-and-file employees, including Kevin Griffin and Ted Reeve. 

      The temporary settlement in the suit does not apply to Griffin and Reeve. 
      The judge agreed to put the suit on hold as it pertains to the union and 
      19 individuals who are represented by the union's attorneys. But Griffin 
      and Reeve, who are not represented by union attorneys because they are not 
      union officers, are still subject to the company's discovery efforts and 
      to a possible injunction against them.

      "This kind of precedent could have a very chilling effect on the exercise 
      of speech rights, and could set a very bad precedent for privacy," said 
      Jerry Berman, executive director for the Center for Democracy and 
      Technology, a leading privacy rights organization based in Washington, 
      D.C.

      Like most flight attendants, Griffin and Reeve do not use a computer at 
      work. But they do operate online message boards where flight attendants 
      have vented their frustration toward the company and the union leadership. 
      Griffin's message board, http://www.nwaflightattendants.com, included 
      anonymous postings calling for a sickout, but they were usually followed 
      by urgings from Griffin that participants not advocate illegal activities.

      Northwest hired two computer forensic experts from Ernst & Young to copy 
      the hard drives of the 21 individuals named in the lawsuit. The judge 
      limited the search to union activities relating to the sickout or e-mail 
      to 43 individuals, well beyond the number of people named in the original 
      lawsuit.

      "This is really an extension beyond established law," said Marshall 
      Tanick, a Minneapolis attorney who specializes in workplace and privacy 
      issues. "How different is this from wiretapping somebody's phone?"

      Personal data  

      Barbara Harvey, a Detroit-based attorney representing Griffin and Reeve, 
      said the situation has created tremendous anxiety about the possible loss 
      of "highly personal" information.

      "We are trusting them [Ernst & Young] totally. We don't know them. We 
      didn't hire them. In fact, they were hired by Northwest. But we are put 
      into the position of having to trust them," she said.

      Griffin, a veteran Northwest flight attendant based in Honolulu, 
      surrendered his Packard Bell desktop and Fujitsu laptop at the Ernst & 
      Young office in Honolulu. He was met there by two forensic examiners who 
      flew to Honolulu from Washington, D.C., and Texas.

      "I didn't think they had the right to come and get your home computer," he 
      said.

      The threat of a court-authorized search of home computers has already had 
      one measurable impact: Postings to a rank-and-file Web site that was 
      openly critical of both union management and the company have slowed to a 
      trickle.

      "If you're Northwest Airlines, you're probably smiling about that," said 
      Paul Levy, a lawyer for Ralph Nader's Public Citizen Litigation Group, 
      which also represents Griffin and Reeve.

      Northwest might not be the only party pleased to see the Web site go 
      quiet. Griffin's Web site and an organized e-mail campaign were 
      instrumental in rallying opposition that defeated a tentative contract 
      agreement that was reached last June and endorsed by the union's top 
      leaders, including Teamsters General President James Hoffa.

      Asked why the union didn't fight harder against the effort to search 
      employees' home computers, Billie Davenport, president of Teamsters Local 
      2000, said the union complied with the discovery request because it felt 
      it had nothing to hide.

      'Was enough protection'  

      "We had voiced concern over people's privacy. There was an 
      invasion-of-privacy issue," Davenport said. "But we believe there was 
      enough privacy protection."

      She said Ernst & Young's computer forensic examiners spent two full days 
      in the union's offices last week, copying hard drives.

      Griffin said his Web site has had more traffic than ever in the past 
      month, but far fewer postings from visitors. Of those who aren't afraid to 
      comment in the open forum section of the Web site, a much smaller 
      percentage of the writers are identifying themselves, Griffin said.

      "It's like they are running scared, with good reason," Griffin said.

      Researchers at the Health Privacy Project at
      Georgetown University have released a study that
      shows that most medical web sites share surfers

      have privacy policies clearly posted however the sites
      are not following their own policies.

      Fears for security on medical websites

     Tuesday 8 February 2000 

     MEDICAL Web sites say they protect the privacy of visitors but often share 
     the information they collect with other companies, a new study has found. 
     That means a visitor seeking information on, say, erectile dysfunction 
     might unknowingly be alerting online marketers to his condition. 

     "We found that almost across the board, the privacy practices did not match 
     the policies," said Janlori Goldman of the Health Privacy Project at 
     Georgetown University, who conducted the research that went into the report 
     released at an e-Health ethics summit of large online health information 
     providers. 

     The 21 leading health sites reviewed appeared to understand the depth of 
     consumer concerns about privacy, Goldman said, noting that they prominently 
     sported privacy policies. But the companies weren't following through, he 
     said. "They're giving people a false sense of confidence and a false sense 
     of trust." 

     Consumers are turning to the Internet for medical information in record 
     numbers, but a recent survey shows that privacy remains a strong concern. 

     The poll, conducted for the California HealthCare Foundation, found that 75 
     per cent of people were concerned about health websites passing on personal 
     data without permission and 17 per cent said they didn't go online for such 
     information because of privacy concerns.

     The report compared consumer health care sites on the Internet to gawky 
     adolescents - with plenty of abilities but little self-control.

      Amazon.com subsidiary target of FTC probe, two lawsuits

      SEATTLE (February 9, 2000 1:51 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - Alexa 
      Internet, a subsidiary of online retail giant Amazon.com, and its software 
      are the subject of an "informal" investigation by the Federal Trade 
      Commission,       according to a document filed this week with the U.S. 
      Securities and Exchange Commission. 

      Amazon.com Inc. also said a pair of lawsuits filed against Alexa over use 
      of private customer data are without merit. 

      Alexa's software, which is downloaded and installed on Web browsers like 
      Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, tracks where users 
      go on the World Wide Web in order to provide related Web links and other 
      data. 

      The two lawsuits mentioned in the SEC filing made Monday allege that 
      Alexa's software secretly intercepts personal data and sends that 
      information to third parties, including Alexa's parent company, 
      Amazon.com. 

      "We are cooperating completely with the FTC on an informal, voluntary 
      basis," said Alexa spokeswoman Dia Cheney. "As for the lawsuits, we 
      believe the claims have no merit." 

      The FTC would not comment on its investigation. 

      Computer security consultant Richard Smith, who found the possible privacy 
      problems in Alexa's software, said the privacy concern is in the way Alexa 
      tracks Web pages in order to provide related links. The system records the 
      entire       address of each Web page. On some Web sites, those addresses 
      could contain customer data. 

      "Some (Web addresses) may contain personal information such as mailing 
      addresses or customer account numbers," the Brookline, Mass.-based Smith 
      said. "It's conceivable that someone like Alexa could tie it all together 
      with your       surfing patterns and create a profile." 

      The lawsuits allege that the San Francisco-based Alexa is doing that - 
      combining information gleaned from Web addresses with Amazon.com's 
      customer accounts. Both companies deny the accusations. Alexa would not 
      identify where       the suits were filed. 

      Cheney noted that Web usage patterns and customers' data are stored in 
      separate databases and are not linked. 

      Both Amazon and Alexa said Tuesday that personal data that Alexa gathers 
      remains on Alexa's databases and is not made available to Amazon. 

      Amazon.com has a service it calls "zBubbles," which offers Alexa users the 
      ability to buy certain products based on Internet sites they visit. For 
      example, someone visiting a site about a handheld computer might click on 
      a zBubble to       get more information on how to buy the device from 
      Amazon. 

      However, the zBubbles do not access Amazon.com accounts or take such 
      information from the users' computer, according to the company. 

      "This is not transactional information," said Amazon spokesman Bill Curry. 
      "This is a service that Alexa has on its product. It doesn't funnel into 
      us."

122.0 HNN: Feb 9th;  Sys Admins Possibly At Fault in Japanese Defacements 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by William Knowles 
      Japanese officials are digging deeper into the
      investigation of the recent defacements of several
      government web sites. Observers have asked the
      question of whether the system administrators lived up
      to their obligations as operators of Web site servers. 

      Daily Yomiuri       
      http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0208cr21.htm
      
      

      Sites hacked with IDs, passwords 

      Akiko Kasamaand Masato Takahashi Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers 

      The hackers behind a recent series of invasions of government-run Web 
      sites may have gained access to the sites by stealing the user names and 
      passwords belonging to the engineers operating the systems, according to 
      investigation sources. 

      The hackers may have replaced the user names and passwords with new ones 
      after illegally entering computer servers that operate the Web sites. 

      The hackers are also suspected of erasing communications records--known as 
      logs--in an attempt to remove information that could help trace them. 

      Currently, specialists and investigators are trying to work out how 
      hackers gained access to the Web site servers. The sites broken into 
      include those run by the Science and Technology Agency and the National 
      Institute for Research and Advancement (NIRA), an affiliate of the 
      Economic Planning Agency. 

      The computer servers were running under two kinds of operating systems. 
      Investigators are increasingly convinced that the engineers managing the 
      systems failed to properly set up the servers when they entered their user 
      information into the systems. 

      Observers question whether the system managers lived up to their 
      obligations as operators of Web site servers. 

      System managers are in charge of running and overseeing information 
      systems and computer networks at companies and government offices. Their 
      status is almost godlike regarding computer security. They issue user 
      names to other users, have the authority to decide the framework of each 
      organization's computer security system and are able to erase logs that 
      record the sender, time and place of origin of messages. 

      After the Science and Technology Agency Web site was broken into on Jan. 
      24 and 26, access to the site was tested using the user name and password 
      of the official system manager. The site, however, could not be accessed 
      as the user name and password were not recognized after a hacker had 
      created a new password. 

      After the NIRA site was broken into on Jan. 26, officials found that the 
      hacker had impersonated a system manager using a user name and password of 
      the hacker's own invention, as the site had not been set up to recognize 
      only the system manager's user name and password. 

      The logs--the only means of tracing the hacker--were erased under the name 
      of system managers on both sites. 

      Hackers broke into two kinds of operating systems in the recent cases. 
      They usually use special hacking software to scout out bugs left during 
      programming on the operating system and the software for creating Web 
      sites. They then input specific commands to obtain user names and 
      passwords. 

      Hackers in the recent cases might have obtained user names and passwords 
      through uncorrected bugs. Nonetheless, the NIRA site case shows that 
      hackers did not hesitate to take advantage of slack site management, the 
      sources said. 

      Hacking into a system to obtain a user name and password involves 
      searching for an unlocked port. Portscanning is a hacking tool that does 
      this automatically. 

      Portscanning was used in more than 12,000 intrusions into the National 
      Personnel Authority and the authority's Kinki regional office sites, which 
      stores government employee exam information. 

      The deleted logs make tracing the hackers in the recent cases difficult. 
      Also, as hackers usually use a number of servers to try to invade a 
      targeted site, tracing failed hacking attempts does not help much in 
      identifying the Web site trespassers. 

      If hacking routes cross national boundaries, jurisdiction and national 
      interest issues also come into play. 

      Although investigators traced illegal entries to the sites of The Asahi 
      Shimbun and The Mainichi Shimbun to a South Korean provider, they were 
      unable to get any further leads. 

      The series of hacking cases has prompted several Internet security 
      companies to begin offering instruction on security measures and to put 
      antihacking goods on the market. 

      Asgent Inc., a security software company based in Chuo Ward, Tokyo, will 
      hold a free seminar on Feb. 16 and 17 targeting company computer system 
      managers and focusing on the skills needed to prevent hacking and 
      transform the contents of hacked Web sites. For more information, call the 
      Asgent at (03)5643-2561. 

      The Japanese unit of Network Associates Inc., based in Minato Ward, Tokyo, 
      has started distributing free samples of CyberCop Monitor, its software 
      for detecting illegal Web site access in real time. The samples will be 
      sent out for free until the end of March to those who complete the

      Malicious intruders still use temporary guest accounts,
      unrestricted proxy servers, buggy Wingate servers, and
      anonymous accounts to roam unfettered through the
      internet. One would think that some of these old holes
      would be patched by now. 

      InfoWorld

      January 18, 1999 

       Tricks of the trade obscure hacker tracks and make anonymity easily attainable
       Ever wonder how hackers can spend so much time online and rarely get caught? 
       After all, everything they do on the Internet should be logged, right? Web 
       hits, FTP sessions, Telnet connections, newsgroup postings, burps, and coughs 
       should all be traceable, right? Then how do they pillage and plunder with such 
       ease?

       In the good old days, compromising university or government accounts and 
       using them to bounce around the Internet was widespread. Hackers still 
       use these techniques, but they cover their tracks. Temporary guest 
       accounts, unrestricted proxy servers, buggy Wingate servers, and 
       anonymous accounts can keep hackers carefree.

       Hackers can become invisible on the Internet by obtaining a test account 
       from an ISP. A hacker can call a small ISP, profess interest, and open a 
       guest account for a couple of weeks by giving false information. Then, 
       using Telnet, the unwanted guest can connect to any other compromised 
       account.

       University computers are notorious for their easy accessibility to the 
       public. Hackers can take advantage of the lack of monitoring to store the 
       majority of their scripts and tools on the university system. And many 
       universities give out free shell or Internet accounts to "students" 
       supplying little more than a valid name and student registration number.

       From there they can exploit old Wingate servers (www.wingate.com) that 
       allow Telnet redirection by default. Discovered in early 1998, this bug 
       permits unfettered Telnet access to anyone on the Internet through a 
       Wingate proxy server. The bug has been fixed, but many sites have not yet 
       applied the fix. Scanning a list of Wingate servers discovered at a 
       popular hacker Web site, we found at least five (out of 127) machines 
       still vulnerable to this bug. If you use Wingate, be sure to download 
       Version 3.0, which fixes this and other problems.


       Anonymous surfing

       Proxy servers let small organizations protect their internal systems. But 
       an improperly configured system can be vulnerable. Be sure to scan the 
       external interface of your proxy servers. Check for open ports, 
       especially ports 80 (unless you are Web publishing), 3128, 8080, and 
       10080. Out of 282 systems we scanned, more than one half (151) provide 
       proxy services to the world. All Internet users have to do is change 
       proxy settings in their Web browsers to an available proxy server, and 
       it's clear sailing.

       Some Web sites offer free anonymous Web surfing, which is a boon for all 
       of us privacy paranoids out there, but a nightmare for law enforcement. 
       Both CyberArmy (www.cyberarmy.com) and Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com) 
       offer free, albeit slow, anonymous Web surfing. Connecting to a Web page 
       through their free services will mask your identity. Connecting through 
       Anonymizer's ISP you get the following identity:

       Connect from sol.infonex.com [209.75.196.2] (Mozilla /4.5 [en] (TuringOS; 
       Turing Machine; 0.0))logged.

       And from CyberArmy's redirector server you get this identity:

       Connect from s214-50.9natmp [216.22.214.50] (Mozilla/4.01 (compatible; 
       NORAD National Defence Network))logged.

       TuringOS and NORAD National Defence are spoofed origins that mask the 
       originating system.

       Lucent also has a proxy server meant to protect your privacy 
       (www.lpwa.com). Like the others, the Lucent Personalized Web Assistant 
       can make you anonymous by tunneling all of your Web traffic through its 
       proxy server. The only difference with Lucent is you must provide your 
       e-mail address to sign in.

       Anonymous service providers such as Anonymizer and Lucent have the right 
       intentions -- protecting your privacy -- but like any umbrella they can 
       be abused. Services such as these can be a hacker's dream. Anonymizer 
       offers Internet security and privacy for corporate customers and 
       individuals, and effectively makes them invisible. They don't store 
       cookies, they block Java and JavaScript access, and they remove all 
       identifier strings.

       To its credit, Anonymizer severely limits to whom they give shell 
       accounts. But at $7 a month, anyone with a good story should be able to 
       obtain one. They keep logs for 48 hours but don't record the source IP 
       address. To guard against abuse, Anonymizer will shut down service to a 
       particular Web site if abuse is reported. But with no source IP logging, 
       it must shut down service to that site for all customers.


       Privacy cheerleading

       Don't get us wrong, we are the first to jump on the privacy bandwagon 
       whenever it rolls by, but at what cost? Even if all of the software bugs 
       contributing to anonymous connections are fixed, more and more ISPs will 
       inevitably offer anonymous connectivity. How will you defend your site 
       against the possible onslaught of phantom hack attempts? Will logged IP 
       addresses quickly turn into ghosts offering little more than a place to 
       begin? Let us know at security_watch@infoworld.com.

      Web Sites around the net are bracing for more attacks
      today as such major companies as E-Trade, LA Times,
      Datek, and ZD-Net recover from massive denial of
      service attacks. 

      There are lots of rumors flying around the net right now.
      Some are pretty far fetched but others are more
      believable. One such rumor is it that the packets that
      have been used to flood at least one of sites may have
      contained content: A source close to HNN says the
      content includes "Various references to Mixter, greets
      to hacker groups, etc. Several references to the
      Internet becoming a "whorehouse of E-commerce". Of
      course at this time none of this is confirmed. 

      Law enforcement agencies are working over time
      attempting to track down the perpetrator(s). Some
      sources indicate that they may be close to an arrest
      while others still say they have little to go on. 

      What is surprising is that some companies are not
      admitting that they were hit by this attack. Microsoft
      has admitted that a partner was hit but they would not
      identify which one. A Lycos statement said that they
      already take 'extensive precautions' and declined further
      details. Companies need to realize that clamming up and
      closing the doors will not prevent this sort of thing from
      happening again. Only through communication and the
      sharing and pooling of information will a solution, and
      the attacker(s), be found.

      Web Hacks: Day Three 

      By Polly Sprenger

      For the third day in a row, major Web
      sites were hit by denial-of-service attacks
      emanating from an unknown server by an
      unknown assailant. E-Trade and ZDNet
      joined the growing list of downed sites
      early Wednesday morning. 

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
      scheduled a press conference for
      mid-morning Wednesday to review the
      damage caused and update the public
      about their investigation. Meanwhile, the
      much-publicized hacker underground is
      searching its ranks for the perpetrator.

      Wednesday's shutdowns follow the brief
      closure of Yahoo (YHOO) on Monday, and
      Amazon.com (AMZN) , eBay (EBAY) ,
      CNN.com and Buy.com on Tuesday.
      Denial-of-service shutdowns are fairly
      simple to pull off; perpetrators simply flood
      a recipient Web site with requests for
      data, causing the site's servers to
      overload.

      All of the companies targeted were
      anxious to tell the public that although
      their site had gone down, there was no risk that sensitive information
      had been or would be compromised. "Please understand that this is
      strictly a 'denial of service' attack," eBay told its users. "This has
      NOT and does NOT jeopardize data, such as credit card information
      or auction information."

      While the sites wage a public relations campaign deriding hackers and
      defending the security of their systems, some of the numerous – and
      now famous – hacker groups are busy defending themselves as well.

      "That wasn't a hack, it was vandalism," says Chris Tucker, a longtime
      member of the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow. "They're not
      hackers, they're vandals. DoS attacks are nothing new, really. In this
      case, they were coordinated against big-name sites and got some
      press attention."

      Organizations like Tucker's and others worry that anti-hacker
      paranoia will turn public perception against them.

      "We are currently building a consensus among other groups to
      address the media's misuse of the term 'hacker' as a community [and]
      to defend our good name," said "Macki," a representative of 2600, an
      organization which follows issues related to computer security. "We're
      working on a more in-depth commentary on this subject and talking
      with other groups about addressing the issue together."

      Other hackers agreed, adding that the media should focus on the
      sites that are getting attacked, not the hacker underground.

      "This is a wakeup call for people to show some responsibility before
      they hook up servers to the Internet," says "Simple Nomad," another
      hacker who lives his corporate life at a mainstream security company.

      But aside from the arguments over what does and does not
      constitute a hacker, the underground and the law-enforcement
      bodies agree on one thing: Tracking down the perpetrator of this
      week's actions could be a logistical nightmare.

      The perpetrator might be enhancing his street cred by continuing to
      bring down sites, but he's not improving the odds of eluding
      law-enforcement officials. The acclaimed "Weld Pond," a hacker with
      computer security group The L0pht, says that with each new site
      that goes down, the FBI gets more of the information it needs to
      pinpoint the source of the attacks. "I think they've probably proved
      their point and it would be stupid to keep going," he said. Pond is a
      "white hat" hacker, meaning that he avoids criminal activity; he says
      he hacks because it stretches his mind and enhances his consulting
      abilities. 

      Pond explains that, while each new attack makes the search easier,
      "it's hard to trace these things back. When you trace a phone call,
      it's trivial. Tracing phone calls is built into the telephone
      infrastructure. There is no mechanism like that in the Internet."

      The requests that are flooding servers are coming from all over the
      country, so tracking down the machines from which the attacks
      originated requires a massive coordination effort. Different Internet
      service providers have to communicate with one another to pinpoint
      a single computer. And even when the machine is found, it seems
      unlikely that the vandal will be seated at a desk, typing away,
      waiting to be led off in handcuffs.

      "They will eventually find the machine that's doing it," says Pond.
      "But as for the person..."

      "They can only hope that the people who did this are complete
      idiots," agrees Simple Nomad. "If they were smart, the packets sent
      to Yahoo were forged. All that can be done is to slowly move up the
      chain, ignoring where the packet says it is coming from, and look to
      see where the traffic itself is coming from. Next, you find the
      compromised hosts, and hope that there are clues in logs there.
      These hosts were remotely controlled via a client piece of software –
      they may be able to trace this back, but the client software is
      probably on yet another compromised host. Yuck."

      Meanwhile, the latest foray by the mainstream media into hackerdom
      has elicited blase reactions from the underground.

      "I am being swamped with talking-head requests," sighs Space Rogue,
      editor of the Hacker News Network. 




      Corrections: 

      An earlier version of this story included Datek among the attacked
      sites. In fact, a Datek vendor had experienced a temporary router
      problem that was not related to the hacker attacks.

      February 9, 2000 Inside the Hack Attack on the Web By Cintra Scott and Ian 
      Mount

      IF YOU CAN read this, SmartMoney.com is lucky. 

      Call it cybervandalism, or even cyberterrorism. In the last 48 hours, it's 
      been rampant. Using an apparently simple plan of attack known as "denial 
      of service," an unknown hacker (or hackers) has humbled the Internet's 
      biggest sites by bombarding them with packets of data. 

      Simply put, the denial-of-service attacks bring Web sites to their knees 
      for hours, because their lines are all tied up. In the good news category, 
      the victims' infrastructures are not at all compromised; no credit card 
      numbers are stolen nor is anything lost or damaged. 

      As of midday Wednesday, the list of apparent targets spans from Amazon.com 
      (AMZN) to ZDNet (ZDZ) — with Buy.com (BUYX), Time Warner's (TWX) CNN.com, 
      privately held Datek Online, eBay (EBAY), E*Trade Group (EGRP), TD 
      Waterhouse (TWE) and Yahoo! (YHOO) reporting apparently related problems. 
      Most of these sites have experienced slowdowns and outages for a few hours 
      in some U.S. locations. So far, the financial impact of the outages has 
      been called negligible by analysts, but the fear is that it could happen 
      again (and again). 

      That could be why the Nasdaq rally finally pooped out Wednesday, after the 
      composite index hit new highs on both Monday and Tuesday. Amazon.com 
      shares fell $10.72, or 2.9%; eBay shed $5.75, or 3.4%; E*Trade sunk $1.13, 
      or 4.3%, and Yahoo was down $10.75, or 2.9%. But unlike those Internet 
      blue chips, Buy.com stock climbed $2.38, or 9.5%, to $27.50. Buy.com 
      shares have been trading for only two days, and the site has experienced 
      apparent hacking troubles on both days. 

      While many consumers are hearing about the problem for the first time this 
      week, the tech community has been aware of the threat for years. The FBI's 
      National Infrastructure Protection Center has issued many alerts on the 
      latest "DoS" threats. Most recently, on New Year's Eve, the FBI warned 
      that it had seen "multiple reports of intruders installing distributed 
      denial-of-service tools on various computer systems to create large 
      networks of hosts capable of launching significant coordinated packet 
      flooding denial-of-service attacks." (Got that?) 

      This afternoon, Attorney General Janet Reno announced a criminal 
      investigation into the matter, vowing that federal law-enforcement 
      officials would do everything in their power to combat cyberterrorism. And 
      at a press conference this afternoon, the FBI's Ronald Dick suggested the 
      attacks could be related to the recent proliferation of two hacking 
      programs called Tribe Flood Network (TFN) and TRINOO. Meanwhile, the 
      hacking site 2600 reports that the assaults may have been launched with 
      another troublesome "tool" called Smurf. 

      Mischievous hackers can download such programs from various sites on the 
      Web. Then, using fairly basic hacking techniques, they install the program 
      on several hundred low-security servers and then set them to go off at a 
      certain time. (These hosts may be computers at schools and universities, 
      which often have fairly lax security.) The hackers can then launch a 
      coordinated flood of hundreds of packets of data to a targeted Web site. 
      Imagine the data packet says "hi" to each of the Web site's servers. Each 
      server then acknowledges the packet by responding with something like 
      "yes, I'm here." Those responses then trigger more packets of information, 
      and the attack is amplified (hundreds multiplied by hundreds of packets). 
      And that's how the resulting data traffic jam clogs up the servers. It's a 
      high-tech equivalent of tying up an 800 number by getting all your friends 
      (and all their friends) to call in at once. Nobody else can get through. 

      "The problem is that it's next to impossible to prevent," says Robert 
      Kolstad, an editor of security news for SANS (System Administration, 
      Networking, and Security) Institute, a cooperative research organization. 
      Once the problem is detected, Kolstad notes, the Web site's administrators 
      can try to repel some of the packets with filters, as Yahoo did on Monday. 
      The filters reject data packets coming from any suspicious locations. With 
      some quick work, an attack can be thwarted with minimal down time. But 
      clever hackers can make filtering cumbersome if their packets seem to 
      originate from, say, thousands of locations that keep shifting. So far, 
      though, eBay, E*Trade and the rest have been up and running again within a 
      couple of hours. 

      Such attacks don't require heavy computing power. According to Weld Pond, 
      a research scientist at Boston-based security consultancy @Stake (who uses 
      a hacking handle instead of his real name), all that's necessary is a fast 
      connection with which to set off the flood. "It could be a five-year-old 
      computer, but if it's sitting on a network at a university or corporation, 
      it probably has a really good connection to the Internet," he says. 

      Nor do these denial-of-service attacks display much skill or originality. 
      The programs are easily downloadable from various hacking sites on the 
      Web. And while it's time-consuming to hack into and prepare the hundreds 
      of servers required to overwhelm a Web site, Weld Pond says it's not 
      particularly difficult. "It's the kind of thing that, if you were at 
      average proficiency with Internet software, you could probably learn in a 
      few hours," he says. "It probably took a few months to set up, to gather 
      the amount of machines to attack. Whoever's doing this is industrious." 

      Because of the anonymity and ease of the attacks, it's very difficult to 
      track down who launched them. The assault may seem to come from servers in 
      New York or Mountain View, Calif., but the hacker may be a loner in a 
      basement in Crested Butte, Colo. "The speculation is that they're going to 
      brag about it," Kolstad says. And that, he thinks, is the best hope for 
      tracking down the perpetrators. 

      The attacks also seem to show a vicious sense of humor. The first assault, 
      on Yahoo, came a few short minutes after AT&T Labs security expert Steven 
      Bellovin gave a speech on denial-of-service attacks at the just-completed 
      North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG) meeting in San Jose, 
      Calif., which suggests that the attacks were timed by "someone trying to 
      prove a point," Weld Pond says. 

      Whatever point that was, computer experts express disdain for whoever is 
      behind the attacks. Mark Gebert, senior systems research programmer at 
      Merit Network, the nonprofit regional network that sponsors the NANOG 
      meetings, bristles at
      the labeling of the attackers as "hackers." According to Gebert, they
      are known in the computer community as "crackers" and "script kiddies"
      because of their dependence on preprogrammed tools. Their assaults on 
      Web sites may not be particularly elegant or inventive — but that 
      doesn't make them any less illegal.

      Smells Like Mean Spirit 
      by Leander Kahney 
      
      10:50 a.m. 9.Feb.2000 PST Hackers, who pride themselves on Web attacks 
      with a purpose, are scornful of the "packet monkeys" responsible for this 
      week's attacks on Yahoo, CNN, and other high-profile sites. 

      The cracker or crackers responsible for the attacks have been 
      contemptuously dubbed "packet monkeys" because their exploits involve 
      flooding a site with packets of information and, detractors say, betray a 
      distinctly simian       intelligence. 

      Like "script kiddies" who use well-documented techniques and readily 
      available software to deface Web sites, packet monkeys are dismissed as 
      adolescent vandals by a community that celebrates know-how, originality, 
      and creativity. 

      "There's no technical prowess whatsoever in these kind of attacks," said 
      "Space Rogue," a research scientist with @Stake (formerly the highly 
      respected L0pht Heavy Industries) and editor of the Hacker News Network. 
      "This isn't       anything new. This is old, tired technology someone is 
      running in a big way." 

      "This kind of thing is really frowned on," said YTCracker, a 17-year-old 
      high school student from Colorado, who recently claimed responsibility for 
      cracking a number of U.S. government sites. "It's a bunch of bored kids 
      trying to show       they have the guts to do this.... We don't like to be 
      associated with these people." 

      No one has come forward to claim responsibility for the attacks. 

      Unlike a vandalized Web site, where the cracker usually leaves a moniker, 
      says hi to his friends, or taunts law enforcement, a packet monkey attack 
      leaves no public traces and no clue to the cracker's identity. 

      Space Rogue said crackers typically advertise their exploits to gain 
      acceptance with their peer group. In fact, this is frequently the motive 
      for the attack. 

      "It makes you wonder what kind of person is pulling this off and why 
      they're doing this," he said. "There's no public record, no boasting, 
      nothing left behind." 

      Space Rogue said there is also very little gossip about the identity and 
      motive of the attackers. 

      "Rumors are scarce on this one," he said. "That's unusual.... My gut 
      feeling tells me it's an individual and not a group, but I don't have any 
      evidence to back that up." 

      Although most hackers condemn the attacks, at least one poster to Slashdot 
      professed his "grudging admiration" for what appears to be a concerted 
      demonstration against the commercialization of the Internet. 

      "This is the equivalent of a blockade -- a formal, organized protest," 
      wrote "Swordgeek." "Not throwing rocks through windows so much as linking 
      arms in front of a police line. 

      "The brats and miscreants may have gotten their shit together and started 
      to fight for something worthwhile, rather than simply for the hell of it."

      A Tangled Web: A Chat with Former Hacker “Weld Pond” 
 
 
 
      Feb. 9 —ZDNet became one of the latest victims
                                of a cyber attack
                                when the site was
                                taken offline for at
                                least two hours
                                today. A ZDNet
                                spokeswoman told
                                ABCNEWS.com
                                the company
      believes the strike most likely came from the
      same group of attackers responsible for
      knocking at least four other major Web sites
      offline, including Amazon.com and eBay.com,
      in the past two days.
 
      Why are these major sites under attack? Who is
      responsible for these acts, and can the culprits
      be caught? How secure is the Internet?
 
      Former hacker “Weld Pond” answered
      questions from ABCNEWS.com readers today
      in an online chat. Weld has testified before the
      Senate on the state of Internet security and is
      currently a research scientist at security services
      provider @Stake. Below is a transcript of the
      chat. 
 
      Moderator at 2:58pm ET 
      Welcome to our live chat with former hacker "Weld
      Pond." Thanks for being here today. 
 
      Weld Pond at 2:59pm ET 
      Hi, glad to be here. 
 
      Moderator at 2:59pm ET 
      Any idea who's responsible for these recent cyber
      attacks? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:00pm ET 
      It could be anybody from a 15-year old kid to a foreign
      government. But I think it is more likely the former. 
 
      Kingpin from 230.73.33.cypresscom.net at 3:01pm ET 
      Why do you think it takes a major event such as this to
      occur before people begin to think about security?
      Shouldn't security be designed into the system from the
      start, not added AFTER something happens? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:01pm ET 
      Because it takes time and money to design security from
      the start. People are optimists and don't think the worst
      will happen. 
 
      KBear at 3:02pm ET 
      Should companies be worried that hackers might have
      contacts inside their firms? People with grudges? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:03pm ET 
      People should be worried about insiders at a company
      more than outsiders. This is how most security breaches
      occur. They just are not reported that often. 
 
      Moderator at 3:03pm ET 
      Tipo asks: How does someone become a hacker? Is
      there some sort of initiation? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:04pm ET 
      There is no initiation to become a hacker. Most are
      self-taught and are reasonably proficient before they seek
      out other hackers to exchange information with. 
 
      M T Bethel from viagrafix.com at 3:04pm ET 
      What would be the benefit to anyone (or group) who
      would coordinate such an attack? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:05pm ET 
      I think these big name attacks are mostly for bragging
      rights. To impress your peers. 
 
      Moderator at 3:05pm ET
      Matthew asks: Is this a lesson in how fragile the Internet
      is, or a new form of terrorism? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:07pm ET 
      Well I think it is both. The Internet was not designed to be
      robust to denial of service attacks. It just wasn't thought
      about at the time. This is a new form of terrorism. People
      follow the technology to where the important and
      powerful are and try to disrupt and scare them. 
 
      RBeesto from co.polk.ia.us at 3:07pm ET 
      Do you think this is the start of some kind of cyber siege,
      to be duplicated by numerous copycats? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:07pm ET 
      I think it will be copied. With all the media attention this is
      getting it is the perfect way for someone to gain attention. 
 
      Goodguy at 3:08pm ET 
      Do you have the knowledge or ability to do something like
      this? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:09pm ET 
      Yes. Anyone who follows the computer security forums
      on the Internet knows how to do this. The tools and
      instructions are available widely. This is just the first time
      someone has tried it on very big Web sites. 
 
      Howard at 3:09pm ET 
      How is a "denial of service" attack harder to secure
      against than an electronic break-in? What steps would
      YOU take if you were Yahoo, or eBay? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:10pm ET 
      It is much harder because the attacker is taking advantage
      of what the network was designed to do — deliver a lot
      of packets (or data) efficiently. It is hard to tell just busy
      network traffic from the attack traffic.
 
      To stop it you need to understand the exact attack and try
      to filter it out on the routers that connect the Web sites to
      the Internet. 
 
      Martel from cc.ncsu.edu at 3:11pm ET 
      Do you think these high-profile attacks may be a
      distraction from smaller, intrusive attacks against other
      sites? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:11pm ET 
      Quite possibly. These attacks could be just a diversionary
      tactic. That is a standard technique to get around security
      mechanisms. 
 
      Crackerjack at 3:12pm ET 
      How hard will it be for the FBI to track down the parties
      responsible? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:13pm ET 
      It is very difficult to track down the attacker in a denial of
      service attack. The data sent in the attack does not have
      to have valid return addresses so the packets need to be
      traced back one router hop at a time. 
 
      Moderator at 3:14pm ET 
      PJ asks: What's the likelihood of these crackers being
      caught? Do you think they're afraid of being caught? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:15pm ET 
      The attackers have probably taken steps to anonymize
      themselves. It will be difficult to track them down. The
      longer they keep doing it the more time they give to be
      traced back however. 
 
      Moderator at 3:15pm ET 
      RayHS1 asks: What actual crimes or offenses have been
      committed with these attacks? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:16pm ET 
      It is a federal crime to disrupt someone's computer
      service. The same law that was used to prosecute the
      writer of the Melissa virus would be used in this case. 
 
      null from enoch.org at 3:17pm ET 
      Weld, l0pht has said in the past that one of the best ways
      to carry across the message that the term 'hacker' does
      not necessarily equate 'criminal' to the general public is for
      non-criminal hackers to identify themselves as such. Does
      it bother you, then, to be featured on ABCNews.com
      billed as a "former hacker"? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:18pm ET 
      I would rather still be called a hacker than former hacker.
      I'm wearing an @Stake tshirt right now and it has
      "Hacker" emblazoned on the back. :-) 
 
      John in Dallas from cadence.com at 3:18pm ET 
      What about the small companies — how do small
      companies protect against this type of stuff without the
      capital to purchase all this protection ? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:19pm ET 
      Small companies need to demand better security from
      their vendors, whether they are their ISPs, hardware, or
      software providers. 
 
      aj from rpr.rpna.com at 3:19pm ET 
      If the hackers do not have a valid address or IP address,
      how do they access the Net and wouldn't that flag an ISP
      somewhere? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:20pm ET 
      They are connected with a valid IP address but they can
      still send other data that has invalid IP addresses unless
      their ISP is filtering/detecting that. Most ISPs do not do
      this. That is a problem that needs to be fixed. 
 
      BVRWINS from city.palo-alto.ca.us at 3:21pm ET 
      Can attacks like these be carried out by a single
      computer? Or are these coming from an organized group?
 
      Weld Pond at 3:21pm ET 
      There are probably a few computers that are controlling
      100s or 1000s of machines in tandem. That is the only
      way a huge site like Yahoo could be taken down with
      denial of service. 
 
      John from cm-media.com at 3:22pm ET 
      Hackers often claim they're performing a service by
      liberating information and testing security systems. Do you
      see any such "positive" effects in these cases, or is it
      simple harassment? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:23pm ET 
      Sometimes it takes an actual demonstration of the
      problem before anyone does anything. I don't advocate
      denial of service attacks but I can see how they are a
      wake-up call to people who have been ignoring the
      problem. 
 
      aNoViCe at 3:24pm ET 
      Are there legitimate reasons for data not to have valid
      return addresses? If not, wouldn't it solve the problem to
      have servers not accept packets without valid return
      addresses? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:26pm ET 
      There is no legitimate use for them. All routers should
      have ingress filters to make sure that the IP addresses they
      are accepting are valid. It is not feasible to check for
      validity on the Internet backbone routers or at the Web
      site's router. This test must be done at each ISP that
      connects an organization or person to the Internet. This
      needs to be done to start to combat this problem. 
 
      Dan in Philly at 3:27pm ET 
      Do you believe the glorification that comes with such
      media exposure will fuel others to attempt similar attacks,
      and if so what can the media do with companies to
      responsibly report such problems? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:28pm ET 
      I think it will definitely fuel more copycats. I think having
      other hackers speaking out that denial of service attacks
      are stupid and that they do not show any technical
      prowess may help. The people who launch these attacks
      are just vandals and they should be described that way. 
 
      jbomma from ford.com at 3:28pm ET 
      Isn't this really an example of the adage: "Criminals are
      always one step ahead". Once this problem is solved,
      hackers will continue to invent new types of attacks, will
      they not? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:13pm ET 
      These types of attacks were well known for at least a
      year. It is just that no one has taken the time to try and
      come up with a solution until now. It seems like the
      attackers are a step ahead but it is only because the public
      only finds out about the problems after the attackers
      strike. 
 
      Moderator at 3:23pm ET 
      Suppression asks: Are you concerned that the officials
      may go too far in their attempt to find these individuals? Is
      there a real possibility of a permanent invasion of privacy
      as to the activity of law-abiding Web users? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:33pm ET 
      It scares me that the government may take a monitoring
      and surveillance approach to solving these problems. I
      don't think this is a good solution plus it invades the
      privacy of law-abiding Internet users. The solution is to
      design secure networks and to secure the computers that
      are being compromised to launch the distributed attacks
      from. 
 
      Moderator at 3:33pm ET 
      Thanks for your time today, Weld. Any final words for
      our audience? 
 
      Weld Pond at 3:34pm ET 
      It was great to be here to answer these questions. I think
      that eventually there will be a solution to these denial of
      service problems. But I think it will take some time to
      design and put in place. Until then I expect to see more
      attacks like this.

      Classic Hackers Decry
      Heavy-Handed Upstarts

      February 9, 2000 
      Web posted at: 4:14 PM EST (2114 GMT) 

      By Jessica Reaves

      In the world of Internet hacking, as in the world of rap music, there is 
      the old school, and then there are the insurgents. The former tends to 
      view the latter with some suspicion, and perhaps a bit of jealousy. Such 
      was the case Wednesday; establishment hackers are up in arms over the 
      media attention paid to Monday and Tuesday's attacks on Yahoo, eBay, CNN 
      and Buy.com. "We find that there are already ample words in the English 
      language to describe such miscreants and call upon the media to define 
      them by their actions, as they are all we know them by at this point," 
      fumed the editors of 2600, The Hacker Quarterly. 

      Fiercely protective of their reputation, longtime hackers are locked in a 
      love-hate relationship with web site designers, who grudgingly appreciate 
      hackers' talent for pinpointing serious security lapses. "Hacking is 
      generally accepted to be the arena of very smart people," says Stuart 
      McClure, president of Rampart Security Group in Irvine. "Denial of service 
      attacks, like what happened to Yahoo and eBay, are seen as 
      bottom-of-the-barrel assaults; they don't require a lot of brains." 

      When a site has been hacked, its appearance is often altered by 
      chest-beating hackers who leave the cyber equivalent of a "Kilroy was 
      here" scrawl. This week's attacks, on the other hand, bombarded various 
      high-traffic sites with an overflow of information, effectively shutting 
      down normal operations. How do the perpetrators send so much data so 
      quickly? Apparently, the most recent assaults are not typical denial of 
      service pranks, which generally are sent from only one or two computers at 
      a time. "These people scan the Internet for vulnerable systems, and they 
      hack into those systems, and then use hundreds of those computers, 
      remotely, to send the attack," says McClure. 

      The latest string of invasions may inspire some instances of increased 
      security, says McClure, but consumers shouldn't expect a sudden influx of 
      super-secure sites. "There are ways to keep these attacks from happening, 
      but few companies implement them. Security tends to take a backseat to 
      aesthetics and ease of service at the site," McClure says. And while Net 
      businesses may be tempted to pump their time and money into the more 
      visible aspects of a site, the current threat to their bottom line may 
      force them to rethink their priorities. After all, seeing a 
      multibillion-dollar web site brought to its knees by a group of 
      not-so-bright pranksters doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence on Wall 
      Street -- or among consumers and
      advertisers.

125.0 HNN: Feb 10th;  NIPC Releases Detection Tools 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      contributed by jericho 
      NIPC has developed a new release of the software
      application that will detect tfn2k client, tfn2k daemon,
      trinoo daemon, trinoo master, tfn daemon, tfn client,
      stacheldraht master, stacheldraht client, stachelddraht
      demon and tfn-rush client. This new version
      (find_ddosv31) is now available for Solaris on Sparc or
      Intel platforms and Linux on Intel platforms and will no
      longer improperly identify itself or any previous version
      as a DDOS program. 

      NIPC 
      http://www.fbi.gov/nipc/trinoo.htm

      Unfortunately they are only distributing executables and
      not source. With all the recent cases of the FBI and
      NSA trying to pass legislation that will allow them to
      backdoor various communications systems, computer
      networks and everything else.. how could anyone trust
      these? 
      
      FBI:
      
      UPDATED Version 3.1 Released 
      
      NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION CENTER; TRINOO/Tribal Flood Net/tfn2k

      During the past few weeks the NIPC has seen multiple reports of intruders 
      installing distributed denial of service tools on various computer 
      systems, to create large networks of hosts capable of launching 
      significant coordinated packet flooding denial of service attacks. 
      Installation has been accomplished primarily through compromises 
      exploiting known sun rpc vulnerabilities. These multiple denial of service 
      tools include TRINOO, and Tribe Flood Network (or TFN & tfn2k), and has 
      been reported on many systems. The NIPC is highly concerned about the 
      scale and significance of these reports, for the following reasons:

           Many of the victims have high bandwidth Internet connections, 
           representing a possibly significant threat to Internet traffic.            
           The technical vulnerabilities used to install these denial of service 
           tools are widespread, well-known and readily accessible on most 
           networked systems throughout the Internet. The tools appear to be 
           undergoing active development, testing and deployment on the 
           Internet. The activity often stops once system owners start filtering 
           for TRINOO/TFN and related activity. 

      Possible motives for this malicious activity include exploit 
      demonstration, exploration and reconnaissance, or preparation for 
      widespread denial of service attacks.

      NIPC requests that all computer network owners and organizations rapidly 
      examine their systems for evidence of these distributed denial of service 
      (DDOS) tools (specific technical instructions are available from CERT-CC, 
      SANS, NIPC, or other sources).

      The NIPC is making available on its web site a software application that 
      can be used to detect the presence of these DDOS tools.

      Recipients are asked to report significant or suspected criminal activity 
      to their local FBI office or the NIPC Watch/Warning Unit, and to computer 
      emergency response support and other law enforcement agencies, as 
      appropriate. The NIPC Watch       and Warning Unit can be reached at (202) 
      323-3204/3205/3206, or nipc.watch@fbi.gov.

      This latest update reflects that NIPC has developed a new release of the 
      software application that will detect tfn2k client, tfn2k daemon, trinoo 
      daemon, trinoo  master, tfn daemon, tfn client, stacheldraht master, 
      stacheldraht client, stachelddraht demon and tfn-rush       client.  This 
      new version (find_ddosv31) is now available for Solaris on Sparc or Intel 
      platforms and Linux on Intel platforms and will no longer improperly 
      identify itself or any previous version as a DDOS program. 

      This executable (find_ddosv31_{platform}.tar.Z) is for Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 
      and Solaris 7 on the {Sparc} or {Intel} platforms, and {Linux} on Intel 
      platforms. This file will not work on a Windows-based PC.

       Press Release:

       For Immediate Release
       December 30, 1999

                                         Washington D.C.
                                         FBI National Press Office

            

      The FBI today issued the following statement:

      Over the last several weeks, the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) has
      received multiple reports of the presence of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) tools
      on computer systems in the United States. The NIPC issued alerts about these tools
      on December 6, 1999 and today (see http://www.nipc.gov). The CERT at Carnegie
      Mellon has also issued an incident note (IN-99-OT) on November 18, 1999, and an
      update on December 28, 1999 (see http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-99-07.html).
      These DDOS tools have also now been reported by the media and published on the
      Internet. These DDOS tools, such as "trin00" and "Tribe Flood Network" ("tfn"), are
      capable of generating sufficient network traffic to render the targeted network or
      computer system inoperable. Installation has been accomplished primarily through
      compromises exploiting known Sun RPC vulnerabilities. Basically, these tools allow an
      intruder to have multiple victim systems launch denial of service attacks against other
      systems that are the ultimate target.

      The NIPC has developed a software application that can be used by system
      administrators to scan their computer systems to determine whether they contain the
      "trin00" or "tfn" tools and therefore might be used as part of a DDOS attack on another
      network. The latest version of this detection software can be downloaded from the NIPC
      Internet Web site (http://www.nipc.gov). The NIPC requests that computer network
      administrators report the detection of DDOS tools or other apparent criminal activity on
      their systems to their local FBI Field Office or to the NIPC at nipc.watch@fbi.gov.

      NIPC Director Michael Vatis stated: "A central part of the NIPC's mission is to help
      protect critical computer networks by alerting private industry and government agencies
      of potential threats before an attack occurs. In this case, we have gone one step
      further by developing a software application that can be used to detect the presence of
      a significant hacker tool and neutralize it."

      The NIPC commenced its Y2K Command Post at FBIHQ yesterday, and will operate 24
      hours a day until January 5. In addition, each FBI Field Office has initiated a Command
      Post. These Command Posts have been established to facilitate the FBI's detection of
      and response to any criminal activity, cyber or physical, that might occur during the
      Millennium rollover period.

      The NIPC is a multi-agency organization whose mission is to detect, warn of, respond
      to, and investigate computer intrusions and other unlawful acts that threaten or target
      our Nation's critical infrastructures. Located in the FBI's headquarters building in
      Washington, D.C., the NIPC brings together representatives from the FBI, other U.S.
      government agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector in a
      partnership to protect our Nation's critical infrastructures. More information on the NIPC
      is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nipc.gov.

      downloading:

      HACKERS TO BLAME? DOUBTFUL 

     02/09/00 

     We feel sorry for the major Internet commerce
     sites that have been inconvenienced by the
     Denial of Service attacks. Really, we do. But we
     cannot permit them or anyone else to lay the
     blame on hackers. 

     So far, the corporate media has done a very bad
     job covering this story, blaming hackers and in
     the next sentence admitting they have no idea
     who's behind it. Since the ability to run a
     program (which is all this is) does not require
     any hacking skills, claiming that hackers are
     behind it indicates some sort of knowledge of
     the motives and people involved. 

     This could be the work of someone who lost their
     life savings to electronic commerce. Or maybe
     it's the work of communists. It could even be
     corporate America itself! After all, who would
     be better served by a further denigration of the
     hacker image with more restrictions on
     individual liberties? 

     Let's look at the headlines: 

     "Government sees cyber-attacks as disruption of
     commerce." 

     "Justice Department wants more funds to fight
     cyber crime." 

     Didn't take them long, did it? And later in the
     same story: "But the FBI may never know who is
     responsible for the cyber-attacks, due to the
     difficulty in tracing the electronic trails, a
     senior law enforcement source told CNN." 

     How convenient. An unseen villain. No need for
     any actual FACTS to be revealed, but plenty of
     blame to be cast on hackers everywhere. We find
     it to be a bit too contrived. 

     Whoever is responsible is either completely
     clueless or knows EXACTLY what they're doing.
     It's the latter that should concern hackers
     everywhere. 



     Number of times hackers were named or
     implied as culprits on these sites: 

     cnn.com         14
     msnbc.com       13
     zdnet.com        4
     abcnews.com      0

     Bronc;     

  
     So it comes to pass, the biggest names of the Internet are taken down in 
     some of the most massive denial of service attacks ever launched against 
     these major portals and web sites. Yahoo, one of the top three most visited 
     sites on the Internet, was reported to have been down for three hours on 
     Sunday. Buy.Com had been taken down for several hours as well early Monday, 
     with CNN and eBay unreachable during the afternoon, and then Amazon.Com and 
     Zdnet.Com unreachable for hours late Monday night—reportedly all the 
     targets of the latest round of attacks on Monday. 

     The main questions that beg to be answered are who is doing this, and why. 
     Several stories have been done in the last day, based mostly on rumors that 
     have been floating around and "expert" opinions as to      what was 
     happening and why, but there aren't many hard facts among them. 

     Several stories have reported the problem as a huge Denial of Service 
     attack, where crackers launch a large amount of false requests at a server, 
     basically clogging it up so other users can not reach it. A few      
     stories have reported that the Yahoo problem was just that, an internal 
     problem with the company that provides Yahoo with their connection to the 
     Internet, and not an attack. Still others have reported both poorly 
     configured equipment and a combination of attacks. 

     It is clear now, with the attacks against CNN, Buy.Com, eBay, Amazon and 
     Zdnet today, that there is someone, or some group, out there with an 
     agenda, attacking these sites on purpose. The reasoning behind it      may 
     remain unknown for now, but many in the hacker community are speculating 
     what kind of attacks are being used to cause this type of massive denial of 
     service, and what the motives might be behind it.

     A hacker with Condemned.Org, who goes by the name b|ueberry, said she 
     thought the attacks were done using a program called "Trinoo," which allows 
     one person to set up several systems (thousands possibly)      across the 
     Internet and use them in a coordinated attack. This type of program allows 
     the attackers to easily utilize a large network of boxes they have control 
     of across the Internet, and use them to strike at once against their 
     desired targets. As to why these attacks were taking place, she speculated 
     that they "were a bunch of idiots with nothing better to do…" 

     Her harsh words were echoed across the net. 

     "The people who did this are most likely bored 15 year olds with nothing 
     better to do than be a menace," said Eli Bottrell, system administrator for 
     SysAdmins.Com.

     Others that were questioned about their views on these attacks followed 
     suit, saying that the assaults were most likely being perpetrated by 
     youngsters either out to impress friends or make a name for      
     themselves. 

     One unnamed expert was quoted on the Today Show this morning claiming he 
     had gotten an e-mail from the attackers. This e-mail, he said, claimed that 
     the attackers were mad at the commercialization of the      Internet and at 
     the specifically targeted sites, and also went on to state that the attacks 
     would continue against other large sites.

     Reports coming out of San Francisco say that the FBI there has opened an 
     investigation into this matter, and is also looking into some of the 
     effected companies. One story had unconfirmed reports of the attacks      
     being traced back to a central computer where a list of possibly of up to 
     ten thousand compromised systems was found. 

     Although large-scale Denial of Service attacks are nothing new to the 
     Internet, not many have been seen on such a large scale against so many 
     targets, as is the case here. Administrators and security experts are      
     sometimes baffled when it comes to stopping these attacks because of the 
     shear size of the assault, and the multiple locations of origin around the 
     Web. In either case, most people questioned shared the view that the 
     attackers would be caught sooner of later.

      A worm known as Win32 Haiku.16384, or Haiku Worm for
      short, has been identified as a potential threat to
      Internet sites. Once infected the worm searches a

      Computer Associates Warns of New 'Haiku' Worm

      Media Alert for Wednesday, February 9, 2000

      ISLANDIA, N.Y., Feb. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Computer Associates International, 
      Inc. (CA) today warned computer users of the ``Win32 Haiku.16384'' Worm, 
      which has the potential to overload network traffic, impacting the 
      availability of resources. The       increase in network traffic may 
      degrade eBusiness performance, making end users unable to connect to email 
      and eCommerce sites. CA has the detection and the fix for this Worm, which 
      was reported by a client.

      The Haiku Worm arrives in an email with the subject line ``Fw: Compose 
      your own haikus!'' The email will have the file Haiku.exe attached. The 
      text of the message reads: 

          :))

          "Old pond...            a frog leaps in water's sound." -Matsuo Basho.

          DO YOU WANT TO COMPOSE YOUR OWN HAIKUS?

      
      Haiku is a small poetry with oriental metric that appeared in the XVI 
      century and is being very popular, mainly in Japan and the USA.

      It's done to transcend the limitation imposed by the usual language and 
      the linear/scientific thinking that treat the nature and the human being 
      as a machine.

      It usually has 3 lines and 17 syllables distributed in 5, 7 and 5. It must 
      register or indicate a moment, sensation, impression or drama of a 
      specific fact of nature. It's almost like a photo of some specific moment 
      of nature. More than inspiration, what you need in       order to compose 
      a real haiku is meditation, effort and perception.

      DO YOU WANT TO COMPOSE YOUR OWN HAIKUS?

      Now you can! it is very easy to get started in this old poetry art. 
      Attached to this e-mail you will find a copy of a simple haiku generator. 
      It will help you in order to understand the basics of the metric, rhyme 
      and subjects which should be used when composing a       real haiku... 
      just check it out! it's freeware and you can use and spread it as long as 
      you want!

      If Haiku.exe is run, it copies itself to C:\WINDOWS\HAIKUG.EXE and edits 
      the WIN.INI file, so the Worm will be loaded when Windows is restarted. 
      The Worm then displays a poem that is generated from an internal list of 
      words. The program exits when       the 'OK' button is selected.

      The next time a computer is restarted, the Worm will be loaded 
      automatically. At that point, it will not display any messages and is 
      registered as a service, so that it doesn't appear in the tasklist.

      The Worm stays resident, checking for an active dial-up Internet 
      connection. When it finds one, it will search through files with the 
      extension .doc, .eml, .htm, .html, .rtf and .txt looking for email 
      addresses. The Haiku Worm then attempts to send a copy of itself       to 
      all of the email addresses that it has found.

      ``CA aims to provide the most current and accurate information regarding 
      the latest Worm threats for our clients,'' said Simon Perry, CA's security 
      business manager. ``This worm is dangerous for eBusinesses because it 
      disguises itself cleverly and obtains email       addresses from documents 
      rather address books. CA is urging all of our clients to download the 
      latest signature files that will provide protection from this latest 
      threat.''

128.0 HNN: Feb 11th;Investigations Continue, Reports of more Possible Attacks Surface 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/
      
      contributed by Code Kid 
      Early reports indicate that Excite may have been hit with a denial of 
      service attack early this morning. Some evidence seems to suggest that AOL 
      has also been hit however neither has yet been confirmed. 

      More information on the attacks is now becoming available as sites recover 
      from the attacks. After further investigation Yahoo has said that they 
      have been able to determine that they actually suffered four separate 
      attacks prior to the one that took them offline. All the attacks had a 
      large distributed smurf component to them. Other sites have reported 
      single sourced syn-attacks which may indicate copy cat activity. Of the 
      several attacks against Yahoo only the one beginning at 10:30am PST on 
      Monday had any noticeable effect. The massive amount of traffic generated, 
      in excess of 1G bits/sec, took down one router and when it recovered Yahoo 
      lost all routing to their upstream ISP. Due to earlier network hardware 
      problems investigators believed this to be the reason for the outage at 
      first. After completely pulling the plug from their upstream ISP, Yahoo 
      was able to stitch things back together and finally realized that they had 
      been under a widely distributed DoS attack. The attacker(s) seemed to know 
      about the network topology and planned this large scale attack in advance. 
      Global Center, the Yahoo ISP, is now throttling all forms of ICMP until 
      they can determine the best configuration
      to prevent future attacks.

      Web-Sabotage: Eine harte Nuss für das FBI
      US-Justizministerin Janet Reno hat gestern abend auf einer Pressekonferenz eine 
      umfassende Untersuchung der aktuellen Sabotageakte im Internet angekündigt. Die 
      amerikanische Kriminalpolizei FBI hat die Fahndung nach Hackern aufgenommen, 
      die den dritten Tag in Folge populäre Internetfirmen attackiert haben. Reno 
      versicherte, die Washingtoner Regierung werde alles tun, um die Sicherheit des 
      elektronischen Handels im Internet zu garantieren.

      Nach wie vor sind keine "Bekennerschreiben" aufgetaucht, auch über die 
      Motive der Hacker herrscht Reno zufolge bisher Unklarheit. Der FBI-Experte 
      für Computersicherheit, Ron Dick, erklärte, das Spektrum der möglichen 
      Täter sei groß. Derartige Attacken könnten auf das Konto eines Teenagers 
      gehen, aber auch auf das einer ausländischen Regierung. 

      Den oder die Täter zu ermitteln dürfte sehr schwierig sein, da hierzu 
      große Mengen von Protokolldateien auf einer Reihe von Rechnersystemen 
      ausgewertet werden müssen. Bei Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) 
      Attacks, wie sie in den letzten Tagen auftraten, arbeiten die Hacker über 
      ein mehrstufiges System infiltrierter Computer. Das Hacker-News-Network 
      (HNN) sprach von einem Kontrollknoten, auf dem eine Liste von bis zu 
      zehntausend geknackten Rechnern gefunden wurde, die für Angriffe zur 
      Verfügung standen. 

      HNN meldet zudem, dass einige der Datenbomben Inhalt trugen, der die 
      Kommerzialisierung des Internet verwünscht habe. Auch Grüße an 
      Hackerzirkel und den deutschen Hacker Mixter, dem Programmierer eines 
      DDoS-Tools, seien beobachtet worden. Mixter zeigte sich c't gegenüber 
      schockiert und distanzierte sich von den Attacken: "Es scheint, als wären 
      die Angreifer ziemlich ahnungslose Leute, die machtvolle Ressourcen und 
      Programme für sinnlose Aktivitäten missbrauchen, einfach nur weil sie es 
      können. Das hat nichts mit Hacken oder 'Hacktivismus' zu tun." 

      Nicht zuletzt zeigen die Vorfälle Risiken einer digitalisierten 
      Gesellschaft, die sich immer mehr auf die Verfügbarkeit der elektronischen 
      Infrastruktur verlässt: Bisher waren nur E-Commerce-Sites und 
      Dienstleister betroffen -- die Hauptfolgen sind Wartezeiten und 
      Unbequemlichkeiten für die Kunden, der finanzielle Schaden dürfte 
      vergleichsweise gering ausfallen. Gleichartige Angriffe
      könnten aber im Prinzip jeden Dienst lahm legen, der über ein öffentlich
      zugängliches Netz läuft. Damit könnten beispielsweise Wirtschaftsunternehmen
      bei zeitkritischen Verhandlungen Konkurrenten ausschalten, Störer die 
      Koordination von Rettungsmaßnahmen im Katastrophenfall behindern oder 
      Regierungen unliebsame Bürgerrechtsbewegungen zum Schweigen bringen. (nl/c't)

      Author of Web attack tool speaks

     'The Net is as susceptible to hack attacks as its weakest parts.' So says
     'Mixter,' the  hacker who created the tool possibly used in this week's 
      spate of Web attacks.

      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News
      UPDATED February 10, 2000 5:04 PM PT 

      The Internet has its own sense of irony. 

      While chatting online with ZDNet about this week's spate of Web attacks,
      "Mixter" -- a self-proclaimed "white-hat hacker" who created the Tribal 
      Flood Network denial-of-service tool some believe is responsible for
      several of those attacks -- was knocked offline by a flood of data 
      similar to those very same attacks. 
      
     "It's quite easy," Mixter said of the data-flood technique used
      against Yahoo!, eBay, Buy.com, Amazon.com, CNN, E*Trade,
      MSN.com and ZDNet. And the tool allegedly created by the
      20-year-old German-based hacker makes it even easier. 

      The Tribal Flood Network and its newest version, TFN2K,
      can implement a denial of service by flooding servers and
      routers with a bewildering variety of different data types. 

      In an exclusive chat interview with ZDNet, Mixter called
      Tribal Flood Network a teaching tool that points out the
      holes in the Web. Others consider it a danger. 


      ZDNet: How did you get into security? 

      Mixter: Well, I worked with computers for a long time. I
      started with my first computer when I was 6 years old,
      and I've been interested in the technical details of
      operating systems and networks since I was about 14
      when I got my first PC with an Internet connection. 

      ZDNet: What computer did you start with? 

      Mixter: Commodore 64. 

      ZDNet: Do you consider what you do to be "hacking"? 

      Mixter: I think what I do is hacking in the "traditional"
      sense, but I'm afraid to use the term, since the meaning
      of "hacker" is changing to something negative. I had
      some conflicts with the law in the past, but I'm a
      white-hat now. 

      ZDNet: What sort of things happened in the past? 

      Mixter: Well, I started with it like many people on Efnet
      (a major IRC chat network) do, by learning how to take
      over and how to secure chat channels. Then I went over
      to programming and writing IRC robots. Unfortunately, I
      have also "actively" taught myself how to get into
      systems. I used some compromised systems for running
      and testing IRC bots, for which I've been raided and
      persecuted, but gladly I didn't commit real major damage
      with anything I did. I consider it as a mistake in my past,
      from which I've learned. 

      ZDNet: Why did you want to make a tool like TFN and
      make it public for all the script kiddies to use and abuse?

      Mixter: I rewrote TFN after what I thought Trinoo (a tool
      that makes another DoS attack known as SMURFing
      easy) worked like because Trinoo was kept private. First,
      I called it the "teletubby flood network," but I thought the
      name was just too silly. 

      The problem (with today's infrastructure) is that a lot of
      weaknesses exist. For example, you can employ
      spoofing and distributed concepts, and it is hard to do
      something against it due to Internet protocol
      weaknesses. I decided to write TFN and post the source
      code publicly to security sites, so people could scrutinize
      the code, and possible upcoming attack methods, and
      come up with a patch. This is the security concept known
      as "full disclosure." The main idea is that security people
      find and post any weaknesses, including really dangerous
      ones, as soon as possible, so everyone has a chance of
      analyzing them and thinking about countermeasures. 

      ZDNet: Yet, there seems to be no comprehensive
      solution to the problem. That is, if you want to let people
      access your site, you must to some degree be
      susceptible to a DDoS (distributed denial-of-service)
      attack. 

      Mixter: That's true, but the real problem is the lack of
      authentification in current protocols. Besides, you
      actually have to compromise a real lot of other hosts to
      be able to penetrate fast sites. ... That is the concept of
      DDoS. There are methods (to stop more advanced DoS
      attacks) including SYN interception and proxying at the
      routers. However, all these short time measures can only
      minimize the impact of the floods; they cannot fully
      prevent it. When a site is attacked really badly, they're
      probably still going to notice it somehow. 

      ZDNet: So, in your mind, what is the solution to this
      problem? 

      Mixter: Well, you can basically spoof the origin of any
      packet arbitrarily. And that has to be prevented in the
      long term by migrating to IPv6 (the next-generation
      Internet protocol), which provides necessary
      authentication facilities and a bunch of other security
      extensions. 

      ZDNet: What is the short-term solution? 

      Mixter: The solution for the hosts that are being
      compromised is simply to care about their security, by
      updating their software and configurations. It's that easy.
      The attacker *HAS* to gain access to his "slave" servers
      by exploiting existent security vulnerabilities. The Net is
      as susceptible to hack attacks as its weakest parts.
      Also, limit the amount of bandwidth that is being let
      through at the backbone provider. This is a concept that
      many people are implementing. 

      ZDNet: And when do you think IPv6 will actually make it
      into most of the infrastructure? 

      Mixter: IPv6 should get implemented as soon as
      possible, not only because of security aspects, but
      because the growth of the Internet will make it inevitably
      necessary by 2004, or sooner. The old IP protocol is a
      relic, comparable to the Y2K bug. It is soon going to
      cause problems if people don't care about it. 

      ZDNet: Do you think that the people who make these
      tools available (i.e., put power in the hands of people who
      don't use it responsibly) are responsible for the use of
      them? Yourself, for instance? 

      Mixter: No, that's generally not the case, and it is, in my
      opinion, irrational to say so. I also know the author of
      Trinoo, who hasn't directly been launching the attacks,
      but I think he is afraid and wants to stay anonymous. 

      ZDNet: Are you planning to make any other such tools? 

      Mixter: Currently not. I've released TFN2K, after the
      CERT advisory. The purpose of releasing another DDoS
      tool was to include all possible attacking, stealthing, etc.,
      features in that tool that could be developed in the future I
      could think of. 

      We are currently seeing new derivatives of tools with
      small variations, but nothing that is really worse or more
      "powerful" in any way. ... My purpose of releasing TFN2K
      was showing all these risks in one rush, and as early as
      possible. 

      ZDNet: So, anything you want to say about the attacks
      that are currently occurring? 

      Mixter: Well, there has been rumor that they included in
      the packets some protest against e-commerce. I think
      they are mostly social motivated, and I don't condone any
      of such activity. Most of all because it doesn't require
      really great technical skill to install these tools and
      launch attacks, and it serves absolutely no constructive
      purpose.

      10 Feb 2000, 5:02 PM CST

      Responding to the spate of recent attacks against commercial Websites, a 
      number of legislators are calling for a crackdown on computer crime. 

      "We might have to pass some legislation to get even tougher" on computer 
      crime, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
      Wednesday. Hatch intends to hold a hearing sometime in March to determine 
      whether current laws give law enforcers the "tools that they need" to 
      prosecute computer crime offenses, Judiciary Committee spokesperson Jeanne 
      Lopatto said today. 

      Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has also raised concerns about the 
      recent attacks and is "monitoring the situation," according to the 
      majority leader's office. 

      Hatch, Lott and others on the hill are reacting to the recent glut of 
      "denial of service" attacks against large e-commerce providers such as 
      Amazon.com, CNN.com, and E-Trade. 

      The most recent confirmed attack struck Excite and there are unconfirmed 
      reports that America Online has fallen victim to a denial of service 
      attack.

      Surveillance bill under fire


      At issue is the burden of proof

 

      The UK Government came under fire  on Thursday from the internet 
      community after it published a Bill to regulate covert surveillance. 

      The critics say the legislation, if passed, could lead to innocent 
      people being sent to jail simply because they have lost their data 
      encryption codes. 

      The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill covers the monitoring 
      and the interception of communications by law enforcement and security 
      agencies. It will, for example, lay down the legal rules that must be 
      followed by the police and security services when they tap someone's 
      phone. 

      It also regulates the authorities' access to the codes that encrypt 
      data sent over the net. Such encryption will increasingly become a routine 
      tool of e-commerce, built into ordinary e-mail and browser software. But 
      the Home Office is deeply concerned that criminals, such as paedophiles, 
      will use encryption to hide their activities. 

      And, as a result, the Bill proposes that the police or the security 
      services should have the power to force someone to hand over decryption 
      keys or the plain text of specified materials, such as e-mails, and jail 
      those who refuse. 

      The government believes it has built sufficient safeguards into the 
      legislation. But Caspar Bowden, from the Foundation for Information Policy 
      Research, said the law as drafted was "impossible" and accused the 
      government of ignoring all the advice and lobbying it had received from 
      the net community over the past year. 

      Net privacy

      At issue is the burden of proof. Critics of the legislation say 
      someone might go to jail unless they could prove they did not have a 
      requested key - an impossible defence for someone who has lost the 
      software code. 

      "This law could make a criminal out of anyone who uses encryption to 
      protect their privacy on the internet," Mr Bowden said. 

      "The Department of Trade and Industry jettisoned decryption powers 
      from its e-Communications Bill last year because it did not believe that a 
      law which presumes someone guilty unless they can prove themselves 
      innocent was compatible with the Human Rights Act. 

      "But the corpse of a law laid to rest by Trade Secretary Stephen 
      Byers has been stitched up and jolted back into life by Home Secretary 
      Jack Straw." 

      Under the new legislation, the police  would have to have "reasonable 
      grounds to believe" someone suspected illegal activity had a key. Previous 
      attempts to draft the legislation had only used the word "appear". 

      Human rights 

      Caspar Bowden acknowledged that  the change replaced a subjective 
      test with one requiring some objective evidence. The prosecution would 
      have to show that someone receiving encrypted e-mail has or had a key. 
      However, he said the presumption of guilt remained for those who had 
      genuinely lost or forgotten their keys.

 
      "It's clear we are heading for the courts with a human rights test case," 
      Mr Bowden told BBC News Online. "The legislation could be amended, but 
      it's obvious the government is not going to take that course." 

      However, the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, is clearly confident about 
      the legal advice he has received. 

      "The Human Rights Act and rapid  change in technology are the twin 
      drivers of the new Bill," he said. 

      "None of the law enforcement  activities specified in the Bill is 
      new. Covert surveillance by police and other law enforcement officers is 
      as old as policing itself; so too is the use of informants, agents, and 
      undercover officers. 

      "What is new is that for the first time  the use of these techniques 
      will be properly regulated by law, and externally supervised, not least to 
      ensure that law enforcement operations are consistent with the duties 
      imposed on public authorities by the European Convention on Human Rights 
      and the Human Rights Act."

      French to sue US and Britain over
                 network of spies
   
                FROM ADAM SAGE IN PARIS
     THE British and US Governments are to be sued in
     France after claims that they have spied on French
     companies, diplomats and Cabinet ministers. Lawyers are
     planning a class action after confirmation last week that a
     global anglophone spy network exists. 
   
     Codenamed P-415 Echelon, the world's most powerful
     electronic spy system was revealed in declassified US
     National Security Agency documents published on the
     Internet, and is capable of intercepting telephone
     conversations, faxes and e-mails. 
   
     The system was established in the 1980s by the UKUSA
     alliance, which unites the British, American, Australian,
     New Zealand and Canadian secret services. In Europe, its
     listening devices are at Menwith Hill defence base in
     Yorkshire. French MPs claim to have evidence that the
     European Airbus consortium lost a Fr35 billion (£3.5
     billion) contract in 1995 after its offer was overheard and
     passed to Boeing. Georges Sarre, a left-wing MP, said:
     "The participation of the United Kingdom in spying on its
     European partners for and with the US raises serious and
     legitimate concerns in that it creates a particularly acute
     conflict of interest within the European Union." 
   
     The European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee will
     study a report on the Echelon network on February 23.
     The debate is certain to fuel criticism of Britain's role. 
   
     Until this month, the network was an official secret
     recognised by none of the members of the UKUSA
     alliance. But the documents published by the George
     Washington University prove its existence and its capacity
     to intercept civilian satellite communications. 
   
     Jean-Pierre Millet, a Parisian lawyer, said that Echelon
     tracked every mobile and satellite call, but only decoded
     those involving a key figure. "You can bet that every time
     a French government minister makes a mobile phone call,
     it is recorded," he said. 
   
     M Millet said that Echelon's system leaves it open to legal
     challenge under French privacy laws. "The simple fact that
     an attempt has been made to intercept a communication is
     against the law in France, however the information is
     exploited." Yesterday he said that he would bring an
     action on behalf of French civil liberty groups.

      EVERETT, Wash. (February 11, 2000 8:35 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) 
      - A computer virus blamed for more than $80 million in damage last year 
      has resurfaced, this time in the Snohomish County government's e-mail 
      system. 

      The virus known as Melissa eluded virus defenses and infested county 
      computers about noon Thursday, resulting in shutdown of the e-mail system, 
      said Colin Bottem, director of information services. 

      The rest of the county's computer services were not affected, Bottem said. 

      E-mail servers were "being cleaned up" and the system should be operating 
      normally again Friday afternoon, Bottem said. 

      Melissa struck thousands of e-mail systems last March, disguised as an 
      "important message" from a friend, and spread around the world like an 
      electronic chain letter. In December, David L. Smith, a computer 
      programmer, pleaded       guilty in Newark, N.J., to creating the virus 
      and using a sex Web site to spread it through cyberspace. 

      When the message is opened, the virus goes to the recipient's computer 
      address book and sends the same message to the first 50 e-mail addresses. 
      
      "It replicates itself," Bottem said.

      Computer Boffs Hunt Teen Hacker
      'Akt0r' claims his intentions are good
      By Andre Jurgens
      
      A Computer Whiz Kid has become South Africa's most wanted "cyber-villian"
      after breaking into nearly a dozen "safe" Internet web sites. The 19-year-old,
      who calls himself Akt0r, has so far evaded capture but computer security
      experts from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are on his trail after an
      embarassing attack on their web site last weekend.
      
      Akt0r claims in just four months to have "cracked" sites owned by Eskom, The
      Police, Rand Afrikaans University, Southern Life, Stormers Rugby Club,
      Incredible Connection, Computicket, Durban Metropolitan Council and the
      government's Stats SA page. Each time he replaced their official webpages with
      his own messages, criticising their "clueless" security and hinting that he
      was willing to accept a job in the computer industry.
      
      The companies were not eager to discuss the attacks in detail this week but
      all said no confidential information had been compromised. [Wyzewun: This is
      true for the South African Police Service, because their page is hosted at a
      seperate ISP and have their private network accessible only over dialup.
      However, I seriously doubt this is true for the likes of Incredible Connection
      and Southern Life.] Akt0r told the Sunday Times he broke into the web sites
      "for a good cause, to prove a point actually - Security measures in South
      Africa are quite lame", he said, "Privacy is not well guarded. How safe do you
      think your personal details are?" "I'm not malicious. I have not destroyed or
      stolen information."
      
      His goals are to land a job in the information technology industry. "I've had
      enough of hacking. I want to get a job and make a positive contribution to the
      industry." [Wyzewun: More about this after the article :P] Last year he
      telephonically warned companies about computer security. "They weren't
      interested, especially Eskom, so I defaced their sites to teach them a few
      tricks."
      
      Also known as "Zilly Zaber" and "Purple Chaos", he is a member of an
      international hacking gang called the Binary Outlaws. [Wyzewun: More commonly
      known as the b1nary 0utlawz or b10z] "We're against the way governments and
      big businesses manipulate people. They control information and information
      shapes people's lives around the world. We've cracked big websites around the
      world to get this message out." The 15-member gang, all male, are scattered
      through Bosnia, New Zealand, The US, Cyprus, Sweden, Ireland and South Africa.
      
      Akt0r taught himself the tricks of the trade working in a computer shop, and
      started hacking at the age of 16 with an Internet group called the North
      American Intelligence Liberation. [Wyzewun: They never did a great deal, but
      cracked an insecure NASA box (Vulnerable to PHF in 1997). They were disbanded
      when one of the NAiL members mysteriously disappeared after hitting some or
      other gov thingymabob :( One neat thing they did was...] "We defaced the Ku
      Klux Klan web site and replaced it with a picture of Martin Luther King and
      a message about free speech. They went ballistic."
      
      He is not worried about being caught. "I didn't cover my tracks well. It's
      quite simple to find me but most companies don't have the knowledge." He said
      there was virtually no law in South Africa against "cracking" - what hackers
      define as breaking into web sites with good and non-destructive intentions.
      [Wyzewun: HUH? Who's definition of cracking is THAT?]
      
      "My mom and dad will probably freak. I'm thinking about telling them what I've
      done," he said. South African computer security expert Ian Melamed said Akt0r
      should put his energy into stopping hackers. "We are desperately short of good
      technical experts in the industry. No right minded person can support the
      introduction of techno thuggery," he said.
      
      Earlier this week, Richard Miller, general manager of information technology
      at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, said investigations were closing in on
      Akt0r. [Wyzewun: Yeh right, if they haven't got him by now, they won't have
      him ever, aKt0r knows an infinite amount more than all the JSE "experts"] He
      denied that any confidential information had been lost.
      
      --- End Article ---
      
      Well, aKt0r is a good friend - and I respect him, but a lot of his friends
      don't approve of this new "hacking for a job" mission he's going on. Certainly
      this can be achieved, but by defacing a site you blow away all your chances of
      succeeding. He should rather persist at bugging the company day after day, and
      try and get some form of reaction that way.
      
      I originally became aware that aKt0r was doing this when Moe1, part of the
      Forbidden Knowledge e-zine staff [packetstorm.securify.com/mag/fk] and another
      member of b10z who helps aKt0r with many of his defacements msg'd me...
      
      <Moe1> Oh, btw, I have Nothing to do with aKt0r's latest
      <Moe1> Some-one needs to talk some sense to that kid
      
      Yeah, aKt0r is a pimp and I love him, but this new shit he's up to is just a
      bit too suicidal. He also told me he intended to stop cracking after the new
      computer crime laws came in, which it appears he hasn't. He is pushing harder
      and harder, and attracting too much media attention, and somewhere along the
      line, something is going to give. We don't need or want a South African
      Mitnick, and it looks like that could be his eventual path. :/
      
      He is set to do an interview with Carte Blanche in the near future, along with
      the most prominent members of the South African Hacking scene (Vortexia,
      Pneuma, Myself and some others). I will have the show put into MPG and will
      publish a URL for it in HWA.hax0r.news as soon as it is available. Later...

137.0 ISN: Jan 16:Hacker gang blackmails firms with stolen files

      Hacker gang blackmails firms with stolen files
      
      Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Stan Arnaud
      
      [The Sunday Times] (12.16.2000) A BRITISH group of hackers has broken into
      the computer systems of at least 12 multinational companies and stolen
      confidential files. It has issued ransom demands of up to 10m and is also
      suspected of hiring out its services.
      
      Scotland Yard is now investigating the attacks, which computer experts
      have described as the most serious systematic breach ever of companies'
      security in Britain.
      
      "The group is using very sophisticated techniques and has been exchanging
      information via e-mail and internet chat," said an investigator.
      
      Visa confirmed last week that it had received a ransom demand last month,
      believed to have been for 10m.
      
      "We were hacked into in mid-July last year," said Russ Yarrow, a company
      spokesman. "They gained access to some corporate material and we informed
      both Scotland Yard and the FBI."
      
      It is understood the hackers stole computer "source codes"  that are
      critical to programming, and threatened to crash the entire system. If
      Visa's system crashed for just one day, the company - which handles nearly
      1 trillion business a year from customers holding 800m Visa cards - could
      lose tens of millions of pounds.
      
      "We received a phone call and an e-mail to an office in England demanding
      money," Yarrow said.
      
      The company contacted police after the ransom demand. "We hardened the
      system, we sealed it and they did not return. We have firewalls upon
      firewalls, but are concerned that anyone got in."
      
      Scotland Yard's computer crime unit is now scrutinising e-mail traffic
      between several known hackers in England and Scotland. Last month officers
      from the unit flew to Hopeman, a Scottish fishing village, and seized
      equipment from the home of James Grant, who works for a local computer
      company.  He has been interviewed by detectives and Visa security experts.
      
      It is understood that he has given a legal undertaking to Visa not to
      discuss the matter. "He is saying nothing at all," said his mother, Rhona.
      "That is a situation that will not change in the future."
      
      Grant, 20, studied computing in nearby Elgin, and now works for Data
      Converters, based in Elgin. His father is a member of the civilian
      security staff at RAF Lossiemouth air base and his mother a care worker.
      
      Detectives are studying attacks on at least 12 companies that they believe
      have been penetrated by the group and others that may be connected,
      including one within the Virgin group, in which a hacker tried to break
      into the UK mailing system.  They believe the group may also be acting as
      paid specialists for information brokers who trade corporate secrets.
      
      "These are professionals and there is some evidence that suggests some of
      the activity was contracted and paid for,"  said a computer expert
      involved in the investigation.
      
      The group's success has exposed flaws in security. The internet company CD
      Universe last week confirmed it had called in the FBI after being
      blackmailed by a hacker who had copied more than 300,000 of its customer
      credit card files.
      
      Scotland Yard said: "There is an ongoing investigation into the incident
      involving Visa, but it is too early to speculate about the involvement of
      a group."

      How to steal 2,500 credit cards

      Mon, 17 Jan 2000 10:19:05 GMT       Bob Sullivan, MSNBC

      Remarkable discovery by MSNBC investigation, uncovers e-commerce sites' 
      shoddy security. 

      Just how easy is it to steal credit card numbers on the Internet? Last 
      week, MSNBC was able to view nearly 2,500 credit card numbers stored by 
      seven small e-commerce Web sites within a few minutes, using elementary 
      instructions provided by a source. In all cases, a list of customers and 
      all their personal information was connected to the Internet and either 
      was not password-protected or the password was viewable directly from the 
      Web site. 

      Credit card theft, a problem long lurking in the background of Internet 
      commerce, leaped to the top of consumers' minds earlier this month when a 
      computer intruder calling himself Maxus was able to break into CD 
      Universe's database of user credit cards. There's still speculation about 
      how he did it. But perhaps Maxus didn't have to work so hard. Last week, 
      MSNBC was able to view nearly 2,500 credit card numbers and other data 
      essentially by browsing e-commerce Web sites using a commercially 
      available database tool rather than a Web browser. Not only were the sites 
      storing the credit cards in plain text in a database connected to the Web 
      -- the databases were using the default user name and in some cases, no 
      password. 

      These basic security flaws were found by a legitimate Russian software 
      company named Strategy LLC, according to CEO Anatoliy Prokhorov, and 
      shared with MSNBC. He says he tried contacting some of the companies first 
      and got no response. "From our point of view this is just 
      unprofessionalism in a very high degree that's not explainable," Prokhorov 
      said. His company writes software that helps consumers compare prices 
      across multiple e-commerce sites, so his developers become familiar with 
      data structures at hundreds of e-commerce sites. He says they weren't 
      looking to find security flaws, but rather stumbled on these. "This is 
      just a hole we passed by, an open door. Our people were amazed." 

      But security experts were not. Given the speed required to succeed in the 
      fast-paced Internet economy, companies are in a big hurry to publish 
      working Web sites and often skimp on security measures. "This is a 
      microcosm of what's out there," said Elias Levy of SecurityFocus.com. 
      Levy's site was the first to report the CD Universe break-in last weekend. 
      "One could only imagine what they would have found if they were looking 
      for problems ... The problem is fairly widespread, and what Anatoliy has 
      found is a small snapshot." Prokhorov also contacted SecurityFocus.com 
      with his information, and the site today will issue its own report based 
      on its independent investigation. 

      The security flaws Prokhorov found involve more than just easy-to-steal 
      credit cards. At all seven sites, MSNBC was able to view a wide selection 
      of personal data including billing addresses, phone numbers and in some 
      cases, employee Social Security numbers. 

      Prokhorov sent the list and instructions to MSNBC on Tuesday. It included 
      about 20 Web sites which either had no password protection at all on their 
      database servers -- in each case, they were running Microsoft's SQL Server 
      software -- or had password information exposed on their Web site. 
      Connecting to all the sites was as simple as starting SQL Server and 
      opening a connection to the Web site. (Note: Microsoft is a partner in 
      MSNBC.) 

      Some of the sites didn't include personal information; they are not 
      included in this report. The others -- PMIWeb.com, Softwarecloseouts.com, 
      EPCdeals.com, Expressmicro.com, Computerparts.com, Directmicro.com and 
      Sharelogic.net -- were all contacted 24 hours before this story so they 
      could close the security hole. 

      While the flaws are obvious, assessing blame is a much more sticky 
      business. There's a mounting concern that small businesses are 
      particularly vulnerable to attack; many don't have computer experts on 
      staff. Other times, non-technically savvy business owners take lowball 
      bids from developers who promise a secure Web site but don't deliver. Then 
      there are inherent problems in software itself that make flaws more 
      likely. 

      In some cases, the server-side code underlying a Web page is viewable if a 
      browser places "::$DATA" at the end of the page's Web address. That code, 
      normally hidden, can contain any usernames, passwords and other 
      information about any computer connected to that server. This flaw was 
      revealed over two years ago and has since been patched. Four of the 
      vulnerable sites MSNBC found were hosted on the same Web server and had 
      not plugged this hole. 

      But even without knowing that technique, an intruder could have entered 
      the sites anyway -- the username required for entering the database was 
      the default "sa," which stands for "system administrator"; the password 
      was the name of the company. 

      "We used a developer, and obviously the developer didn't take that flaw 
      into consideration," said a spokesperson for the sites. "The flaw could 
      have lied within the software, but maybe the developer should have taken 
      that into consideration ... and one thing we didn't do, we didn't hire a 
      security company to come in and test our Web site." 

      Getting a second opinion when building an e-commerce site is a good idea, 
      said security expert Russ Cooper, who maintains the popular NTBugTraq 
      mailing list. "Make a condition of the contract that it has to pass 
      scrutiny of another individual who tests the site," Cooper recommended. 
      The fundamental problem, he said, is that developers have no liability for 
      flaws they leave behind in e-commerce sites. Merchants are responsible for 
      the cost of any stolen merchandise, while most developer contracts make 
      clear they are not responsible for what happens with a site they build. 
      "So a lot of people end up with a working site but not a secure site." The 
      other three vulnerable sites MSNBC visited simply used "sa" as the 
      username for their database, and no password. 

      Average consumers have no way of knowing how well-guarded their personal 
      information is when they submit it to a Web site. Levy said the problems 
      MSNBC found at these seven sites are hardly isolated. 

      "The blame falls on more than one person. You can't rush out to set up an 
      e-commerce site regardless of how much you want to make money... Many 
      people don't give (security) a second thought," he said. 

      One of the fundamental flaws in all these sites -- and, experts say, in 
      many other sites -- is the storing of private consumer information in the 
      first place. While encryption techniques that scramble the data are 
      available, it's often kept on a computer in plain text -- one step away 
      from the Internet. While that's more convenient, experts agree it's a bad 
      idea. "My advice is, if nothing else, don't store the data where it 
      physically has access to the Web," said Wesley Wilhelm, a fraud prevention 
      consultant at the Internet Fraud Prevention Advisory Council. "Take them 
      off every night and make a sneakernet run." 

      As for consumers, there isn't much they can do to ascertain how well a Web 
      site is guarding their personal information. Some experts suggest using 
      only one card online, and religiously checking credit card bills. While 
      consumers are liable for at most $50 of fraudulent purchases, they are 
      responsible for catching them and alerting their bank.

139.0 Good IDS article from Security Portal           
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Kurt Seifried, seifried@securityportal.com, for 
      http://www.securityportal.com/

      January 12, 2000 - Last week I did a general overview of IDS systems and 
      anti-virus software, and why they may not be the answer. Well in some 
      respects they aren't and in some they are. But I think the main issue is 
      the current model of intrusion detection (be it host or network based, 
      looking for bad packets or data in the case of anti-virus software) is 
      flawed (and the alternatives have a ways to go). Now to back up that 
      statement so I don't get flame roasted. 

      Problem 1) Basic performance problems (machine):

      Let's take a system like Network Flight Recorder for example (and don't 
      get me wrong, as current NIDS systems go, NFR is one of the best on the 
      market), NFR hoovers up all the traffic and can log it and compare it 
      against a set of rules (modules actually) to see if any matches known 
      attacks. NFR can also have multiple detection units that report to a 
      central authority, so you can detect scans more reliably. So like most 
      people you have a pretty diverse network, some Solaris, some Cisco, some 
      NT, and so on and so forth. If you want to detect as many attacks as 
      possible, you need to load all the modules available, resulting in slower 
      performance, because NFR is literally doing more stuff. This will also 
      result in the highest number of false positives, which will require you 
      to spend a lot of time "filtering" manually. You can of course reduce the 
      number of modules you need by not loading the ones that detect NetWare 
      specific attacks for example, the assumption being you have no NetWare 
      servers, or at least none accessible to the Internet. This can be a 
      problem because at some point you might attach a NetWare server to the 
      network in say your Internet DMZ, or (accidentally or otherwise) make an 
      existing internal NetWare server visible to the Internet. The other, 
      related problem, is that you might not load modules to detect attacks on 
      Radius servers (same assumption as the NetWare servers apply here), which 
      you might regret at some later point, very close to this is the idea of 
      removing modules for old attacks, that you have patched all your 
      applicable servers for. The problem basically boils down to the fact that 
      networks have a habit of changing, rather quickly, and new services, new 
      operating systems, and old bugs have a way of getting in without the 
      correct people being notified. To ensure you don't miss anything (as the 
      NFR admin), regular port sweeps using tools like nmap would be required 
      to make sure new machines don't pop up, or new services, this technique 
      of course is not infallible. 

      Problem 2) Basic performance problems (man):

      The man hours required to properly maintain and respond to an (N)IDS 
      system vary, most of it depends on how much traffic you monitor, and how 
      often you get attacked (so generally speaking bigger sites, higher 
      profile sites, and the like will generate more work). I also don't know 
      about you, but I don't want to spend 8 hours a day staring at packet 
      logs, trying to figure out what is hostile and what isn't (and then 
      responding to it). Even if all goes well and you detect an attack 
      successfully, the most you can do about it is to firewall the 
      perpetrator, and contact their network administrator, chances are the 
      attack was spoofed, or launched from a compromised machine (even if 99% 
      of hosts on the Internet are secure, that still leaves around 1 million 
      that aren't by today's numbers). Unlike the physical world, where most 
      people (criminals being a subset of people) can't afford to hop on a jet 
      plane, scoot over to Australia, rattle a few doorknobs in the hopes that 
      one is open and rob the place, the Internet allows just that. The problem 
      of "false positives" is made worse by the number of low level attackers 
      (known as "script kiddies") seems to be increasing, largely due to the 
      propensity of free UNIX platforms (*BSD, Linux), hacking tools (Bugtraq, 
      rootshell), and Internet access (especially high speed access like ADSL 
      and cable). This will only continue for the foreseeable future, I don't 
      know when or where it will level off (or start to decline for that 
      matter) but I don't think it will be anytime soon. 

      Problem 3) The intelligence solutions (beyond man and machine):

      So if machines can't do the job too well (separating the wheat from the 
      chaff), and humans are too expensive, the obvious alternative (well maybe 
      not obvious) is to get the machines to behave more like people (or living 
      organisms at all for that matter). The immune system is an amazing piece 
      of work. With only rudimentary "intelligence" it manages to keep you 
      relatively safe from known threats, but even more interestingly, it 
      manages to adapt quickly to new threats (it doesn't always work 
      perfectly, AIDS for example seems to be able to avoid the immune system 
      by disabling it). So why not build a piece of software that emulates 
      this, and use it to detect attacks? Well this is exactly what some people 
      have been working on (in other fields as well, such as anti-virus 
      software). One such result (from the Computer Immune Systems project at 
      the University of New Mexico) is stide, which runs on several UNIX 
      platforms and is available for free. Each TCP connection is represented 
      by a compressed 49 bit string that represents a connection (IP from, IP 
      to, port to, 80 bits of information in all). Speaking (in simplified 
      terms) stide monitors the network and builds a list of ok traffic (known 
      as "self"), and as these connections are seen more often they "mature". 
      Once stide has a good picture of "self" it can compare all traffic (in 
      the form of the 49 bit identifier) against its "self" (the known good 
      traffic), and decide whether or not it is legitimate. Now this wouldn't 
      work too well since if during the time you spent monitoring your 
      webserver, only the people that connected would be allowed in the future, 
      so stide does not match the entire string, rather it only requires 12 of 
      the 49 bits to match. This sounds promising, but the real kicker is that 
      in their tests, stide did a remarkably good job of identifying attempted 
      intrusions, but more importantly the number of false positives was 
      relatively low (compared to tradition (N)IDS systems). 

      So what's the catch to stide? Well it seems it requires a large amount of 
      CPU time, and doesn't scale terribly well, but this may not be an 
      incredibly large problem. By installing the stide software on all hosts 
      the load is distributed (the host only monitors its own traffic), and 
      generally speaking most hosts do not communicate with too many other 
      hosts, or in the case of servers, tend to communicate with only a few 
      protocols (such as ftp), making the list of "self" relatively short. This 
      also eliminates the single point of failure possible with current (N)IDS 
      systems, but more importantly, assuming software packages like stide 
      mature and actually are viable, each machine (metaphorically speaking) 
      will take care of itself, and require a minimum of human intervention.

      The future?

      In any case there are other organizations working on similar solutions to 
      similar problems, the most notable being IBM. IBM is developing an 
      anti-virus system where computers running the software will identify 
      potentially dangerous pieces of software, and send them to a central site 
      to be analyzed, if it turns out to be a virus the system will be able to 
      generate a countermeasure for it (typically a virus signature, and a 
      removal process) and distribute it to all the machines running this 
      software. This solves all the major current problems with anti-virus 
      software (that I covered on the 5th of Jan, 2000), and makes for a much 
      more effective response (of course the virus writers might start 
      attacking the central site(s) in order to help their new viruses spread). 
      This system won't be available for several years most likely, but as 
      various pieces of it come online, network administrators (with the money 
      to afford it) will benefit.

      Network Intrusion Detection Systems and Virus Scanners - are they the 
      answer?

      Kurt Seifried, seifried@seifried.org, for http://www.securityportal.com/

      January 5, 2000 - It takes a lot less effort to destroy and break things, 
      than it takes to build and fix them. This is nowhere more evident then 
      computer networks. Corporations, governments, universities and other 
      organizations spend large sums of money on computer network 
      infrastructure, and the cost of keeping them running is not trivial. And 
      this doesn't even take into consideration malicious attacks and security 
      controls which add even more cost to building and maintaining a network 
      of computers. Unfortunately for most of us, the desktop is Microsoft 
      centric, which means most of us can't do a whole lot to it to make it 
      more secure. If you run Windows 95 or 98 you get no file permissions (and 
      hence the computer has absolutely minimal protection from hostile acts), 
      if you run Windows NT 4.0 Server or Workstation the default settings are 
      full control for everyone for all files on the system, and registry keys 
      (fixing this takes a long time, and will break some applications). Let's 
      assume for a minute you have fully locked down the machines, users cannot 
      modify them, they are physically secure, and so on, are you secure? No. 
      New problems for various operating systems are made public all the time, 
      these range from minor security issues to full blown "take control of the 
      machine remotely and do what you want with it". Also, due to the single 
      user oriented nature of Windows there exists a whole class of malicious 
      software called viruses, which typically consist of some code to exploit 
      a program or system bug, a replication mechanism, and possibly some 
      additional software that ranges from annoying to destructive. What are 
      network and systems administrators to do in such an increasingly hostile 
      world?

      Anti-virus software

      Entire classes of software with literally hundreds (ok, maybe not 
      hundreds but a lot) of companies producing products have sprung up over 
      the last few years, and is now beginning to consolidate into several 
      large companies providing complete product lines to cover everything you 
      could want, and dozens of medium to small sized companies with sometimes 
      just one main product. Of this the anti-virus software vendors were one 
      of the original groups of vendors to start writing add-on software to 
      enhance the security (which was non-existent on Microsoft platforms at 
      the time) available for ensuring software that you used was not 
      malicious. This has lead to an "arm's race" (apologies for using this but 
      it is a decent analogy) between virus software writers, and anti-virus 
      vendors. Most anti-virus software packages started out as simple programs 
      that checked the files against a known list of "bad" ones (i.e. via 
      checksum and so forth), which lead to polymorphic viruses (that is the 
      software would modify itself a little bit each time, thus defeating this 
      detection technique). The anti-virus vendors then started scanning the 
      actual binary code for the various pieces of code present in viruses, and 
      heuristic packages that supposedly figure out what the software will do, 
      and based on that can block it if it is considered malicious (if this 
      worked properly though we wouldn't be needing anymore virus signature 
      updates now would we?). Additionally things have gotten more complicated, 
      with the integration of anti-virus software with such services as email, 
      www and ftp. A small list of "new" problems with anti-virus software that 
      have come out in the last few months:

      
      compression of the virus with a little used compression algorithm 
      successfully fooled most anti-virus packages (this was fixed in most of 
      them) 

      compression of the virus with some XOR'ing of the data, successfully 
      fooled most anti-virus packages 

      storing the virus in directories not scanned by the anti-virus software, 
      such as "Recycle bin" in windows (user can configure the software to scan 
      that directory usually) 

      exploitation of various buffer overflows in software packages like 
      Outlook so that the virus is run without the user actually being asked if 
      they want to save or run the attachment (fixed) 

      usage of system calls and software in Windows, such as having Outlook 
      email everyone in your address book a copy of the virus 

      addition of some characters to the attached file successfully fooled 
      email anti-virus packages

      That's all I could find from the last month or two of Bugtraq. Obviously 
      the anti-virus vendors have a ways to go before their products can even 
      be called remotely reliable. The last dozen or so viruses that spread via 
      email have all left the anti-virus vendor community flat footed, the 
      Melissa virus (which was relatively harmless) resulted in several large 
      sites (Microsoft, Intel, etc.) shutting down the mail servers (and in 
      some cases it overwhelmed mail servers causing them to be effectively 
      shut down). 

      It is obvious that anti-virus vendors will always be playing catch-up 
      with the virus writers, which wouldn't be such a problem if anti-virus 
      software updates were released quickly and people installed them. This is 
      however impossible. The life cycle of a virus looks something like:

      1. 
          virus is written, tested, possibly deployed on a test network 
      (computers are cheap now) and otherwise honed 2. virus is released, 
      possibly on a selected target (university campus, corporate network, 
      etc.) 3. virus (if "successful" in a biological sense) spreads like 
      wildfire, possibly causing severe damage (such as wiping motherboard BIOS 
      chips) 4. someone notices the strange activity, takes whatever data is 
      left over, and sends it to an anti-virus vendor - this is the first point 
      at which people start taking corrective steps, the virus has already had 
      time to spread 5. the virus is analyzed, decompiled, and otherwise ripped 
      apart, a signature is created 6. typically the anti-virus vendor will 
      share data with other competitors, they may or may not do this promptly 
      7. the anti-virus vendors issue bulletins, make the update (if one exists 
      yet) available 8. some customers with support contracts and so on will be 
      notified, some will have automated distribution systems for the update, 
      resulting in a rapid deployment of the fix, most will not 9. network and 
      system administrators, home users, and so on possibly read the advisory 
      or hear about the virus on CNN, they get the update (which can be near 
      impossible during peak times) and install it

      During steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and up till 6 the virus will spread unchecked. 
      Once an update is created and distributed the virus will only spread to 
      systems without protection (a good sized percentage). The amount of 
      effort it takes to install software on millions of computers is 
      horrendous, even when heavily automated, compared to the amount of effort 
      a virus author spends, the ROI (return on investment) can be significant. 

      Intrusion detection software

      Directly related to anti-virus software is intrusion detection software 
      (sometimes refereed to as IDS or NIDS). I'm going to start with a brief 
      explanation of the various intrusion software technologies and types 
      since they overlap and can be somewhat convoluted. As a rule of thumb the 
      software has to run on a computer system (that's a pretty safe rule for 
      most software packages actually), and this machine can either be 
      dedicated to the task of monitoring the network and other systems, or the 
      software can be an additional component that runs on a production server. 

      

      For example we have NFR (Network Flight Recorder) which is an entirely 
      network based system, you have one or more collection machines (a 
      dedicated box, either an appliance system or something you have built 
      yourself), which analyze data, and can funnel it all to a central 
      collection point (allowing you to more easily detect distributed attacks 
      and see patterns of activity). Then there are a variety of products that 
      are loaded onto client machines and report to a central machine via SNMP 
      (or some other protocol), which analyses the data and looks for attacks 
      and so forth, and in between the two are some hybrid systems. As with 
      anti-virus software vendors a major problem with (N)IDS systems is the 
      time frame between when an attack is discovered, and when the (N)IDS 
      systems are updated to detect and react to it accordingly (the life cycle 
      is pretty much identical to that of a virus's life cycle).

      The next major differentiation is how active a role the software will 
      take when it detects an event, for example some systems can be set to 
      lock out a host computer if it appears hostile, whereas some will simply 
      compare files against signatures to see if they have changed or not and 
      generate a report (and the extreme of this would be forsenic software 
      used "after the fact" to try and determine what happened). This leads to 
      one of the fundamental problems of intrusion detection systems. These 
      systems are typically heavily automated, and sometimes make use of neural 
      networks, artificial intelligence and other techniques in an effort to 
      make them more accurate and useful. If you set the detection threshold 
      too low you will detect more events, resulting in a large number of false 
      alarms, and wasted effort. If you set the detection threshold too high 
      you run the risk of missing events that might prove critical to continued 
      operations (a.k.a. a bad person might get in and delete all your archived 
      .... research data). In an effort to get the best of both worlds (low 
      detection threshold, with a minimum of false alarms, and no important 
      events missed) the systems make heavy use of rule sets, content based 
      analysis, and so forth. Unfortunately even the best of these systems are 
      far from perfect. In addition to this you have to act on events, 
      monitoring the network and generating a detailed report of attacks, which 
      is useless if you do not use it constructively. Again we discover a 
      fundamental problem, if you give control up to the computer there is a 
      good chance an attacker will be able to abuse it and possibly circumvent 
      it, whereas if you have a human respond to each event the cost and time 
      involved would be prohibitive. 

      Striking a balance between a low detection threshold and a high one, in 
      addition to letting either the computer handle it, or a human is a 
      critical process (it is not a single decision, since you should be 
      evaluating results constantly and fine tuning it). The same applies to 
      anti-virus software, you want to get the updates to the machines as fast 
      as possible, which means automation where possible, however there are 
      some basic issues that can severely delay the time between a virus 
      rampaging around networks, and a successful counter to it. Even if you 
      have instantaneous updates of your anti-virus software and intrusion 
      detection systems, there is still a timeframe in which you can be 
      successfully attacked. But this doesn't make anti-virus software and 
      intrusion detection systems worthless, far from it. Security is about 
      risk management and risk minimization, often within a budget and time 
      constraints (few organizations can write a blank check as far as computer 
      security is concerned). The real question is will the ROI (return on 
      investment) be worthwhile, e.g. armed security guards at every 
      workstation to make sure no-one tampers with them would be nice, but not 
      terribly cost effective.

      In addition to this there are intrusion detection software packages that 
      only detect an attack after the fact, such as tripwire. This is however 
      not as useless as it would seem at first blush (someone stole all the 
      silverware, guess we should buy a new set). A part of all security 
      incidents is discovering the scope of the problem (did they only get into 
      one machine, or did they get into a few hundred?), and tools like 
      tripwire can make this task much more easy (in fact some vendors are now 
      shipping integrity checking software that can be loaded onto a bootable 
      floppy so you can get a very secure snapshot of the system that you can 
      compare securely, of course it requires a server reboot). 

      Conclusion

      Computer security doesn't come in nice shrink wrapped box for $99.95 
      (after a $50 rebate). Computer security is an ongoing process, with 
      constant re-evaluation and changes, as new threats and solutions are 
      released, you need to be able to react to them effectively. Ideally 
      vendors would ship software that was not susceptible to viruses (this is 
      possible), nor susceptible to user/network/random events resulting in 
      improper operation (like giving someone a root shell remotely). This 
      isn't going to happen for along time however (although there is a variety 
      of hardening software becoming available). 

      Anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems (passive and active) 
      are all part of a healthy security policy implementation. Any security 
      plan implementation, when properly done will require some degree of human 
      intervention. If possible you should dedicate people to the task, and 
      possibly have them fulfill other optional duties (like evaluating new 
      software for possible future use). If the people you have tasked are 
      responsible for support, chances are they will spend the majority of 
      their time running around and putting out fires instead of preventing a 
      massive firestorm.

      Win2000 security hole a 'major threat'

      Six banks and three major PC makers are
      affected by a bug that lets attackers view
      files stored on Microsoft Index Server.
      Microsoft issues patch.



      By David Raikow, Sm@rt Reseller
      UPDATED February 1, 2000 9:37 AM PT 


      Windows 2000 is not scheduled for release until Feb.
      17, but Microsoft has already released the first patch
      affecting the long-awaited operating system. 

      The patch, released by Microsoft on Wednesday, repairs
      two different security bugs in Microsoft Index Server, the
      more egregious of which allows hackers to view files
      stored on a target Web server. Index Server is an add-on
      to Windows NT 4.0 and is built into Windows 2000 (in the
      form of Indexing Services). Index Server provides
      developers with Active Scripting and query management
      capabilities. 

      The more dangerous of the two problems, dubbed the
      "Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument Vulnerability" by
      Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), was spotted by David
      Litchfield of Cerberus Information Security on Jan. 17 and
      immediately reported to Microsoft security. The bug
      allows attackers to view files stored on a target Web
      server and represents a major threat, according to
      Litchfield. 

      "Of course, ideally you make sure there's no sensitive
      data on your Web server, but this can be incredibly
      difficult," Litchfield said. 

      "A lot of servers have account passwords and user
      names on them. Even under the best of circumstances
      you can end up with account information and sometimes
      credit card numbers stored in temporary files on the
      server. You should clear those files out regularly, but you
      still end up with a 'race condition' where attackers can try
      to grab them before they're erased." 

      Microsoft: It's all serious
      "It's not for us to assess the seriousness of this problem,
      because we take all security risks seriously," said
      Microsoft Security Manager Scott Culp. "The important
      thing now is that the patch is out, and that it fixes the
      problem. All of our customers should check out our
      security site." 

      However, Litchfield's investigation of the bug suggests
      that the majority of Windows-based servers are at risk. 

      He confirmed that at least six banks and three major
      computer manufacturers were affected by the bug. 

      "The problem is that Index Server is active by default, so
      most people don't even realize they've got it on. Even if
      they see an MS alert, they're probably not going to
      realize that it applies to them," Litchfield said. 

      Culp acknowledged that many users may have the Index
      Server active without realizing it. 

      "Of course, from a security perspective, you shouldn't
      offer any services you don't use," Culp said. "We want to
      make sure our customers are educated about this, and
      that they are aware of which services they have active
      and how to disable what they don't need. We've also
      given Windows 2000 tighter defaults and made it much
      easier to configure." 

      Second bug relatively minor
      The second of the two bugs allows an intruder to access
      information about the targeted network, but it is
      considered relatively minor. Although several specialists
      assert that this problem has been publicly discussed for
      several months, Culp stated that Microsoft only became
      aware of it within the past two weeks. 

      According to Culp, both of these problems were
      discovered too late to be fixed in the shipping version of
      Windows 2000. 

      "These came to our attention in mid-January, and
      Windows 2000 went out to OEMs and many customers
      Dec. 15. It's a shipping product, and we're supporting as
      any other shipping product." 

      Microsoft released to manufacturing Windows 2000 on
      Dec. 15 and delivered it to hardware makers and some
      other key partners on that date. Large customers and
      developers received the gold code in early- to
      mid-January. 

      The product will be available through retail starting 
      Feb. 17.

141.0 New hack attack is greater threat than imagined
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by Dragos Ruiu 

      http://www.theregister.co.uk/000127-000005.html?&_ref=1188363377
 
      
      New hack attack is greater threat than imagined
 
      It was news a month ago; days later it vanished. The mainstream press may 
      have forgotten it, but security      specialists gathered in California 
      last week for the sixth RSA Conference to consider the growing trend in 
      malicious computer assaults called distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
      attacks. 
 
      Using tools called trin00 and tribe flood network (TFN), intruders can 
      commandeer hundreds, possibly      thousands, of separate, unsuspecting 
      clients to launch a flood which can bring a network down in a torrent of 
      packets all appearing to come from different sources, making it impossible 
      to identify the origin. 
 
      Dealing with this sort of assault can be maddening for the primary victim. 
      The clients from which the      attack is launched are themselves 
      intermediate victims who rarely know that their systems have been 
      compromised. They are in diverse locations around the world, administered 
      by people who speak different languages, making it nearly impossible for 
      one victim to explain to another how to cope with the threat. 
 
      Security experts are not optimistic. The tools do not require an intruder 
      to gain root access to a system,      but can be uploaded via a number of 
      simpler exploits, many of which can be scripted to run automatically, and 
      even multi-threaded to run very, very fast. Finding weak systems to use as 
      clients for a distributed attack is neither difficult nor prohibitively 
      time consuming. 
 
      More ominously, DSL and cable modems, which remain connected around the 
      clock, make it possible to      launch attacks through the growing number 
      of private Linux boxes now online. 
 
      "We've already seen these attacks coming through Linux boxes," ISCA 
      Director of Research Services      David Kennedy told The Register. "And 
      there's no reason why it can't be ported to the Win-32 [operating system]," 
      he added. 
 
      To further complicate matters, merely killing the process during a 
      distributed flood attack is not adequate      to end it. So long as the 
      hundreds of clients remain infected, an attack can be resumed, Kennedy 
      says. We note that communicating with the owners and administrators of 
      hundreds of compromised clients, and gaining their cooperation, would be 
      virtually impossible. The victim is, for all practical purposes, at the 
      mercy of the attacker. 
 
      The FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) has developed an 
      application to detect the      malicious tools, though the first indication 
      that they've been installed will usually be a phone call from a frantic 
      sysadmin trying desperately to block the onslaught of packet traffic. We 
      say 'phone call' because a distributed attack capitalises on so much 
      bandwidth from so many sources that it literally overwhelms entire 
      networks. Under those circumstances, e-mail is hardly going to work. 
 
      An ISP can turn off the attack, provided its administrators are well enough 
      acquainted with the problem;      but there again, nothing can stop an 
      attacker from firing up his hundreds of compromised clients hours or days 
      later if he chooses. 
 
      It gets worse; most of the more obvious defences are problematic. For 
      example, a firewall configured to      catch a distributed flood attack 
      would also interrupt such utility functions as ping and traceroute, which 
      are commonly used by administrators and power users, Kennedy noted. 
 
      The tools are in constant development within the hacker underground; new 
      and better versions are      released regularly. Most worrying is a shift 
      to scripted attacks which allow unsophisticated users, such as bored 
      teenagers, half-assed hacker wannabes and clueless script kiddies to launch 
      them. 
 
      The tools are getting more powerful, slicker and easier to use. Defences 
      are not. Defences require the      infected clients, not the end victims, 
      to take action. Human nature being what it is, we reckon the end victims 
      are pretty well on their own. 
 
      The NIPC offers an unsettling insight: "Possible motives for this malicious 
      activity include....preparation for      widespread denial of service 
      attacks." 
 
      We wonder what "widespread" means here. If one malicious hacker can exploit 
      hundreds of clients      worldwide and retain them for repeated abuse, what 
      might a hundred accomplish? 
 
      And what effect might that have? Could enough bandwidth be gobbled up to 
      crash large portions of the      Net? Could ISPs be overwhelmed for hours, 
      even days? Could infrastructure be at risk? The NIPC refuses to say, but 
      our imaginations are very much stimulated by the possibilities. And we 
      reckon yours ought to be as well. ®

      NSA Confirms `Serious Computer Problem'
      W A S H I N G T O N, Jan. 29 - The super-secret National Security Agency 
      confirmed tonight that it had a "serious computer problem" last week that 
      affected its ability to process intelligence information. The agency 
      issued a brief statement a few hours after the outage was reported by 
      ABCNEWS. Sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure 
      in the history of the NSA. From Monday night until late Thursday, 
      computers at Fort Meade, just outside Washington, were unable to process 
      the millions of communications intercepts flowing in from around the world 
      via a series of U.S. satellites. The statement said the agency "is 
      currently operating within the window of normal operations." NSA Director 
      Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden told ABCNEWS that the system has been 
      almost totally rebuilt in the past five days, although it is not quite 
      fully up yet. Officials said it did not appear to be sabotage, just a 
      computer system overwhelmed trying to digest data. 

      $1.5 Million Problem        The NSA said it took thousands of man-hours 
      and some $1.5 million to get the computers up and running again at the 
      agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. As a result of the 
      unprecedented blackout of information, analytical reports from Fort Meade 
      that turn intercepted foreign telephone, cable and radio messages into 
      meaningful data for the rest of government, were halted. "This problem ... 
      did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the processing of 
      intelligence information," the statement said. "The backlog of 
      intelligence processing is almost complete, and NSA is confident that no 
      significant intelligence information has been lost." The Washington Post 
      quoted one official describing the outage as a "software anomaly." "As of 
      now, there is no evidence other than this was a system stressed to meet 
      day-to-day operational pressures," the paper quoted the official as 
      saying. 

      Dangerous Times        This was an especially dangerous time for something 
      like this to happen. The system uses the data to track terrorists, among 
      other things, including suspected ringleader Osama bin Laden - monitoring 
      them, issuing warnings and keeping the United States one step ahead. "This 
      problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex at Fort 
      Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the 
      processing of intelligence information," the agency statement said. "NSA 
      systems were impacted for 72 hours." "Contingency plans were immediately 
      put into effect that called on other aspects of the NSA system to assume 
      some of the load," the agency statement said. "While intelligence 
      collection continued, NSA technicians worked to recover the IT 
      (information technology) infrastructure. That backlog of intelligence 
      processing is almost complete and NSA is confident that no significant 
      intelligence information has been lost." The latest incident follows the 
      failure of a critical U.S. spy satellite system on New Year's Eve, the 
      most significant known casualty of the Year 2000 computer glitch (see 
      related story). 

      `No Such Agency'        Until a few years ago, the National Security 
      Agency - known around Washington as "No Such Agency" - was so secret there 
      was no public acknowledgment by the government of its existence and 
      employees could be disciplined for merely saying they worked there. It 
      specializes in electronic intelligence gathering through satellites, 
      telephone intercepts and other methods. The Defense Department 
      acknowledged earlier this month that it made mistakes in its pre-New 
      Year's Eve testing of a Y2K correction for a computer system that 
      processes imagery from intelligence satellites. The computer system broke 
      down that night, interrupting the flow of by satellite information for 
      several hours. However, the Pentagon insisted the trouble did not 
      jeopardize U.S. national security.

      fprintf(stderr, "Please read the License Agreement in rz.doc\r\n");
      fflush(stderr);
      }

      This change was detected because the FreeBSD ports system uses an MD5
      checksum to verify the integrity of downloaded software - the rzsz.zip
      file has a habit of changing regularly, and after one such change this
      addition was discovered.
      
      Thanks for Marcin Cieslak <saper@system.pl> for identifying this problem.
      The rzsz port has since been removed from the FreeBSD ports collection :-)

      Web Probe Widens, Clinton Calls Internet Summit


                                        Updated 10:23 PM ET February 11, 2000

     By Dick Satran

     SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. investigators tracking hackers who shut down 
     top Web sites turned their focus to the sites used to launch the attacks on 
     Friday as President Clinton      called a summit on Internet security for 
     next week.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation was backtracking through sites that 
     were penetrated and used as "zombies" to hit others.

     The agency, at a briefing this week, underscored the importance of 
     "unwitting third parties" used to conceal themselves by launching massive 
     coordinated attacks on the top e-commerce      sites.

     The University of California-Santa Barbara said that its computer system 
     was used to aim an attack at the CNN Web site brought down in the week's 
     wave of Internet sabotage, a      spokesman said Friday.

     The university said it was providing details to the FBI for the 
     investigation.

     "ZOMBIE" ATTACKER FOUND

     In Palo Alto, meanwhile, computer security company Network Associates Inc 
     (NETA.O) said it had located another one of the "zombies" used to launch 
     the attacks -- a computer in      Germany which has since been disconnected 
     from the Internet.

     But while the university and the security firm stepped forward, computer 
     experts said scores more remained silent, fearing legal action or 
     involvement in costly criminal probes.

     "People want to stay out of the way," said Stuart McClure, president of the 
     Irvine, California-based Ramparts Security Group. "People are real 
     sensitive about these issues -- they think the      perception would be 
     negative."

     Perceptions of Internet security took another hit on Friday when a small 
     California Internet company said an unrelated hacker attack on its system 
     this week had apparently gained access      to consumer credit card 
     numbers.

     RealNames, a San Carlos, California, business, said the extent of the 
     damage was hard to assess because the attack had come through mainland 
     China, and the connection appeared to      have shut down while the hackers 
     were downloading data.

     "Our best guess is that this was done by a traditional hacker, whose goal 
     is not to steal but to prove that he has the ability to steal," said 
     RealNames chief executive Keith Teare, whose      company sells a 
     simplified Internet address system to about 50,000 customers.

     In Washington, Clinton's summit is expected to boost broader cooperation in 
     a young industry that's growing fast and hasn't made security a high 
     priority. The industry, in turn, wants to      give advice to federal 
     regulators seen as too unsophisticated in Web ways to have much impact.

     Clinton warned not to expect Tuesday's meeting to come up with an 
     "instantaneous solution" to a wave of hacking attacks which this week took 
     down popular sites Yahoo!, the largest      independent Web site, leading 
     retailers Buy.com, eBay, Amazon.com and the news site CNN.com.

     While computer security has often vexed individual computer users linked to 
     the Internet, major Web sites have been hit only by sporadic outages, and 
     nothing like the chaos of the past      week.

     BROADER COOPERATION

     The U.C.-Santa Barbara report was one of the first to indicate that the 
     hackers' tracks were slowly being uncovered.

     FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman refused to comment on the UC-Santa Barbara 
     report. She said no search or arrest warrants had yet been issued in 
     connection with the investigation.

     At the university, spokesman Bill Schlotter said a climate of academic 
     freedom left facilities vulnerable.

     "We're a university, and you want the keep your system open for students 
     and faculty, but you want it to be secure. How do you do both?" he asked.

     The wave of hacker attacks prompted little surprise in either the computer 
     security industry or the hacker community. The attacks have relied on 
     easy-to-find tools available over the      Internet, and sites with poor 
     security to use as their staging areas.

     Those "third party" sites are the ones -- not the large ones suffering the 
     attacks -- that the FBI cited as the biggest security risks.

     "All these littler sites are worried about is getting their site up and 
     then the Webmaster is in charge, and there is no attention paid at all to 
     security," said one hacker, known as YTCracker,      interviewed by 
     Reuters. "Usually, it doesn't take anything to get in."

145.0 ISN: Who gets your trust?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Source: ISN list
      
      Who gets your trust? 

      Security breaches can come from those you least suspect 

           Summary Systems administrators have extraordinary access to all the 
           data on corporate systems. What can be done to ensure that your 
           administrators will not betray that trust? (3,000words) 



        In the business world you will often hear the statement "We don't hire 
        hackers." When pressed for a reason, the speaker usually reveals a fear 
        that a "hacker" will install a back door in the system. Time and time 
        again, however, I have seen back doors installed by employees or 
        security professionals whose integrity is never questioned. When 
        confronted, they usually say it's no big deal. After all, they have the 
        root password. They just wanted to set up a root account with a 
        different environment. That's not hacking, right? Wrong. Their intention 
        did not matter -- the security of the system has been bypassed. 

      This article discusses how administrative privileges can be abused and 
      suggests some methods for countering that abuse. It is not meant to imply 
      that every administrator abuses privileges or has malicious intent -- just 
      that you shouldn't assume anything. 

      What is a back door? Quite simply, a back door is a method for gaining 
      access to a system that bypasses the usual security mechanisms. (Has 
      everyone seen WarGames?) Programmers and administrators love to stick back 
      doors in so they can access the system quickly to fix problems. Usually, 
      they rely on obscurity to provide security. Think of approaching a 
      building with an elaborate security system that does bio scans, background 
      checks, the works. Someone who doesn't have time to go through all that 
      might just rig up a back exit so they can step out for a smoke -- and then 
      hope no one finds out about it. 

      In computer systems, a back door can be installed on a terminal server to 
      provide direct access to the console remotely, saving the administrator a 
      trip to the office. It can also be a program set up to invoke system 
      privileges from a nonprivileged account. 

      A simple back door is an account set up in the /etc/passwd file that looks 
      like any other userid. The difference is that this userid doesn't have to 
      su to root (and it won't show up in /var/adm/sulog) -- it already is root: 

      auser:x:0:101:Average User :/home/auser:/bin/ksh 

      If you don't see it, look again at the third field (userid) and compare it 
      to the root account. They are the same (0). If you are restricting direct 
      root logins to the console only (via /etc/default/login), then this 
      account will have the same limitation. The difference is that if someone 
      does su to this account, it will not be apparent in /var/adm/sulog that it 
      is root. Also, a change to the root password will not affect the account. 
      Even if the person who installed the account intends no harm, he or she 
      has left a security hole. 

      It is also pretty common for an administrator to abuse the /.rhosts file 
      by putting in desktop systems "temporarily." These have a way of becoming 
      permanent. 

      Back doors can also be set up in subtler ways though SUID 0 programs 
      (which set the userid to root). Usually, the motivation for setting up 
      back doors is one of expediency. The administrator is just trying to get a 
      job done as quickly as possible. Problems arise later when either (1) he 
      leaves under normal circumstances and the hole remains or (2) he leaves 
      under bad circumstances and wants revenge. 

      Proprietary data A manager may also be reluctant to hire "hackers" for 
      fear that they may divulge proprietary information or take copies of 
      proprietary data. Several years ago, I was consulting at a company when a 
      new administrator joined the group. In an effort to ingratiate himself 
      with the team, he confided that he had kept the backup tapes from his old 
      job (a competitor) and that they had some "really cool tools." It so 
      happened that a consultant with my own business worked at the competitor's 
      site. A scan of the tape revealed the proprietary software that the 
      administrator had been working on, which eventually sold for a significant 
      amount of money. While the admin probably did not intend to steal the 
      software, his actions could have left his new employer facing a large 
      lawsuit -- all for the sake of a few shell scripts. In this particular 
      case, no one believed that the administrator had any ulterior motives. I 
      wonder if people would have felt that way if he had been a "known hacker"? 

      System monitoring Administrators are supposed to monitor system logs. How 
      else can problems be investigated? But there is a difference between 
      monitoring logs for a legitimate reason and monitoring them to satisfy 
      prurient curiosity. Using the system log files to monitor a particular 
      user's behavior for no good reason is an abuse of privileges. 

      What is a good reason? Your manager asks you to monitor specific logs. Or 
      maybe you notice suspicious activities, in which case you should inform 
      the management. Or, more commonly, a user complains about a problem and 
      you are trying to solve it. What is a bad reason? A user ticks you off and 
      you want to see how he is spending company time. Or a user has a prominent 
      position in the company and you want to know what kinds of Websites she 
      goes to. 

      Countermeasures You can take some actions to ensure the integrity of 
      privileged users, but none of them carries any guarantee. 

      Background checks You can have an investigative agency run a background 
      check on an individual and you can require drug tests. These tell you only 
      about past behavior (if the individual has been caught). 

      The state of New Jersey (where I live) has adopted a law commonly referred 
      to as Megan's Law (see Resources). The law mandates that a community be 
      notified of any convicted sex offender living in the community. On the 
      surface, it sounds like a great idea and a way to protect children from 
      predators. 

      As a parent, I am particularly sensitive to crimes against children. I 
      received a Megan's Law notification this past year about a convicted sex 
      offender who moved into town. It did not change a thing for me. My feeling 
      is that every child molester has to have had a first time and that in any 
      case not all molesters have been identified. Therefore, I take appropriate 
      precautions with my children, regardless of who has moved to the area. 

      In the technical field, hackers are considered the molesters. (Yes, I know 
      all about the politically correct terms cracker, defacer, etc., but the 
      common term these days is hacker.) How do you know if someone is a 
      "hacker"? Some people try to refine the term to mean "someone who has been 
      convicted of a computer crime." But let's say, for example, that you 
      attend Defcon, the hackers' conference, and encounter an intelligent job 
      seeker with bright blue hair and funky clothes. Would you hire him? 
      Chances are that you would at least scrutinize his credentials and make 
      sure your contract spelled out all details of the work to be performed and 
      the legal repercussions for any violations. What if the same person showed 
      up for an interview with the blue dye rinsed out and in a nice pressed 
      suit? Be honest: would you perform the same background checks regardless 
      of a person's appearance? 

      Technical measures Some technical software packages can limit or control 
      superuser privileges. I recommend using them to prevent the inadvertent 
      abuse of superuser privilege. Unfortunately, knowledgeable administrators 
      and programmers with privileged access will be able to circumvent these 
      measures if they really want to. 

           sudo The freely available sudo package provides more granular control 
           over the system by restricting which privileged commands can be run 
           on a user basis. See Resources for the Sudo main page, which has a 
           more complete description. 

           Tripwire Tripwire is a file integrity package that, following the 
           policy determined by the administrator, reports any changes made to 
           critical files. Tripwire was originally developed at Purdue 
           University by Gene Kim under the direction of Eugene Spafford. I plan 
           to evaluate the merits of the commercial version of Tripwire in a 
           future column. Tripwire is a good way for an administrator to tell 
           whether the system files or permissions have been modified. 

           What can be done, however, if the senior administrator who monitors 
           the system has malicious intent? 

      Professionalism The best defense against the abuse of administrator 
      privileges is to rely on a certain level of professionalism. The medical 
      Hippocratic oath includes the mandate Do No Harm. While there is no such 
      professional oath for systems administrators, you can establish guidelines 
      for acceptable behavior. During the mid-1980s, I worked as an 
      administrator in a computer center at a large telecommunications research 
      facility. We had a code of ethics that a user had to sign before an 
      account could be installed. We also had a code of ethics for privileged 
      users that included additional restrictions, such as: 

           No SUID 0 (set userid to root) programs will be installed without the 
           consent, in writing, of the senior administrator. 

           All users' email is to be considered private and confidential and may 
           not be read by anyone other than the intended recipient. 

           Users' files may not be modified or read except in the case of a 
           predetermined problem or security investigation. Be prepared to 
           justify. 

           Privileged users are often entrusted with sensitive information, such 
           as an employee termination, before other employees. This information 
           is to be kept confidential. 

           The root passwords are changed monthly and are to be distributed by 
           the senior administrator only. The passwords must be kept in a safe 
           location, such as your wallet. If the password is lost, notify the 
           senior administrator or your manager immediately. 

           Keystroke monitoring of user activities is strictly prohibited 
           without senior management approval, in writing. 

           All administrative procedures and tools are to be considered 
           proprietary information and are the property of the computer center. 

           Tape archives may not be removed from the facility without written 
           approval. 

      Discretion A code of ethics for privileged users should not be considered 
      a punitive device, but rather a statement about the integrity of the 
      person who signs it. At one point during my years in the computer center, 
      the secretary to the president of the company came to me with a printer 
      problem. As I was assisting her, she became upset when she realized that 
      the test job she had sent to the printer was highly confidential. I was 
      able to reassure her that all administrators were bound by a code of 
      ethics and would be terminated for violations. (Besides, I wasn't really 
      reading it, I was just looking for garbage characters!) Professionals must 
      establish a certain level of trust. This is especially important for those 
      privy to sensitive information regarding terminations or investigations. 

      Final thoughts Would I hire someone who showed up for an interview with 
      blue hair, body piercings, and a name like 3v1l HaK0rZ? No. Not because he 
      might install a back door, but because he was ignorant about what was 
      acceptable on Wall Street. As for the back doors? More are installed by 
      well-groomed "professionals" in suits than by "hackers." Anyone with the 
      required skills can be either a "security consultant" or a "hacker." The 
      only difference is the label.

      Hackers demand £10m
      By Mark Ward

      COMPUTER hackers have demanded a £10 million ransom from Visa, the
      credit card giant, after claiming to have stolen critical data.

      Visa's British head office was contacted just before Christmas by a group
      which said it obtained the information during a hacking raid last summer. Visa
      refused to pay the ransom and contacted police. 

      A Visa spokesman admitted the British-based hackers managed to penetrate its
      computer network last July but were detected almost immediately and only stole
      useless information. He said: "As fast as they were in they were found out. To
      our knowledge they've not been back in."

      Police are investigating and Scotland Yard is understood to have already talked
      to one suspect.

147.0 ISN: Cybercrime growing harder to prosecute

      By Martin Stone, Newsbytes
      Special to the E-Commerce Times
      January 21, 2000
      
      U.S. Justice Department officials reportedly called computer crime a
      growing menace to corporations worldwide, and admitted that law
      enforcement agents face major hurdles in combating it.
      
      A report by Reuters today said Justice and FBI officials concede there is
      no such thing as a completely secure computer system. The warning was
      voiced Thursday at a conference on cybercrime sponsored by the Deloitte &
      Touche accounting firm, the report said.
      
       Who Is Vulnerable?
      
      "The issue isn't who is vulnerable because everyone is vulnerable. he
      issue is how are companies going to deal with those vulnerabilities,"
      Reuters quoted Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Burroughs as saying.
      
      The report noted that a recent survey found that 62 percent of U.S.
      companies reported security breaches in the last 12 months and that
      resulting financial damages totaled almost $124 million (US$).
      
      Computer criminals are harder to identify and have a greater reach than
      conventional criminals, Burroughs reportedly said, adding that prosecution
      of felons outside U.S. borders is complicated.
      
       Formidable Weapon
      
      Burroughs and FBI Agent Nenette Day warned that encryption, meant to
      protect company data, can become a formidable weapon for criminals wary of
      leaving electronic footprints, Reuters said.
      
      That statement comes after Attorney General Janet Reno in September said
      that the administration would work on making strong encryption exports
      easier for US high-tech companies, who traditionally have been hampered in
      their efforts to ship the products because of law enforcement concerns.
      
      The relaxed encryption regulations were announced on January 12th.
      
      Day reportedly told the conference there are large numbers of computer
      criminals working every day from home trying to defraud or otherwise
      damage corporations. She added that corporations are often reluctant to
      report computer intrusions, making investigations more difficult, the
      report stated.

      Hacking Exposed: Network Security Secrets & Solutions
      Stuart McClure, [4]Joel Scambray, [5]George Kurtz
      http://www.hackingexposed.com
      
      Paperback - 484 pages (September 1, 1999)
      McGraw-Hill ISBN: 0072121270
      
      Since 1991, I have been involved in the security field in one way or
      another. Starting as a casual hobby and evolving into a career, it has
      been a predominat part of my life. In my spare time I have run a number of
      FTP archives, Web sites and participated in many mail lists.  Because of
      this, many people seek me out for advice and answers. In all these years,
      the most frequently asked question of me has no simple answer. "How do I
      hack?" To date I have answered this with a wide variety of responses
      depending on how the question was asked, who asked it, and my general
      mood.
      
      Lucky for me, I now have a quick and dirty way out of what sometimes
      proved to be a three page response to the question. While I have always
      maintained (and still do) that hacking can not truly be taught, some
      aspects certainly can be. The technical steps behind computer intrusion
      can be shared by knowledgeable people, giving a solid foundation for the
      steps and procedures required in compromising the security of a system.
      That is the goal of this book, and it does it quite well. To those with a
      basic understanding of how computers and networks operate, this book will
      teach them the basiscs of remote system auditing (also known as controlled
      penetration).
      
      The book is divided into four main sections: Casing the Establishment,
      System Hacking, Network Hacking, and Software Hacking. Each section is
      further divided into seperate chapters which cover various methods of
      system intrusion on different platforms. By breaking it down and
      seperating information related to Unix and Windows NT, it adds clarity and
      avoids confusion between tools and techniques specific to a particular
      platform.
      
      In Casing the Establishment, you learn the fine art of remote
      reconnaissance of machines on a remote network. To a dedicated security
      auditer, remote machines can give away a world of information that aids
      them in subsequent attacks. Often times administrators are not aware of
      just how much information is shared out. The ability to pick this
      information out and use it to your advantage can often make the difference
      between gaining access and complete failure.
      
      System Hacking goes into the specific details of breaking into remote
      hosts. Covering Windows, Novell and Unix, the authors cover a wide variety
      of methods, many of which are lost to newcomers to security auditing.
      Readers learn the nuances of brute force attacks, buffer overflows,
      symlink attacks and a lot more.
      
      Network Hacking looks at the bigger picture and considers multiple
      machines as the intended target. Covering dial-ups, Virtual Private
      Networks (VPNs), routers and more, these chapters aim to hit the critical
      infrastructure of many networks. Another critical appliance in any
      sensitive network is the Firewall. The final chapter in this section gives
      several ways to poke holes in the firewall so that it no longer acts as a
      complete dead end for you.
      
      Software Hacking delves into details of Denial of Service (DoS)  attacks,
      remote access software, and advanced techniques. With more and more
      corporations using remote access software, they are finding it is leaving
      them wide open to attacks. These software packages are often a security
      auditers dream.
      
      To everyone who has ever asked me 'how to hack', or anything to do with
      system penetration, start with this book. Read it cover to cover and you
      will save yourself a lot of time and effot otherwise wasted with search
      engines and outdated text files.

149.0 ISN: The crime of punishment by Brian Martin
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      The Synthesis
      
      http://www.thesynthesis.com/tech/crimepunishment/index.html

      As you read this, an unusual legal case history is being established 
      around the prosecution of computer crime. Because computer crime is still 
      a relatively new aspect in the arena of law and prosecution, each and 
      every case       sets important precedent that will be called on in 
      upcoming cases. The growing concern by many people seems to be the drastic 
      nature of punishments being levied against computer intrusions. Not only 
      are the punishments not seeming to fit the crime, there is little 
      consistency in the legal system's application of punishment to these 
      people.

      Previous articles have pointed out the disturbing trends in damage figures 
      which directly affect sentencing in these cases. Unfortunately, the 
      emerging problem seems to go well beyond suspicious damage figures. It is 
      difficult       to say exactly why the punishment for computer crime is so 
      severe. Some people speculate it is the public perception of hacking and 
      the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) surrounding it while some think it 
      is nothing more than sacrificial lambs taking the brunt of public outcry. 
      Others feel it can't be logically explained. I think the best answer is 
      that computer crime is still shocking society, which overreacts in 
      response.

      The immediate disparity can be seen when comparing the sentencing between 
      computer and non-computer crimes. While more traditional and material 
      crimes like assault, burglary and murder are receiving what seems like       
      light sentences, computer crime convicts are becoming the bearers of 
      exceptionally stiff and smothering sentences. Not only are the prison 
      sentences extraordinarily lengthy, the terms of probation are baffling and 
      rough. Instead of a probation that encourages reform and nurtures a good 
      life better than the previous life of crime, it thrusts the convicted into 
      a life of poverty and despair.

      Jail Time

      Shortly after the new year, I was watching the news in a New York hotel 
      and caught the follow-up of a story begun some two to three years prior. 
      The news went on to say that a 21-year-old man convicted of killing his 
      baby       was being released after two years of prison. He and his wife 
      and killed their infant some three years age, and his prison term was two 
      years. Surely this is one case that slipped through our justice system and 
      let these killers off easy? A quick search yields that this is not 
      necessarily uncommon. Patrick Jack served a two-year sentence for 
      manslaughter after stabbing Francis Sunjay Weber with a pair of scissors. 
      Another article that discusses short sentences mentions yet another case 
      in which a 17-year-old Marysville girl was shot and killed. Her killer was 
      in turn sentenced to 27 months in prison for his crime. These cases make 
      me wonder about the effectiveness of our legal system.

      On the flip side, two recent computer crime cases perfectly illustrate the 
      baffling seriousness and resulting prison time that now accompanies 
      computer crime. Eric Burns recently pled guilty to ONE felony count of 
      computer       intrusion, and took the blame for the defacement of the 
      White House web page. For his confessed crimes, he was sentenced to a 
      $36,240 fine and 15 months in prison. A second longer story unfolded 
      recently, telling us of a small group of hackers known as the Phone 
      Masters who wielded amazing control of computers and phone networks. One 
      of the individuals, Corey Lindsley, was sentenced to 41 months in prison 
      for his 2 felony counts. The last comparison is the infamous Kevin Mitnick 
      saga in which Mitnick spent a total of 5 years in jail and prison for what 
      ended up being five felony counts of computer related crimes.

      What should be noted is the comparison of crimes. Burns' single felony is 
      basically nothing more than high tech graffiti, a sort of digital spray 
      paint on a federal building. What would that crime fetch for a sentence if 
      done in the       real world? Certainly not fifteen months of prison. 
      Manslaughter can fetch as low as two years of prison time, while Lindsley 
      and Mitnick sit in federal prison for four and five years respectively. 
      This disparity is hard to believe considering the gruesome nature of 
      manslaughter and killing a young baby as compared to altering the web page 
      of an Internet web site. 

       

      Conditions of Probation

      Even if you could dismiss the harsh penalty for relatively minor crimes, 
      you would then face another practice that is becoming all too common with 
      computer crime. After subjecting computer intruders to the long trial, 
      large       fines and lengthy jail terms, the real injustice occurs. It is 
      not uncommon for people to be put on probation for one to five years for 
      any felony conviction. I think it is fair to say that a probation term of 
      two to three years is a sound average. Probation terms for most crimes are 
      generally the same, preventing convicts from certain behavior and actions 
      that are not appropriate. Some of these terms are not associating with 
      known criminals, possessing weapons, use of drugs, and more. One thing 
      about these terms are they tend to be generally the same with little 
      variation based on crime.

      For those convicted of computer crime, the probation guidelines are quite 
      different. A quick review of the terms and conditions of Kevin Mitnick's 
      probation bring on a whole new set of computer crime specific terms: 

           Absent prior express written approval from the Probation Officer, the 
           Petitioner shall not possess or use, for any purpose, the following: 
           1. any computer hardware equipment; 2. any computer software 
           programs; 3.            modems; 4. any computer related peripheral or 
           support equipment; 5. portable laptop computer, 'personal information 
           assistants,' and derivatives; 6. cellular telephones; 7. televisions 
           or other instruments of communication equipped with online, Internet, 
           World-Wide Web or other computer network access; 8. any other 
           electronic equipment, presently available or new technology that 
           becomes available, that can be converted to or has as its function 
           the ability to act as a computer system or to access a computer 
           system, computer network or telecommunications network (except 
           defendant may possess a 'land line' telephone); B. The defendant 
           shall not be employed in or perform services for any entity engaged 
           in the computer, computer software, or telecommunications business 
           and shall not be employed in any capacity wherein he has access to 
           computers or computer related equipment or software; C. The defendant 
           shall not access computers, computer networks or other forms of 
           wireless communications himself or through third parties; D. The 
           defendant shall not act as a consultant or advisor to individuals or 
           groups engaged in any computer related activity; E. The defendant 
           shall not acquire or possess any computer codes (including computer 
           passwords), cellular phone access codes or other access devices that 
           enable the defendant to use, acquire, exchange or alter information 
           in a computer or telecommunications database system; F. The defendant 
           shall not use any data encryption device, program or technique for 
           computers; G. The defendant shall not alter or possess any altered 
           telephone, telephone equipment or any other communications related 
           equipment. 

           Reading these, one can begin to see how this limits a convicted 
           computer intruder in life after prison. Some argue that as convicted 
           felons, who cares? They are getting what they deserve. Perhaps that 
           is true, but why            don't murderers and rapists receive 
           special terms for their probation that might be deemed appropriate? 
           Some of the few crimes that receive no special terms?

        A.Forgery -- Convicted forgers are not banned from pens, paper and other 
        devices that help commit the crime.         B.Vehicular Manslaughter and 
        other crimes involving motor vehicles -- These people do not lose their 
        driver's license or the ability to own and operate cars or trucks. C.Sex 
        Crimes – Except in extreme cases of recidivistic offenders, convicted 
        rapists and pedophiles are not forbidden from pornography or other 
        stimuli said to influence or encourage their behavior. D.Counterfeiting 
        -- Convicted counterfeiters are not forbidden from using currency, nor 
        forbidden from working jobs with cash or banned from a wide variety of 
        activities that may influence them. 

      The purpose of incarceration and the following probation is to punish and 
      rehabilitate the convict. Probation specifically is geared to help push 
      the criminal into a structured life without influences that may lead to 
      their return to a       life of crime. However, in the case of computer 
      crime the probation guidelines do a lot more than discourage further 
      computer crime. Some of the few acts they will be banned from:

           Sending a letter to a Senator via e-mail or using a word processor            
           Playing a video arcade game or personal entertainment system like 
           Sega or Nintendo Calling his family on a cellular telephone Working 
           in any industry (including fast food) as they all rely on computers, 
           even for cash transactions (cash registers) Working as a custodian in 
           any business that has computers on premises Working as a teacher, 
           instructor, consultant, or advisor to any company that owns or 
           operates a single computer device Writing any type of computer 
           software program (even using merely a pen and paper) Accessing a 
           public library's computerized card catalog. Using computerized 
           information services found at airports and shopping malls that give 
           directions and customer information Accessing any information via 
           phone and voice mail/prompt system (including bank account 
           information, car insurance and more) 

      Surprising as it seems, all of the above become illegal to most people on 
      probation for computer crimes. Imagine living for three years with those 
      restrictions hovering over you. Is this really a good guideline to get you 
      back on       the right track and lead a good life without bad influence? 
      Or is this a well lit path encouraging you to break the terms of probation 
      and risk more prison time?

      If you are thrust into society after a lengthy prison sentence, stripped 
      of opportunity to work in the one field you previously excelled in, what 
      options does that leave? Unable to work in most modern and computerized 
      jobs,       unable to work near computers, it leaves the convict with 
      several years of difficult living at below poverty level. Hardly the 
      rehabilitation that was intended or needed.

      The Tip of the Iceberg

      The story of Chris Lamprecht still remains in the depths of news sites. In 
      1995 Lamprecht was sentenced to a 70-month prison sentence for money 
      laundering. He did not plead to or get convicted of any computer related       
      crimes. Despite this, Federal Judge Sam Sparks imposed the same "no 
      computer" probation on Lamprecht at the request of the District Attorney. 
      This seems to be an equivalent of being banned from restaurants because 
      you ate dinner before breaking and entering.

       

      Recouping Your Tax Dollars

      It is well established that those caught and convicted of any crime are 
      subjected to restitution. The amount is typically arrived at by 
      calculating the damage figures against the victim(s). If a bike worth one 
      hundred dollars was       stolen, the criminal could be ordered to pay 
      restitution that included the cost of the bike, court fees the victim paid 
      for, emotional distress, etc. One thing that has not historically been 
      factored in is the cost of the investigation or the time and effort of the 
      officers involved in solving the crime. Apparently the money associated 
      with the law enforcement efforts was not a factor for one reason or 
      another.

      Once again, when computer crime enters the equation, circumstances seem to 
      change. In May of 1997, Wendell Dingus was sentenced by a federal court to 
      six months of home monitoring for computer crime activity. Among       the 
      systems he admitted to attacking were the U.S. Air Force, NASA and 
      Vanderbilt University. What is different about this case is the court's 
      order for Dingus to repay $40,000 in restitution to the Air Force 
      Information Warfare Center (AFIWC) for their time and effort in helping to 
      track him.

      It is odd that the court systems are now levying punishments for computer 
      crimes not based on the damage that was actually done, rather it is based 
      on the amount of time, money and resources required to track down or fix       
      the system's vulnerability. Worse, they are then lumping on time and 
      resources required to (belatedly) create pro-active preventative measures 
      from future intrusions, something that should have been done in the first 
      place. So the system intruder is now responsible for future intrusions, 
      yet the administrators were not in the first place?

      When the police or FBI catch up to a robber, defrauder or murderer, they 
      are charged and punished for their crimes. It is generally unheard of for 
      these criminals to receive punishments and fines based on the efforts of 
      the law       enforcement tracking them down. Think of how much time and 
      resources the FBI put into tracking down a serial killer that has been 
      roaming our country for years. How many air plane trips, car rentals, 
      hotels, overtime, examination and forensic equipment, food reimbursement 
      and who knows what else do our tax dollars go to pay for? Why aren't these 
      levied against the criminal like they are now starting to do with computer 
      crime?

      One difficult aspect that creeps back into computer crime cases is the 
      blanket laws covering a wide variety of people and activities. As a 
      computer crime investigator brought up in a conversation recently, a 
      homicide typically       affects a family, friends and perhaps a small 
      community, while a concentrated computer attack could affect the lives of 
      thousands of people or more. There are certainly exceptions to each type 
      of crime but in general, that statement seems to be reasonable. The bottom 
      line is that more consistency needs to be developed between traditional 
      crimes and computer crimes.

      In Texas, it is a Class B misdemeanor for graffiti if the damage is less 
      than $500. In reality, most Web page defacements done today can be 
      recovered from and dealt with for less than $500. Anyone saying otherwise 
      is likely       to be the consultant profiting heavily at your expense. So 
      why is it that a young kid who spray paints a wall gets hit with a small 
      fine, and a young kid who spray paints a Web site gets fifteen months in 
      jail and tens of thousands of dollars in fines?

      I think it is time for the media to quit hyping up computer crimes and 
      introduce a dose of sanity to the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt they love to 
      bring to 'hacker' stories. The legal system needs to give a serious look 
      at the       disparity in how they handle various crimes. I think it is 
      pretty obvious that something is wrong when a knife wielding murderer does 
      less time than a keyboard wielding fourteen-year-old.

150.0 ISN: EDI Security, Control and, Audit (Book review) by Brian Martin
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      amazon reviews: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0890066108/insekurityorgA/

      http://www.attrition.org/library/rev/0890066108.html
      EDI Security, Control, and Audit
      Albert J. Marcella, Jr. and Sally Chan
      Artech ISBN: 0-89006-610-8
      
      Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a computer-to-computer or
      application-to-application exchange of business information in a standard
      format. In 1992, there were over 31,000 known EDI users, with a steady
      increase since 1987. EDI users can be found in such industries as
      transportation, retail, grocery, automobiles, warehousing,
      pharmaceuticals, healthcare and financial institutions.
      
           "EDI will change our lives, just as computers did. It will redefine the
            ways we work as it pushes us toward a knowledge-based society in which
            we pursue intellectual challenges while routine, noncreative tasks are
            assigned to computers."                - Gene A. Nelson
      
      As a comprehensive book on EDI, several parts of the book deal more with
      the operation and setup of such a network. This leads into the areas that
      explain in technical detail the security and auditing of EDI networks.
      Beginning with the basics of EDI, the book walks through the pros and cons
      of such networks. It gives guidelines for who should implement and use it,
      operating issues, risks, control concerns and more. These sections are
      brief and to the point, suitable to give to non technical managers who may
      be considering EDI as a solution.
      
      The following three chapters (2 - 4) delve into the technical aspects and
      the standards governing their development and operating procedures.
      Covering infrastructure and standards, networks and telecommunications,
      and cross-vulnerabilities in EDI Partnerships, these chapters give a solid
      understanding of the issues at hand. This reading is not suggested for the
      technical neophyte!
      
      Dropping back out of the technical jargon, Chapter 5 (Managing
      Interenterprise Partnerships) seems to be more suited toward managers and
      legal staff. The next chapter jumps back into technical land and covers
      Application Control Issues, Security/Environmental/Project controls,
      Inbound/Outbound Control Issues and more. Maintaining the ping-pong style
      of writing, Chapter 7 (EDI Management and
      
      Environmental Control) delves into higher level project and planning.  If
      your organization uses EDI, or is considering implementing it, this book
      is for you. Both management and the technical staff can get something out
      of this book by passing it back and forth to read chapters. For a one stop
      shop on EDI, this is it.

      NEW YORK (February 4, 2000 10:44 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) -
      Home computer users who think hacking is just a threat to government
      and corporate networks need to realize that the Internet puts them at
      risk of being invaded by computer predators, too, security experts
      say.
      
      Concern about home security grew Thursday following disclosure that
      former CIA Director John Deutch stored sensitive national security
      secrets on a home computer connected to the Internet.
      
      "He certainly should have known better," said Cormac Foster, who
      monitors security issues for Internet research firm Jupiter
      Communications. "If your business is protecting the security of the
      country, one would hope you wouldn't make a mistake like that."
      
      Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus.com, said
      hackers often target computers randomly, to obtain financial
      information or play a prank. But sometimes they access home machines
      from which they launch attacks on companies.
      
      "It comes down to people thinking, I don't have anything important on
      my computer, so why would somebody want to get me," Levy said.
      
      A hacker can gain access to a home computer in many ways.
      
      If a sharing option is turned on, outsiders could take advantage of
      that to delete or steal files. Through e-mail, hackers could send
      viruses and other malicious programs that will give them access to
      sensitive documents.
      
      The risks are greater with high-speed connections such as cable modems
      - those computers are always connected to the Internet.
      
      But even standard, dial-up users are vulnerable. Hackers have tools
      that can automatically scan the Web looking for computers with
      security holes.
      
      "If I'm a burglar, I have to rattle each door in the neighborhood
      until I find one that's unlocked," said Tom Powledge, senior product
      manager for Norton Internet Security software. A hacker with the right
      scanning tools "can rattle hundreds of doors at once."
      
      Once in, a hacker can seize control of the computer, even stealing
      credit card numbers or top-secret materials.
      
      CIA Director George Tenet said he has no evidence that foreign enemies
      hacked into Deutch's computer but acknowledged there is no way to tell
      for sure.

152.0 ISN Japanese Police crack down on hacker attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Feb 5, 2000 - 01:33 AM
      
      TOKYO (AP) - With hackers barraging government Internet sites,
      Japanese police announced plans to improve crime-fighting in
      cyberspace, newspapers reported Saturday.
      
      Beginning late last month, unidentified hackers began a high-profile
      campaign to crack state sites. And despite its love for just about
      everything high-tech, Japan is far behind other countries when it
      comes to tackling online crime.
      
      The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest paper, said the National Police
      Agency has requested $1.78 million from the country's fiscal 2000
      budget to battle the problem. Police want to study how hackers break
      into Web sites and ensure user names are not being abused, the reports
      said.
      
      Agency officials were unavailable for comment.
      
      Agency figures showed that 247 Internet crimes, including distributing
      child pornography, were reported in 1999, nearly double the previous
      year, according to major Japanese newspapers.
      
      A bill aimed at improving user verification, a so-called digital
      signature bill, is due to be submitted to parliament soon, the Asahi
      Shimbun reported. Digital signatures allow people to use the Internet
      to buy and sell goods and services, it said.
      
      The police agency is urging that mandatory identity checks on people
      who apply for such signatures be made part of the bill, the paper
      said.
      
      The proposed legislation comes on the heels of a new law parliament
      passed last summer to make it illegal to access sites without the
      proper clearance. It takes effect this month.
      
      The Bank of Japan - the country's central bank - the Defense Agency,
      the Science and Technology Agency and the Transport Ministry have all
      reported being attacked by hackers, though they reported no damage.
      
      However, hackers into the Science and Technology Agency's homepage
      left a message alleging that Tokyo denied the Rape of Nanking, the
      Japanese army's massacre of as many as 300,000 civilians during the
      1937-38 occupation of the Chinese city now known as Nanjing.

153.0 ISN:Behind the scenes at "Hackers Inc."

      So you thought hackers were nerds in dark rooms traveling in
      cyberspace to attack companies' computer systems or steal data.
      
      Think again.
      
      A new breed of hackers licensed to hack legally into companies around
      the world, ranging from banks in Israel and Britain to e-commerce
      companies in Spain, and check their systems' security, is at work in
      Sweden.
      
      The Stockholm-based private company Defcom, set up in April last year,
      is a pioneer in a shadowy business that may seem more like a scene
      from one of legendary American science fiction author William Gibson's
      novels than reality.
      
      But Defcom actually gets paid for hiring out its "ethical hackers" to
      large companies, mostly in the banking, insurance, and e-commerce
      sector around Europe.
      
      "Nine out of ten companies we're employed to check, we can break into
      through the Internet," Defcom Chief Executive Thomas Gullberg tells
      Reuters. "That's a frightening statistic."
      
      An Online Playground
      
      The Web is becoming an ever more attractive playground for hackers as
      e-commerce mushrooms in Europe and the United States, and sensitive
      data is transferred over the Internet.
      
      Hackers can break into practically any computer system if they want
      to, Defcom says.
      
      It was hard at first to bring hackers together, but Gullberg was
      surprised by the willingness on the part of hackers to turn
      legitimate.
      
      "We've brought hacking to another stage, made it ethical," Gullberg
      says. "We've gathered hackers under one roof. After all they're the
      best in the business, they know how it's done."
      
      Defocom's motto, displayed in one of the main hackers' rooms, sums it
      up: "It takes one to know one."
      
      The Swedish company--with an office in London--has grown to over 40
      staff, of whom about half are professional hackers, aged 23 to 30. One
      has a criminal record.
      
      To boost expertise and knowledge it has also hired a police officer
      from the IT security division in Sweden's national crimes prevention
      unit.
      
      Once appointed by a company to check its security system, the staff
      carries out a technical analysis, then travels to the country of the
      company and starts hacking.
      
      What makes them different from some other data security firms is that
      they actually make changes in their customers' computers to see
      whether they can really be hacked into, Defcom says.
      
      "We don't just go to the firewall and prove that we can break it, but
      we go into the main computers," Defcom's senior cyberspace hacker, who
      asked to remain anonymous, tells Reuters.
      
      "We deliver the truth to clients. The bittersweet truth," Gullberg
      says.
      
      Bad for Business
      
      "Security has been a big problem in the business world and it still
      is. The Internet is not safe," Gullberg says.
      
      Most illegal hacking in finance centers on stealing credit card
      numbers but is expanding quickly into industrial espionage.
      
      Defcom says an underground market known as "information broker" sites
      is growing on the Web, where clients could scout around for hackers to
      do their dirty work, like breaking into a company to steal corporate
      data.
      
      The need for tighter security was underscored last month when hackers
      broke into online music retailer CD Universe, a unit of EUniverse and
      stole 300,000 credit card numbers, demanding payment of $100,000 not
      to use them.
      
      Defcom advises its clients not to publicize their use of its services
      as this could be a challenge to the hacking community.
      
      "It's easy to break into the system. Too easy. But often customers
      don't know when the companies have had intruders because they cover it
      up," the top hacker says.

154.0 ISN: Hackers a No-Show at DVD decryption protest (!???)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.digitalmass.com/columns/software/0207.html      
      
      
      Hackers a no-show at protest over DVD decryption

      By Hiawatha Bray Special to boston.com 

      The angry hackers never showed up -- not at their appointed meeting place 
      at the Prudential Center food court, nor out in front of the Cheri Theater 
      in downtown Boston, where I'd hoped to see them handing out their protest 
      leaflets.

      Too bad; especially their not being at the Cheri. I'd have enjoyed the 
      looks of bewilderment from the teens that stood three-deep, smoking 
      illegal Marlboros as they waited for the start of Scream 3.

      Scarcely any of the kids would have had the slightest idea what the 
      protest was about, and probably still wouldn't have understood, even after 
      patient explanation.

      "You want to watch movies? Yeah, me too, man. On your computer? Cool ... 
      Linux? What's that? And what's it got to do with movies, anyway?"

      Good question, but I doubt your average teen filmgoer would stay for an 
      answer. They're probably not as insatiably curious as you guys.

      Many of you already know part of the story -- how the motion picture 
      industry lit out after a network of Internet sites and a hacker hobbyist 
      in Norway in an effort to stamp out a piece of software that allows 
      unauthorized replays of DVD movie disks.

      I haven't bought a DVD player yet, but more than 5 million of you have. 
      These devices replay Hollywood flicks with vastly better image and sound 
      quality than old-fashioned videotape.

      DVD disks include an encryption system that makes it impossible to play 
      them back, except in a player that has the right software to decrypt the 
      disk. Of course, this software is built into living-room DVD players, and 
      is included with DVD-ROM players for personal computers.

      The trouble is that while this decryption software exists for the most 
      common computer systems --Apple's Macintoshes or machines running 
      Microsoft's Windows -- there wasn't a DVD decoder program that would work 
      with Linux, the upstart operating system cobbled together by hundreds of 
      part-time hackers worldwide.

      So, as hackers will, some Linux folk got busy and wrote their own program. 
      A group of Europeans, including a Norwegian teenager named Jon Johansen, 
      figured out how to break DVD encryption and created software called DeCSS 
      to let Linux users watch DVD movies. And of course, they posted this 
      software on the Internet.

      What did they do that for? The Motion Picture Association of America and a 
      DVD industry trade group ran screaming to court, and Norwegian cops hauled 
      young Mr. Johansen down to the precinct house for a scary interrogation. 
      The movie moguls demanded not only that dozens of individuals remove DeCSS 
      from their Web sites, but also that they remove Web links to other pages 
      where the software might be found.

      This last demand should have all of us passing out leaflets on street 
      corners. The freedom to share information, regardless of its source, is at 
      the heart of the Internet. A court order forcing a Web site to stop 
      linking to a questionable source of information would be like ordering a 
      library to stop offering a controversial book.

      Thank heaven that federal and California state judges refused to go along 
      with the ban on links. But the judges did issue temporary injunctions 
      forcing Web sites to take down their own copies of DeCSS, on the grounds 
      that the program may amount to an illegal theft of the movie industry's 
      trade secrets.

      This has outraged the hacker community, and publications such as 2600: The 
      Hacker Quarterly have called for protests and boycotts outside of movie 
      theaters. Readers of 2600 in the Boston area were urged to meet at the 
      Prudential Center on Friday, and then swoop down on local movie theaters 
      with protest leaflets in hand.

      Maybe I went to the wrong theater. Or maybe it was too cold and dreary. Or 
      maybe the local hacker community thinks this issue isn't as 
      black-and-white as some would have us believe.

      A chat with the DVD encryption folks revealed that they're happy to share 
      their secrets with Linux computer makers -- for a $10,000 fee. One 
      company, Sigma Designs, has paid the fee, and is now bringing out a 
      circuit card that'll let Linux computers legally run DVDs.

      You might think this would satisfy the hackers, but you'd be wrong. 
      They're arguing that they have a right to bypass DVD encryption without 
      getting anybody's permission. It's called "reverse engineering" -- taking 
      apart somebody else's hardware or software, figuring out how it works, and 
      then using that knowledge to create a compatible product. It's done all 
      the time in the computer business, and there are court cases that have 
      found it to be legal.

      The hackers, then, are standing on principle, fighting for their right to 
      dismantle and study software whenever they please. The movie industry, for 
      its part, points to law protecting trade secrets. The DVD encryption 
      system is just such a secret, they say, and the creators of DeCSS smashed 
      the lock, rather than pay $10,000 for a copy of the key.

      There are serious arguments on both sides, a level of ambiguity that 
      wouldn't likely appeal to the kids shivering outside the Cheri, waiting to 
      see a bunch of Hollywood teenagers get slashed to death. No wonder the 
      hackers stayed home.

      ; AFTERWORD: Well, well, well. I really was at the wrong theatre. An alert 
      reader pointed me to a page on the 2600 Web site, filled with after-action 
      reports on the Friday protest. Instead of hitting the nearest cinema, as 
      I'd assumed, the Boston-area hackers headed for the Avalon dance club over 
      on Lansdowne, where they leafleted up a storm. What's Avalon got to do 
      with DVD movies? Beats the stew out of me; I'm just too rational for my 
      own good sometimes. HB, 2/07/99, 9:10 p.m.

155.0 ISN need C2 security? - stick with NT 4.0 by Susan Menke
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      From: "John Q. Public" <tpublic@dimensional.com>
      
      [Please remember this when the MS droids come to your office and try to
       push NT4 C2 certification on you. - John]

      If you need C2 security, youll have to stick with NT 4.0
      By Susan M. Menke
      GCN Staff
      
      Agencies that have a "hard requirement" for C2 security will have to wait
      two or more years before adopting Microsoft Windows 2000, says James
      Arnold, technical director of Science Applications International Corp.'s
      Trusted Technology Assessment Program laboratory.
      
      Arnolds TTAP team in Columbia, Md., last month announced the C2
      certification of amended versions of the 4-year-old Windows NT 4.0 Server
      and Workstation operating systems under the National Security Agencys
      Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria. Arnold said agencies existing
      installations of NT 4.0 Server and Workstation must have NT Service Pack 6
      and several hot fixes installed to qualify at the C2 security level.
      
      C2 certification has been a moving target for NT 4.0 for several years
      [GCN, Oct. 26, 1998, Page 8]. Until the SAIC lab completed its work, NT
      3.5 had been the only C2-certified Microsoft OS.
      
      Specific environment
      
      The San Diego company's lab, with Microsoft funding and NSA supervision,
      tested the NT 4.0 OSes on Compaq Computer Corp.  uniprocessor and
      multiprocessor systems in networked and standalone modes.
      
      The configurations included ProLiant 6500 and 7000 servers and Compaq
      Professional Workstation 5100s and 8000s, in addition to a Hewlett-Packard
      Co.  digital audio tape drive and HP LaserJet printers.
      
      Strictly speaking, only those specific configurations are C2-certified
      with NT 4.0.
      
      The required NT Service Pack 6 and hot fixes are downloadable from the Web
      at www.microsoft.com. Arnold said the software fixes also can be obtained
      on CD-ROM from Microsoft Corp.
      
      "Lots of requests for proposals require C2 or the equivalent," Arnold
      said.  "C2 means the OS can identify and authenticate users and can
      control and audit their access to data."
      
      The lab's certification effort began with NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and
      continued through packs 4, 5 and 6. Work will now begin on Windows 2000.
      "The evaluation process is still evolving," he said.
      
      Arnold and Frank Simmons, vice president at SAIC's Center for Information
      Security Technology, said the lab also is evaluating Microsoft SQL Server.

156.0 ISN: Sites cracked with id's and passwords
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/0208cr21.htm

      Akiko Kasamaand Masato Takahashi Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers
      
      The hackers behind a recent series of invasions of government-run Web
      sites may have gained access to the sites by stealing the user names
      and passwords belonging to the engineers operating the systems,
      according to investigation sources.
      
      The hackers may have replaced the user names and passwords with new
      ones after illegally entering computer servers that operate the Web
      sites.
      
      The hackers are also suspected of erasing communications
      records--known as logs--in an attempt to remove information that could
      help trace them.
      
      Currently, specialists and investigators are trying to work out how
      hackers gained access to the Web site servers. The sites broken into
      include those run by the Science and Technology Agency and the
      National Institute for Research and Advancement (NIRA), an affiliate
      of the Economic Planning Agency.
      
      The computer servers were running under two kinds of operating
      systems. Investigators are increasingly convinced that the engineers
      managing the systems failed to properly set up the servers when they
      entered their user information into the systems.
      
      Observers question whether the system managers lived up to their
      obligations as operators of Web site servers.
      
      System managers are in charge of running and overseeing information
      systems and computer networks at companies and government offices.
      Their status is almost godlike regarding computer security. They issue
      user names to other users, have the authority to decide the framework
      of each organization's computer security system and are able to erase
      logs that record the sender, time and place of origin of messages.
      
      After the Science and Technology Agency Web site was broken into on
      Jan. 24 and 26, access to the site was tested using the user name and
      password of the official system manager. The site, however, could not
      be accessed as the user name and password were not recognized after a
      hacker had created a new password.
      
      After the NIRA site was broken into on Jan. 26, officials found that
      the hacker had impersonated a system manager using a user name and
      password of the hacker's own invention, as the site had not been set
      up to recognize only the system manager's user name and password.
      
      The logs--the only means of tracing the hacker--were erased under the
      name of system managers on both sites.
      
      Hackers broke into two kinds of operating systems in the recent cases.
      They usually use special hacking software to scout out bugs left
      during programming on the operating system and the software for
      creating Web sites. They then input specific commands to obtain user
      names and passwords.
      
      Hackers in the recent cases might have obtained user names and
      passwords through uncorrected bugs. Nonetheless, the NIRA site case
      shows that hackers did not hesitate to take advantage of slack site
      management, the sources said.
      
      Hacking into a system to obtain a user name and password involves
      searching for an unlocked port. Portscanning is a hacking tool that
      does this automatically.
      
      Portscanning was used in more than 12,000 intrusions into the National
      Personnel Authority and the authority's Kinki regional office sites,
      which stores government employee exam information.
      
      The deleted logs make tracing the hackers in the recent cases
      difficult. Also, as hackers usually use a number of servers to try to
      invade a targeted site, tracing failed hacking attempts does not help
      much in identifying the Web site trespassers.
      
      If hacking routes cross national boundaries, jurisdiction and national
      interest issues also come into play.
      
      Although investigators traced illegal entries to the sites of The
      Asahi Shimbun and The Mainichi Shimbun to a South Korean provider,
      they were unable to get any further leads.
      
      The series of hacking cases has prompted several Internet security
      companies to begin offering instruction on security measures and to
      put antihacking goods on the market.
      
      Asgent Inc., a security software company based in Chuo Ward, Tokyo,
      will hold a free seminar on Feb. 16 and 17 targeting company computer
      system managers and focusing on the skills needed to prevent hacking
      and transform the contents of hacked Web sites. For more information,
      call the Asgent at (03)5643-2561.
      
      The Japanese unit of Network Associates Inc., based in Minato Ward,
      Tokyo, has started distributing free samples of CyberCop Monitor, its
      software for detecting illegal Web site access in real time. The
      samples will be sent out for free until the end of March to those who
      complete the application form on the company's Web site at
      http://www.nai.com/japan.

157.0 ISN: Who are these jerks anyway?

      Who Are These Jerks, Anyway?
      February 10, 2000
      by Richard L. Brandt
      
      The real question about the "denial of service" (DoS) attacks on major
      Web sites this week is: Just who are these jerks, anyway?
      
      It could be virtually anyone. Except for non-jerks. You have to be a
      jerk to pull this kind of stunt. It seems to be nothing but a prank.
      There is no political ideology, no monetary gain, no anger against the
      sites being attacked. There is just the thrill of having done it and
      knowing that all those important newscasters on television are talking
      about something you did. Gee, aren't you special?
      
      If it were political or a protest against particular sites or
      e-commerce in general, there should be some sort of manifesto, someone
      claiming credit. The point of a terrorist attack is to let people know
      why you did it, in an attempt to change something you don't like. But
      in this case, no one is claiming credit or telling us why it's
      happening.
      
      Further, although there are certainly unscrupulous people who would
      attack a site in order to make money -- say, short a stock before the
      attack -- usually such a person would be smart enough to keep a low
      profile. When a lot of prominent sites are attacked at once, investors
      realize this is an anomaly and not a problem unique to the company
      being attacked. The stocks of these companies did not decline as much
      as some observers thought they might.
      
      That's why the main speculation seems to be that this is being done by
      adolescents (in mind if not in body). "The people who have done this
      in the last couple days are amateurs," says Alex Samonte, chief
      engineer at SiteSmith, a company that helps build Web sites. "It
      appears to be just for the fun of it."
      
      Samonte has a lot of experience on this issue, as someone who has been
      building Web sites for a long time. He did some of the work on the
      original Yahoo site.
      
      We should distinguish between these amateurs (or "jerks") and that
      underground computer community that calls itself "hackers." The hacker
      communities are really pissed off right now, because every television
      news program in the universe is talking about the "hacker attacks."
      
      Hackers like to figure out how systems work. They like to find obscure
      weaknesses that can be exploited. The more difficult, the better.
      There is status in being able to do something sophisticated. And many
      of them try to demonstrate their power by showing it off in some
      relatively harmless way, posting an obscene message, say, rather than
      shutting down a site.
      
      Most hackers do not consider DoS attacks to be true hacking. You can
      do it automatically, using one of several rogue programs available on
      the Internet. (One early program, still popular, is called Smurf,
      although there are a lot more sophisticated programs these days.)
      Using such a program makes this kind of attack a simple process that
      we used to call "cookbooking" in chemistry lab. You don't have to know
      how it works, just follow the directions and you get the reaction you
      want. The problem in this case is that we don't know what reaction the
      attackers want.
      
      Hacker news sites are complaining. On 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, for
      example, writers say they're insulted to be linked to these attacks by
      implication. The site's editors do concede, however, that the
      attackers have a reasonable knowledge of Internet topology.
      
      (Suggestion to the hacker community: Find a new name for yourself. The
      term "hacker" has been co-opted by the press to mean any computer
      attacker, malicious or not. The public's definition of the word is
      different than yours. You can't change that now.)
      
      The reason these attacks are so disturbing is that it could be some
      14-year-old jerk doing it. And some of the recent attacks could be
      done by copycats, an even more despicable breed of jerk, because they
      don't even show any originality.
      
      And it's not that I agree with hackers who may be trying to prove a
      point or make a statement, but the randomness of these attacks is
      clearly worse. The world is moving toward e-commerce, and it can be
      halted by some pimply-faced kid who doesn't have a life. Isn't that a
      pleasant image of the information revolution?
      
      When I was in college at a really geeky school called Harvey Mudd
      College, there were lots of phone phreaks and geeks who liked to show
      that they could make free calls off the college president's phone line
      with their homemade blue boxes. I'd hang out with them sometimes and
      get a giggle out of doing something naughty. But then I grew up.
      
      The current attacks demonstrate the double-edged sword of any new
      technology. The Web empowers the individual to do great things. It can
      also amplify his or her tendency to be a jerk and hurt a lot of
      people. With every new privilege comes a new responsibility, and these
      folks are irresponsible. They don't deserve access to the Web, but we
      don't know how to deny them service, unless they are caught.
      
      Apparently, that will be difficult to do. It is not difficult to
      disguise yourself, or make it appear that you are operating from a
      different address. It's called spoofing. According to Samonte of
      Sitesmith.com, in order to trace the attack back to the origin, you
      have to do it while the attack is occurring, probably tracing back
      through several different servers, ISPs and network providers -- with
      their cooperation. But the people operating the target sites are too
      busy putting out fires, trying to get their sites back up, to spend
      time doing the tracing.
      
      Here's another difficult problem: DoS attacks use innocent computers
      to do the attacking. They do not exploit security problems in the
      target sites, they attack security problems in other computers on the
      Internet. They get other computers -- and it could be your home
      computer with a DSL connection -- to send hundreds of messages to the
      target site. Enlist enough of those computers and you can overwhelm a
      site with too much traffic.
      
      Therefore, companies that can best prevent such attacks are the
      Network Service Providers or Internet Service Providers, not the
      target Web sites themselves.
      
      The ISPs know all the network addresses that should be routing signals
      through their services. These spoofed messages would have strange IP
      addresses on them. So theoretically, the ISPs could block any messages
      with the wrong address.
      
      But they may have thousands of legitimate addresses to keep track of,
      and those change every day as new clients join up and old ones drop
      off. It is not that trivial or cheap, and the ISPs themselves have
      nothing to gain by it. They would only do it to prevent another
      company from being attacked.
      
      In other words, "What's my motivation?" To be nice? Government
      subsidies might do the trick, but we know how bad government subsidies
      are. Right?
      
      Longer term, there are solutions. Major sites need to distribute their
      servers and add as much redundancy as possible. That will make it
      harder for the attackers to find and target all their servers,
      increasing the odds that the site will keep running. But that's not an
      overnight job.
      
      But in the meantime, this is a perfect example of the difficulty of
      putting a powerful tool in the hands of the people: Some people are
      jerks.

      A response follows;
      
      Hi William,
      
      You raised a few interesting points in your previous mail. I would like to
      add to a couple with my own, if I may.
      
      * 2600, "The Hacker Quarterly", can in no way act disgusted by these attacks
      and hold insult for being linked to them. When I was a teenager, sitting
      around with an all powerul 96 modem (speed!) the magazine was a good read.
      Informative, and fun. Now however, it panders to nothing more than the
      scr1p7 k1d33. Disseminating information is one thing - tell me how to
      propogate an attack in rough technical terms, and I would be able to work it
      out, probably learning a lot on the way. It is doubtful that I would take
      the attack beyond my own network and my friends, though. However, 2600 is
      guilty of providing source code directly and/or direct links in several
      cases. This is not passing the information under the ideal of "free speech".
      This is passing the gun to a teenage idiot with a seriously bad attitude.
      Thanks, I got that one of my chest - it's been bugging me for a while now!
      :-)
      
      >Here's another difficult problem: DoS attacks use innocent computers
      >to do the attacking.
      
      * Innocent is in one way correct, William, but in another I think not. DoS
      attacks are older than my cleanest pair of socks, and this particular type
      is not new. The information pertaining to it, and ensuring that your system
      is not amongst those compromised is freely and easily available. Steps
      should have been taken by now to ensure that your machine is not one of
      those used. Whether it be a home box or not - people need to act in a
      responsible way. You would lock your guns in a cabinet, rahter than leave
      them outside on the window ledge, wouldn't you? What I'm saying is that
      security is only as good as the next weak machine, and we should not
      tolerate weak machines.
      
      I was discussing on the FreeBSD mailing list with a chap recently these
      things, after Yahoo! was had. The best way would be to have machines removed
      from the backbone - how is that done? The only other option we could come up
      with was along your lines. Perhaps, we thought, we could start a list
      dedicated to nothing more than recording the IP addresses of machines used
      to propogate such attacks. Provide some tools to automate things as much as
      possible, and sysadmin now has a list of IP addresses that they can drop at
      the border. We then mail the blocked sites to let them know what is
      happening. In this way we could take some responsibility that the people who
      should be taking it don't seem to want - we could reduce site of the playing
      field for the morons out there. OK, so the problem doesn't go away, but it
      is a step in the right direction, don't you think?

      Domain Name Robbery (aka Domain-Jacking): A Flaw in InterNIC Authentication
      Scheme
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         By Lucifer Mirza (lucifermirza@hotmail.com)
      ___________
      Disclaimer:
      -----------
      This sole purpose of the information contained in this advisory is
      to point out the flaws in InterNIC's domain name handling system
      and is intented for education. Any abuse of the information in whole
      or in part is NOT my responsibility nor do I encourage illegal activities.
      
      The below mentioned technique involves a planned step by step way
      of stealing different sorts of com/net/org/gov/mil domain names.
      ______
      Tools:
      ------
      * anonymous remailer or mail bomber which could spoof email adresses (I used
      Kaboom).
      * access to internet and mainly networksolutions.com website.
      * Social Engineering skills for timing the emails.
      * A fake email address at hotmail.com or any other free service.
      ____________
      Intructions:
      ------------
      As an example for this advisory, I will take the domain name wi2000.org.
      Go to networksolutions.com and click on the link that says 'Who Is.'
      Now enter the domain name (wi2000.org in this case) in the search field
      and click on the 'Search' button.
      This would show you the WhoIs information as shown below

         NS2.MOUNTAINCABLE.NET	24.215.0.12
      ____________________________________________________________
      
      Now you have two choices here:
      
      -01> Either you could take full control of the domain by
           changing the Administrator's handle information.
      
                                   OR
      
      -02> You could simply point the domain to another
           host and let it recover in time by itself.
      
      The first approach is very aggressive and could be hazardous if you are
      going for gov or mil domain names so I recommend second approach for gov
      and mil domains.
      ___________________________
      Intiating the First Attack:
      ---------------------------
      Let me first explain the InterNIC authentication system in case most of you
      would be the readers who do not have their own domain names.
      The problem with InterNIC authentication is that they do NOT send a
      confirmation email if the request is sent from the same email as the
      person owning the contact or the domain name itself!
      Therefore, utilizing this flaw one could spoof anyone's email address
      and change any domain name's information.
      Although, a confirmation is required from the person to whom the domain
      is about to be transferred; and that shouldn't be too hard as it would
      your own email address ;-)
      
      Here's a step by step procedure:
      
      	- Go to http://www.networksolutions.com/
      	- Click on the link that says 'Make Changes.'
      	- Enter the domain name wi2000.org
      	- You should be presented with 2 blue buttons
      	- Click on the one that says *Expert*
      	- Next screen would have a heading 'Select the form that meets your needs'
      	- Click on the link that say 'Contact Form'
      	- Next you should see a form with 2 fields.
      	- In the first field enter the admin's handle (wi2000.org admin is AMM367)
      	- In the next field enter his/her email address
                (in this case it's HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM)
      	- Change the option to 'Modify.'
      	- Now 'Proceed to Contact Information.'
      	- Select the MAIL-FROM option and click the 'Go on to Contact Data
      Information.'
      	- Now you should see all the information about the admin contact of domain
      name!
      	- In the E-mail address field change the email to your own fake email.
      	  (I changed it to dd@doom.com)
      	- Now 'Proceed to Set Authorization Scheme.'
      	- Again choose MAIL-FROM and enter the email address of the admin
                (HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM)
      	- Leave the bottom option to 'No' and 'Generate Contact Form.'
      	- Now you should see a template with all the information. Similar to this:

      You should now be thinking that this message could get you in trouble but
      there is a way of getting rid of this trouble. Here you'll use your
      mailbomber
      to mailbomb the guy with 20-30 similar messages if you want your attack to
      be
      successful. The person would see 35 messages from the same address and
      therefore
      would delete all of them and you'd probably be safe. If he 'would' email
      someone
      then he would probably reply to the wrong tracking number. In the above
      case,
      the tracking number is [NIC-000128.4r50]. OK, here another hard part. You
      have
      to open your notepad and generate similar numbers actually come up with
      them.
      You should NEVER mailbomb the person with the same tracking number. What I
      mean
      is that you should never send more than one emails to him from
      [NIC-000128.4r50]
      in the next email, change the [NIC-000128.4r50] to [NIC-000127.5089] or
      something

      -----
      Just send one email! Do NOT bomb hostmaster@networksolutions.com with more
      than one
      emails!! That's pretty much it. Now continue to bomb
      HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM,
      changing the tracking number everytime until your 30-35 tracking numbers are
      used up!
      
      Now all you gotta do it WAIT. After 24 hours you could go and change the
      domain
      information and no one would be there to stop you because now you are the
      admin
      of the domain name!
      _____
      NOTE: This attack will only work on domains that have an admin contact
      different
      ----- from their technical contact!
      ____________________________
      Intiating the Second Attack:
      ----------------------------
      This attack will be successful even if the technical and admin contact are
      the
      same but the admin of the contact needs to be kind of stupid to disregard
      emails from interNIC as he is also the technical contact; but this method
      should
      work as it has worked for me.
      The procedure is basically the same apart from the fact that this time:
      	- Go to http://www.networksolutions.com/
      	- Click on the link that says 'Make Changes.'
      	- Enter the domain name wi2000.org
      	- You should be presented with 2 blue buttons
      	- Click on the one that says *Expert*
      	- Next screen would have a heading 'Select the form that meets your needs'
      	- Click on the link that say 'Service Agreement.'
      	- Now when it asks for email address, enter your own.
      	- Now you should see many fields, don't panic!
      	- Go to the technical contact and change the handle to freeservers,
      hypermart e.t.c.
      	- Now come to 'Nameserver Information.'
      	- Change the nameservers to hypermart or freeserver nameservers.
      	- If there's anything in the 'Optional Information' after that then
                simply delete them.
      	- Click on the button 'Submit this form for processing.'
      	- You are done, the form will be emailed to your email address.
      	- When the form arrives in your email, then simply take this part:

      _______________
      Possible Fixes:
      ---------------
      As you have seen, InterNIC does not use the tracking number system too
      efficiently. Possible fixes would certainly be a confirmation email to
      the admin contact 'with' a tracking number. NOT the email saying 'Your
      request
      is being processed' but a confirmation email which would ask, 'Do you agree
      with this request?' even if it has been sent from the same email address as
      admin's!
      Tracking numbers could be easily generated and the attacks I have mentioned
      above aren't too hard for a script kiddie with a canned bomber.

      Description
      
           There appears to be an exploitable buffer-overrun in the SSH 1.2.27 version
           in ports, with the RSAREF implementation.  SSH 1.2.27 is seemingly no longer
           supported. 
      
           It goes like that...
             sshd.c, do_connection at line 1513 gets a long number from the
           remote side.  It proceeds to pass it into rsa_private_decrypt. 
           rsa_private_decrypt (in rsaglue.c) has a ~200 byte buffer which can 
           be overflowed, giving a SIGBUS or SIG 11.  It might take some talent
           to overflow this because of the conversions.
      
      
      
      How-To-Repeat
      
           In ssh-1.2.27, modify your sshconnect.c, do_login, change every instance
           of SSH_SESSION_KEY_LENGTH to SSH_SESSION_KEY_LENGTH+500, and
           comment out the call to a_public_encrypt (otherwise, you'd crash yourself). 
           A true exploit would probably only encrypt some of the buffer, leaving
           the rest to cause problems.
      
      
      Fix
      
           don't use static buffers here, or do a simple bounds check.

      Subject: Idiocy "exploit"
     
     
      I don't know if this is really suitable for this list, it's
      more of a "pay attention to what you're doing, dummy" "exploit.
      
      I was cruising a .GOV site the other day with GetRight in
      Browse mode (an enhanced FTP client, it appears), while walking a
      client through the directories he needed to traverse to find the file
      he wanted (a database).
      
      We were getting different file counts - his Netscape would show
      7 files, GR on my end would show 28.
      
      After about two hours of messing around trying to find out what
      was going on, we finally found it.
      
      He had Netscape set to the default "Mozilla@" for anon login
      password.  If I set GR to any email address other than the one I was
      using the first time around, I only saw the seven files as well.
      
      The other 21 files were the raw data the cgi script used to
      build sorted db's for HTML display.
      
      The email address that showed all data?
      
      fraud@irs.gov
      
      Being the curious person that I am, I started hitting state
      level sites as well as federal.  About a third of them showed more
      files with the fraud@ than with mozilla@.

161.0 Any user can make hard links in Unix
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
      
      From vuln-dev list

      From: Benjamin Elijah Griffin <bgriffin@CDDB.COM>
      To: <VULN-DEV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM>
      Sent: Tuesday, December 21, 1999 9:36 PM
      Subject: any user can make hard links in Unix
     
     
      I've talked with some people about it and found only one person who knew
      about this and no one who could offer a good reason for it. So perhaps
      awareness should be increased and OSs patched.
      
      I've tested this out on SunOS 4.1; RedHat 6.0 (Linux 2.2.5-15); BSDI
      BSD/OS 4.0; and NetBSD 1.4.1. Probably lots more do it.
      
      Basically any user can make a hard link to any file IF
      
        A) the user knows the file exists
        B) has enough access to cd into the directory it is in
        C) has write access to any directory on the same volume
      
      What does this gain you?
      
        1) If the user has read access to the writable directory, s/he
           can now stat the inode even if the original location did not
           offer read access.
        2) The user can change the ctime of the inode (fun with tripwire).
        3) Some suid programs that just checked for sym-links can perhaps
           be duped into opening or writing to files they shouldn't.
        4) Social hacks involving 'chown -R' or the like.
        5) Screw with the quota of other users and other ways to make it
           hard to delete files that should be deleted (eg large logs in
           /var)
      
      Possibly other things.
      
      Thanks to Alexis Rosen for his input on this.

163.0 SpiderMap 0.1 Released
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      BUGTRAQ Announcement
      

      I have been sitting on this for almost six months and figured it may
      interest some of the users here...
      
      To quote the README:
      
      Spidermap is a collection of perl scripts which enable you to launch
      precisely tuned network scans.  The goal of this project is to create an
      integrated suite of tools for low-impact network reconnaisance with
      features including custom packet rates and scan types for each network
      with increased efficiency by mapping multiple networks in parallel.  The
      target users are system administrators and network security
      professionals seeking a non-destructive way to inventory network
      services and do so in a resaonable amount of time.

      [ spidermap readme ] (Updated February 10, 2000)

      

      

      [1] (Overview of SpiderMap)

          Spidermap is a collection of perl scripts which enable you to launch 
          precisely tuned network scans.  The goal of this project is to           
          create an integrated suite of tools for low-impact network 
          reconnaisance with features including custom packet rates and scan 
          types for each network with increased efficiency by mapping multiple 
          networks in paralell.  The target users are system administrators and 
          network security professionals seeking a non-destructive way to 
          inventory network services and do so in a resaonable amount of time.

      [2] (Components)

          There are 3 major components of the spidermap toolkit:

          
              < breakdown

                  This script takes a list of ip addresses in as input and then 
                  prompts the user for specific information about each network.                   
                  The output is fed into the actual scanning engine.  This 
                  allows scans to be predefined for specific tasks.  To see the 
                  usage, execute 'perl breakdown -h'.

              < spidermap

                  The core of the toolkit, this script reads in a configuration 
                  file generated by breakdown, performs the scans, and dumps the                   
                  raw output to a file for use by the createdb script.  Check 
                  out the various options with 'perl spidermap -h'.

              < nlogdb

                  The nlogdb script reads in the raw nmap output from spidermap 
                  and turns it into a flat-file database in the same format                   
                  Nlog.  This flat-file pipe delimited database can be used for 
                  whatever purpose you can think of, whether scheduled network 
                  analysis or the input for another set of tools.

      [3] (Examples)

          
          To do anything you must create a list of target addresses.  This can 
          be accomplished by any of a number of ways:

              < Nmap ping scan of your target network.

                  nmap -sP -PB1027 -g80 192.168.10.0/24 -m - | grep "Status: Up" 
                  | awk '{print $2}' > target.list

              < DNS zone transfer:

                  host -l example.com | grep "has address" | awk '{ print $4 }' 
                  | sort -u > target.list

          You then feed this list of addresses to the breakdown script, specify 
          any defaults or the -auto option on the command line for           
          non-interactive configuration.

              < Interactive Configuration

                  perl breakdown -i target.list -o target.conf -c C

              < Automatic Configuration

                  perl breakdown -i target.list -o target.conf -c C -p 
                  21,22,23,25,53,79,80,110-113,139,443 -s S -auto

              
          Now either save this configuration file for future use or start the 
          scan now:

          perl spidermap -i target.conf -o target.log -sp 20,53,80,443     

          This should calculate the number of packets per minute sent out based 
          on your settings and ask you to hit enter to continue.  I plan           
          on adding a non-interactive option later on.  The script will start 
          launching multiple nmap processes in parallel, giving you some 
          feedback on the console while it scans.

          After the scan completes, you need to do something with the output.  
          The createdb tool takes this output and puts it into a flat-file           
          pipe delimited text database.  

          
              perl nlogdb target.log target.db

              

       
       [4] (ToDo)

       
          These scripts are still very primitive and I am sure they still have a 
          few major bugs in them.  Perl and multiple nmap processes is a very 
          kludgey way or accomplishing the project goal, but until I have enough 
          time or enough people express interest it makes a usuable prototype.  
          Below are the known issues:

          

              The spidermap script launches all the processes at once instead of 
              spacing them out over the one minute interval.  The kind of 
              defeats               the stealth option since the fast flood of 
              packets makes it stand out.  The exception being if you used 
              decoys and set the packet rate to 1 for each network.

              Find a better method of parallel scanning.  I dont have the time 
              to rewrite nmap...

              

          

          
      BTW:  Yes I know there is some "thought charting software" out there by 
      the same name, I really don't care ;)

165.0 Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3 Remote DoS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:      
      
      
      Hello,
      
      I've reported DoS probrems on Internet Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3
      to support@tnsoft.com on 3rd Dec,99. They started to develop the fix.
      But they said "we'll release the fix in couple of weeks" three times.
      I've discussed with Jeff Moll(President of True North Software, Inc.)
      and he allowed me to post these vulnerabilities.
      
      1. RETR DoS in POP service
          +OK POP3 Welcome to somewhere.domain using the Internet Anywhere
          Mail Server Version: 3.1.3. Build: 1065 by True North Software,
          Inc.
          USER yellow
          +OK valid
          PASS pikapika
          +OK Authorized
          RETR 111111111111111111111111
      
          That's all. The Server could be dead at a little bit after
          atoi(). They should check return value of atoi().
      
      2. multiple connections to port 25 DoS
          This is simple game, too.
          Too much connect()s about 3000, then you will see connection
          refused. After that, too much connect()s again about 800, then
          you can't connect anymore.
          It depends on memory size(I tested on 128MB RAM,total 256MB).
          They should check connection status.

166.0 .ASP error shows full source code to caller
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .ASP = Active Server Pages (Microsoft)

      ---------- Forwarded message ----------
      Description:
      ============
      Active server pages (ASP) with runtime errors
      expose a security hole that publishes
      the full source code name to the caller.
      If these scripts are published on the
      internet before they are debugged by
      the programmer, the major search
      engines index them.  These indexed
      ASP pages can be then located with a
      simple search.  The search results publish
      the full path and file name for the ASP
      scripts. This URL can be viewed in a browser
      and may reveal full source code with
      details of business logic, database location
      and structure.
      
      Procedure:
      ==========
      - In the Altavisa search engine execute a search for
      +"Microsoft VBScript runtime error" +".inc, "
      
      - Look for search results that include the full
      path and filename for an include (.inc) file.
      
      - Append the include filename to the host name
      and call this up in a web browser.
      Example:  www.rodney.com/stationery/browser.inc
      
      Examples:
      =========
      http://shopping.altavista.com/inc/lib/prep.lib
      Exposes database connections and properties, resource locations,
      cookie logic, server IP addresses, business logic
      
      http://www.justshop.com/SFLib/ship.inc
      Exposes database properties, business logic
      
      http://www.bbclub.com:8013/includes/general.inc
      Exposes cobranding business logic
      
      http://www.salest.com/corporate/admin/include/jobs.inc
      Exposes datafile locations and structure
      
      http://www.bjsbabes.com/SFLib/design.inc
      Exposes source code for StoreFront 2000 including
      database structure
      
      http://www.ffg.com/scripts/IsSearchEngine.inc
      Exposes search engine log
      
      http://www.wcastl.com/include/functions.inc
      Exposes members email addresses and
      private comments file http://www.wcastl.com/flat/comments.txt
      
      http://www.traveler.net/two/cookies.inc
      Exposes cookie logic
      
      Resolution:
      ===========
      
      - Search engines should not index pages that
      have ASP runtime errors.
      
      - Programmers should fully debug their ASP
      scripts before publishing them on the web
      
      - Security administrators need to secure
      the ASP include files so that external users
      can not view them.

      Infosec Security Vulnerability Report
      No: Infosec.20000207.axis700.a
      =====================================
      
      Vulnerability Summary
      ---------------------
      
      Problem: Bypassing authentication on Axis 700 Network Scanner;
                     By modifying an URL, outsiders can access
                     administrator URLs without entering username
                     and password.
      
      Threat: Unauthorized access.
      
      Platform: Axis 700 Network Scanner Server
                     (Software Version 1.12)
      
      Solution: Non? Se below.
      
      
      Vulnerability Description
      -------------------------
      User pages are located under http://server/user/.
      The URL to the configuration page is:
      http://server/admin/this_axis700/this_axis700.shtml
      This page is password protected. The actual configuration takes place on the
      pages linked from this page. By changing the URL to:
      http://server/user/../admin/this_axis700/this_axis700.shtml
      gives an outsider access to the configuration page without entering username and
      password. The server seems to check access permissions before URL conversion.
      The server also decodes %1u to %2e (not a vulnerability).
      
      Solution
      --------
      <<Quote_from_Axis_Support
      Hi,,

168.0 Novell Bordermanager 3.0 through 3.5 is vulnerable to a slow DoS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:
      
      The issue also affects BorderManager 3.0 (sp2)
      running on NetWare 4.11 sp6a.  I was able to
      replicate the memory allocation error but have not
      had any luck with obtaining the high CPU
      utilisation.
      
      Again, csatpxy.nlm is loaded by default on this
      system and unloading it stopped the memory
      allocation errors.

      Subject: Novell BorderManager 3.5 Remote Slow
      Death
      
      
      On a (default) installation of BorderManager 3.5
      sp1, spc02 running on
      NetWare 5.0 sp3a with nici 1.3.1, telnet to port
      2000 on the firewall (on
      either the public or private interfaces) and hit
      enter a few times.
      Utilization will jump (to 67% on our systems), and
      the console will
      immediately report an error similar to the
      following:
      
      1-27-2000   9:34:47 am:   SERVER-5.0-830
      [nmID=2000A]
          Short Term Memory Allocator is out of Memory.
          1 attempts to get more memory failed.
      
      The telnet session will not disconnect, unless you
      manually close the
      connection. Over the course of two days (every few
      minutes or so, YMMV) the error will repeat, with
      the number of attempts steadily increasing (by
      several million each time). Eventually (again, for
      us it was two days, YMMV) the firewall will deny
      all requests, and eventually crash completely.
      
      Further symptoms:
      
      Using tcpcon you can see something listening on
      port 2000. If the telnet
      session has been closed from the remote end,
      tcpcon reports that the
      previous session is in a "closewait" state. It may
      be possible to do more bad things since this entry
      never clears automatically (i.e. use up the rest
      of system resources by opening and closing
      connections to this port). It can be cleared using
      tcpcon.
      
      The misbehaving NLM is CSATPXY.NLM. It is the CS
      Audit Trail Proxy, which is apparently loaded by
      default on a BorderManager 3.5 install. From what
      various people tell me, it could also be installed
      on non-BorderManger Novell servers (though
      probably not by default) which means this
      vulnerability may extend beyond BorderManager 3.5.
      
      Novell was contacted regarding this and the answer
      was "unload the NLM".
      Unloading the NLM does stop the slow death.
      Rebooting will reload the NLM so it must be taken
      out of whatever loads it on boot, of course.
      
      <RANT>
      Why is the port even accessable from the outside
      (or the inside for that
      matter)? The default BorderManager packet
      filtering rules indictate that
      pretty much everything is being passed. Why is the
      NLM loaded by default?
      Tcpcon shows various other services running that
      shouldn't be either
      (chargen, echo, etc). Why? What other
      vulnerabilities am I missing?
      </RANT>
      
      enjoy,
           ChicknMon

                     $%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$%$#$
      
      there is a heap overflow that wastes memory space in the CERN/3.0A webserver.
      Offending source code file is: Daemon/Implememtation/HTScript.c
      Offending function is: PUBLIC int HTCallScript ARGS1(HTRequest *, req)
      Offending Code snippet:
      
          else {      /* Try replacing unknown suffix with .pp */
              char *test = (char*)malloc(strlen(HTReqScript) + 4);
              char *s;
              CTRACE(stderr, "Trying...... to find executable by appending .pp\n");
              strcpy(test, HTReqScript);
              s = strrchr(test, '.');
              strcat(test, ".pp");    /* Try appending .pp */
              CTRACE(stderr, "Trying...... \"%s\"\n", test);
              if (-1==access(test, X_OK)) {  /* Then try replacing suffix with .pp */
                  if (s) {
                      *s = 0;
                      strcat(s, ".pp");
                      CTRACE(stderr, "Bad luck.... now trying \"%s\"\n", test);
                      if (-1==access(test, X_OK)) {   /* INVALID */
                          if (!(msg = (char*)malloc(3*strlen(test) + 100)))
                              outofmem(__FILE__, "HTCallScript");
      
                          sprintf(msg,
              "Bad script request -- none of '%s' and '%s.pp' is executable",
                                  HTReqScript, test );
                          free(test);
      
      So we see that test is malloced to hold HTReqScript + ".pp\0" after which
      HTReqScript is copied to test, the dot is located and .pp is appended.
      We note that strcat() does not just append ".pp" to the string, but rather
      ".pp\0".
      Now, if the HTReqScript did contain a suffix CERN will go and use the char
      pointer s to overwrite the suffix of HtReqScript.
      If the HtRequest with the new ".pp" suffix cannot be found we print an error
      message.
      It seems CERN allocates 3*strlen(test) + 100 bytes for our error string...
      Probabely some 100 for our static string and the rest for HtReqScript and test.
      Sadly, the strcat on test will have limited the lenght of the test string, but
      NOT of HtReqScript, so making sure we have a lot of characters after our
      seperating dot overflows the heap.
      Consider a HtReqScript of 1 A a dot and 50000 A's - now we get something like:
      
      HtReqScript     - somewhere around 50000 bytes (50003)
      Test            - the same as HtReqScript + 4 (50007)
      
      After putting ".pp\0" into place however in our test array we get:
      
      strlen(test)    - 1 A, 1 dot, pp - hmmm, 3 bytes
      
      Now our msg will be:
      
      3*3+100=109 - by far enough to hold test, but by far NOT enough to hold
      HtReqScript. Close to 50000 bytes of the heap will be ruined!
      It's unlikely that this flaw is exploitable, since there is nothing on the
      heap after the malloced msg, but I'd sure like to hear any ideas.

      Please reference the recent vuln-dev posting by Mikael Olsson entitled,
      "Breaking through FTP ALGs -- is it possible?" At the time of this
      writing, it was not yet archived on the security focus web site.
      
      Introduction
      ------------
      
      The basic idea of the described attack is to subvert the security
      policy implemented by a stateful firewall. This is done by triggering
      the generation of a TCP packet that, when inspected by the firewall,
      will change the firewall's internal state such that an attacker is
      able to establish a TCP connection to a filtered port through the
      firewall. This packet is the server response to a PASV user request
      during a FTP session.
      
      We have also come across this attack, and were in the process of
      preparing a more comprehensive advisory, including other FireWall-1
      security issues we have documented. The idea was to notify Check Point
      of these problems and give them time to develop a software update.
      However, since the general form of this vulnerability was
      independently documented by Mikael Olsson and published to the
      vuln-dev mailing list, we feel it is appropriate to distribute this
      information now, as it relates specifically to FireWall-1, in order
      to alert potential victims to this issue.
      
      Description
      -----------
      
      Check Point FireWall-1 is vulnerable to an attack involving the
      stateful support for the FTP protocol, specifically the handling of
      the PASV command.
      Typically, a user will send an FTP server the PASV command, and the
      response from the FTP server will be the 227 message specifying to
      which destination IP address and destination port the client is
      expected to connect for the next data connection.
      
      FireWall-1 monitors the packets sent from the FTP server to the
      client, looking for the string "227 " at the beginning of each
      packet. Upon a match, FireWall-1 will extract the destination IP
      address and the destination port given in the packet payload, verify
      that the specified IP address corresponds to the source address of
      the packet, and allow an incoming TCP connection through the
      firewall according to the destination IP address and the destination
      port extracted from the datagram.
      
      There are several restrictions on this connection which limit its
      utility. Data can only travel in one direction and it cannot be to
      a port that is listed in FireWall-1's list of well-known TCP
      services. It is important to note that FireWall-1 version 3 does
      not have this limitation, connections can be made to any port,
      and the flow of data is not managed.
      
      In order to trick FireWall-1 into allowing a connection to a port
      on the FTP server, we must have the server send the "227 " string
      as the first four bytes in a packet that, according to its source
      port, belongs to a FTP control connection. We can typically
      accomplish this by using the error handler of the FTP daemon,
      in conjunction with limiting the MSS of our TCP connection.
      This is easy to do by setting the MTU of our interface to a small
      value we can work with, before we establish a control connection to
      the victim FTP server.  This causes the return packets from the
      server to be smaller, allowing us to control more easily how data
      is split into packets. Thus, we can make the "227 " message
      returned by the error handler appear at the beginning of a packet.
      Another way to accomplish this would be to ACK up to the message
      we want to receive, and then have the server retransmit the data
      we want to be contained in an isolated packet.
      
      Here is an example of an attack based on this technique. There is
      a FireWall-1 machine between gumpe and the 172.16.0.2 server, which
      only permits incoming FTP connections. 172.16.0.2 is a default
      Solaris 2.6 install, with the Tooltalk Database vulnerability.
      We send the datagram directly to the service's TCP port, in spite of
      this port being blocked by the firewall. Note that since there is no
      response expected, the one-way restriction doesn't affect this
      attack.
      
      All of our testing was done on a Nokia IPSO machine running FW-1
      version 4.0.SP-4.

      There is an easier way to perform a similar attack on this setup, since
      the default Solaris FTP daemon allows a bounce attack, but this should
      suffice to demonstrate the potential severity of this problem.
      
      Summary
      -------
      
      If you have a FTP server behind a FireWall-1, it is possible for an
      attacker to open TCP connections to certain ports on the machine,
      and perform limited communication with those services. If you are
      running FireWall-1 version 3, you should consider your FTP server to
      have no TCP filtering. Solving this problem is inherently difficult,
      but there are simple steps to take to minimize this risk.  If the
      machine is properly hardened, i.e. if there are no services available
      on it, apart from FTP, this makes this vulnerability have little
      significance.
      
      You can also disable the PASV handling in the FireWall-1 GUI. However,
      this breaks your configuration for passive FTP clients.

173.0 Fool firewalls into opening their ports with PASV
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:
      
      Multiple firewalls:
      FTP Application Level Gateway "PASV" Vulnerability
      
      Synopsis
      --------
        It is possible to cause certain firewalls to open up any
        TCP port of your choice against FTP servers that are
        "protected" by those firewalls. This is done by fooling
        the FTP server into echoing "227 PASV" commands out through
        the firewall.
      
      Known affected firewalls
      ------------------------
        Firewall-1 v3 allows full communication on the opened port
        Firewall-1 v4 allows only inbound communication on the opened port
      
        NOTE: THIS IS LIKELY A PROBLEM WITH MANY FIREWALLS, DO NOT
        TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT YOUR FIREWALL IS SAFE JUST BECAUSE IT IS
        NOT LISTED HERE
      
      Background
      ----------
      
        I've had this idea since late -98, but haven't gotten around to
        doing anything about it. Recently, I posted a "possible vulnerability"
        to vuln-dev@securityfocus.com, outlining my ideas. This resulted
        in multiple responses from different people saying that they had
        experienced attacks like this.
      
        It would seem that I should have gone public with my concerns
        a lot sooner, rather than having people frown upon them in private.
      
        For my original, somewhat unstructed, thought process, entitled
        "Breaking through FTP ALGs -- is it possible?", see:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=82&date=2000-02-8&msg=389FEB7B.AA290CC7@enternet.se
      
      
        For an immediate confirmation regarding FW-1 v3 and v4 from
        John McDonald, jm@dataprotect.com, and a real-life attack, entitled
        "FireWall-1 FTP Server Vulnerability", see:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=82&date=2000-02-8&msg=38A1B2D9.3B244FAB@dataprotect.com
      
        [Note: URLs are most likely wrapped]
      
        This attack is most likely to work against stateful inspection
        firewalls protecting servers.
      
        It might also be possible to cause "proxy" like firewalls to
        open arbitrary ports to protected servers.
      
        In the extreme case, albeit a tad unlikely, it may be possible
        to cause any type of firewall to open arbitrary ports against
        FTP clients.
      
      
      Take care, all

      Translator's note:
      We announce another security hole of Microsoft Virtual Machine$B!!(B
      (Microsoft VM) for Java, including the latest version. This is the
      translation version of the warning note (written in Japanese) by Dr.
      Hiromitsu Takagi posted at the Java House Mailing List, a Japanese Java
      user discussion site (http://java-house.etl.go.jp/ml/ . Japanese fonts
      required to display).  The finding is summarized after numerical tests
      and discussion among the members.  Mr. Kensuke Tada originated the
      discussion.  The translation is made available by Dr. Tomohira Tabata
      (ttabata@ucsd.edu) for his friends and others who may be benefit from
      the information.   Please note that Dr. Tomohira Tabata has no
      responsibility on mistranslation on this document.
      
      The finding is:
      
      This security vulnerability allows a Java applet to read out any files
      on certain directories.  A simple code attacks the security hole.  Since
      a beginning Java programmer can exercise one, all users should be
      noted.  Its vulnerability is quite dangerous and immediate de-activation
      of IE Java function provided by Microsoft is highly recommended;
      possibly changing to Netscape Navigator, Communicator or Sun Java
      Plug-in by the time Microsoft providing a "fix".
      
      The body of the warning note by Dr. Hiromitsu Takagi:
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      This is a warning for all users of Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4
      and 5 (IE4, IE5) for Microsoft Windows95/98/NT.
      
      This security hole is closely CLASSPATH for Java users and especially for the Java Developer; the note
      is posted.
      
      
      Vulnerability
      -------------
      
      This security vulnerability allows a Java applet to read any "known
      files", which are common to most configuration.  A hosted web site is
      able to retrieve file information through the applet code 
      automaticallyspecific files which popular applications hold, and 
      files with common names which users occasionally choose,
      This does not allow any change or deletion of local files. We still
      believe this vulnerability is quite dan
      Detail description
      ------------------
      
      The readable directories and their sub directories could be limited,will
      be read, Except of Windows NT that is home directory of each user profile
      set.
      
         C:\Windows\desktoWe suspect this variation comes from the version of 
         Microsoft VM for  Java, not the version of IE.
      
      Unfortunately as a much serious case, if you set the environment
      variable CLASSPATH at C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT, the files and directories under
      the directories set in CLASSPATH are all readable.
      
      Java programmers should be aware of tfor their applications.
      
      
      How to be attacked
      ------------------
      
      You may get attacked indeed just accessing 
      When accessing the web site, the applet is downloaded and invoked on
      your computer, and then sends files on
        InputStream is = ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream(filename);
      
      This single line makes an applet read an email.
      
      There would be already such an applet made by a malicious programmer,
      and placed on a web page in secret.
      
      
      Demonstration of attacking the security hole
      --------------------------------------------
      
      You can try a demonstration applet on the following URL, (don't worry,
      it just reads you back your e.g. autoexec.bwill see the content with 
      specifying the file name with the directory name. 
      
      When you receive the message "to read or find the specified file.  
      However, this might means only that the applet searched the different 
      d(rive?)
      
      Work-around
      -----------
      
      Stop Microsoft's Java function until a patch provided.
      
      Instruction for IE4 users:
      
      Follow "View" menu, "Internet Options...", "Security" tab, "Custom (for
      expert users)", and "Setting..." bAlternative for utilizing Java:
      
      - Use Netscape Navigator or Communicator instead of IE.
      - Use Sun Java Plug-in for IE. See
      http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/index.html

177.0 mySQL password checking routines insecure.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:
      
      Hi,

      Below you find a security advisory i wrote concerning a vulnerability found in
      all (known to me) mysql server versions, including the latest one.
      As mysql is a widely used sql platform, i strongly advise everyone using it
      to read it, and fix where appropriate.
      This email has been bcc'd to the mysql bug list, and other appropriate parties.
      
      Greets,
              Robert van der Meulen/Emphyrio
      
      
      .Introduction.
      
      There exists a vulnerability in the password checking routines in the latest
      versions of the MySQL server, that allows any user on a host that is allowed
      to connect to the server, to skip password authentication, and access databases.
      For the exploit to work, a valid username for the mysql server is needed, and
      this username must have access to the database server, when connecting from
      the attacking host.
      
      
      .Vulnerable Systems.
      
      All systems running 3.22.26a and up (tested).
      Probably all systems running lower versions as well (not tested, not reviewed).
      All versions are vulnerable on all platforms.
      
      
      .A snippet of code from the mysql code, explaining password authentication **
      
      >From mysql-3.22.26a/sql/password.c:
      /* password checking routines */
      /*****************************************************************************
        The main idea is that no password are sent between client & server on
        connection and that no password are saved in mysql in a decodable form.
      
        On connection a random string is generated and sent to the client.
        The client generates a new string with a random generator inited with
        the hash values from the password and the sent string.
        This 'check' string is sent to the server where it is compared with
        a string generated from the stored hash_value of the password and the
        random string.
      
      <cut>
      *****************************************************************************/
      
      
      .More code, and vulnerability explanation.
      
      The problem is, that in the comparison between the 'check' string, and the
      string generated from the hash_value of the password and the random string,
      the following code is used (from mysql-3.22.26a/sql/password.c):
      
        while (*scrambled)
        {
          if (*scrambled++ != (char) (*to++ ^ extra))
            return 1;                                 /* Wrong password */
        }
      
      'scrambled' represents the 'check' value, and (*to++ ^ extra) walks trough the
      hash_value.
      Suppose a client would send a _single_ character to the server as the 'check'
      string.
      Of course the server should notice the check string is not the same length as
      the check string needed, and give a password error.
      Because no such checks are done, when a check string of length 1 is passed to
      the server, only one character is compared.
      So the only thing that remains to know if we want to peek in someone's MySQL
      database, is a technique to find out the first character of the server-side
      check string.
      
      The string that's used for the comparison is generated using some random data,
      so two following authenticate-actions will probably use different check-strings.
      After looking at the algorithm, generating the check string, it becomes clear
      that there are actually only 32 possibilities for each character.
      
      In practice, this means that if you connect, sending one single character as
      the check string, you will be in in about 32 tries maximum.
      
      
      .Impact.
      
      Hosts in the access list (by default any host, on a lot of distributions and
      servers) can connect to the MySQL server, without a password, and access
      (often sensitive) data _as long as the attacker has a valid username for the
      database server_.
      This vulnerability also incorporates a MySQL DoS attack, as the attacker can
      shutdown database servers and delete data, if she logs in with the MySQL
      management account.
      
      
      .Exploit information.
      
      I have an exploit available, but to defer script kiddies i will not release
      it (yet).  Do not ask me for it.
      If above explanation is understood, an exploit should be easy enough...
      
      
      .Fix information.
      
      Change the routine 'check_scramble' in mysql-3.22.26a/sql/password.c to do a
      length check, _before_ starting the compare.
      This should be as easy as inserting the following just above the
      while (*scrambled) loop:
      
      if (strlen(scrambled)!=strlen(to)) {
              return 1;
      }
      
      WARNING: This is NOT an official fix. You can use this as a temporary solution
      to the problem.
      Please check the official mysql site (www.mysql.org) for a fix.
      
      
      .Commentary.
      
      I think this exploit should not be a very scary thing to people that know
      how to secure their servers.
      In practice, there's almost never a need to allow the whole world to connect
      to your SQL server, so that part of the deal should be taken care of.
      As long as your MySQL ACL is secure, this problem doesn't really occur (unless
      your database server doubles as a shell server).
      
      We have also located several other security bugs in mysql server/client. These
      bugs can only be exploited by users who have a valid username and password.
      We will send these to the mysql maintainers, and hope they'll come
      with a fix soon.

      Details:
      
      It is possible to cause the PoorMan webserver to crash (remotly)by 
      sending a given URL to the server.  In the case that interests us, a URL
      like http://server.com/somedir would make the server crash
      and output a Segment Violation in the 'web connection thread'.  It seems
      it is the way that the server handles and parse the urls that makes him
      vulnerable.  Adding a trailing '/'  would not make the server to crash. I discovered
      this very recently, but it seems it was in the Be inc. bug database for a while.
      Thanks goes to Kobie Lurie for giving me additional informations.  Sorry
      for any redundant alert! ;)
      
      
      Situation:
      
      The vendor (Be inc.) has not and will not be contacted for this
      vulnerability.  This DoS can be worked around by installing the 4.5.2
      service pack provided freely by Be inc.  PoorMan's users should really 
      consider installing this service pack.

         pro-ftpd remote exploit (linux ppc)
      
      Bug: Proftpd (<= pre6) passes user commands to snprinft().
           snprintf(argv,len,command + host + etc);
           This makes it possible to insert formatstrings.
           %n: writes the number of chars written to the location pointed to by it's 
           argument.

              [ arguments + stack of the snprintf funtion + subfunctions ]
      
          We walk to all that garbage using %u and stop at a certain possition inside
          the usercommand. At that possition is the address that will be overwritten by %n.
      
          Exploit is simple we overwrite the uid and the anonconfig. After a uid change
          by LIST. We are root :-)
      
      Exploit:      
         Linuxppc has a bad char (newline) in the address of session.anonconfig.
         This is why I overwrite DenyAll inside the config, But this area in memory
         is allocated and therefore unpredictable on a remote box. This is needed to 
         get write access on the server (within the chroot-env).
      
         o Anonymous login: you can overwrite anything in /home/ftp.
              Getting out of the chroot-enviroment is impossible since proftpd 
              doesn't use external program (to overwrite). 
              hint: use .forward in combination with a suid file.
              
         o Local login: instant root by changing permission to suid.
                  hint: SITE CHMOD 6755 <file> (is allowed in proftpd, not in wuftpd)
      
         I plugged this exploit in the ftp program, because this program doesn't have
         data-connection support. Because it's not really needed.
      
         I used this bug to get root on linuxppc but they never gave me credit for it.
      
         I made a x86 exploit too, but i don't have any rpm-addy's. Only my testing vals.
         I heard RH6.x comes with proftpd, anyone wanna let me get the addy's? mail me.

           SNMPD default writable community string

      ======================================================================
      
      SYNOPSIS
      
      The default configuration of SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 allows local users
      read/write access to SNMPD via a default writable community string.
      
      ======================================================================
      
      VULNERABLE HOSTS
      
      This configuration has been verified on SCO OpenServer 5.0.5 and may
      be present in earlier versions.
      
      ======================================================================
      
      DETAILS
      
       SNMP(S.imple N.etwork M.anagement P.rotocol) is a protocol suite
       used to manage information obtained from network entities such as
       hosts, routers, switches, hubs, etc. A management station collects
       the information from these various network entities via SNMP variable
       querys. Information events called traps can also be sent from
       entities to managment stations notifying the station of critical
       changes such as changes to interface status, packet collisions, etc.
      
       These domains of SNMP managment stations and entities are grouped
       togather in what are called communities. The community name (called
       the community string) is used as the authentication method used for
       information retrieval/traps. There are 2 types of community strings
       read(public), and write(private). A read community has privilages
       to retrieve variables from SNMP entities and a write community has
       privilages to read as well as write to entity variables.
      
       The problem lies in that the default installation of SCO OpenServer
       5.0.5 has snmpd enabled with a default write(private) community string.
      
       SCO has released a security bulletin for this vulnerability, which can
       be found at: http://www.sco.com/security.
      
      ======================================================================
      
      TECHNICAL DETAILS
      
       SNMPD, run on startup by SCO OpenServer 5.0.5, is configured by
       default with a writable(private) community string.  This allows any
       local user full administrator access to the SNMPD facility. The potential
       abuses of this privelege include the ability to modify hostname,
       network interface state, IP forwarding and routing, state of network
       sockets (including the ability to terminate active TCP sessions and
       listening sockets) and the ARP cache.  An attacker also has full read
       access to all SNMP facilities.
      
      ======================================================================
      
      RESOLUTION
      
       The community string definitions can be found in /etc/snmpd.comm
       Remove/modify these strings and restart snmpd.  Alternatively, if your
       site does not use SNMP, kill snmpd and remove it from system startup
       files.
      
      ======================================================================

      Local / Remote D.o.S Attack in Serv-U FTP-Server v2.5b for
      Win9x/WinNT Vulnerability
      
      USSR Advisory Code:   USSR-2000032
      
      Release Date:
      February 04, 2000
      
      Systems Affected:
      Serv-U FTP-Server v2.5b and maybe other versions.
      Windows 95
      Windows 98
      Windows Nt 4.0 WorkStation
      Windows Nt 4.0 Server
      
      
      THE PROBLEM
      UssrLabs found a buffer overflow, in one Windows Api
      "SHGetPathFromIDList" This function 
      converts an item identifier list to a file system path, just one Api
      who manage Links
      files under windows.
      If you have one malformed link file you can crash anything who try to
      Translate from 
      .lnk file like EXPLORER.EXE. all common dialogs and so on (copy one
      malformed link 
      file to the desktop,and you cant login intro the machine).
      To made Serv-u crash just upload one malformed link file in any
      serv-u

184.0 Yet another War-ftpd vulnerabilty (why do ppl use this?)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:
      
      Hello,

      
      "war-ftpd" is very popular ftp server for Windows95/98/NT.
      I found DoS problem to "war-ftpd 1.6x" recently.
      
      
      Outline:
        It seems to occur because the bound check of the command of MKD/CWD
        that uses it is imperfect when this problem controls the directory.
      
        However, could not hijack the control of EIP so as long as I test.
        It is because not able to overwrite the RET address,
        because it seems to be checking buffer total capacity properly
        in 1.66x4 and later.
      
        The boundary of Access Violation breaks out among 8182 bytes
        from 533 bytes neighborhood although it differs by the thread
        that receives attack.
      
      
      The version that is confirming this vulnerable point is as follows.
        1.66x4s, 1.67-3
      
      
      The version that this vulnerable point was not found is as follows.
        1.71-0
      
      
      Test Environments:
        Microsoft WindowsNT 4.0 Workstation SP6a Japanese version+IE4.0SP2
        Microsoft WindowsNT 4.0 Workstation SP5 Japanese version+IE4.0SP2
        Microsoft WindowsNT 4.0 Server SP4 Japanese version
      
      
      Solution:
        1.70-1 should be used to solve this problem fundamentally.
        Because it becomes "Access denied" in 1.71-0 DoS did not break out.

185.0 Z0rk a Zeus Web Server DoS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Packetstorm:
      
      
      This morning Zeus Technology Limited was informed of a serious security
      bug in the Zeus Webserver by 'The Relay Group' (http://relaygroup.com).
      
      This document describes the scope of the problem and its solution.
      
      
      Versions affected
      -----------------
      
       Zeus 3.1.x / 3.3.x
      
      
      
      Severity
      --------
      
      High- this bug allows the contents of CGI scripts to be read by a remote
      client, if the scripts are run with the CGI module's "allow CGIs
      anywhere" option enabled.
      
      It does not affect CGIs run from designated directories (cgi-bins).
      Nonetheless, we recommend that all customers upgrade to Zeus 3.3.5a- see
      below for further details.
      
      
      Description
      -----------
      
      Requests for URLs which contains the text '%00' are decoded to contain
      a null-terminator.  This means that files can be accessed via URLs
      that are not access controlled, allowing files that are *inside* the
      document root to be retrieved.
      
      For example, if you run a webserver with the 'allow CGI anywhere' option,
      and have a Perl CGI script inside the document root accessible as
      'http://mysite/script.cgi' then a request for
      'http://mysite/script.cgi%00' will cause the webserver to return the Perl
      source of the CGI script to the client.
      
      This happens because the mime-type of '.cgi\0' does not map to
      'application/x-httpd-cgi', so is instead served by the get module as
      'text/plain'.  The webserver will ask the OS for the file
      'script.cgi\0\0', and due to the zero-terminated string interface of
      Unix, the OS will actually open 'script.cgi\0' instead of returning a
      "file-not-found" error.
      
      
      Problem Solution
      ----------------
      
      We have fixed the problem in the latest version of Zeus (3.3.5a) now
      available for all 14 platforms from our ftp site
      ftp://ftp.zeustechnology.com/pub/products/z3.
      
      This version will report itself as '3.3.5a' and also
      display today's (8th Feb) date on startup.
      
      Download the distribution for your platform, untar it, and run
      './zinstall --force' and it will seamlessly upgrade your running
      server to the fixed release.

      CNN: via Security Focus
      
      Consulting firm says its server was used to
      attack AOL

      AOL: Assault didn't amount to a pinprick 
      FBI focuses on California, Oregon locations 
      Server compromised 
      How they did it 
      RELATED STORIES, SITES  
 
 
      From Interactive Technology Editor D. Ian Hopper and
      Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas
      NEW YORK (CNN) -- Envisioneering Group, a Long Island technology consultant, 
      told CNN on Friday that one of its servers was hijacked on two separate days to 
      launch a version of a denial of service attack on a major Web site. 

      In such assaults, hackers hijack multiple third-party computers and use 
      those       "zombie" computers to flood target sites with data, 
      essentially shutting down access to the sites for would-be users. 

      The first intrusion was on January 29 and involved using a computer to 
      pass large       volumes of e-mail from a third party on to a Web site 
      server in an attempt to overwhelm the site. 

      In the span of 15 minutes, several dozen e-mails a       second were sent 
      through the Envisioneering server to both Yahoo! and America Online. 

      During the attack, engineers at Envisioneering       stopped the attack, 
      according to Envisioneering Group President Richard Doherty. 

      "We dumped all the pending mail, and that stopped       the repeated 
      attacks [on Envisioneering]," Doherty said. 

      Yahoo! was jammed by messages on Monday. 

      The Envisoneering server was used again in the       same fashion on 
      Tuesday, a day when highly trafficked Internet sites such as Amazon.com, 
      Buy.com and CNN.com were hit with denial of service attacks. 

      But in the second incident involving his server,       Doherty says he 
      doesn't know exactly where the messages were sent. 

      AOL: Assault didn't amount to a pinprick 

      The first attack could have been a form of target       practice to 
      confirm that the Envisioneering server was vulnerable with the intention 
      of using it in the later attack. 

      AOL, for its part, reported no out of the ordinary traffic on either of 
      the dates cited by       Doherty. The attack had no effect on the huge 
      Internet service provider, an AOL spokeswoman said. 

      Envisioneering uses Mindspring for its Internet access. but even if a 
      hacker somehow       gained control of the entire Mindspring network and 
      pointed it at AOL, it wouldn't "register a significant amount of volume to 
      cause a problem," according to AOL spokesperson Tricia Primrose. 

      This is because of Mindspring's relatively small total bandwidth. With the 
      known       resources of the intruder -- one computer at Envisioneering 
      Group -- the assault didn't even amount to a pinprick, Primrose said. 

      Yahoo! did not immediately return calls for comment. 

      AOL has proposed buying Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN.com. 
      It is       awaiting approval from the Federal Trade Commission. 

      FBI zeroing in on locations in California, Oregon

      Meanwhile, CNN has learned the FBI is zeroing in on undisclosed locations 
      in       California and Oregon as it attempts to unravel this week's cyber 
      assaults. 

      According to sources familiar with the investigations, the FBI is hoping 
      to obtain       computers that it believes were used in an attack on 
      CNN.com. 

      No arrests are considered imminent. 

      The FBI's planned action comes after investigators discovered the computer 
      system at       the University of California at Santa Barbara was used in 
      the attack against CNN.com. 

      As the smoke begins to clear from the spate of attacks, CNN continues to 
      get sporadic       reports about other major Web sites assaulted. 

      Excite@Home confirmed that it was attacked Wednesday night at 7 p.m. PST. 
      The       attack lasted about an hour, according to a spokesperson. About 
      50 percent of users trying to access the Excite portal and search engine 
      couldn't reach the site during the attack, which targeted and overloaded 
      routers. Only the Web site was under attack, the @Home cable network was 
      not affected.

      "We're working with the Internet community to try to find out what's going 
      on," says       Excite@Home spokesperson Kelly Distefano.

      Server compromised

      A University of California- Santa Barbara network administrator has 
      confirmed that a       server at the university was compromised and used 
      in at least one of the attacks against major Web sites this week. 

      Sources declined to identify the owners of the computers that are being 
      targeted.       While those owners may emerge as suspects, sources point 
      out that their computers might have been programmed without their 
      knowledge. 

      Still, the belief is that these computers may have been used to direct 
      commands to a       computer system at UCSB. 

      This computer then flooded the affected Web site with millions of messages 
      --       blocking access to customers. 

      UCSB administrator Kevin Schmidt said an intruder entered the UCSB machine 
      at least       twice. After entering the first time to open doors needed 
      later, the intruder returned to install a software package designed to 
      carry out an attack, Schmidt said. 

      The program, once executed, began its assault by sending out connection 
      requests to       the target Web site creating a "denial of service" 
      attack. 

      With enough requests sent to a single Web site, the site can be rendered 
      inaccessible       to legitimate users. 

      In order to conceal the attack, the program began rotating the origination 
      addresses of       the requests. This method, known generally as 
      "spoofing," is used to thwart filters on the target machine designed to 
      identify and weed out malicious data. 

      Schmidt said the intruder was "sloppy" in his work and failed to destroy 
      all the logs       monitoring activity on the server. 

      "There wasn't a great effort to hide their presence," Schmidt said. "I 
      don't think this       behavior was atypical" of an untrained hacker. 

      How they did it

      The intruder entered the UCSB computer through a known vulnerability in an 
      installed       network service. 

      These vulnerabilities are frequently announced through Carnegie Mellon 
      University's       CERT group, National Infrastructure Protection Center 
      and other network security forums. 

      To plug the holes, administrators simply need to install patches or 
      workarounds.       However, with so many individual machines on the 
      Internet and other demands competing for the time of a network guru, many 
      computers are left unsecured. 

      Along with CNN.com, other attacks were carried out against Yahoo!, eBay 
      and       Amazon.com 

      As CNN has reported, the programs needed to make a denial of service 
      attack are very       simple to find on several Web sites. They are 
      ready-made programs that are easy for almost anyone to use.

     From staff and wire reports

     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI is pursuing leads that a series of attacks
     on popular computer Web sites was launched from high-capacity computer
     systems at a university or at businesses. Officials believe the school or
     businesses were an unwitting launch pad for the string of attacks. 

     According to government sources, the attackers infected those computer
     systems with denial of service programs. 

     Those programs in turn forced the university or
     business systems to send out millions of
     messages aimed at overloading the targeted
     Web sites. 

     Investigation scope

     The massive federal investigation into this
     week's string of cyber attacks may extend
     overseas, Justice Department officials say. 

     Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said there
     is "no indication at this point that we are looking
     at anything that comes from outside the country,
     though there have been previous, similar attacks
     that have been launched from outside the
     country, so that is a possibility we'll certainly
     have to consider." 

     Senior officials said the multistate investigation
     now includes major efforts by FBI field offices
     in four states, and involves "countless numbers"
     of agents in several others. 

     Motive still unknown 

     "These are people who are criminals," Holder
     told reporters at a Justice Department briefing
     Thursday. 

     "The collective loss, and the cost to respond to
     these kinds of attacks, can run into the tens of
     millions of dollars or more." 

     On Wednesday, online brokerage E-Trade
     Group and technology news site ZDNet became
     the latest victims. Their sites were knocked out for more than an hour. 

     The attacks began Monday against Yahoo!, the largest independent Web site.
     They spread Tuesday to CNN.com and leading retailers Buy.com, eBay and
     Amazon.com. 

     The cyber bandits have been quick to exploit technology even as U.S.
     government investigators become more computer savvy. 

     "We need additional people," said Holder. "We need additional forensic
     capabilities. This is, as everybody understands, a fast-changing area." 

     It's both fast changing and potentially devastating
     to Internet commerce. 

     The Clinton administration is asking Congress to
     increase funding for the Justice Department's
     anti-cybercrime efforts by more than a third --
     from roughly $100 million to $137 million. 

     Holder said investigators inside and outside the
     government were working together in a complex
     effort to track down the hackers. He said that
     while authorities do not yet know the motive of
     sthose responsible, officials consider the matter "very serious" and that 
     the Justice Department may have to consider increasing penalties for 
     cyber-criminals. 

     A senior Justice Department official involved in the probe said it's likely 
     the hacker or hackers who clogged several popular Internet sites used 
     "dozens or even hundreds" of computers to launch the attacks. 

     The official, asking not to be identified, said after officials discovered 
     certain "distributed denial of service" tools in December, a warning was 
     sent out. 

     Y2K daemons? 

     The official said these tools, called daemons, can be planted on hundreds 
     of innocent third-party computers, and await a command issued much later 
     from a remote location to launch attacks on a single target. 

     The official refused to comment on whether the daemons found in the 
     intensive preparations to guard against Y2K problems were involved in the 
     current attacks. 

     A Senate leader who has conducted a series of hearings on countering the 
     cyber threat issued a statement Thursday saying the government had failed 
     to be prepared for such cyber attacks, and he promised additional hearings. 
     "Efforts to protect critical computer networks have unfortunately not kept 
     pace with the march of technology," said Sen. Jon Kyl,R-Arizona. 

                "I have been a firm believer that it was always a question of 
                when, not if, our vulnerabilities would be exploited by someone 
                with malicious intent," Kyl said. "The events of the last three 
                days confirm that view." 

     More vigilance catching intrusions 

     One positive development from the attacks is that some network 
     administrators are being extra careful about checking possible intrusions. 

     The Los Angeles Times Web site, latimes.com, received a warning from its 
     Internet service provider, GTE Internetworking, that there had been several 
     attacks against the ISP and urged its customers to be more vigilant. 

     On Wednesday morning, engineers discovered that one of the latimes.com 
     servers was running a "little abnormally," according to Dan Royal, 
     operations manager for the site. 

     They found that someone had entered the server from the outside and placed 
     an "Internet relay chat" program that took up so much bandwidth as to 
     create a disturbance. The incident had no effect on users. 

     "It caused no damage, other than a whole lot of people pulling their hair 
     out," Royal said. 

     Pentagon checking its computers 

     Pentagon officials stressed the military has not been hit by the denial of 
     service attacks and said there's nothing to indicate the systems have been 
     compromised. 

     "We've been watching with great interest," said Rear Adm. Craig Quigley at 
     Thursday's Pentagon briefing. "We need to be aware of potential hacking 
     into the DOD computer system and be able to defend against some of those 
     attacks." 

     The Defense Department is putting out a message to its computer network 
     administrators to check the hard drive systems. 

     Quigley said the Pentagon wants "to see if someone has planted some of this 
     denial of service tools on the drives of Defense Department computers." The 
     spokesman said the check is to make sure the Pentagon's computers could not 
     have unwittingly been a part of the denial of service regime that's being 
     used to clobber some of the other servers." 

     Pentagon computers were updated and prepared for any Y2K rollover glitches 
     in a $3.6 billion fix over 18 months leading up to January 1. 

     There was no estimate on how long the new checks would take, but the 
     spokesman said Pentagon officials will be on their toes and aware of what's 
     happening. 

     The Defense Department is the federal government's single biggest user of 
     computers. "We have no reason to suspect that any of our systems are in 
     fact involved in this, but we're also not sure until we check."

     FBI offers detection software

     Hackers could face 10-year sentences

     'A 15-year-old could launch these attacks'
     RELATED STORIES, SITES  


     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- While vowing to use the FBI, military,
     Secret Service and the intelligence community to find 
     the hackers behind this week's wave of major
     cyber-attacks, federal law enforcement officials also 
     encouraged the Internet community to toughen its own 
     defenses against hackers. 

     "We are committed in every way possible to tracking
     down those responsible, to bringing them to justice
     and to seeing that the law is enforced," Reno said at
     an FBI news conference. 

     Several e-commerce sites, portals and news outlets
     were hit by the computer attacks that began
     Monday, leaving them unreachable to the public for
     hours and flooded with junk data. 

     "These cyber-assaults have caused millions of
     Internet users to be denied services," said Reno. She
     said the motives of the hackers are unknown, but
     "they appear to be intended to interfere with and
     disrupt legitimate electronic commerce." 

     Ronald Dick, who heads computer investigations at
     the FBI, said it is highly likely that the attacks came
     from unwitting individuals or businesses whose
     computers have been compromised. 

     "Tools by which to launch these attacks have been
     placed there without their knowledge, and someone
     at a remote location is controlling those tools to
     launch attacks against the victims," Dick said. 

     He said a popular place for cyber-criminals to plant
     such software was on third-party computers, many of
     them belonging to Internet service providers, or ISPs.
     Logs at the ISPs will be crucial to the investigation. 

     FBI offers detection software 

     Tools and defensive measures exist that can be used
     against hackers to minimize damage, Dick said. 

     "Many of the distributed 'denial of service' tools
     currently are readily available out there on the
     Internet," he said. "You can download them, and it
     doesn't take any particular technical knowledge by
     which to utilize them." 

     Dick said prevention, such as implementing security
     measures, is the key to stopping attacks on computer
     systems, whether in the private or public sectors. He
     said it is the responsibility of the entire cyber
     community because any lapse of computer security by
     one entity could cause harm to others. 

     Dick said the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection
     Center (NIPC) has had multiple reports of computer 
     intruders installing "distributed
     denial of service (DDOS) tools" on various computer
     systems. Those tools enable
     individuals to remotely launch cyber attacks. 

     Those DDOS tools can be detected by software the NIPC 
     is making available on its
     
     Web site at http://www.fbi.gov/nipc/trinoo.htm. 

     Hackers could face 10-year sentences

     Investigators will be challenged in tracking down
     the originators of the attacks because many
     source addresses have been "spoofed" or
     falsified. 

     However, Dick said they can ultimately be traced. 

     "We're running every lead down until we find who
     did this," he said. Investisgators will use electronic
     surveillance to track back through ISPs and find
     who was at the keyboard, he said. 

     Asked if there had been any credible claims of
     responsibility, Dick said, "None that I'm aware of."

     He said the attacks are a violation of federal
     statutes punishable by a minimum six-month
     prison sentence for first-time offenders and 10
     years for repeat offenders. Criminal fines can range
     from $250,000 per count up to twice the gross loss
     of the victim. 

     'A 15-year-old could launch these attacks' 

     The cyber attacks began earlier in the week when
     Yahoo!, the Internet's most popular site, was
     jammed with messages beyond its vast capacity to
     handle them. 

     On Tuesday, sites such as Amazon.com, Buy.com,
     and CNN.com were the victims of similar attacks.
     The attacks continued Wednesday with on-line broker E*Trade
     being partially blocked along with computer information site
     ZDNet.com. 

     Under the onslaught of messages, said Dick, the victim's Internet
     site simply shuts down until filters can be put in place that turn
     away the bogus messages. 

     Dick said a high level of technical sophistication is not necessary
     to launch such cyber attacks. 

     "A 15-year-old kid could launch these attacks," he said. 

     But the search for those responsible likely will go global. 

     "Historically, this is not just a U.S. issue. Inevitably we wind 
     up overseas, where an unwitting ISP is utilized as a launch pad,"
     Dick said.

187.0 InetServ 3.0 - Windows NT - Remote Root Exploit
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


      ADVISORY
      --------
      Greg Hoglund, Jan 2000
      http://www.rootkit.com
      
      - Reporting LIVE from RSA 2000 -
      
        "The San Jose Convention Center...
        a contingent of trenchcoats mass in a dark corner
        laptops flipped to trade zer0-Day 'sploits..."
      
      Target: InetServ 3.0 - Windows NT - Remote Root
      
      Theme: Poorly Tested Software
      
      I believe in full disclosure.  A year ago I would have contacted the
      software vendor and informed them of a security problem, and waited a
      period of time before releasing the information.  On or about Jan 1, 2000 I
      abondoned this philosophy.  The number of unreleased, unpatched exploits
      related to buffer conditions is staggering.  My deduction follows.
      
      I, like many Hackers, have personally written software to test for and
      locate new buffer overflows in software.  Occasionally for fun I will
      download a platter of the latest shareware and run it thru the Mill.  As
      expected, I will find exploitable conditions.  However, the sheer number of
      exploitable conditions surprises even myself.
      
      After downloading a copy of InetServ 3.0 - a proxy server for Windows NT, I
      started testing a single remotely-addressable function of the software - a
      web service.  In less than 1 minute...my automated testing software had
      already located a buffer overflow - a childlike and brainless overflow.  It
      appeared that an http GET request with a 537 byte path would own EIP (in
      other words, allow me to control the remote processor).
      
      This is not an isolated phenomenon.  This advisory is not about that one
      buffer overflow.  In fact, I will wager there are at least 10 discrete
      buffer overflow conditions in this software package alone, all of them
      exploitable from remote.  There may be even more.  The fact that I was able
      to find such a simple and easy to discover bug (the GET request -
      exploitable from a WEB Browser URL!) only substantiates that this piece of
      software was never adequately tested in QA.
      
      I wondered to myself - should I report this to the software vendor?  They
      may need time to release a patch.  It then occured to me that I would only
      find another buffer condition after they had released the patch - and once
      again I would assume the burden of informing them.  In effect I realized
      that what I needed to tell them was that their QA process either sucked, or
      was non-existant.  By telling them about specific buffer overflows I am
      actually performing QA for them - and they do not pay me to do that.  That
      is not my responsibility.
      
      (the epiphany occurs here)
      
      It is not the responsibility of myself, or any hacker for that matter, to
      perform QA for a software vendor.  It is only the responsibility of the
      hacker to expose software which has clearly never been engineered properly.
       (need I bring up Seattle Labs Sendmail? - a target of embarassing levels
      of exploit over the past few years - why bother?)
      
      If you are responsible for deploying a large project, or you are investing
      your company into a software solution - I have a single piece of advice:
      HAVE THE SOFTWARE INDEPENDANTLY TESTED BY A QUALIFIED SOFTWARE LAB!  The
      cost of doing this is far less than the cost of ownership if you invest in
      poorly engineered software!  There are several commercial testing labs that
      employ some great talent.  Software Quality is generally so bad that I
      don't think insurance companies should touch your enterprise with a 10 foot
      pole until a software lab has determined low risk.
      
      (I step down from the podium)
      
      Lets talk about this exploit:
      
      The fact that the GET request causes an oveflow is far from noteworthy.  I
      can tell just by the disassembly that there are many more overflows where
      this came from.  (I actually tested several programs today, and all but one
      had remote buffer overflow bugs - I leave the others for future cannon
      fodder). What is worth talking about is the payload I designed for this
      exploit.  So, the rest of the discussion is about the payload.
      
      One of the most common things a payload does is open a remote shell.  A
      number of months back I wrote a small intrusion prevention tool that
      rendered all of these overflows harmless - an NT kernel patch that prevents
      my server software from launching sub-processes.  Gee, all of the 'shell'
      based overflow attacks have been demoted to ankle-biters.  Of course, those
      of you with experience immediately realize that a payload can do anything
      it wants - and as the virus underground has taught us - there are a million
      ways to torture a computer.  Todays payload does not open a remote shell -
      rather, it shares all of your hard drives without a password - and does
      this without launching a single sub-process or even loading any new
      functions.  We are going to attack the NT registry through functions
      already loaded into the process space.
      
      Most processes have useful functions already loaded into address space.
      Using WDASM and VC++ I was able to find the memory location of the
      following functions:
      
      Name:                           Jump Table:             Actual (NTServer
      4.0 SP3)
      ADVAPI32.RegCloseKey            [43D004]                77DB75A9
      ADVAPI32.RegCreateKeyExA        [43D008]                77DBA7F9
      ADVAPI32.RegOpenKeyExA  [43D00C]                77DB851A
      ADVAPI32.RegQueryValueExA       [43D010]                77DB8E19
      ADVAPI32.RegSetValueExA [43D000]                77DBA979
      
      Since we cannot be assured where the location of ADVAPI32.DLL will be
      mapped, we simply use the jump table itself, which will be loaded in the
      same location regardless.  In order to prevent NULL characters, I XOR my
      data area with 0x80.  The payload first decodes the data area, then calls
      the following functions in order to add a value to the windows RUN key:
      
      RegOpenKeyEx();
      RegSetValueEx();
      
      In order to avoid NULL's I used an XOR between registers, as you see in code:
      mov     eax, 77787748
      mov     edx, 77777777
      xor     eax, edx
      push    eax
      
      followed later only by:
      mov     eax, 0x77659BAe
      xor     eax, edx
      push eax
      
      These values translate to addresses in the local area which require a NULL
      character, hence the XOR.  The value in the example is merely "cmd.exe /c"
      with no parameters.  You could easily alter this to add a user to the
      system, or share a drive.  For "script kiddie" purposes you will get
      nothing here - you'll need to alter the cmd.exe string and alter the size
      variable in the decode loop (shown here set to 0x46):
      
                      xor     ecx, ecx
                      mov ecx, 0x46
      LOOP_TOP:
                      dec             eax
                      xor             [eax], 0x80
                      dec             ecx
                      jnz             LOOP_TOP (75 F9)
      
      Once this runs, check your registry and you'll find the value in question.
      The value will be executed upon the next reboot.  This is a very common way
      for network worms to operate, incidentally.  The only snag when using an
      http request is that there are some characters that are filtered or special
      - so you must avoid these. This limits which machine instructions you can
      directly inject - however there are always wasy to get around such
      problems.  In conclusion, I merely am trying to demonstrate that there are
      meny things a buffer overflow can do besides create a shell or download a
      file - and many forms of host based IDS will not notice this.  Now clearly
      the RUN key is common place for security-savvy people to look, but it could
      have easily been something else more esoteric.

188.0 Bugfest! Win2000 has 63,000 'defects'
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Bugfest! Win2000 has 63,000 'defects'

      Urging developers to clean up their code, a
      Microsoft exec says: 'How many of you would
      spend $500 on a piece of software with over
      63,000 potential known defects?' It ships
      Thursday.



      By Mary Jo Foley, Sm@rt Reseller
      UPDATED February 11, 2000 2:25 PM PT 


      Not everyone will be having fun at Microsoft Corp.
      next week. While the software giant and its partners
      celebrate the arrival of Windows 2000 on Thursday,
      Feb. 17, hundreds of members of the Windows
      development team will be busy cleaning up the
      mess. 

      Not the launch-party mess. The code mess. According to
      an internal Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) memo viewed by
      Sm@rt Reseller, the company needs to fix tens of
      thousands of bugs contained in the final Win2000 release
      code. Fixing these bugs is the top-priority assignment for
      Microsoft group VP Jim Allchin's Windows team. 

      "Our customers do not want us to sell them products with
      over 63,000 potential known defects. They want these
      defects corrected," stated one of Microsoft's Windows
      development leaders, Marc Lucovsky, in the memo. "How
      many of you would spend $500 on a piece of software
      with over 63,000 potential known defects?" 

      According to the Microsoft memo, the Windows 2000
      source-code base contains:

           More than 21,000 "postponed" bugs, an
           indeterminate number of which Microsoft is
           characterizing as "real problems." Others are
           requests for new functionality, and others reflect
           "plain confusion as to how something is supposed
           to work." 

           More than 27,000 "BugBug" comments. These are
           usually notes to developers to make something
           work better or more efficiently. According to
           Microsoft, they tend to represent "unfinished work"
           or "long-forgotten problems." 

           Overall, there are more than 65,000 "potential
           issues" that could emerge as problems, as
           discovered by Microsoft's Prefix tool. Microsoft is
           estimating that 28,000 of these are likely to be
           "real" problems. 

      "Our goal for the next release of Windows 2000 is to have
      zero bugs. The only way this happens is if you take it
      upon yourselves to fix the bugs that should be fixed, and
      close the bugs that should be closed," continued
      Lucovsky in his note to the development team.

      He added that no new code for future Windows releases,
      such as Whistler and Blackcomb, will be allowed to be
      "checked in" until the development team has fixed the
      existing Windows 2000 bugs. 

      Microsoft's response
      A spokeswoman for Microsoft strongly defended
      Windows 2000's quality. "Bugs are inherent in computer
      science," she said. "All software ships with issues. The
      difference is (that) no software in the history of Microsoft
      development has ever been through the incredible,
      rigorous internal and external testing that Windows 2000
      has been through." 

                            The spokeswoman said
                            750,000 testers received
                            each beta version of
                            Windows 2000. She said
                            "hundreds of companies
                            have signed off on the
                            incredibly high quality and
                            reliability of Windows
                            2000." 

      The result, she said, is that hundreds of companies are
      deploying Windows 2000 before general availability. 

      One developer, informed of Microsoft's bug estimates,
      said all new software ships with lots of bugs but few
      software vendors are willing to acknowledge this reality.
      "The fact that Microsoft found that many bugs indicates
      to me just how thorough their testing processes are,"
      said the Windows developer, who requested anonymity. 

      Waiting for bug fixes
      But others aren't so sure. Market researchers have
      repeated warnings to their clients against upgrading
      immediately to Win2000. Several outfits have advised
      customers to wait until Microsoft issues its first or
      second service pack before deploying Win2000. And
      research outfits made these suggestions before the exact
      bug tallies came to light. 

      Despite these bugs, Microsoft has made Windows 2000's
      reliability a key focus and part of its marketing message
      for months. At Comdex/Fall last year, Allchin detailed the
      two-year-old reliability initiative upon which Microsoft had
      embarked to insure Win2000 would be more stable and
      reliable than NT 4.0 or its predecessors. 

      Allchin said Microsoft spent 500 person-years and $162
      million on people and tools specifically to improve
      reliability of the product. 

                        In more recent weeks Microsoft
                        has plastered ads on buses,
                        billboards and telephone booths
                        in a number of major cities.
                        "Windows 2000 is coming.
                        Online or off, a standard in
                        reliability," reads the text. 

                        Other hurdles
                        Windows 2000 is hardly
      Microsoft's only worry in the coming months. Another big
      hurdle is application support for the OS. 

      Microsoft has been working on a slew of Windows
      2000/Active Directory-optimized applications that
      ultimately will ship as some type of BackOffice 2000 or
      BackOffice 5.0 package. 

      The first BackOffice 2000 beta isn't expected until some
      time in the second half of this year, but the first
      BackOffice 2000 app upgrade, Exchange 2000, is
      expected to arrive at midyear. Other BackOffice Server
      updates -- the next releases of SQL Server, Proxy Server,
      SNA Server and Systems Management Server -- also are
      in the development pipeline. But exactly how far along
      they are is unclear. 

      At the same time, Microsoft is developing several BackOffice
      add-ons. Microsoft preannounced some of these add-ons, such as
      its BizTalk Server, Commerce Server and AppCenter Server, a 
      full year ago. But first betas of these point products have 
      yet to appear.

      The company doesn't plan to move any of these new
      point products into the BackOffice SKU, said Russ
      Stockdale, director of server applications marketing with
      Microsoft's Business Productivity Group. 

      Stockdale said Microsoft's plan is to continue to offer
      current and future BackOffice SKUs to branch-office
      customers and midsized organizations. 

      Stockdale acknowledged that BackOffice 2000 will have
      little appeal to e-commerce and dotcom customers --
      even though Microsoft is pitching its anchor, Windows
      2000, as an e-commerce-optimized operating system.

189.0 Legit Hackers Roam Cyberspace for Security
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Contributed by Slash
      
      So you thought hackers were nerds in dark rooms travelling in cyberspace 
      to attack companies' computer systems or steal data.
      
      Full Story <http://www.ukhackers.com/0602001.htm>
      
      Legit Hackers Roam Cyberspace for Security
      So you thought hackers were nerds in dark rooms travelling in cyberspace 
      to attack companies' computer systems or steal data.
      
      Think again.
      A new breed of hackers licensed to hack legally into companies around the 
      world, ranging from banks in Israel and Britain to e-commerce companies in 
      Spain, and check their systems' security, is at work in Sweden.
      
      The Stockholm-based private company Defcom, set up in April last year, is a 
      pioneer in a shadowy business that may seem more like a scene from one of 
      legendary American science fiction author William Gibson's novels than reality.
      
      But Defcom (www.defcom-sec.com) actually gets paid for hiring out its ``ethical 
      hackers'' to large companies, mostly in the banking, insurance and e-commerce 
      sector around Europe.
      
      ``Nine out of 10 companies we're employed to check, we can break into through the 
      Internet,'' Defcom chief executive Thomas Gullberg told Reuters. ``That's a 
      frightening statistic.''
      
      Defcom expects its business to grow fast as more companies seek protection 
      from hackers, sophisticated users of advanced computer programming languages 
      who can break into computer systems or Web sites to change or steal information.
      
      Consumers handed an estimated $30 billion over to Internet sites last year, 
      a sign that a lot of people have lost their fears about shopping online. 
      Most got what they ordered and didn't have their credit card details abused.
      
      Online Boom Threatens Security
      
      But the Web is becoming an ever more attractive playground for hackers as
      e-commerce mushrooms in Europe and the United States, and sensitive data 
      is transferred over the Internet.
      
      Security experts say some Web sites are forgetting about security issues 
      in their rush to be on the Internet. One concern is the expected arrival 
      of mobile phones linked to the Web, creating more opportunities for hackers 
      to get in.
      
      And some worry that putting too many security features on a site scares 
      away some consumers and slows the transaction process, while costly security 
      features cannot match the returns of investments in marketing and customer 
      acquisition.
      
      A survey by Zona Research showed that consumers who have to wait more than 
      eight seconds will click to another site.
      
      Hackers can break into practically any computer system if they want to, 
      Defcom said.
      
      Defcom is one of hundreds of Net start-ups in Sweden, one of the world's 
      most wired countries. With its high Internet penetration and wide use of 
      e-commerce and Internet banking, Sweden also has some of the world's best 
      online security.
      
      ``We aim to be the leader in Europe. I think we are already,'' Gullberg said. 
      ``It's such a new area. We're the only ones who've managed to organize it 
      properly. Some have tried but failed.''
      
      Licensed To Hack
      
      It was hard at first to bring hackers together, but Gullberg was surprised 
      by the willingness on the part of hackers to turn legitimate.
      
      ``We've brought hacking to another stage, made it ethical,'' Gullberg said. 
      ``We've gathered hackers under one roof. After all they're the best in the 
      business, they know how it's done.''
      
      Defocom's motto, displayed in one of the main hackers' rooms, sums it up: 
      ``It takes one to know one.''
      
      The Swedish company -- with an office in London -- has grown to over 40 staff, 
      of whom about half are professional hackers, aged 23 to 30. One has a criminal 
      record.
      
      To boost expertise and knowledge it has also hired a police officer from the 
      IT security division in Sweden's national crimes prevention unit.
      
      Once appointed by a company to check their security system staff carry out a
      technical analysis then travel to the country of the company and start hacking.
      
      What makes them different to some other data security firms is that they actually 
      make changes in their customers' computers to see whether they can really be 
      hacked into, Defcom said.
      
      ``We don't just go to the firewall and prove that we can break it, but we go 
      into the main computers,'' Defcom's senior cyberspace hacker, who asked to 
      remain anonymous, told Reuters.
      
      The company prefers not to name its hackers as this may unleash a backlash 
      from real hackers out there seeking to disturb the legitimate ones.
      
      Defcom takes between two hours to three days with most cases fixed once it 
      tells them how to improve the system.
      
      ``We deliver the truth to clients. The bitter-sweet truth,'' Gullberg said.
      
      Most Business In Finance Sector
      
      ``Security has been a big problem in the business world and it still is. 
      The Internet is not safe,'' Gullberg said.
      
      Defcom says it is not hard to convince companies of their market expertise, 
      although clients' IT officials get very nervous once they manage to hack into 
      their systems.
      
      Most illegal hacking in finance centers on stealing credit card numbers but 
      is expanding quickly into industrial espionage.
      
      Defcom said an underground market known as ``information broker'' sites was 
      growing on the Web where clients could scout around for hackers to do their 
      dirty work, like breaking into a company to steal car designs or corporate data.
      
      Defcom has several contracts in Israel, especially in Internet banking, and 
      said that despite its reputation as one of the world's high-tech nations its 
      security was often sloppy.
      
      It also has contracts in Europe but has not yet moved into the United States, 
      the biggest market for hackers.
      
      Defcom, which eventually plans to go public, has some 50 fixed customers -- 
      including Sweden's top listed companies -- who sign three-year contracts for 
      monthly visits from Defcom.
      
      ``We work for insurance companies in Britain who want their clients, especially 
      banks, checked to see how safe they are and what insurance premium they should 
      have,'' Gullberg said.
      
      The security industry got a boost last month in the form of the Clinton 
      administration's plan to relax rules on the export of sophisticated encryption 
      technology, which enables people to conceal credit card numbers and other data 
      from prying eyes.
      
      The need for tighter security was underscored last month when hackers broke 
      into online music retailer CD Universe, a unit of EUniverse Inc. and stole 
      300,000 credit card numbers, demanding payment of $100,000 not to use them.
      
      Defcom advises its clients not to publicize their use of its services as this 
      could be a challenge to the hacking community.
      
      ``It's easy to break into the system. Too easy. But often customers don't know 
      when the companies have had intruders because they cover it up,'' the top hacker 
      said.

190.0 Deutch controversy raises security questions for Internet users

      Deutch controversy raises security questions for Internet users
      From Science Correspondent Ann Kellan
      Former CIA Director John Deutch's alleged use of a home computer to store 
      classified materials has sparked a security scare in the U.S. intelligence 
      community and has also pointed out a problem many Internet users are not aware of. 
      
      The minute anyone logs onto the Internet, financial records and other personal 
      information stored on a home computer are an open book to any cyber-thief. 
      Security experts say Deutch would be a much bigger target than the average person. 
      
      "There are known foreign intelligence agents operating on the Internet today ... 
      and they are actively seeking U.S. intelligence on the Internet," said Daniel 
      Verton of Federal Computer Week. 
      
      "It's hard to know exactly what he had on his home computer," Verton said. 
      "But we do know that it was thousands of pages in length, we do know it was 
      top secret and probably ranged the entire breadth of classifications, from 
      unclassified to top secret code word information." 
      
      Most hackers are more interested in larceny than espionage, targeting credit 
      card numbers and bank records. Those records are becoming more vulnerable as 
      the number of people using the Internet grows. 
      
      'A huge vulnerability'
      The modems that most home computers use to connect to the Internet are difficult,
      but not impossible, for a thief to crack. But some new ways to log on are l
      ess secure. 
      
      "We're seeing things like broadband Internet ... faster connections that are 
      always on," said PC World Magazine's Sean Dugan. "That's a huge vulnerability." 
      
      Computers connected to the Internet through high-speed cable modems are at 
      the highest risk, because they share the line with other people. 
      
      Danger lurks in 'Trojan Horses' 
      Microsoft Windows even has a setting that lets users share information with 
      those people. This function can be disabled if you don't want others to have 
      access to your computer. 
      
      Another point of entry is through e-mail attachments, where so-called 
      "Trojan horses" can be hidden. These programs give thieves the ability to 
      control another computer from a remote location, without the user's knowledge. 
      
      Security software and programs that scramble or encrypt data are available, 
      but experts say the best way for users to protect themselves is to keep private 
      information off-line.

191.0 PC's Vulnerable to Security Breaches, Experts Say

      PC's Vulnerable to Security Breaches, Experts Say 
      Unless a home PC is placed in an isolation tank, computer security experts 
      say, it is vulnerable to a panoply of potential intrusions. 
      For that reason, it can be an extremely hazardous place to keep anything 
      remotely confidential, much less the classified documents that John M. Deutch, 
      the former director of central intelligence, had stored on his unsecured home 
      computers in 1996. 
      
      "The more software people have on their computers, and the more they are online, 
      the more vulnerable they become to attack," said Avi Rubin, an Internet security 
      expert at AT&T Labs Research in Florham Park, N.J. "All the factors that 
      contribute to increased vulnerability are becoming more and more common." 
      
      To be sure, general awareness of security vulnerabilities among home PC users 
      was not very high in 1996, when people were beginning to explore the World Wide 
      Web in increasing numbers. 
      
      Then, as now, the level of vulnerability depended largely on how the computer 
      was used and on what precautions were taken. 
      
      A computer user's vulnerability to attack does not depend as much on which Web 
      site is visited as on what software is used to gain access to the Internet, experts say. 
      
      Mr. Deutch's computers had access to the Web via America Online. And, in 1996, 
      America Online accounts were among the most frequent targets of attackers, who 
      used sundry ploys to gain access to members' passwords. This included planting
      malicious hidden programs known as trojan horses on the victims' hard drives. 
      
      In recent years, experts have exposed a number of security holes in browsing 
      software. In general, however, e-mail programs are the software most vulnerable 
      to intrusion, said Richard Smith, an Internet security consultant in Cambridge, Mass. 
      
      That is because a trojan horse attack can come in the form of a malicious program 
      attached to a piece of e-mail or, in some instances, can be carried within the 
      e-mail message itself. In either case, these programs end up on a computer's 
      hard drive, where they can do many kinds of mischief. For example, some have 
      been known to capture passwords by monitoring the victim's keystrokes. This has 
      been a common attack on AOL. 
      
      "It's possible that you can read files off a hard drive and then send them back 
      on the Web as e-mail to someone else, or post them to a news group," Mr. Smith said. 
      
      The danger of a trojan horse is that it is a seemingly legitimate program that 
      hides -- and eventually executes -- a malicious code. 
      
      While many such attacks are mounted randomly, Mr. Smith said that such a method 
      of gaining access to a computer would be ideal for espionage. 
      
      "These security holes would be a great way for spying," he said. This could be 
      accomplished, he said, by sending an e-mail message containing a clandestine program 
      that lowers the computer's security settings, paving the way for a second, more 
      malicious program. 
      
      "If you're in the spy business," he said, "what better way to do it than to get the 
      home e-mail addresses of important people and use some of these security holes to 
      bug their computer?" 
      
      Mr. Smith said he knew of no such incidents involving espionage, but he added that 
      a portion of a fast-spreading virus called Melissa, which infected thousands of 
      computers last year, worked by lowering the security settings on target computers. 
      
      Mr. Smith said it was only relatively recently that security holes in Internet-based 
      software were systematically documented. 
      
      Whether Mr. Deutch had anti-virus software installed on his computers has not
      been made public. Even if he did, Mr. Rubin said, anti-virus software offers 
      protection only against known viruses. 
      
      "The big problem is a virus that's creative and new and acts in a way 
      unanticipated by the anti-virus writers," he said. "There's no way to defend 
      against a virus like that." 
      
      Investigators have not revealed the kind of lines with which Mr. Deutch's 
      computers had been connected to the Internet, but it is likely that they had 
      used a dial-up modem. 
      
      A dial-up connection poses less of a security risk than what is known as a 
      persistent connection -- like a cable modem or digital subscriber line, or 
      DSL -- in which a computer is always online. 
      
      Persistent connections typically are much higher speed than dial-up connections 
      and have surged in popularity only recently. 
      
      Mark Seiden, chief network security consultant to the Kroll-O'Gara Information 
      Security Group in Palo Alto, Calif., said a more interesting question was the 
      extent to which Mr. Deutch was sending and receiving sensitive information from 
      the home computer via e-mail. 
      
      E-mail traveling over the Internet is vulnerable to interception. Unless it is 
      encrypted, its contents are there for the taking. 
      
      "The last time I talked to someone at the C.I.A. about sending something there, 
      they said to send it by U.S. mail," Mr. Seiden said. "They didn't want me to e-mail 
      them anything." 
      
      The fact that no computer is an island these days, Mr. Rubin said, has put security 
      experts in something of an "arms race" with potential intruders. "They take a few 
      steps forward, then we take a few steps," he said. 
      
      In spite of a tremendous effort on the part of security professionals to secure 
      computers, Mr. Rubin said, "I'd say the attackers have the edge." 
      
      "The best thing people can do in the face of this is not to talk to strangers," 
      La Guardia said. "Don't go into dark alleys. There are bad places out there--and 
      bad people. Stay away from them."
      
      In addition to JavaScript, other common scripting languages include AppleScript, 
      CGI, HTMLScript, Perl and VBScript. JavaScript is standardized under the European 
      Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA), an international standards body based in 
      Switzerland.

192.0 Hacking hazards come with Web scripting territory 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Hacking hazards come with Web scripting territory 
      Heard about a Web security issue lately? Chances are scripting was part of the problem.
      
      If you've surfed the Web recently, you've almost certainly seen scripts at 
      work performing some of the most common tasks of today's Web pages, from helping 
      users search pages to scrolling text across the screen and launching new windows.
      
      In the wake of a government advisory about a newly recognized Web scripting 
      security threat, software providers fear scripting is getting a bum rap despite 
      security protections built into the top scripting implementations.
      
      Web scripting is the method most sites use to create moving parts. Scripting 
      languages such as JavaScript--invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape, 
      now a division of America Online--bring to the Web the kind of features that 
      at the dawn of the Web could be found only on the computer desktop, features 
      that let users interact with sites without calling up a new page from the server.
      
      The difference between scripting languages, which can be found on and off the 
      Web, and computer programming languages like C++ or Fortran, is that scripting 
      languages are interpreted, while programming languages are compiled. Compilers 
      translate programming instructions written by humans into a language a microchip 
      can understand.
      
      With scripts, browsers essentially do that work on the fly.
      
      Scripts are powerful enough, however, to do real damage when written maliciously. 
      Both this week's government advisory and countless other exploits demonstrated by
      bug hunters on the Web have shown how hackers can take advantage of the flexibility 
      and power of scripting to pry into Web surfers' private information, both in the 
      browser and in other applications on the computer.
      
      Chief among these bug hunters is the Bulgarian security consultant Georgi Guninski, 
      who has numerous scripting exploits to his name for the major browsers provided by 
      Microsoft and Netscape.
      
      In a recent example, Guninski showed how Microsoft's Outlook Express mail reading 
      application let a malicious user embed a script within a message to expose the mail 
      of the targeted user while the initial message window remained open.
      
      Guninski earned a steady income of $1,000 per bug from Netscape before the company 
      brought him on board as a consultant last summer.
      
      Security experts point out, however, that the government's advisory did not pinpoint 
      any flaw on the scripting side of things, but rather with Web sites' implementation 
      of forms that permitted the introduction of potentially malicious scripting tags.
      
      Despite the frequency of scripting-related security problems, Microsoft stresses that 
      the hazards come with the technology territory.
      
      "There is always a balance between security and ease of use, and scripting is no 
      exception," a Microsoft spokeswoman said. "It is up to each customer to decide what 
      sites they want to allow to perform scripting and which they don't."
      
      She noted that Internet Explorer's security zones let users classify sites according 
      to whether they are known and trusted and therefore allowed to run scripts.
      
      Netscape said that scripting is the safer of various alternatives because of its 
      "sandbox" security model, which only allows the script to interact within certain 
      boundaries on the site visitor's computer.
      
      Michael La Guardia, group product manager for the Communicator browser, explained 
      that JavaScript is only allowed to interact with the user through the Web interface. 
      
      "If you have native code talking directly to your computer, it could do anything," 
      he said. "It could set up a listener and get sensitive information like passwords 
      and credit card numbers or erase your hard drive. With JavaScript, the programmer 
      is not allowed to execute native code."
      
      He added: "If it were native code running all the time, we wouldn't have the Web 
      as we have it today. It would be one giant gaping security hole."
      
      For example, Microsoft's ActiveX technology has been criticized for running code 
      on computers while relying on a "trust" security model, in which ActiveX controls 
      can execute native code provided the user has decided they trust the control's source.
      
      Even with sandbox protections, however, Netscape said users should exercise caution 
      in choosing which sites to visit. 
      
      "The best thing people can do in the face of this is not to talk to strangers," La 
      Guardia said. "Don't go into dark alleys. There are bad places out there--and bad 
      people. Stay away from them."
      
      In addition to JavaScript, other common scripting languages include AppleScript, 
      CGI, HTMLScript, Perl and VBScript. JavaScript is standardized under the European 
      Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA), an international standards body based 
      in Switzerland.

      Microsoft battles pair of security bugs 
      Microsoft bug exterminators are at work on two security flaws that could expose users' 
      information to the prying eyes of online attackers.
      
      Microsoft has acknowledged that bugs in its Java virtual machine for the Internet 
      Explorer browser and its Outlook Express mail reader for IE enable malicious hackers 
      to look at more than they ought to be able to see on targets' computers.
      
      Microsoft said it was devising patches for both holes.
      
      With Outlook Express, a malicious user can embed a script within a message that 
      will let him or her read the mail of the targeted user while the initial message 
      window remains open. The bug does not affect the standard version of Outlook. 
      
      "This could potentially let a malicious user read email, but under pretty restricted 
      conditions," a Microsoft representative said. "And it only allows email to be read--not
      changed or altered."
      
      Pending a fix, Microsoft said that concerned users can turn off Active Scripting 
      within IE's Restricted Zone and reconfigure Outlook Express to open email within 
      the restricted zone.
      
      The second problem, in Microsoft's Java virtual machine, also permits the improper 
      reading of files on the user's computer. Originally discovered, described and 
      demonstrated by Kensuke Tada, the vulnerability lets a Java applet read, but not 
      write to or delete, "known files," which could include the registry file or other 
      files with common names like "memo.txt" or "password.txt." A Java applet is a small 
      application written in Java such as an online spreadsheet or news ticker.
      
      The Java virtual machine translates code written in the cross-platform Java programming 
      language into code that computers can understand.
      
      Microsoft said it learned of the problem over the weekend and immediately began 
      working on its patch. The company downplayed the seriousness of the problem, saying 
      the attacker could only access a particular directory that was most often empty. 
      Microsoft also said the problem was simple to patch and that all versions of the 
      JVM would be patched this weekend.

195.0 How Safe Is AOL 5.0?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      AOL is hit with $8 billion lawsuit over its latest client software.
      
      Internet service provider giant America Online took a potentially damaging 
      hit Monday as it was handed a class-action lawsuit demanding at least $8 billion 
      in damages apparently caused by its Internet software AOL 5.0.
      
      The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, seeks $1000, 
      or three times the amount of damage (whichever is greater) each for the estimated 8 
      million people who have already downloaded the faulty software and "have had the 
      operation of their computer altered as a result thereof," according to the filing.
      
      AOL officials responded on Wednesday by stating their intent to fight the allegations.
      
      "[The allegations] have no basis in fact or law and we intend to vigorously contest 
      them," said Rich D'Amato, an AOL spokesperson. "[Version 5.0] does not prevent members 
      from accessing the Internet through other providers."
      
      User Complaints Rise
      
      
      AOL has come under much criticism since releasing the software as users have
       complained of interference it causes with other computer programs, particularly 
      software of other ISPs.
      
      The filing alleges that "as part of its normal operation, Version 5.0 disables, 
      interrupts, alters, or interferes with operations of other software installed on 
      those same computers, including but not limited to disabling any other internet 
      software which provides internet access by non-AOL ISPs that also may be installed 
      on the computer."
      
      In particular, the lawsuit claims that "AOL knew of or should have known that it 
      operated in such a manner."
      
      "I upgraded to AOL 5.0 and blindly thought everything went fine," said Kenneth Novak, 
      who uses AOL as a backup. "When I tried to dial in to my work location with dial-up 
      networking, I was unable to use the IE [Internet Explorer] 5.0 browser through our 
      firewall."
      
      The problem seems to be affecting people from all technological backgrounds as well, 
      perplexing the first-time user and veteran computer and Internet users alike.
      
      "I am a computer consultant and I know my way around installing software," said Kevin 
      Wohler, another self-proclaimed AOL 5.0 victim. "I ran into multiple problems, not 
      the least of which was the interference with my normal ISP."
      
      Unauthorized Changes?
      
      
      Most of all, users were most distressed about how an "upgrade" seemed to cause 
      mostly harmful and unauthorized changes to their systems.
      
      "AOL made changes to my system that I would have never agreed to," Wohler said.
      
      AOL officials, however, claim that AOL 5.0 does not make any changes to anything, 
      including settings, unless the user permits them.
      
      "AOL software allows users the ability to set AOL as their default," D'Amato said. 
      "They must choose AOL to be their default Internet setting."

196.0 Teens steal thousands of net accounts

      Teens steal thousands of Net accounts
      

      By Ann Harrison
      01/13/2000 A group of teen-age computer crackers allegedly
      used thousands of stolen Internet accounts to probe the
      networks of two national nuclear weapons laboratories,
      according to law enforcement authorities in California. 

      At least five crackers, ages 15 to 17, compromised
      accounts at 17 Internet service providers in the U.S.,
      Romania and Australia and used the accounts to attack
      nine targets including the Sandia and Oak Ridge
      National Laboratories and Harvard University, according
      to Capt. Jan Hoganson of the Sacramento Valley
      High-Tech Crimes Task Force in California. The crackers
      managed to gain root access to computers at Harvard,
      Hoganson said, but just scanned the national lab
      networks to look for vulnerabilities. The intruders stole
      200,000 accounts alone from San Francisco-based
      Pacific Bell Internet Services for use in the attack. 

      According to Hoganson, the stolen accounts were used
      to scan for open network ports at the labs, which could
      be used for subsequent attacks. Hoganson emphasized
      that the laboratory networks themselves weren't
      compromised. He said law enforcement authorities were
      notified of the scans Dec. 7, by an El Dorado Hills,
      Calif.-based Internet service provider called InnerCite,
      which had received complaints from the labs that
      accounts it hosted were used in the scans. 

      "The feds say it was an unwelcome visit, but there was
      no criminal action committed," said Hoganson, who
      likened the action to nighttime intruders rattling the
      doorknobs of a locked business. "Fortunately, the ISP
      preserved the evidence," he said. 

      Damian Frisby, a detective with the Sacramento Valley
      High-Tech Crimes Task Force, said the FBI is now
      contacting other service providers from which accounts
      were allegedly stolen. He said the young intruders, who
      allegedly belong to a cracking group called Global Hell,
      had been tracked down and contacted by authorities
      after they bragged of their exploits in Internet chat
      rooms. While no charges have yet been filed, Frisby
      said he expects that some of the attackers will
      eventually be charged with unlawful access of a
      computer and possibly grand theft. 

      "One of the first things an ISP considers is to shut
      these people down -- which is great for security and
      stops the attack, but it makes it hard for us to track
      them down," said Frisby. "They should contact law
      enforcement, but they have to make the decision
      whether to track them down or cut them off, and we
      can't tell them what to do." 

      Frisby noted that while some of the compromised
      Internet service providers had chosen to cooperate with
      law enforcement, one, PSINet Inc. in Herndon, Va.,
      demanded a search warrant before taking any action.
      "We don't want to violate anyone's rights, but it delays
      the process," said Frisby. PSINet wasn't available to
      comment on the request. 

      While the investigation is ongoing, Frisby said service
      providers should guard against the theft of account data
      by taking care to update operating systems with current
      security patches and maintain effective firewalls. "It is
      a hard job to do because there are new exploits
      everyday," he said. 

      Frisby added that many of the compromised Pac Bell
      accounts used passwords that were easy to uncover
      using standard dictionary programs that search for
      known words. He said the attackers somehow obtained
      a list of 200,000 Pac Bell user accounts and were able
      to successfully steal the passwords for about 95,000
      accounts. 

      Michelle Strykowski, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell
      Internet Services, a subsidiary of SBC Communications
      Inc., based in San Antonio, disputed the number of
      compromised passwords. Strykowski said 63,000
      passwords had been decoded, but Pac Bell was still
      unsure how the accounts were compromised. She said
      there has been no indication that the account
      information has been abused elsewhere and no
      customers have complained. 

      According to Strykowski, the company sent an advisory
      to customers Jan. 7, warning of a security breach and
      advising them to change their passwords to include
      uppercase and lowercase characters, symbols and
      numbers, which makes them more difficult to crack. She
      said Pac Bell's 330,000 California Internet customers
      were also advised to change their passwords every 90
      days and to not use the same passwords for a number
      of different accounts. 

      "Security is a top priority for Pacific Bell, and we are
      working closely with the police, but these hackers have
      proved to the Internet as a whole that we must
      maintain vigilance," said Strykowski, who noted that the
      Global Hell cracking group had also compromised Web
      sites at the FBI and the White House. "All other ISPs,
      like Pac Bell, have to constantly scrutinize security and
      make recommendations to customers to be responsible
      Internet users and change their passwords."

197.0 Online Credit Hacker May Be Out For Profit

      Online Credit Hacker May Be Out for
      Profit 
      Investigator Thinks 'Maxus' Is a Two-Person Team 

      Jan. 14, 2000 

      By David Noack 

      NEW YORK (APBnews.com) -- While a
      computer hacker maintains that he stole credit
      card numbers from an online retailer as
      revenge for poor service and a couple of
      broken CDs, a security expert believes that
      "Maxus" is actually a two-man team in Russia
      engaged in a well-organized credit card fraud. 

      In an e-mail message to APBnews.com,
      Maxus gave his motives for hacking into CD
      Universe's customer credit card database. He
      acknowledged stealing 300,000 card numbers and trying to extort $100,000
      from the company by threatening to post the information online. 

      "They send me two broken CDs, and I conclude test of their site for bugs.
      ... Their service is not good. Amazon is better," he said. 

      In an e-mail exchange, Maxus said he might post more of the pilfered
      credit card numbers online, and he claimed that he still can get into the CD
      Universe database if he wants. 

      "They can't fix it without me," Maxus boasted. 

      Admits one previous theft 

      Maxus also said he has stolen credit card
      information once before, in 1997. He claimed
      he got 20 then but declined to say where they
      were from or what he did with the information. 

      He said he is using a computer with Windows
      2000, Solaris and a Pentium III. 

      Attempts to reach Maxus with additional
      questions and clarifications were
      unsuccessful. Brad Greenspan, chairman of
      e-Universe, the parent company of CD
      Universe, could not be reached for comment. 

      Does Maxus have associates? 

      Meanwhile, AntiOnline, an online computer
      security publication and consulting firm, which
      conducted its own investigation into the
      hacking incident, suspects the operation is
      more organized and widespread than Maxus concedes. 

      John Vranesevich, the founder of AntiOnline, said that Maxus does not
      work alone. 

      "We believe there are about a dozen that are close to Maxus. We don't
      have any hard evidence, but that is the impression we get. There are also
      some in Canada," said Vranesevich. 

      He said the Web page that Maxus set up initially, which included some of
      the stolen credit card numbers as part of the extortion threat against CD
      Universe, was really an effort to peddle or advertise the credit card numbers
      to buyers. 

      A four-layered scheme? 

      The credit card scheme, says AntiOnline, has four parts: 

           Maxus' partners first buy the numbers in wholesale lots of $1,000 for
           $1 a number. 

           The card numbers are resold in blocks of 50 for a round price of
           $500. First-round buyers who keep numbers for themselves must
           pay Maxus a hefty kickback. 

           AntiOnline believes Maxus uses "CyberCash" software to set
           himself up as an online merchant, entering the stolen numbers as if
           customers in his store were using the cards. 

           In this case, the software "sees to it that the stolen credit cards are
           charged, and that the 'merchant' or in this case, 'thief,' gets the
           funds 'owed to him' electronically deposited into a bank account,"
           Vranesevich reported in AntiOnline. 

           The "final buyers" of the card numbers use them to access online
           pornography sites or for online gambling. They also can order
           computer equipment online. 

      Finds two partners 

      Vranesevich believes he has identified Maxus as Maxim Ivancov, and also
      another individual, who is called Diagnoz or Evgenij Fedorov, who may be in
      his 30s. Both have set up accounts at either banks or money transfer
      companies in order to complete the transactions. 

      AntiOnline recommends that any user who shopped at CD Universe cancel
      their credit cards immediately. 

      Vranesevich said that information from the AntiOnline investigation has
      been turned over to the FBI. He declined to say with which FBI office he
      was working. 

      "The fact that CD Universe or the credit card companies would suggest to
      anyone that they could keep these credit cards accounts until they notice
      suspicious activity is ridiculous," said Vranesevich. 

      May be at risk from Russian mob 

      William Callahan, president of Unitel, a multinational investigative and
      security company, suspects that the Russian hackers are a small group
      and their greatest threat is not from law enforcement, but from Russian
      mobsters. 

      "This is a small crowd of young Russian hackers who are incredibly adapt
      at computer stuff, they have no scruples and are just having fun stealing
      money," said Callahan. 

      However, he cautioned, once organized crime in Russia gets wind of what
      they are doing, they will muscle in on the operation. 

      "They will use them and extort them. They have to watch over their
      shoulder. [The Russian mobsters] are always looking for ways to launder
      money offshore," said Callahan, a former federal prosecutor. 

      Purdue University professor Eugene Spafford, director of a new
      multidisciplinary center designed to tackle issues related to information
      security, finds Maxus' story of a revenge hack "plausible." 

      "I do not know where the liability lies, because I do not know for certain
      where 'Maxus' got the numbers -- if he did -- nor do I know how," Spafford
      said. "If the story is as he presented it, then there is some blame to be laid
      at the merchant, and some with the company that provided the
      e-commerce software."

      Funny Story Gets Cut/Pasted To Channel 28 Times

      CINCINNATI, OH - A C/NET News.com story relating to another huge
      goof-up made by Microsoft's free email service, Hotmail.com, excited
      chatters on irc.openprojects.net's #linuxhelp channel. In fact, the
      people enjoyed the story so much that it got posted 28 times by
      various people.

      The initial joy the story brought to #linuxhelp was quickly offset as
      tempers flared and the channel administration hastily +moderated the
      channel in an effort to restore order in the out-of-control chat room.

      "Fuck off.", said MbM, immediately after setting the +m. "We all have
      browsers, we don't need people posting the story every 30 seconds."

      Witnesses claimed that there was no initial response from the
      #linuxhelp regulars to MbM's actions, because "nobody had been
      +voiced". The chat room was described as "very quiet". 

      IRCNews.com learned that the cut and pasted story was in regards to
      Microsoft forgetting to pay the $35 registration fee for the
      passport.com domain name (the authentication part of Hotmail.com),
      leaving millions of people without access to their email. A Linux
      programmer forked out the $35 on behalf of Microsoft, and the
      popular freemail service was back in business.

      Everyone agreed that the News.com story was "very funny". One
      #linuxhelp regular named kernel_ said that it came as little surprise to
      anyone that people would want to cut and paste it.

      "OMG, okay. PiNkEyE tells me to go check out this story about M$ and
      Hotmail, so I do, and it's hysterical. So I post the URL to #linuxhelp,
      and about 2 minutes later, all hell broke loose!"

      kernel_ added, "At first I saw a few hahaha's and LOL's. Then people
      start posting parts of the article to the channel. Before I knew it,
      people are tripping out and probably a hundred lines of text was
      scrolling by every 5 seconds! It got out of control."

      "It all happened so fast.", commented Etriaph, also a #linuxhelp
      regular. "I remember getting up to make some Pop-Tarts and I come
      back and like quotes are flying all over, people are saying shut up,
      fights are breaking out, more quoted text, people leaving the channel
      to avoid the spam. It was like a warzone."

      MbM quickly stepped in to restore peace to the chat room. After
      several reported attempts to calm the channel by telling people to
      "stop that", MbM was left with no choice but to +moderate, which he
      did. 

      MbM's quick thinking may have saved thousands of lines of spam from
      being shown to the 40 or so people visiting #linuxhelp at the time. 

      When asked for his version of the events, MbM told IRCNews.com to
      "Fuck off."

      check out http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/groups.html to see who
      you are up against. You can often gather intel from IRC as many of these
      groups maintain a presence by having a channel with their group name as 
      the channel name, others aren't so obvious but do exist.

      The alleged hacks of:
      http://www.armeniansisters.org
      http://www.usabia.org
      http://www.armgate.com
      http://www.armtv.com
      
      have been determined to be hoaxes.
      
      The group claiming to do it called themselves "hijak team". Looking at the
      NIC registry for the first two domains:
      
      Registrant:
      US-Armenia Business & Investment Association (USABIA-DOM)
         hijak st azerbaina for ever
         Baku, Az 3700001
         AZ
      
         Domain Name: USABIA.ORG
      
         Administrative Contact, Technical Contact, Zone Contact:
            netninja, Sanjay  (SP335)  infowar@ANTIONLINE.ORG
            99412666666 (FAX) 94412666666
         Billing Contact:
            netninja, Sanjay  (SP335)  infowar@ANTIONLINE.ORG
            99412666666 (FAX) 94412666666
      
      
      Combine that with the second two domains (which appear to be legitimate),
      and the fact that the first two were hosted on free servers (Hypermart),
      it appears this group and their actions are a big hoax.

      ATTRITION Staff Comment:
      This defacement has a message regarding Joerg Haider and the Austrian Freedom
      Party. Mention of possible targets in the *.gv.at domain. (For more information
      about this issue, read: 
      http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_632000/632039.stm )
       
      The site of the Belgium Senate was defaced by Illusions Team and NOT #Dorknet.

      This defacement brought to you courtesy of "Harkat-ul-mOs". The Pakistan 
      based terrorist organization that wants India to stop killing innocent 
      civilians. (read women and children)


          YES! we are terrorists! 

          <EXTRACT> ..... The man was stopped by an Indian army patrol 10 yards 
          from his house, 20 minutes after curfew - his house had no toilet. 
          Just before sunrise the next day , his battered corpse was dumped in 
          front of his house. Permission for a proper funeral was refused, 
          arrangements were made for a burial in a local park. The women blocked 
          the entrance of the park from the Indian Army who were trying to stop 
          the ceremony. </EXTRACT> 

          <EXTRACT> The Indian security forces in Kashmir have systematically 
          violated the Code of Medical Neutrality in Armed Conflict. During the 
          curfew the security forces have prevented medical personnel from 
          evacuating injured people in need of treatment. Ambulance drivers have 
          been the principal victims of these actions, frequently being stopped 
          while on duty. A number have been fired on and beaten, in some cases 
          the medical personnel have been detained, tortured and killed. 
          </EXTRACT> 

          <EXTRACT> Torture is widely practiced in Kashmir as a means of 
          extracting information from detainees, coercing confessions, punishing 
          persons believed sympathetic to the militants and creating a climate 
          of political repression. Torture includes severe methods, which 
          include the psycho-torture: soldiers rape the detainee's wife in front 
          of his eyes. </EXTRACT> 

          <EXTRACT> Patrols downtown. Military squads in the streets, they are 
          looking for militants. 01 Minute to evacuate their homes. Time limit 
          expired. The soldiers enter, bursts of gun fire. Entire families 
          slaughtered. Flesh burned five, ten, fifteen bodies bleeding now while 
          I am writing far away from Kashmir. </EXTRACT>

          dammit ! They have a right to live... to choose ! 

          Take away the rights they have as human beings, and every muslim shall 
          rise against you ! We will keep "terrorizing" you, defacing sites 
          until there are no more Indian sites left that have yet to be defaced 
          by the :: [ m O s ] :: .... and start all over again ! Your data is

      Common Trojan ports to watch for:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      After seeing several questions about traffic directed at ports as 31337 and
      12345 I've put together a list of all trojans known to me and the default
      ports they are using. Of course several of them could use any port, but I
      hope this list will maybe give you a clue of what might be going on.

      You'll find the list on the following address:
      http://www.simovits.com/nyheter9902.html  (still in Swedish but it will be
      translated in the near future).
      
      To help anyone to detect trojan attacks, I´m planning to add information
      about the original names of the executables, their size, where they usually
      are hiding, and the names of any helpfiles they may use. I will also add
      tools or links to tools that may be of your assistance.
      
      Feel free to get back to me with any comments or suggestions. If you find
      new trojans I´ll love to get my hands on them, but please mail me first, as
      I don´t need more than one copy. If you have live experiance of trojan
      attacks I´m interested to read about your findings.

A.4  The hacker's Ethic (90's Style)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
     
     
          _   _            _             _    _____ _   _     _
         | | | | __ _  ___| | _____ _ __( )__| ____| |_| |__ (_) ___

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

    BUGTRAQ - Subscription info
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    What is Bugtraq?

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa <n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina <http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.
      
      
      * Products. An incredible number of categorized security products
         from over two hundred different vendors.
      
      
      * Services. A large and focused directory of security services offered by
         vendors.
      
      
      * Books, Papers and Articles. A vast number of categorized security
         related books, papers and articles. Available to download directly
         for our servers when possible.
      
      
      * Tools. A large array of free security tools. Categorized and
         available for download.
      
      
      * News: A vast number of security news articles going all the way
         back to 1995.
      
      
      * Security Resources: A directory to other security resources on
         the net.
      
      
      As well as many other things such as an event calendar.
      
      
      For your convenience the home-page can be personalized to display
      only information you may be interested in. You can filter by
      categories, keywords and operating systems, as well as configure
      how much data to display.
      
      
      I'd like to thank the fine folks at NETSPACE for hosting the
      site for as long as they have. Their services have been invaluable.
      
      
      I hope you find these changes for the best and the new services
      useful. I invite you to visit http://www.securityfocus.com/ and
      check it out for yourself. If you have any comments or suggestions
      please feel free to contact me at this address or at

      Comments: To: InfoSec News <isn@securityfocus.com>

      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.
      
      
      As you can see from the headers, ISN is now generously being hosted by
      Security Focus [www.securityfocus.com]. THey are providing the bandwidth,
      machine, and listserv that runs the list now.
      
      
      Hopefully, this message will find all ISN subscribers, help us weed out
      dead addresses, and assure you the list is still here. If you have found
      the list to be valuable in the past, please tell friends and associates
      about the list. To subscribe, mail listserv@securityfocus.com with
      "subscribe isn firstname lastname". To unsubscribe, "unsubscribe isn".
      
      
      As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome. I apologize for the down
      time of the list. Hopefully it won't happen again. ;)

      The subject line will always contain the title of the article, so that
      you may quickly and effeciently filter past the articles of no interest.
      
      
      This list will contain:
      
      
      o       Articles catering to security, hacking, firewalls, new security
              encryption, products, public hacks, hoaxes, legislation affecting
              these topics and more.

              * subscribe from any account with a small quota

      ==============
      NTSecurity.net brings the security community a brand new (Oct 99) and
      much-requested Windows security mailing list. This new moderated mailing list,
      Win2KSecAdvice (formerly NTSecAdvice,) is geared towards promoting the open
      discussion of Windows-related security issues.
      
      With a firm and unwavering commitment towards timely full disclosure, this
      new resource promises to become a great forum for open discussion
      regarding security-related bugs, vulnerabilities, potential exploits, virus,
      worms, Trojans, and more. Win2KSecAdvice promotes a strong sense of community
      and we openly invite all security minded individuals, be they white hat,
      gray hat, or black hat, to join the new mailing list.
      
      While Win2KSecAdvice was named in the spirit of Microsoft's impending product
      line name change, and meant to reflect the list's security focus both now and
      in the long run, it is by no means limited to security topics centered around
      Windows 2000. Any security issues that pertain to Windows-based networking are
      relevant for discussion, including all Windows operating systems, MS Office,
      MS BackOffice, and all related third party applications and hardware.
      
      The scope of Win2KSecAdvice can be summarized very simply: if it's relevant to
      a security risk, it's relevant to the list.
      
      The list archives are available on the Web at http://www.ntsecurity.net,
      which include a List Charter and FAQ, as well as Web-based searchable list
      archives for your research endeavors.

A.9  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
