   Synopsis 
   ---------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    In 1995, a New Jersey farmer yanked up a cable with his backhoe,
    knocking out 60 percent of the regional and long distance phone
    service in New York City and air traffic control functions in Boston,
    New York and Washington. In 1996, a rodent chewed through a cable
    in Palo Alto, California, and knocked Silicon Valley off the Internet for
    hours. In 1995, a New Jersey farmer yanked up a cable with his backhoe,

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

    EoF    - End of file

    EoD    - End of diatribe (AOL'ers: look it up)

    FUD    - Coined by Unknown and made famous by HNN <g> - "Fear uncertainty and doubt",
            usually in general media articles not high brow articles such as ours or other
            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same

        Author: nexus

        Ultratech-is.net was recently hacked by a new group on the net named Infiltrators Inc.,
        a new security group formed by "nexus."  Officials at Ultratech were alerted to the 
        security breach and have secured the server with the help of Infiltrators Inc.

        Ultratech's site remained "altered" for approximately 5 hours, and was still undiscovered
        by admins.  The group then removed the altered page and reposted the origional as the admins
        still did not notice.  The site was hacked using a private exploit made by Shiva2000 of
        Infiltrators Inc. to gain root access.  This is the first webpage altered by the group, who
        was founded May 24, 1999.

     'There are lots of opportunities; that's very scary'

      April 6, 1999
      Web posted at: 2:29 p.m. EDT (1829 GMT)

      By John Christensen
      CNN Interactive 
      
      (CNN) -- It is June, the children are out of school, and as highways and airports fill with vacationers, rolling
      power outages hit sections of Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and New York. An airliner is mysteriously
      knocked off the flight control system and crashes in Kansas. 
      
      Parts of the 911 service in Washington fail, supervisors at the Department of Defense discover that their e-mail
      and telephone services are disrupted and officers aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser find that their computer systems have
      been attacked. 
      
      As incidents mount, the stock market drops precipitously, and panic surges through the population. 
      
      Unlikely? Hardly. The "electronic Pearl Harbor" that White House terrorism czar Richard A. Clarke fears is not
      just a threat, it has already happened. 
      
      Much of the scenario above --
      except for the plane and stock
      market crashes and the panic --
      occurred in 1997 when 35 hackers
      hired by the National Security Agency launched simulated attacks on
      the U.S. electronic infrastructure. 
      
                "Eligible Receiver," as the exercise
                was called, achieved "root level"
                access in 36 of the Department of
                Defense's 40,000 networks. The
                simulated attack also "turned off"
                sections of the U.S. power grid,
                "shut down" parts of the 911
                network in Washington, D.C., and
                other cities and gained access to
                systems aboard a Navy cruiser at
                sea. 
      
                At a hearing in November 1997,
                Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, chairman of
                a Senate technology subcommittee,
                
      reported that nearly two-thirds of U.S. government computers
      systems have security holes. 
      
      "If somebody wanted to launch an attack," says Fred B. Schneider, a
      professor of computer science at Cornell University, "it would not be
      at all difficult." 
      
      'There are lots of opportunities'
      
      Although "Eligible Receiver" took place in the United States, which has
      about 40 percent of the world's computers, the threat of
      cyberterrorism is global. 
      
      Consider: 
      
      During the Gulf War, Dutch hackers stole information about U.S.
      troop movements from U.S. Defense Department computers and
      tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and
      turned it down.
      
      In March 1997, a 15-year-old Croatian youth penetrated
      computers at a U.S. Air Force base in Guam.
      
      In 1997 and 1998, an Israeli youth calling himself "The Analyzer"
      allegedly hacked into Pentagon computers with help from
      California teen-agers. Ehud Tenebaum, 20, was charged in
      Jerusalem in February 1999 with conspiracy and harming
      computer systems.
      
      In February 1999, unidentified hackers seized control of a British
      military communication satellite and demanded money in return
      for control of the satellite.
      
      The report was vehemently denied by the British military, which
      said all satellites were "where they should be and doing what
      they should be doing." Other knowledgable sources, including
      the Hacker News Network, called the hijacking highly unlikely.
      
      "There are lots of opportunities," says Schneider. "That's very scary." 
      
      'The Holy Grail of hackers'
      
      President Clinton announced in January 1999 a $1.46 billion initiative
      to deal with U.S. government computer security -- a 40 percent
      increase over fiscal 1998 spending. Of particular concern is the
      Pentagon, the military stronghold of the world's most powerful nation. 
      
      "It's the Holy Grail of hackers," says computer security expert Rob
      Clyde. "It's about bragging rights for individuals and people with weird
      agendas." 
      
      Clyde is vice president and general manager of technical security for
      Axent Technologies, a company headquartered in Rockville, Maryland,
      that counts the Pentagon as one of its customers. 
      
      The Defense Department acknowledges between 60 and 80 attacks a
      day, although there have been reports of far more than that. 
      
               The government says no top secret
               material has ever been accessed by
               these intruders, and that its most
               important information is not online.
               But the frustration is evident. 
      
               Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's
               National Infrastructure Protection
               Committee, told a Senate
               subcommittee last year that tracing
               cyberattacks is like "tracking vapor." 
      
               'A lot of clueless people'
      
               Schneider says the "inherently
               vulnerable" nature of the electronic
               infrastructure makes counterterrorism
               measures even more difficult.
               Schneider chaired a two-year study
               by the National Academy of Sciences
               and the National Academy of
               Engineering that found that the
               infrastructure is badly conceived and
               poorly secured. 
      
               "There is a saying that the amount of
               'clue' [knowledge] on the Internet is
               constant, but the size of the
               Internet is growing exponentially,"
               says Schneider. "In other words,
               there are a lot of clueless people out
               there. It's basically a situation where
               people don't know how to lock the
               door before walking out, so more and
               more machines are vulnerable." 
      
               Schneider says the telephone system
               is far more complicated than it used
               to be, with "a lot of nodes that are
               programmable, and databases that
               can be hacked." Also, deregulation of
               the telephone and power industries
               has created another weakness: To
               stay competitive and cut costs,
               companies have reduced spare
               capacity, leaving them more
               vulnerable to outages and disruptions
               in service. 
      
      Still another flaw is the domination of the telecommunications system
      by phone companies and Internet service providers (ISPs) that don't
      trust each other. As a result, the systems do not mesh seamlessly
      and are vulnerable to failures and disruptions. 
      
      "There's no way to organize systems built on mutual suspicion,"
      Schneider says. "We're subtly changing the underpinnings of the
      system, but we're not changing the way they're built. We'll keep
      creating cracks until we understand that we need a different set of
      principles for the components to deal with each other." 
      
      'The democratization of hacking'
      
      Meanwhile, the tools of mayhem are readily available. 
      
      There are about 30,000 hacker-oriented sites on the Internet, bringing
      hacking -- and terrorism -- within the reach of even the technically
      challenged. 
      
      "You no longer have to have knowledge, you just have to have the time," Clyde says. "You just
      download the tools and the programs. It's the democratization  of hacking. And with these
      programs ... they can click on a  button and send bombs to your network, and the systems will go
      down." 
      
      Schneider says another threat is posed not by countries or terrorists, but by gophers and squirrels and
      farmers. 
      
      In 1995, a New Jersey farmer yanked up a cable with his backhoe,
      knocking out 60 percent of the regional and long distance phone
      service in New York City and air traffic control functions in Boston,
      New York and Washington. In 1996, a rodent chewed through a cable
      in Palo Alto, California, and knocked Silicon Valley off the Internet for
      hours. 
      
      "Although the press plays up the security aspect of hacker problems,"
      says Schneider, "the other aspect is that the systems are just not
      built very reliably. It's easy for operators to make errors, and a gopher
      chewing on a wire can take out a large piece of the infrastructure.
      That's responsible for most outages today." 
      
      'The prudent approach'
      
      Schneider and Clyde favor a team of specialists similar to Clinton's
      proposed "Cyber Corps" program, which would train federal workers to
      handle and prevent computer crises. But they say many problems can
      be eliminated with simple measures. 
      
                These include "patches" for
                programs, using automated tools to
                check for security gaps and
                installing monitoring systems and
                firewalls. Fixes are often free and
                available on the Internet, but many
                network administrators don't install
                them. 
      
                A step toward deterrence was
                taken in 1998 when CIA Director
                George Tenet announced that the
                United States was devising a
                computer program that could attack
                the infrastructure of other
      countries. 
      
      "That's nothing new," says Clyde, "but it's the first time it was publicly
      announced. If a country tries to destroy our infrastructure, we want
      to be able to do it back. It's the same approach we've taken with
      nuclear weapons, the prudent approach." 
      
      The U.S. Government Accounting Office estimates that 120 countries
      or groups have or are developing information warfare systems. Clyde
      says China, France and Israel already have them, and that some
      Pentagon intrusions have surely come from abroad. 
      
      "We don't read about the actual attacks," says Clyde, "and you
      wouldn't expect to." 
      
      "The Analyzer" was caught after he bragged about his feat in
      computer chat rooms, but Clyde says the ones to worry about are
      those who don't brag and don't leave any evidence behind. 
      
      "Those are the scary ones," he says. "They don't destroy things for
      the fun of it, and they're as invisible as possible."

 04.0 The hacker from an administrator's point of view
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Submitted by System (Indonesia)
      
      Note: be gentle, this was translated from Indonesian.(ESL)
      
      Hacker : An overview from An Admin point of view.
      by system ( 30 mei 1999 ).
      
      
      Hacker's is an enemy
      ------------------
      
      Yes, that's true. Hacker's is an enemy for an certain of administrators. 
      Because hacker's to them are very annoyying. They only give an admin a lot of job to do, 
      from just maintenance the network, now plus he must watch the network, find the hole in his 
      network, and finally fix his network. Not even in the case when the hacker's can get in to 
      their network and break / steal / and modify the data's from their network user computers.
      
      Being an network adminitrator is not an easy way, not only he must know and understand how 
      the network goes, he also must have the capabilities to fix unknow error or hacker's intruders 
      in their network. [ This is what i call a good qualify admin ].
      
      But, it is not an easy to find that kind of admin. In this world, there are to many admin that 
      only know how to maintenance the network but cannot to find the hole in their network, or even 
      he cannot fix the hole. What they think is " This is not my job, my job is only maintenance the 
      network, i dont know anything else ".
      
      Well, this is the type of admin that call the hacker's an enemy, because they only think that 
      hacker only give them a job to do. Hacker's only trying to bring down their network. He never 
      think in the positive way. 
      
      But, is this true ??? ...
      
      Hacker's is a friend.
      --------------------
      
      Yes, that's true. Hacker's is a friend for a certain of administrator. They give back their 
      passion of working become live again. The hacker's helping them for strengthen their network.
      
      An administrator that call the hacker's as their friend is what i call an high dedication of 
      admin.
      
      Why ?
      
      Because that type of admin didn't think about the job that they must take, but they only think 
      that this is the right time that he has waiting for, it is a time that make their job's not 
      boring again, now they can find out the hole that exist in their network, and finally he can 
      fix the right hole in their network.
      
      Do you ever fell how good is when you do what you like ?
      
      If you do, that is the right felling that administrator fell too. They think hacker's is not 
      their enemy, but as their friend and their job mate that he must honouring them.

      Retaliation Against FBI Continues 


      contributed by mortel 
      The cracks of he US Senate web site and DoS attacks
      against the FBI web site was not the end of the
      protests over recent FBI actions. Last week the FBI
      executed up to nine search warrants mostly against
      members of a group known as gH or Global Hell. At this
      time HNN is not aware of any arrests that have been
      made. These actions by the FBI have upset a few
      people and in retaliation have attacked the US
      Department of Interior web site.

      F0rpaxe a group based in Portugal and with close
      connections to gH has claimed responsibility for defacing
      numerous web sites over the weekend (see list at
      bottom) and have also released a statement expressing
      their view about what has been going on. 

      
      F0rpaxe Statement
      
       
                 FORPAXE TECHNOLOGIES INC.

                         STATEMENT

     F0rpaxe needs to inform all people what is going on. At this
     moment and for what we know, F0rpaxe is the only Portuguese group
     that is executing massive attacks on edu, gov , mil, com,servers.
     Maybe this is the reason why F0rpaxe is now being wanted by PJ
     (Portuguese police) and some international organizations like FBI
     and Interpol. While we had been away for a few days we had watch
     several events on the Portuguese media whitch in a certain way
     implicates F0rpaxe. Some newspapers reported that PJ is now doing
     their homework together with FBI to lock down "Hackers" who
     aleggely are involved on US hacks. 

     Also PJ is now our BIG BROTHER since they are gathering efforts
     to make a net surveillence over POrtugual. For what it seems they
     have the help of Portuguese ISP's like Telapac. Their goal is to
     track down hackers...

     In an article of "EuroNoticias" they call hackers to the ones who
     use trojans to steal accounts (l0l). If PJ thinks that this is
     their biggest problem then that info about working together with
     the FBI is a bulshit... Portugal is now passing through serious or
     hilarious actions.. IF the goal of PJ is to track down people who
     use trojans to steal accounts then they have to arrest all
     population. We think that this isn't their main goal since F0rpaxe
     had been informed that PJ is trying to get solide proofs that we
     are the responsables for all those hacks.

     PJ doesn't scare anyone. IF FBI is really working together with PJ
     then they are doing this only because of us...most certainly to
     erase us from the system... FBI had been mounting schemes to
     track us down.... FBI had already tried to pretend being
     Iron-Lungs to get info about our current hacks, if we still had
     acess to gov servers, if we had copyed military databases and all
     that sort of things...

     The real I-L reported that the fake I-L wasn¥t him. The guy was
     always asking things and we just ignored...it could be just
     a lamer trying to get some info about us... But then the
     attemptives to track us down started: the guy started to contact
     people who are closed to F0rpaxe ,like some fo attrition staff, in 
     order to get our contact like phone etc... They even asked some of
     them to phone us.... When they realized that we had discover they
     started trying to get info from all those who surround us...a few
     days later an article on a newspapper reported that FBI and PJ
     were (or are?) working together... We don't know if all this is
     the truth or only a misunderstanding but one thing we know FBI
     really want us bad and they will do anything to caught us.

     We think that FBI doesn't want us just because of all the hacks but
     to show that they have the authoritie to arrest hackers of other
     country's. Although they need the permissions of the government and
     that isn't easy. They should be tired of making American Hackers
     life miserable and now they want to do the same with us....... As
     we told before we had been away for a while because things were 
     starting to be pretty badÖ 

     Groups who work on the shadow
     Some groups just disappear but they don't disappear trully..They
     start working on the shadow because FEDS are always ready to take
     them down...We thought that it would't happen that with us but
     sooner or later we will need to go back to where we belong...to
     the shadow. We also take this chance to show our support with
     people who are now facing legal troubles, like I-L, dk,
     Zyklon.....Kevin and all the others who will face them in the
     futureÖ gH has also our support.

     Information in Portugal 
     Portuguese media isnÔt aware of all this.... neither some admins
     who were hacked and nothing was reported....In Portugal people 
     don't care about what happens...They aren't aware that there are
     people building an underground system. Ity's just that. On CNN,
     ZDNET, Wired etc.. they inform what's happening.... In Portugal
     the media just doesn't give a shit.... Maybe this is the best for
     us since this will prevent a media hype and PJ and other FEDS
     won't be after us so soon..but information isn't circulating as
     it should. People built a bad image of the "hacker". Portuguese
     media report "hackers" as being the ones who use trojans...
     Man....they arten't aware of the true meaning of the concept 
     "hacker"  They should think about it...

     Why are we doing this?
     We agree with some of the things that had been said by some groups.
     We are always hacking and for what? We hack and hack things whitch
     can be fixed in 2 minutes. In fact we could have done worse like
     destroying completely all servers. We can do it if we w ant but
     hackers are waiting for justice. If FBI doesn¥t stop we won¥t and
     we can start destroying. We think that FBI should explain what a
     fuck they are doing. For the moment we won¥t destroy the servers
     we hack but if it is necessary we can burn alot of servers. For
     example this gov server could be erased completly. Everyone
     should think about this, about what¥s happening.

     Don't make all this a media hype just inform in a simple 
     manner....people need to know. People need to know why all this
     hacks. People need to know who FBI really is.

     Tough talk amid new Web assaults
     White House and federal agencies lay down the law 
     while computer attackers hit another federal Internet site
     By Alan Boyle, Bob Sullivan and Brock Meeks
      

 
     June 1   The White House, Pentagon, Justice Department and FBI all addressed a rash of
     electronic attacks on federal Web sites Tuesday, even as the attackers hit new targets. The protest
     campaign against last weeks FBI raids on  computer users spilled across global cyberspace,
     from the Pacific to Europe. 
     
     THE WEB ONSLAUGHT began nearly a week ago,
     after FBI agents served search warrants on members of the 
     hacker community in Washington state, Texas, California
     and other areas of the country.
            The raids  which were aimed at gathering evidence
     related to past computer intrusions as well as unauthorized
     use of telephone systems  sparked attacks that forced the
     shutdown of the FBI and U.S. Senate Web sites last week.
     After beefing up security, the Senate site is back in service,
     but the FBI site is still inaccessible.
            Scores of protest pages have rudely taunted the FBI,
     and government officials laid down the law at several news
     briefings Tuesday.
            Cyber-security is something the government takes
     very seriously, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
     in response to a reporters question. I know that there
     have been a series of attempts (to break into government
     computers) with some success, some without success. ...
     We take it very seriously. We are constantly reviewing and
     will continue to review the security measures we have.
            Last month, a group known as Global Hell, or gH, was
     implicated in attacks on the White House Web site as well
     as sites for several Cabinet departments and the U.S.
     Information Agency. Also last month, Global Hell member
     Eric Burns, who also goes by the name Zyklon, was
     indicted in connection with attacks on three computers,
     including the USIA system.
            

           White House Web site shut down


            Lockhart emphasized that those implicated in the latest
     wave of attacks were liable to face a similar fate.
            For those who think that this is some sort of sport, I
     think (it will be) less fun when the authorities do catch up
     with them ... and these people are prosecuted, he said.
            At another briefing, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
     Bacon said system administrators were briefly limiting Web
     access Tuesday so they could beef up security.
            He said such measures would make it much more
     difficult to deface Pentagon Web pages.
            It has not been a major problem, Bacon said. This is
     much more protective than reactive. Its looking to the
     future to prevent the types of problems (seen) at other
     agencies.
            Federal law-enforcement officials emphasized the harsh
     criminal penalties that Web intruders could face: Attackers
     who cause $5,000 worth of damage in one year could be
     charged with a federal felony that carries up to five years in
     prison, the head of the Justice Departments computer
     crime section, Scott Charney, told The Associated Press.
     Merely gaining unauthorized access to a government
     computer could bring a year in jail, but Charney pointed out
     that the cost of fixing a compromised Web site could mount
     to $5,000 in employee time alone.
            A Dallas telecommunications company suffered a
     considerable loss  perhaps ranging into millions of dollars
      because of intrusions that are the subject of the FBIs
     current investigation, bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi said.
            What we investigate are violations of law, he told
     MSNBC. If a hacker feels that our investigating
     somebodys illegal activity is somehow an infringement on
     that individuals freedom to do what he wants to do, then
     there is a basic misunderstanding of the way this country
     works.
            Scafidi said there was no intention on our part to
     select a group of people and pick on them. ... They get the
     first move in this game.
            But he also indicated that the justice system intended to
     have the last word.
            When there is a violation ... we will pursue it, and
     usually we will knock on somebodys door and maybe take
     some computer equipment, he said. Such equipment may
     have to be held for months or years, to be used as evidence
     in a trial or during the appeal process, he said.
            As for the FBI sites down time, Scafidi said: That
     isnt affecting the FBIs investigative response in any way. It
     is a problem for us in that we rely on our Web site as a
     place for anybody to go and get information on the FBI for
     any purpose ... so it is a public information resource for us,
     and since it has been down it has really been affecting a lot
     of innocent parties out there. 


            
            
     THE LATEST VICTIMS
            Tuesdays governmental victim was the General
     Services Administration, which manages U.S. government
     property. At least three pages on the Web site for the
     GSAs Office of Governmentwide Policy 
     www.policyworks.gov  were briefly replaced with
     protest pages.
            Our sentence is hacking everything we can as a
     protest to FBI current actions, one page read.
            The hacked pages were accessible for 10 to 15
     minutes, said Joe McKay, director of office information
     systems at the Office of Governmentwide Policy. He said
     the attacker apparently gained access through a security gap
     related to file transfer protocol, or FTP. 
            Weve terminated all FTP services, and I am issuing
     on a need-to-use basis new FTP access, he told MSNBC.
     The site was working normally Tuesday night, and computer
     server logs were being analyzed for further clues, he said.
            Were always playing catch-up, it seems, he said.
     Its important to show (the attackers), Hey, you got us,
     but were OK now. 
            The hacked pages claimed credit on behalf of a group
     called Forpaxe, including a member using the handle
     M1crochip. Similar credits appeared on hacked pages
     placed Tuesday on Web servers at Monash University in
     Australia and Coca-Colas Belgian subsidiary, as well as a
     page that briefly appeared Monday at the Idaho National
     Engineering and Environmental Labs Web site. 
            The hacked pages indicated that M1crochip lived in
     Portugal  which others in the hacker community
     confirmed. Another computer user said to be involved in the
     current wave of Web attacks reportedly lived in Britain.
            
     BACKGROUND ON THE FBI RAIDS
            Members of Global Hell reported that law-enforcement
     officials served search warrants last Wednesday in Texas,
     California and Washington state. AntiOnline, a Web site
     focusing on the hacker community, indicated that the sweep
     extended to other states as well.
            One of the subjects of the search warrants was a
     contractor working at Microsoft, which is a partner in the
     joint venture that operates MSNBC. When contacted by
     MSNBC, the contractor  who uses the online handle
     VallaH  confirmed that nine law-enforcement agents
     served him with a warrant at his Seattle-area apartment,
     interrogated him and confiscated computer equipment. 
            He said he was not involved in any illegal activity and
     surmised that he was implicated by a former associate in the
     hacker community.
            FBI agents also contacted Microsoft, said company
     spokesman Adam Sohn.
            This is an active investigation, and theres not a lot we
     can say, Sohn said Monday. Its an FBI matter, its not a
     Microsoft matter.
            He indicated that FBI agents were interested in
     computer equipment that VallaH used at Microsoft. As far
     as I have been told, we are still in possession of the
     property. However, were cooperating with the FBI in the
     investigation, Sohn said.
            VallaH said he was told not to report for work at
     Microsoft.
            We did ask that his assignment at Microsoft be
     terminated. I dont know what his status is with his
     contracting agency, Sohn said.
            
     MEANWHILE, IN HOUSTON ...
            In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss told
     MSNBC that agents were investigating allegations of
     computer intrusions involving, among others, a teen-ager
     who uses the hacker handle Mosthated.
            In telephone conversations with MSNBC, Mosthated
     said that his home was raided at about 6 a.m. CT
     Wednesday, and that family computer equipment was
     confiscated. He said his parents were really mad. ... The
     computer had all their financial information and stuff on it.
     Mosthateds mother got on the line to read from the FBIs
     receipt for the equipment and confirm that she was really
     mad.
            Mosthated said at least eight other people around the
     country had been served with search warrants as part of a
     huge hacker crackdown. Four other Houston-area
     hackers, three in California and one in the Seattle area
     reportedly received FBI visits. None was arrested, but all
     had computer equipment confiscated, he said.
            Media representatives at FBI offices in San Diego and
     Seattle said they could not comment on the investigation.

     Hackers Strike Again
     Deface Interior Department and Supercomputer Lab Web Sites 

     By Ted Bridis
     The Associated Press
     W A S H I N G T O N, June 1  A spate of high-tech
     vandalism against the government continued this
     week, as computer hackers defaced two more
     federal Web sites and left a taunting note
     promising to attack other sites because of a
     related FBI investigation.
          Hackers from different organizations defaced Web
     sites Monday for the Interior Department and a federal
     supercomputer laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho, claiming
     its our turn to hit them where it hurts.
          These are the perils of open government, said
     Stephanie Hanna, an Interior spokeswoman. We try to
     make as much of the materials of the Interior Department
     as open and available as possible. The consequence of
     that is, those who choose to do damaging things can do
     that.
          Messages left at the attacked sites suggest they were
     vandalized to retaliate against what was said to be the
     FBIs harassment of specific hacker groups, including the
     group that boasted of breaking into the White House site
     last month.
          The FBI confirmed it executed four search warrants
     last week in Texas related to an investigation into
     allegations of computer intrusion, including one search at
     the home of a prominent hacker in Houston. 

     FBI Took Down Site Last Week
     Last week, hackers claiming to be from another group
     defaced the Web site for the Senate, causing it to be
     taken offline through the weekend.
          The FBI also was forced to take down its own
     Internet site last week after hackers launched an electronic
     attack against it. It remained inaccessible Monday, along
     with the Web site for its National Infrastructure Protection
     Center, which helps investigate computer crimes.
          On Interiors Web page, the hackers left a message
     Monday saying they were going after every computer on
     the Net with a .gov (suffix). ... Well keep hitting them
     until they get down on their knees and beg.
          At the site maintained by the Idaho National
     Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, a note
     threatened the electronic destruction of the powerful
     computers that serve pages on the Internet if the FBI
     doesnt stop.
          We could have done worse, like destroying
     completely all servers, the note said. We can do it if we
     want, but hackers are waiting for Justice. 

     Warnings of More to Come 
     In an online interview with The Associated Press, the
     hacker claiming responsibility for the laboratory attack
     warned that further FBI investigation would result in more
     severe damage.
          The hacker identified himself only as M1crochip, living
     in Portugal and part of a group calling themselves
     F0rpaxe. The interview was arranged through a mutually
     trusted third party.
          If FBI doesnt do anything and doesnt stop arresting
     people and making our life miserable, each member of
     F0rpaxe will discuss an eventual destruction of every
     single server, he said. If that happens, everything goes
     down.
          He added, We dont want to proceed that way, and
     called the electronic attacks the only resource of the
     hacker community.
          The FBI in Washington declined comment Monday.
          Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia
     indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer
     intrusion. Burns reportedly is known on the Internet as
     Zyklon and is believed to be a member of the group that
     claimed responsibility for the attacks on the White House
     and Senate sites.
          Zyklon was one of a dozen names listed on the
     hacked version of the White House Web site, which was
     altered overnight Sunday for a few minutes before
     government computers automatically detected the
     intrusion.
          Burns was accused of breaking into a computer used
     by the U.S. Information Agency between August 1998
     and January 1999. The grand jury also said Burns broke
     into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet of
     Fairfax, Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of
     Washington.

      This article gives the impression that some of todays

      placed on these things. A choice quote from the article

      What We Leave Behind
      Online Activities Become Open Trail for Authorities 

      By Calvin Woodward
      The Associated Press
      L E E S B U R G,   Va.,   May 28  Go for a walk,
      drive a car or dance in the moonlight and
      chances are, no one notices. Journey on the
      Internet and a trail is left. 
           And police are hot on that trail in a growing number of
      criminal investigations. 
           Armed with search warrants, police are looking into
      the online activities of suspects, and sometimes victims, by
      seizing evidence from Internet service providers and
      finding material that people online never dreamed would
      end up in the hands of the law. 
           Private e-mail between lovers. The threatening
      missives of haters. The true identities of people hiding
      behind screen names in a medium they thought was the
      essence of secrecy. 
 
      Va. Sheriff Helps Get AOL Help
      Ultimately, if you break the law, it can be traced, said
      investigator Ron Horack of the Loudoun County, Va.,
      sheriffs department. Horack helps police around the
      country apply for search warrants to get material from the
      county-based America Online, the worlds largest Internet
      service provider with 18 million customers. 
           I know who you are and where you live, an
      anonymous hatemonger e-mailed a 12-year-old girl in
      Lancaster, Pa. By peeking into the accounts of Internet
      providers, police can often say the same thing: They know
      who the threatening people are and where they live. 
           This week federal authorities said they had charged a
      northern Virginia pediatrician with possessing child
      pornography after investigating his AOL account and
      finding at least 22 explicit images sent to him via e-mail
      over the course of nearly six months. They said they then
      found more child pornography on his computer. The
      doctor could not immediately be reached for comment. 
 
      Wide Powers of Warrant
      With a warrant, law enforcement authorities can look at
      the electronic mail and other online communications of
      people suspected of a range of serious crimes, getting
      information not just from a home computer but often the
      company that provides the Internet, e-mail or chat service.
 
           They can do the same with victims, in the process
      seeing mail from people who corresponded with them but
      had nothing to do with a crime. Everything from humdrum
      to-do lists to love letters from illicit digital dalliances
      becomes potential evidence, and eventually a matter of
      public record. 
           It is a growing risk to privacy, said Marc Rotenberg,
      executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
      Center, who says police should stick to traditional
      methods such as stings, informants and forensic evidence,
      which dont invade peoples communications. 
           Said Horack: If theyre going to use the Internet for
      their crime, were going to use the Internet to catch them.
 
      Used in Littleton Investigation
      Authorities turned to AOL to see some of the online
      activities of the two high school students who killed 13
      other people and themselves in Littleton, Colo., last
      month. Theyve used it to try to track down some of the
      copycat threats that have closed many schools since. 
           They took the same route, thus far with inconclusive
      results, after a woman in Pennsylvania was told in a chat
      room, I guarantee you I will hurt you if you dont listen to
      me, and when a man in New York was charged with
      attempted murder of his wife, who, police say, was having
      a passionate online encounter her husband happened to
      see. 
           AOL is extremely law-enforcement friendly, Horack
      said. They dont hold anything back. 
           America Online tells its nearly 18 million customers it
      wont read or disclose private communication or personal
      identifying information except under a valid legal
      process. 
 
      Most ISPs Have Similar Rules
      Other major Internet service providers, or ISPs, as well
      as separate online e-mail services and Internet hubs like
      Hotmail and Yahoo, say much the same, although the
      disclaimers may be hard to find in screens of small print. 
           We have a long-standing policy of cooperation with
      law enforcement, said AOL spokesman Rich DAmato. 
           Communications such as e-mail are disclosed only in
      criminal investigations and with a warrant, he says. In
      response to orders in civil cases, AOL may give out
      information allowing someones real name to be matched
      to a screen name. 
           So if a spouse is found to be having an online affair
      with someone known only as Heart4U, the identity of that
      cyberlover might eventually be uncovered in a divorce
      proceeding. 
 
      Chat Rooms Not That Anonymous
      Raytheon Inc. obtained subpoenas to identify 21 people,
      most of them employees, said to have been spreading
      corporate secrets and gripes in an anonymous online chat
      room. 
           It then dropped a lawsuit it had brought against the 21,
      each identified as John Doe, indicating to privacy
      experts that the company had gone to court in the first
      place only to learn the identities of the chatters. Four
      employees quit; others entered corporate counseling. 
           Privacy advocates worry that authorities could go on
      increasingly invasive fishing expeditions. 
           There are simply many more events that are recorded
      (online) that would not be recorded in the physical world,
      said Rotenberg. I think it is going to become an
      enormous problem as people become more and more
      dependent on ISPs. 
 
      Anonymous Options Fight Back
      Meanwhile, tools continue to be developed to protect
      anonymity  a site called anonymizer.com, for one, will
      relay e-mail, stripping out the senders identifying
      information. 
           So far, at least, few warrants going to AOL look like
      goose chases, an impression formed after a review of the
      more than 100 that have been filed in Leesburg this year. 
           Most involve alleged pedophiles, stalkers and
      harassers who have used the Internet to find prey and left
      evidence of their intentions with victims or undercover
      police. 
           Horack prepares warrant applications for police from
      other parts of the country, some so new to digital
      detective work they need their childrens help to get
      online. Once they are approved by a magistrate, he takes
      them to AOL and retrieves the information. Its almost a
      full-time job, offered by the sheriff because the company
      gives such a big boost to the county. 
 
      Works Well With Pedophile Search
      The warrants are especially effective against child
      pornographers, Horack says. Pedophiles are pack rats.
      They dont throw away anything. Even when they do
      delete material from their computer, it might be found at
      the service provider. 
           In the case of the 12-year-old Pennsylvania girl,
      nothing turned up in the AOL search. Most of the time,
      something does. 
           For example, police in Hendersonville, Tenn., turned
      to AOL to see the Internet activity of Dennis Wayne
      Cope, 47, shot and found dead in a crawl space of his
      home in February. 
           In an affidavit seeking access to Copes e-mail,
      buddy list content and other online activities, police said
      he had been corresponding online with the estranged wife
      of suspect Robert Lee Pattee. They also say Pattees
      hand print was found at the scene. 
          Pattee has been charged with first-degree murder.

     Introduction 

     Australia's citizens are about to be subject to content regulation on the Internet following the introduction of an amendment to existing
     legislation relating to broadcasting services. This legislation defines certain responsibilities for the ABA (Australian Broadcasting
     Authority), the OFLC (Office of Film and Literature Classification) and any company or individual providing public access to "Internet
     content". All rhetoric aside about "big brother" and how this legislation spells the end of free speech in this country, it is acknowledged
     by most if not all participants in the debate about this legislation that, for a number of reasons it will be very difficult if not impossible
     to effectively stem the tide of what the government calls "illegal and offensive material". 

     This paper has one aim - to highlight the futility of attempting such content regulation by explicitly describing the legal means by which
     citizens can evade the provisions within the legislation. 

     Warning 

     I believe that all Australian laws should be in language understandable by ordinary Australians. This paper is my interpretation of the
     Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act 1999 and should not be construed as anything more than this. Just as I believe
     what you view on the Internet should be your own responsibility, if you choose to follow any of my suggestions here, it's your sole
     responsibility to deal with any adverse or unforseen consequences of those actions. That said, if you disagree with anything I've said
     here, feel free to contact me. 

     The means of evasion... 

     I should point out that most of these means of evasion assume that the content you want to access is outside the country and
     therefore beyond the effective reach of the "take down notices" mentioned in the legislation. 

          Use an alternate proxy network - connect to a different proxy server on a non-standard port 
          Mask web content before entering the proxy network - change some words, change some server names 
          Encrypt the content - they can't regulate what they can't read 
               Encrypt web content before it enters the proxy network 
               Use an encrypted VPN/tunnel for streaming content 
          Distribute content by means of a "company" to your "employees" 
          Offer on-demand, point-to-point email access to content 
          Flood the ABA with legitimate, appropriate complaints 
          Use a "recognised alternative access prevention arrangement" 
          Mirror content so widely as to prevent effective enforcement of the legislation 

     Use an alternate proxy network 

     You should be able to access any content you wish by connecting to a proxy server network outside Australia either directly from your
     browser on a port other than 80, 3128 or 8080 (the most popular proxy server ports, and the ones most likely being transparently
     proxied) or using a Squid-like cache internal to your network that accesses a proxy hierarchy outside Australia on a port other than
     3130 (the standard ICP port). 

     This assumes that the government does not mandate the use of a packet level filter, regardless of how ineffective one might be at
     locating banned content in a stream of data passing through it and preventing access to it. If it were to do this, it would most likely be
     done using an industry standard able to be defined under Part 5 of the legislation. 

     Transparent proxying, for those unsure of it's meaning, is the process of redirecting a users' outgoing web content request through a
     network switch capable of what's called layer 3 routing. Layer 3 routing enables the network switch to invisibly redirect the web
     content request away from the intended destination into a proxy server which then fetches the web content for you, assuming it's not
     been configured to block certain URLs or certain media types (mpg movies, for example). 

     Mask web content before entering the proxy network 

     Assume your ISP uses transparent proxying methods to pass all web content through a filter of some kind. What about masking the web
     content in some way at the server (aka "internet host") end such that when it passes unhindered through the proxy network, your
     computer can unmask the information, making it visible to you . A basic example of this, but one that only masks the URL you're trying
     to access is accessible here. The Youth Alliance against Internet Censorship offers information on software for your computer that can
     disable a proxy server here. 

     Encrypt the content before it enters the proxy network 

     Above, I mentioned the ability to mask content on the server side before it passes through the proxy network. The same concept can
     applied to any Internet content using encryption. This could be achieved using a traditional SSL-based transaction between a server
     and your own computer, by means of a PGP-based transaction with an appropriately configured server, or by using any other form of
     encryption that prevents decryption by anyone other than yourself. 

     Use an encrypted VPN/tunnel for streaming content 

     A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. It allows physically separate networks to operate in a homogenous fashion by encrypting packets at
     one particular "endpoint", tunnelling them (sending in a point-to-point fashion) across the internet, then decrypting them at some other
     "endpoint", protecting the information being passed between the two networks. A typical use of a VPN is by a company with offices in
     different cities or in different countries. VPN technologies are offered by a number of major networking vendors including Cisco, Bay
     Networks and Ascend, though usually with a fairly high price tag attached. At a more grass roots level, end users can download and
     use a product called SSH (Secure Shell) to give them secure network access to UNIX shells and set up encrypted tunnels between two
     hosts. For Linux users, the kernel comes with tunnelling code built-in and can be made secure with IPSEC patches available from the
     Netherlands. 

     Distribute content by means of a "company" to your "employees" 

     The legislation allows for information to be distributed to an end-user provided they are within your "immediate circle" and is described
     in Subclause 9(1-4): 

          9 Supply to the public 

                (1) This clause sets out the circumstances in which an Internet carriage
                service is taken, for the purposes of subclause 8(1), to be supplied to the
                public. 
                (2) If: 
                      (a) an Internet carriage service is used for the carriage of information
                          between 2 end-users; and 
                      (b) each end-user is outside the immediate circle of the supplier
                          of the service;
                          
                the service is supplied to the public. 
                    
                    Note: If a company makes Internet content available for access on the Internet,
                    and an individual obtains access to the content using an Internet carriage
                    service, the company and the individual are end-users in relation to the carriage
                    of the content by the Internet carriage service. 
                    
                (3) If: 
                      (a) an Internet carriage service is used to supply point-to-multipoint
                          services to end-users; and 
                      (b) at least one end-user is outside the immediate circle of the supplier
                          of the service;
                          
                the service is supplied to the public. 
                    
                (4) If: 
                      (a) an Internet carriage service is used to supply designated content services
                          (other than point-to-multipoint services) to end-users; and 
                      (b) at least one end-user is outside the immediate circle of the supplier of
                          the service; 
                          
                the service is supplied to the public. 

     The thing to note here are the words "immediate circle". Jumping back up in the document to the definition, we note it refers to the
     Telecommunications Act of 1997. Jumping to the (rather long) definition in that legislation, we find that your "immediate circle" refers to
     employees if you are a company: 

          Immediate circle 

          SECT. (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person's "immediate circle" consists of the person, together with the following persons:

                (a) if the person is an individual--an employee of the individual;
                
          continued...

     In theory, using this aspect of the legislation, you could create a company and employ individuals interested in the banned content you
     have on offer. Far fetched, but apparently possible. The definition, interestingly, would also allow a University to offer banned content
     to it's employees and students. 

     Offer on-demand, point-to-point email access to content 

     In the early days of the commercial internet, before the invention of the World Wide Web, not everybody had access to the FTP sites
     that contained lots of information. The way most people got around this restriction/limitation was using a service called ftp-by-email.
     To use it, you'd send an email to a certain address containing a sequence of standard ftp commands, as follows: 

          From: 2600 Webmaster (webmaster@2600.org.au)
          To: FTP-By-Email (ftpmail@ftp.sunet.se)

          open mirror.aarnet.edu.au
          cd pub/linux/kernel
          cd v2.2
          binary
          get README
          quit

     Following the receipt of this email, any files you had requested with a "get" command would be emailed back to you. A rundown of how
     this (still) works can be found here. 

     Now, referring to the legislation, we find the following definition of "Internet content": 

          Internet content means information that: 
                      (a) is kept on a data storage device; and 
                      (b) is accessed, or available for access, using an Internet carriage service;
                but does not include: 
                      (c) ordinary electronic mail; or 
                      (d) information that is transmitted in the form of a broadcasting service. 

     and of "ordinary electronic mail": 

          ordinary electronic mail does not include a posting to a newsgroup. 

     Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Assuming the content is not accessible to the public by any means other than point-to-point,
     user-requested email, you could be very well within the law to offer content that is otherwise banned in any other forum. 

     Flood the ABA with legitimate, appropriate complaints 

     I'll start describing this means of evasion by displaying Clause 26. Take particular note of Subclause 26(2b): 

          26 Investigation of complaints by the ABA 

                (1) The ABA must investigate a complaint under Division 1. 
                
                (2) However, the ABA need not investigate the complaint if: 
                      (a) the ABA is satisfied that the complaint is: 
                            (i) frivolous; or 
                            (ii) vexatious; or 
                            (iii) not made in good faith; or 
                      (b) the ABA has reason to believe that the complaint was made for the purpose, or for
                          purposes that include the purpose, of frustrating or undermining the effective
                          administration of this Schedule. 
                          
                (3) The ABA must notify the complainant of the results of such an investigation. 
                
                (4) The ABA may terminate such an investigation if it is of the opinion that it does not have
                    sufficient information to conclude the investigation. 

     Okay, so they thought people might flood them with frivolous complaints... Fair enough. But isn't it the case that every site that is not
     investigated by the ABA remains unregulated and therefore free? I'm sure you can put two and two together on this one. 

     Use a "recognised alternative access prevention arrangement" 

     I'll start this one by displaying two rather lengthy but important subclauses of the legislation, both of which describe possible means to
     evade content regulation by installing (but presumably not using) one of the currently-available end-user filtering pieces of software.
     Firstly Subclause 40(4-7): 

          40 Action to be taken in relation to a complaint about prohibited content hosted outside Australia 

                    (1) - (3)
                    
          Recognised alternative access-prevention arrangements 

                (4) An Internet service provider is not required to comply with a standard access-prevention
                    notice in relation to a particular end-user if access by the end-user is subject to a
                    recognised alternative access-prevention arrangement(as defined by subclause (5)) that
                    is applicable to the end-user. 
                    
                (5) The ABA may, by written instrument, declare that a specified arrangement is a recognised
                    alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this Division
                    to one or more specified end-users if the ABA is satisfied that the arrangement is likely to
                    provide a reasonably effective means of preventing access by those end-users to prohibited
                    content and potential prohibited content.
                    
                    Note: For specification by class, see subsection 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
                    
                (6) The following are examples of arrangements that could be declared to be recognised alternative
                    access-prevention arrangements under subclause
                    
                (5): 
                      (a) an arrangement that involves the use of regularly updated Internet content filtering software; 
                      (b) an arrangement that involves the use of a "family-friendly" filtered Internet carriage service.
                       
                (7) An instrument under subclause (5) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A
                    of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901

     and Subclause 60(3-8): 

          60 Matters that must be dealt with by industry codes and industry standards 

                (1) - (2)

          Designated alternative access-prevention arrangements 

                (3) An industry code or an industry standard may provide that an Internet service provider is not
                    required to deal with Internet content notified under paragraph 40(1)(b) of this Schedule or
                    clause 46 by taking steps to prevent particular end-users from accessing the content if access
                    by the end-users is subject to an arrangement that is declared by the code or standard to be a
                    designated alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this
                    clause to those end-users. 
                    
                (4) An industry code developed by a body or association must not declare that a specified arrangement
                    is a designated alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of
                    this clause to one or more specified end-users unless the body or association is satisfied that the
                    arrangement is likely to provide a reasonably effective means of preventing access by those end-users
                    to prohibited content and potential prohibited content. 
                    
                    Note: For specification by class, see subsection 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
                    
                (5) An industry standard made by the ABA must not declare that a specified arrangement is a designated
                    alternative access-prevention arrangement for the purposes of the application of this clause to one
                    or more specified end-users unless the ABA is satisfied that the arrangement is likely to provide a
                    reasonably effective means of preventing access by those end-users to prohibited content and potential
                    prohibited content. 
                    
                    Note: For specification by class, see subsection 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
                    
                (6) The following are examples of arrangements that could be declared to be designated alternative
                    access-prevention arrangements: 
                      (a) an arrangement that involves the use of regularly updated Internet content filtering software; 
                      (b) an arrangement that involves the use of a "family-friendly" filtered Internet carriage service. 
                      
                (7) For the purposes of this Schedule, if an industry code: 
                      (a) deals to any extent with procedures to be followed by Internet service providers in dealing
                          with Internet content notified under paragraph
                      40(1)(b) of this Schedule or clause 46; and 
                      (b) makes provision as mentioned in subclause (3); 
                then: 
                      (c) the code is taken to deal with the matter set out in paragraph (2)(d); and 
                      (d) the code is taken to be consistent with subclause (2). 
                      
                (8) For the purposes of this Schedule, if an industry standard: 
                      (a) deals to any extent with procedures to be followed by Internet service providers in dealing
                          with Internet content notified under paragraph
                      40(1)(b) of this Schedule or clause 46; and 
                      (b) makes provision as mentioned in subclause (3); 
                then: 
                      (c) the standard is taken to deal with the matter set out in paragraph (2)(d); and 
                      (d) the standard is taken to be consistent with subclause (2). 

     Now, if you've made it through all of that, you'll note a single key thing - that subject to appropriate industry codes and standards, it
     may be possible to have an unfiltered internet feed delivered to you if you have an end-user filtering system installed on your computer.
     The means of evasion here? Turn the filter off. Not exactly rocket science, is it? 

     Mirror content so widely as to prevent effective enforcement of the legislation 

     As with the two previous means of evasion, I will begin by displaying several pieces of the legislation. First up is Clause 36: 

          36 Anti-avoidance-special take-down notices 

                If: 
                      (a) an interim take-down notice or a final take-down notice relating to particular Internet
                          content is applicable to a particular Internet content host; and 
                      (b) the ABA is satisfied that the Internet content host is hosting in Australia, or is proposing
                           to host in Australia, Internet content (the similar Internet content) that is the same as,
                           or substantially similar to, the Internet content identified in the interim take-down notice
                           or the final take-down notice, as the case may be; and 
                      (c) the ABA is satisfied that the similar Internet content is prohibited content or potential
                          prohibited content; 
                the ABA may give the Internet content host a written notice (a special take-down notice) directing the
                host not to host the similar Internet content at any time when the interim take-down notice or final
                take-down notice, as the case may be, is in force. 

     Clause 36 appears to apply to mirrored information or, quite possibly, a website consisting of different layout/text but identical images.
     I'll now move onto Clauses 46 and 47: 

          46 Anti-avoidance-notified Internet content 

                (1) If: 
                      (a) particular Internet content has been notified to Internet service providers as mentioned
                          in Paragraph 40(1)(b) of this Schedule; and 
                      (b) the notification has not been withdrawn; and 
                      (c) the ABA is satisfied that Internet content (the similar Internet content) that is the same
                          as, or substantially similar to, the first-mentioned Internet content is being hosted
                          outside Australia; and 
                      (d) the ABA is satisfied that the similar Internet content is prohibited content or potential
                          prohibited content; and 
                      (e) a code registered, or standard determined, under Part 5 of this Schedule deals with the
                          matters referred to in subclause 60(2); 
                the ABA must notify the similar Internet content to Internet service providers under the designated
                notification scheme set out in the code or standard, as the case may be. 
                
                (2) If: 
                      (a) particular Internet content is notified to Internet service providers as mentioned in
                          Paragraph 40(1)(b) of this Schedule; and 
                      (b) as a result of the application of subclause (1) to that content, the ABA notifies similar
                          Internet content to Internet service providers in accordance with subclause (1); and 
                      (c) the notification of the first-mentioned content is withdrawn; 
                the notification of the similar Internet content is taken to have been withdrawn. 
                
                (3) If: 
                      (a) a notification of Internet content is withdrawn under subclause (2); and 
                      (b) a code registered, or standard determined, under Part 5 of this Schedule deals with the
                          matters referred to in subclause 60(2); 
                the ABA must notify the withdrawal to Internet service providers under the designated notification
                scheme set out in the code or standard, as the case may be. 

          47 Anti-avoidance-special access-prevention notice 

                (1) If: 
                      (a) a standard access-prevention notice relating to particular Internet content is applicable
                          to a particular Internet service provider; and 
                      (b) the ABA is satisfied that the Internet service provider is supplying an Internet carriage
                          service that enables end-users to access Internet content (the similar Internet content)
                          that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the Internet content identified in the
                          standard-access prevention notice; and 
                      (c) the ABA is satisfied that the similar Internet content is prohibited content or potential
                          prohibited content; the ABA may give the provider a written notice (special access-prevention
                          notice) directing the provider to take all reasonable steps to prevent end-users from accessing
                          the similar Internet content at any time when the standard access-prevention notice is in force. 
                          
                          Note: The ABA may be taken to have given a notice under this clause-see clause 51. 
                          
                (2) For the purposes of subclause (1), in determining whether particular steps are reasonable, regard must be had to: 
                      (a) the technical and commercial feasibility of taking the steps; and 
                      (b) the matters set out in subsection 4(3). 
                      
                (3) Subclause (2) does not, by implication, limit the matters to which regard must be had. 

                recognised alternative access-prevention arrangements 

                (4) An Internet service provider is not required to comply with a special access-prevention notice in
                    relation to a particular end-user if access by the end-user is subject to a recognised alternative
                    access-prevention arrangement (as defined by subclause 40(5)) that is applicable to the end-user.


     The means of avoidance here would be purely and simply mirroring content so widely and in so many derivative (and possibly dissimilar)
     forms that even the process of generating take-down notices and notifying internet services providers would bog down the ABA and
     the OFLC. 

     Commentary 

     The intent of this legislation, as stated by the government, was to prevent children accessing "illegal and offensive" material on the
     Internet. More specifically, they made reference in various forums to pornographic material. My concern is not that responsible adults
     will be prevented from accessing this material, but that the legislation does not explicitly define what else might be regulated on the
     whim of a misguided Government minister or influential moral crusader within the ranks of the ABA or OFLC. 

     One example of what might be banned is the BugTraq mailing list. This list contains "full disclosure" discussions of computer software
     bugs, including in some cases explicit instructions on how to break into computers. What might be easily overlooked in any such
     government review of this material is the fact that in most cases, such information is accompanied by further instructions on how to
     secure any vulnerable computers. 

     Another oft-quoted example of how an overzealous filter might exclude important content is in the area of health. Breast cancer.
     Sexually-transmitted diseases. Contraception. If it's got any of the words filtered by Senator Alston's favoured filtering solution, iFilter
     (a number of them listed here), chances are your friendly neighbourhood ISP will be told to ban it long before you see it. 

     Conclusion 

     As you can see, there's a number of loopholes in the legislation that our government has pushed through parliament, and most of them
     allow a mildly intelligent citizen to quite legally evade any form of content regulation. Far from suggesting that this legislation should be
     heavier-handed than it already is in restricting people from accessing the information they want, I am suggesting that it should have
     been thrown out by the Paliament on the basis that it is fundamentally flawed and unenforceable. 

     Instead, and without fear tactics or moralist rhetoric, the Government could have instituted a public education campaign informing
     parents about the need to restrict unsupervised/unfiltered access to the Internet with young children (5-13) and begin a dialogue
     about personal responsibility and self moderation with older ones (13 and up). As a young person that has grown up in the midst of
     computers and communication technologies, I believe this would have achieved a much more productive outcome. 

     Feedback 

     Given that this is a layperson's analysis of the legislation, I invite any and all comment from similarly concerned citizens, and in
     particular citizens familiar with legal matters that may be able to provide further insight. 

     Please feel free to make comments to webmaster@2600.org.au.

      Can CIA Break Into Banks? 


      contributed by Weld Pond 
      Last week Newsweek reported that the CIA was
      planning to electronically break into unnamed banks to
      get at Slobodan Milosevic's money. How realistic is this?
      Is it possible and if so what are the international
      implications? MSNBC takes a look at these questions and more.

      Experts argue plan to raid Milosevics bank accounts would
      do more harm than good
                                                 By Bob Sullivan
                                                           MSNBC

      May 28  It sounded like a Tom Clancy spy novel.
      Newsweek reported last week that the CIA was
      planning to tinker with international bank
      accounts full of Slobodan Milosevics money 
      just another way of getting under the Yugoslav
      presidents skin. Information warfare experts
      disagree about the feasibility of such a
      cyberattack. But theres little disagreement the
      U.S. stands to lose much more than it might gain
      from firing the first volley in such an infomation
      war. In fact, some believe damage has already
      been done.
      
      
      THE NEWSWEEK STORY RAISED several issues:
      What international laws would govern a U.S.-backed attack
      on a bank in a third-party nation? Is such an attack feasible
      in the first place? What kind of retaliation might U.S.
      citizens, and their bank accounts, face? But most important,
      what does even the possibility of such an attack do to the
      integrity of international banking systems?
             The story on the cyberattack  fact, fiction or
      somewhere in between  could already have put the U.S.
      at risk, said Kawika Daguio, executive vice president of the
      Financial Information Protection Association. 
             Banking systems hinge on public confidence. You put
      the money in; youre confident youll be able to take the
      money out. If theres any hint you might not be able to get at
      your money, youd withdraw it. Any attack on the integrity
      of a banking system anywhere  particularly when
      retaliation seems like such an obvious possibility  chips
      away at public confidence.
             It bothers me because we have had conversations
      with the defense and intelligence community. We thought
      this was off the table, Daguio said. Weve had discussions
      with rather senior policy-makers. We thought they
      understood the importance of protecting public confidence
      in the payment system.
             But retaliation by foreign agents might be just one
      source of insecurity for U.S. account holders. Theres
      another: If the government can and is willing to tinker with
      foreign accounts, what will stop it from tinkering with mine?
             
             Could U.S. agents hijack Milosevics money, allegedly
      stashed away in foreign banks? Yes and no. 
             Experts agree that the CIA has had the know-how to
      control bank accounts for years, through old-fashioned
      non-cyber methods, such as coercing bank authorities, or
      even through legal methods such as freezing accounts. 
             On the other hand, its not easy when the target
      knowns whats coming. According to MSNBC analyst Bill
      Arkin, the international community, including UNSCOM, is
      still trying to get its hands on Saddam Husseins assets. 
             And such real-world tactics are a far cry from the
      cyberwar image of a few CIA hackers sitting at a keyboard
      moving around money thanks to an Internet connection and
      some wits. Theres disagreement about how possible that
      might be.
             The audits we have performed tell us [banks] are not
      invulnerable, says a security expert identifying himself as
      Space Rogue. Rogue works at L0pht Heavy Industries,
      which hires out to hack corporate computer systems to test
      their vulnerability. Banks have a little more security in
      place, but that security is still not at a level where its
      unbreakable. While money systems arent connected to the
      public Internet, sometimes they have a modem dangling off
      for remote access, or they use cryptography, but not
      correctly, he said. 
             Others suggest cracking a bank that holds Milosevic
      money  outside the more traditional methods  is nearly
      impossible. 
      
          I deal in probabilities, and Ive never seen it, said a
      man identifying himself as Louis Cipher, a principal investor
      in Infowar.com. Cipher is also in charge of security at what
      he says is the sixth-largest brokerage in America. He
      suggested very few individuals have the skills necessary to
      tunnel from an Internet connection through mainframe
      systems in banks  in fact, a team of specialists and inside
      information would be required.
             Youd have to be an applications specialist to even
      navigate to a screen, he said. Youre talking well beyond
      the skills of hackers. It would have to be an insider working
      with Job Control Language sitting on the mainframe. The
      only one who would have that ability other than the U.S.
      government would be organized crime.
             And Cipher is skeptical about the U.S. governments
      ability to hire and hold the brightest minds in the security
      industry  since no government agency can match the lure
      of stock options offered by a high-tech firm.
             Still, even the possibility of the U.S. using a wired
      computer to move Milosevics money drew swift reaction
      from information warfare observers. Even hacker groups
      protested the notion, with a hacker calling himself sixtoed
      setting up a Web page in protest. The reason: Since the
      U.S. relies more on technology and information than any
      other nation, it stands to lose the most from such a
      cyberwar. 

             I am not one for an information arms race, said Frank
      Cilluffo, senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and
      International Studies in Washington. We will lose that
      race.... Were a hell of a lot more susceptible to retaliation.
      The defensive implications outweigh the offensive
      implications.
             Anyone can build up an information warfare capability,
      Cilluffo said. And its much more like guerrilla war than
      nuclear war  its easy for the enemy to hide, and theres
      no real deterrent. Therefore, retaliation could be swift and
      indiscriminate. 
             In addition, there is a general principle among security
      experts suggesting once a systems security is
      compromised, its much easier to compromise a second
      time. So the U.S. could very well be paving the way for
      retribution.
             
      WHY NO DENIALS?
             Fear of such retaliation attempts, or even the
      perception of such retaliation attempts, drove Daguio to
      start calling his friends on the intelligence community to
      complain as soon as the Newsweek story hit. He has yet to
      receive the reassurance he was hoping for. 
             If its true or its just leaks, its bad to have the story
      out there, Daguio said. I have yet to have anyone tell me
      Dont worry, everythings OK. ... If they havent done
      anything, the most appropriate thing to do is to come out
      and say theyre not doing it. 

                The CIA isnt doing that; a spokesperson told
      MSNBC the agency couldnt comment on its activities, but
      one source familiar with U.S. intelligence capabilities tells
      MSNBC to be very skeptical of the Newsweek story.
             Meanwhile, opening the Pandoras box of cyberwar
      would lead to a series of yet-to-be answered questions.
      International law isnt ready to handle such conflicts, says
      Cilluffo  so if the U.S. broke into a bank in Cyprus, what
      laws would govern that act? And could the compromised
      bank sue the U.S. government?
             What are the rules of engagement here? Cilluffo
      asked. What is game, what is not game? This may be a
      harbinger of how we prosecute and wage war in the future.

      RECENTLY, I met with Emmanuel Goldstein, publisher of the hacker
      zine 2600, at the New York City radio station WBAI. 2600, a slender
      volume containing articles about hacking, phone phreaking and tips
      for pirating videogames, has been around since 1984. Goldstein, a
      mainstay in the hacker world since he was a teenager, has hosted "Off
      the Hook," a weekly radio program, for more than ten years. 

      When I asked Goldstein, whose real name is Eric Corley, which
      name he preferred, his response was, "Call me whatever you want,
      but the reason I changed it is because I didn't like Eric Corley.
      The name Emmanuel Goldstein, which comes from a character in
      Orwell's 1984, suits me much better--and many more people know
      me as Emmanuel." 
 
      Goldstein, 39, long, scraggly hair streaked with gray
      poking out from under a 2600 baseball cap, was
      enmeshed in hacker culture long before there was an
      information superhighway. In 1983 he broke into
      computer systems at NASA, Coca-Cola, Raytheon
      and the Executive Office of the President of the United
      States. How was he able to get in? They were all
      using the same E-mail system, and Goldstein
      discovered that if he typed the letter "A," he could get
      the default password, which would allow him to gain
      access to the system. He then used these
      companies' mail systems to send E-mail to other
      hackers. 
 
      Initially, he was charged with a whopping ten counts of
      wire fraud, each with a possible sentence of five years.
      This was the first time, he says, he experienced the
      government hyping the threat of computer crime. 
 
      "I freely admitted what I did: It was an offense, but not
      a crime," Goldstein says. "I showed them what was
      wrong with their system: "'Don't use the letter 'A' for
      your default password,'" I told them. "They gave me
      probation for a year and I had to pay $200 for
      computer time. Then they let me go." 
 
      These days, Goldstein spends most of his time
      working on behalf of his friend, Kevin Mitnick, the
      hacker poster boy who has been in prison for more
      than four years for illegally copying and hoarding
      proprietary software. Goldstein helps run two web
      sites dedicated to the cause, and is in the process of
      filming a documentary about Mitnick. 
 
      "There is a lot of fear and paranoia about hackers, and
      it's not getting any better," he says. "The government
      needs a threat in order to justify its existence, and we
      are a convenient scapegoat, since most people really
      don't understand what we do. They claim that hackers
      do this and do that, they spread viruses and wreak
      havoc and destroy systems, and this is hard to
      dispel." 
 
      For instance, President Clinton, who has proposed
      earmarking some $1.5 billion to fight cyberterror
      threats, said in a January speech at the National
      Academy of Sciences: "We already are seeing the
      first wave of deliberate cyber attacks--hackers break
      into government and business computers, stealing and
      destroying information, raiding bank accounts, running
      up credit card charges, extorting money by threats to
      unleash powerful computer viruses." 
 
      It sounds like Clinton may have seen too many Keanu
      Reeve's flicks. Most companies that are hacked suffer
      web site graffiti. This means the victim company is
      forced to spend money to improve its security.
      Embarrassing? Certainly. A threat to business?
      Hardly, and why was the company's security so lax in
      the first place? 
 
      While it is true that the Pentagon is hacked nearly
      every hour, that doesn't mean these teenagers (and
      that's who most of the hackers who go after "big
      game" like American military sites are) actually come
      away with anything. And the part about hackers
      extorting money by threatening to release nasty
      computer viruses sounds like it could have written by
      Stephen Glass, the former associate editor of The
      New Republic, who was busted for fabricating stories. 
 
      Yet, each time the hacker menace is blown out of
      proportion means the cause of the problem is not
      addressed. Law enforcement can either go after the
      estimated one million hackers out there in
      cyberspace, most of them being "script kiddies"
      possessing basic skills at best, or it could insist that
      companies that release buggy software chock full of
      security holes take responsibility for the many holes in
      their products. 
 
      If you bought a car that could be hijacked with
      off-the-shelf keys made available over the Internet, you
      might be tempted to sue the automaker for not doing
      more to secure the vehicle. Yet, since software
      companies don't technically sell their products, they
      "lease" them, they are not liable. If they were, they
      wouldn't release products that could be so easily
      penetrated by hackers. 
 
      But companies like Microsoft have lobbyists. Hackers
      don't. So don't expect Congress to do much. 
 
      Goldstein and Mitnick, who to this day is listed as a
      staff writer on 2600's masthead, became friends in
      1989, after Kevin Mitnick's first go around in solitary
      confinement. (The court, without proof, was afraid that
      Mitnick could somehow whistle into a telephone and
      launch nuclear missiles.) While Mitnick, who says he
      was devastated by his eight months held in a cell no
      larger than a bathroom, went on the lam from the FBI
      in the early 1990s, afraid he would be put back in
      solitary, he called Goldstein almost everyday. 
 
      "The day Kevin was arrested, I'd just missed a phone
      call from him," Goldstein says. "I was sad he hadn't
      followed my advice to leave the country. I knew what
      they would do to him." 
 
      In the coming months, Takedown, a film based on the
      book by New York Times reporter John Markoff and
      Tsutomu Shimomura that details the capture of Kevin
      Mitnick, is scheduled to come out. Goldstein was able
      to gain an advance copy of the screenplay and
      complained bitterly over the evil way Mitnick was
      portrayed. After Goldstein led a protest outside of
      Miramax's corporate headquarters, the company made
      changes to the script. 
 
      "It's still crap," he says, "but its more well-rounded
      crap." 
 
      Does Goldstein, who freely admits his hacking skills
      are modest at best, have any pearls of wisdom to offer
      about hacking? 
 
      "The people I hang out with know far more about
      technology than I do. When dealing with hackers, he
      cautions, "always assume you're being lied to."

 10.0  DOD Unplugs From Net as Another Gov Site Gets Hit

       will be pulling its systems off the net to upgrade
       security and install a firewall. (About damn time.) The
       White House has also issued a stern warning to would

       quote from the Washington Post "Securing government
       Web sites against attack is difficult because the sites
       are designed for open access." What makes them any
       more difficult to secure or more open than a corporate

       The Posse would like to take this opportunity to personally thank the script kiddies
       who keep throwing themselves at the federal government like insects to a buglight.
       While you have been keeping the FBI (Federal Bureau Of Instigation) and SS (Secret Cervix)
       busy tracking down 14 year old hacker hopefuls; we have spent our time burrowing ourselves
       deep within Corporate America.

       Ecosystems do not grow without antagonists. The internet (like it or not) has become a
       virtual ecosystem that would wither and die were it not for the intervention of hackers.
       Corporate America has entered this ecosystem like a viral fungus, growing ugly clusters of
       .com decay, spreading misinformation like wildfire and causing the natural predators to be 
       removed from the ecosystem in which they provide a necessary function.

                                 Corporate America must be removed.
                                        It's us or them.

       Take a look at the concrete wastelands that Corporate America has built upon the earth
       outside your windows. Beneath that concrete there is soil wasted, soil that breeds life.

                      They are trying to do the same thing to the internet.

       Go outside and try to breathe for just a moment... That stale thickness in the air that 
       Threatens to choke you is the poison spewing from their smokestacks... Did you just cough?
       The phlegm in your throat are their poisons and do you charge them rent ? Did you charge 
       them storage fees for acting as a receptacle for their toxic waste?

          They are destroying the world we built to escape the one they have already destroyed!

       Corporate America will trade 10 years (minimum) of your life in exchange for another $10
       in profits. Their poisons, their stifling concrete morgues, their so called "progress"...

       They never knew the rules, they followed you here to stalk you... To bilk you for $10
       they came here because you did. Then when you got in the way of their "progress" they
       fabricated losses in order to gain FBI attention. They abuse the system and steal your
       freedoms. 


                           Do not blame the FBI, they are playing by the rules...
                           Do not blame the SS, they are playing by the rules...

     White House threatens to punish hackers 
     By Reuters
     Special to CNET News.com
     June 1, 1999, 3:35 p.m. PT 

     WASHINGTON--Annoyed by a recent wave of attacks against official U.S. government Web sites, the White House
     today warned hackers who target federal Web sites that they will be caught and punished.

     "There's a government-wide effort to make sure that our computer systems remain secure," White House Press Secretary Joe
     Lockhart said in a briefing. "For those who think that this is some sort of sport, I think [it will be] less fun when the authorities do
     catch up with them...and these people are prosecuted," he said.

     To protect against attacks that in recent days and weeks have disabled sites run by the Energy Department, the FBI, the Senate,
     the Interior Department, and the White House, the Defense Department said it planned to shut down its Web site for a short time
     today, said Ken Bacon, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.

     "This is much more protective than reactive," Bacon said. "It's looking to the future to prevent the types of problems that the other
     agencies" have experienced in recent weeks on their sites, he said.


     Attacking U.S. government Web sites is becoming an increasingly popular tool of people angry with the Clinton administration
     and its agencies.

     Last week hackers responded to a six-state FBI sweep of about 20 suspected hackers by attacking several government Internet
     locations, forcing the FBI, the Interior Department, and the U.S. Senate to temporarily shut down their Web sites.

     After NATO jets hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May, hackers from China attacked a handful of U.S. government sites,
     including one maintained by the Energy Department. In an unrelated incident, the official White House site was shut down briefly
     because of an attempt to tamper with it by unidentified hackers, officials said.

     In recent years the Justice Department's site was shut down once by hackers who put Nazi swastikas on its home page, and
     hackers forced the CIA to shut down its site after they changed the name from "Central Intelligence Agency" to "Central Stupidity
     Agency."

     With many U.S. government sites under attack, computer security experts are bracing for what could be a month full of additional
     Internet hacking incidents.

     Supporters of Kevin Mitnick, a hacker jailed in Los Angeles since February 1995, will demonstrate in 14 U.S. cities Friday,
     seeking his release to a halfway house and an easy probation when he is sentenced on June 14.

     Mitnick, 35, pleaded guilty on March 26 to seven counts of wire fraud, computer fraud, and illegal interception of a wire
     communication.

     Federal officials said he impersonated an employee of Finland-based Nokia Mobile Phones to steal software worth $240,000. He
     also stole software from Motorola, Novell, Fujitsu Network Transmission Systems, and Sun Microsystems, federal officials said.

     Supporters of Mitnick say the four years Mitnick has spent in jail awaiting trial is a harsher term than for many people convicted of
     violent crimes like robbery and assault. Their protest Friday will be seeking a more lenient sentence.

     The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California said Mitnick will be sentenced to 46 months in prison on June 14 as part of
     his plea bargain agreement with the government.

     Mitnick, whose exploits as a hacker inspired an upcoming Hollywood movie, also will be obliged to pay the victims of his crimes
     from any profits he makes from books or movies about his life, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said.

     While hacking incidents may not be part of Friday's nationwide protest, there may be a surge in attacks across the Internet if
     Mitnick's sentence is perceived as too stiff, said John Vranesevich, the founder and director of AntiOnline.

     "Hackers attack when they're mad about something. The demonstration Friday will be an attempt to educate," said Vranesevich.
     "However, if Kevin Mitnick is put in jail, there very well could be more attacks after that."

     Still, other experts said Internet sites should upgrade their security against possible attack before Friday.

     "Given the timing, it probably would be a good idea to be more on guard than usual," said Jevon Jaconi, the district attorney of
     Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, and an expert in the developing field of cyberspace law.

     Between 70 percent and 80 percent of all Internet hacking attacks come on systems that have not updated their security codes,
     routinely sent by computer manufacturers and network administrators, Jaconi said.

     The best way to prevent hacking attacks in the future is to heed those security warnings and implement the needed changes, he
     said.

     Online Security Is Pentagon's Latest Battle

     By John Schwartz
     Washington Post Staff Writer
     Wednesday, June 2, 1999; Page A2 

     The Department of Defense announced yesterday that it was briefly pulling
     its computers off the Internet to upgrade security by installing hardier
     "firewall" protection between computer systems that are accessible to the
     outside world and those that should not be.

     Noting the recent spate of hacker attacks on government Web sites,
     Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the upgrade is part of a
     long-term computer security effort: "This is much more protective than
     reactive."

     In fact, the Defense Department is engaged in long-term planning that
     could completely move its unclassified networks off the Internet and on to
     a proprietary system. The GNIE project (Global Network Information
     Enterprise, pronounced "genie") will unveil this major proposal this
     summer, said DOD spokeswoman Susan Hansen. "A lot of systems over
     the years have been patched together," she said, and "of course, you're
     only as strong as your weakest link."

     Skirmishes between federal law enforcement officials and computer
     intruders have been intensifying in recent weeks. Hackers angered by
     about 20 recent FBI raids on suspected members of the loose-knit
     computer underground have launched a variety of attacks on Web sites
     maintained by the FBI, the Senate, the Interior Department and the White
     House.

     "For those who do this for whatever kind of sport it provides them, they'll
     be found, and they'll be prosecuted," White House press secretary Joe
     Lockhart said yesterday.

     Securing government Web sites against attack is difficult because the sites
     are designed for open access; that's why security-conscious computer
     managers separate Web computer systems from those that contain critical
     internal information.

     In the case of the FBI computer intrusions, for example, "these are not the
     internal systems that contain classified or top-secret information," said
     Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman. "Those systems have
     not been at risk, and they have not been compromised." 

     Instead, she said, the attacked sites are "the FBI's vehicle for
     communicating with the public. . . . What they are really doing is denying
     access to the American public to the information available on that Web
     site."

     FBI agents across the country have been focusing on a gang that calls
     itself "Global Hell." The agents appear to be going after leading members
     of the group and some peripheral figures, hoping to find bigger players,
     said John Vranesevich, founder of antionline.com, a Web site that tracks
     hacker activity. 

     Vranesevich called the hacker response "a tantrum," saying that "many of
     them are now realizing for the first time that everything they've been doing
     for the past few months [has] been watched."

     Those targeted by the raids say that the agents are casting a very broad
     net. Paul Maidman, 18, was asleep when FBI agents entered his
     apartment. The New Jersey teen's mother had already left for work for
     the day when a half-dozen armed agents grabbed Maidman's computer
     and began hours of questioning.

     Noting that he has no relationship with Global Hell but that he has sat in on
     Internet chats where its members have congregated, Maidman said, "I'm
     not really counting on getting it [the computer] back any time soon." He
     added that he has shied away from computer mischief since he turned 18.

     Maidman said that while the experience with the government agents was
     intimidating, "they were actually really nice." When his 12-year-old sister
     woke up, "they made her waffles," he said.

     Experts in computer crime said the government reaction constitutes just
     the latest wave of law enforcement efforts to curtail computer mischief.

     "It's immensely foolish of the hacker underground to step up its assaults on
     law enforcement sites," said Michael Godwin, author of the book "Cyber
     Rights."

     "These two cultures regard each other with such deep antagonism and
     distrust that you might have to call in [veteran diplomat] Richard
     Holbrooke to sort it out," Godwin said.

      The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act is
      about to be approved. This draconian act will give
      vendors the right to repossess software by disabling it
      remotely (meaning you have to leave a port open on the
      firewall? Just imagine the DoS possibilities.); prevent the
      transfer of licenses from one party to another without
      vendor permission (Does this include my copy of
      LoadRunner for the Atari2600 that I sold for $5?);
      outlaw reverse engineering (Whoa, no more third party
      security analysis). This new law is being supported by
      such software giants as Microsoft, Adobe, and WinPro.
      The proposed legislation is set to go before the National
      Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in
      July. If this panel approves this measure it will then be
      sent to state legislations around the country. (Good
      way to bypass the feds.)

      Licensing time bomb

       Software-law dispute explodes as enactment draws near

       By Jessica Davis

       Imagine the horror of walking into work one day to find your software vendor holding your company hostage by threatening to shut down
       your mission-critical systems unless you concede to its terms.

       Sounds illegal, right? Perhaps not.

       Although many IT professionals are unaware of it, that practice will become legally defensible if new legislation called the Uniform Computer
       Information Transactions Act, or UCITA, is approved.

       UCITA is a proposed law for applying consistent rules to computer software licenses across
       all 50 states. It would

       * give vendors the right to repossess software by disabling it remotely;

       * make the terms of shrink-wrapped licenses more enforceable;

       * prevent the transfer of licenses from one party to another without vendor permission;

       * allow vendors to disclaim warrantees; and

       * outlaw reverse engineering.

       Proponents of the law, primarily software vendors, say it is time for a uniform law that applies
       directly to software licenses. Critics, including technology consumer groups such as the
       Society of Information Managers (SIM), say UCITA is fatally flawed and should be killed.
       Other trade organizations representing the motion picture industry, newspapers, magazines, and the music recording industry, have joined
       SIM in opposing UCITA.

       In July, a state attorney organization known as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) will meet in
       Denver to approve UCITA. If the organization gives the proposal a green light, a few state legislatures are likely to rubber-stamp it by the
       end of the year and UCITA will become law, according to UCITA experts.

       This fast time table has opponents up in arms. Although SIM is in favor of a law to govern software licensing, it says it believes UCITA
       cannot be fixed.

       "This law would significantly increase the level of the burden on the IT procurement function and significantly increase the cost of procurement
       -- both in staff costs and out-of-pocket costs," says Susan Nycum, a SIM member and an attorney at law firm Baker & McKenzie, in Palo
       Alto, Calif.

       Although many software vendor representatives attended development meetings to discuss the law and lobbied its creators, most attendees
       contacted by InfoWorld refused to discuss their views on the record.

       And although this law threatens to profoundly affect how IT departments in both large and small companies do business, most IT
       professionals remain unaware of the law and its ramifications.

       "We were naive about how things were handled," says Randy Roth, a SIM member who also works at the Principal Financial Group, in Des
       Moines, Iowa. "We thought, gee, when people are writing these laws they are making sure they are balanced and somebody is watching out
       for our best interests."


       Blackmail tool?

       To the IT managers who have been following UCITA, perhaps the most threatening provision is vendor "self-help," or vendor repossession
       of software.

       According to the most recent draft of the law, a vendor can remotely disable a customer's software if the vendor decides that the customer
       has violated its license and the license includes language that says self-help is a possibility. The proposed law would require the vendor to
       notify a company representative designated in the contract 15 days prior to taking such action, although it does not specify the means of
       notifying that representative. Such messages could spend weeks languishing in voice mail or e-mail if the wrong person happens to be on
       vacation.

       "Self-help is a draconian remedy in which the licensor would act as judge, jury, and executioner to electronically disable or repossess
       software when in its self determination, the licensee has done something bad," says Barney Kantar, a member of SIM who also works at
       Dupont, in Wilmington, Del.

       UCITA's champions counter that the software market would not tolerate vendors who shut off customers' software.

       "So far the market has been a very good disciplinarian," says Micalyn Harris, vice president, secretary, and general counsel at Winpro, in
       Ridgewood, N.J. "Anyone who gets a reputation for shutting off software on customers is not very likely to stay in business."

       But fear of getting a bad reputation has not stopped vendors from taking such draconian measures in the past. The most extreme case of a
       vendor repossessing software happened almost 10 years ago. Logisticon, a software vendor in Santa Clara, Calif., shut down Revlon
       Group's systems over the phone lines because it said Revlon had not paid the remaining $180,000 balance of a $1.2 million contract for
       warehouse management software. In a subsequent lawsuit, Revlon claimed its shipping operations were shut down for three days. The case
       was settled out of court in late 1990. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed not to divulge the terms.

       Because UCITA specifically authorizes electronic self-help, critics say that software developers would have legal justification to build back
       doors and software time bombs in their programs. That itself would create a tremendous threat and reduce users' negotiating power, whether
       the license specified the self-help rights or not.

       "The real danger of self-help is not so much that it will be invoked, but rather that it will be used as a threat hanging over licensees in order to
       extort compromises, concessions, and other payments that they would not otherwise agree to provide," Dupont's Kantar adds.

       Adobe Systems corporate counsel Vincent Bryan, however, argues that according to current law, a vendor could shut down a customer
       without any notice. The self-help provisions of UCITA, he says, are designed to protect the software customer.

       "What [the self-help provision] attempted to do was to reach a compromise between what SIM wanted -- which was that you had to go to
       court and trial before a small licensor could get paid," Bryan says.

       John McCabe, NCCUSL legal counsel and legislative director, calls UCITA's provisions on vendor self-help a middle position.

       "We are not banning this; we are not requiring judicial permission," McCabe says. "We are just putting parameters around it."

       McCabe added that vendors are not permitted to exercise self-help if the vendors are aware of third parties that could suffer serious losses
       because of it.

       Although Microsoft's UCITA representative, senior corporate attorney Robert W. Gomulkiewicz, requested that he not be quoted, a
       Microsoft public relations representative agreed that the law is designed to protect customers.

       But the law's detractors dispute that vendor self-help provisions protect consumers, and they find this to be the most threatening aspect of the
       proposed law.

       "Once we have licensed a product and put it into mission-critical use, self-help becomes a blackmail tool," Principal's Roth says. "Customers
       have no negotiating power at all."


       Pass-alongs prohibited

       Another UCITA provision could increase the costs of mergers and acquisitions by prohibiting the transfer of a software license from one
       company to another without permission from the vendor. Many shrink-wrapped licenses have blanket restrictions on transferability already,
       but vendors generally do not try to get a court to enforce them in a merger. UCITA would make those terms enforceable.

       For example, if you have Microsoft Word on your computer, you will need to obtain permission from Microsoft to transfer that copy of
       Word from Company A to Company B, according to Cem Kaner, a career software developer in Santa Clara, Calif., an attorney, and the
       author of Bad Software: What to do when software fails.

       "Imagine doing that for all the computer programs, utilities, drivers, printer drivers, clip art, fonts," Kaner says. "At some point the cost of
       having lawyers inspect every utility to figure out how to transfer it becomes too high. What will happen is people will simply erase the hard
       drives on the machines."

       Software vendors argue that they are within their rights to limit the use of their products.

       "Licenses tell users what it is that creators or providers of software regard as fair use," Winpro's Harris says.

       Those definitions of fair use included in licenses have become more aggressive as the years have gone by, according to SIM, and often
       include transfer restrictions.

       "If I buy a book, I can't make a copy and sell it. But I can sell my copy of the book or I can give away my copy," Dupont's Kantar says.
       "The same should be true for software."

       However, UCITA transforms software from a product into a license to use this product, according to attorney Kaner.

       "That flies in the face of how we have dealt with intellectual property in the past," Kaner says. "If you put something into the mass market,
       your rights as far as transferability end when the first buyer gives you the money."

       But some vendors believe that because software is fundamentally different from other products, it deserves new rules.

       "What UCITA is doing is validating the terms [of sale] after you pay," Adobe's Bryan says. "The academic community and consumer groups
       are saying that's not right -- the contract should be what the parties agree to at the time there is a transaction."

       Bryan notes that airline tickets and rental-car reservations' licensing terms are not revealed until after sales are completed.


       Not my fault

       Another hotly contested provision of UCITA is one that allows vendors to disclaim warrantees for defective, buggy, or virus-infested
       software.

       Today, any features that a vendor demonstrates at a trade show or writes about in a product manual must be a working part of the product,
       according to Kaner, because under current law, any statement or affirmation of fact by seller to buyer is part of the basis of the bargain.

       "UCITA takes the notion of a warrantee by demonstration and guts it," Kaner says. "And in the mass market, UCITA makes it trivially easy
       to disclaim warrantees."

       Although proponents claim that the provisions in UCITA are not a change from the current law, other industry observers view UCITA as a
       license for commercial developers to turn out buggier software.

       "It says manufacturers are not liable for the poor quality of their products," according to Watts Humphrey, a fellow of the Software
       Engineering Institute, a development institution with headquarters at Carnegie-Mellon University, in Pittsburgh. "I think that is bad for the
       nation."

       The licensing loopholes that UCITA provides will cause lowered standards for software performance and will cost user companies more
       money because they will have to assure that the product works properly before they buy it, according to Baker & McKenzie's Nycum.

       Software vendors counter that they need protection from customers in the fuzzy area of computer performance guarantees.

       "If I have to guarantee that my software will perform the way you think it's going to perform, that's going to be costly for me," Winpro's
       Harris says. "Software isn't like a piece of furniture -- there are many other variables."

       But critics do not believe software companies need more legal protection than they already have.

       "I have yet to hear a good argument as to why the software industry needs more than it has today," Dupont's Kantar says. "They are enjoying
       double-digit growth and huge success in the marketplace. Why does the software industry need protection?"

       Detractors also fear that UCITA will turn shrink-wrapped software licensing agreements -- which have become more and more restrictive
       over time -- into enforceable law.

       For example, many licensing agreements today state that customers who test the vendor's software are not allowed to publish the results of
       those tests, Kantar says.

       "We frequently see license agreements that attempt to restrict free speech in prohibitions against publishing test results," Kantar explains.
       "UCITA would permit a licensor to restrict such fair use under a contract."

       Many licensing agreements that come with shrink-wrapped software are "questionable at best," Principal's Roth says. "I would never put my
       name on a contract like that, so why should I be forced to accept it if I'm going to buy a lot of shrink-wrapped software?"


       Read the fine print

       SIM members also say they believe that the cost of procurement will rise if UCITA becomes law because companies will have to scrutinize
       shrink-wrapped software licenses as closely as those of mainframes and other large systems.

       "Large companies spend about as much on shrink-wrapped software as they do on non-shrink-wrapped software," Kantar says. "Today
       most businesses don't devote significant resources to the negotiation of shrink-wrapped licenses. They will now have to start doing so
       because the default rules are shifting in favor of the licensor."

       UCITA has other controversial provisions, leading the act's detractors to say it is too flawed to fix.

       "If you are going to come up with a law that will last another 50 years, it needs to be written to be flexible and fair, and not [as] a wish list of
       what vendors want right now," Baker & McKenzie's Nycum says.

       The origins of a law

       The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) began as a proposed change to the Uniform Commercial Code's Article 2,
       which dealt with the sale of goods.

       The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are laws designed to make commerce uniform from state to state. These laws are written by the
       National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), a group founded in the late 19th century during the states' rights
       movement and approved by the American Law Institute (ALI). The commissioners are attorneys, usually from small law firms, appointed and
       paid for by the states to represent them to the Conference.

       Once NCCUSL approves a bill, it is very likely to be passed by state governments.

       The ALI advises NCCUSL on creating amendments to the UCC. ALI is largely an honorary, academic organization of tenured law
       professors.

       ALI officials called NCCUSL's 2B draft "unbalanced" and declined to put it to a membership vote at their annual meeting earlier this month.
       NCCUSL decided then to make 2B a stand-alone bill, not part of the UCC. The proposed law then became known as UCITA. A current
       draft of UCITA was not available at press time.

 12.0 Japan Follows Australia in Limiting Privacy

      In an effort to to help law enforcement stop murders,
      drug trafficking, gun running, and illegal immigration,
      Japan is proposing new draconian legislation that will
      give sweeping power to eavesdrop on all
      communications. This includes telephone and email.

      Japan: More Crime, Less Privacy
      by David Lazarus 
      
      3:00 a.m.  2.Jun.99.PDT
      TOKYO -- Privacy issues have taken center stage as Japan prepares to enact legislation allowing the police to eavesdrop on phone calls, intercept
      fax and computer transmissions, and read email. 
      
      The draconian measures are ostensibly intended to help law enforcement halt premeditated murders, trafficking in drugs and guns, and smuggling of
      illegal aliens into Japan. 
      
      At least that's what a bill cobbled together by the country's coalition government says. 
      
           
      
      The reality could be far more intrusive, especially after investigators receive an official green light to comb through private correspondence and
      communications. 
      
      Japanese citizens' groups -- a hodgepodge of activists with little actual influence over policy decisions -- have decried the wiretapping legislation
      as a gross invasion of privacy, and opposition politicians boycotted a vote on the legislation last Friday. But the government insists that what Japan
      needs to restore public order is less civil liberty and more Big Brother. 
      
      People here are scared. Crime -- once unthinkable in Japan -- is on the rise. The country's yakuza racketeers are growing increasingly bolder in
      their schemes as nearly a full decade of recession eats away at traditional revenue sources, such as payoffs from companies and corrupt
      politicians. 
      
      For law-enforcement authorities, the trouble began back in 1995 when Aum Shinrikyo cultists released sarin gas in the Tokyo subway, killing a
      dozen people. The cops simply never saw the attack coming, and have been agitating for greater surveillance powers as a means of preventing
      such nastiness from happening again. 
      
      Wiretapping is a convenient shortcut for investigators. And, as the pervasive eavesdropping of former East Bloc countries made undeniably clear,
      once authorities start listening it's a hard habit to break. 
      
      Yozo Marutake, a former senior executive with a manufacturer of hearing aids called Rion, said last week that the Japanese police have been
      bugging phones for decades. How does he know this? Because his company sold the cops all their surveillance gear, and had done so since first
      being approached by authorities in 1957, he said. 
      
      So why would the Japanese police now be seeking legal backing for their electronic skulking? One reason might have to do with charges from an
      opposition politician last year that his phone had been bugged. The courts upheld the politician's claims, although the cops never actually admitted
      being behind the incident. 
      
      The Internet undoubtedly will be a low priority at first for Japan's snoops, but this will change as more people, criminals included, go online. For
      now, it looks like the cops are still unsure how to proceed where matters of cyberspace are concerned. 
      
      Police last week raided the Sapporo home of an 18-year-old who had posted a bunch of hit tunes on his home page using the MP3 compression
      format. The teen, needless to say, hadn't worked out copyright issues in advance with related Japanese recording companies. 
      
      Police didn't reveal how they learned about the song-laden site. But they said they moved quickly to shut things down after concluding that illegal
      actions were being perpetrated. 
      
      This only took them three months of monitoring downloads to figure out.

 13.0  AGNPAC Revealed

      ----------------
      What is AGNPAC?
      ----------------
      
      AGNPAC is the Alberta Government Packet Switched Network based on the X.25
      protocol. It is a Wide Area Network which spans across Alberta. It is used
      to connect systems and networks used by the Alberta Government, Alberta
      Registries, hospitals, schools, libraries, and other such entities.
      
      The backbone for this network is made up of full T1 fibre optic lines. Other
      WAN's and nodes are connected to the AGNPAC backbone via T1, 128K Frame Relay
      circuits (full CIR), and multiple 128K Frame Relay circuits. The network can
      also be connected to through local dialups in most cities and large towns in
      Alberta.
      
      AGNPAC is built, managed, and maintained by Alberta Public Works Supply and
      Service (PWSS) and funded by the Alberta provincial government. Recently
      publicly funded school board use has also come into play with beta trials
      becoming more widespread through the late nineties.
      
      The AGNPAC network has been in existance since at least 1995, however, no
      information regarding it has been publicly available... until now. There is
      still much to learn about this network, and this file, the most complete
      publicly available document on AGNPAC, is still somewhat lacking. However,
      this file will be updated as new discoveries are made.
      
      
      ---------------------
      Connecting to AGNPAC
      ---------------------
      
      Dial ports exist in most major towns and cities across Alberta. The standard
      communication parameter 8/N/1 is used although some systems on AGNPAC may use
      7/E/1. When you connect you will see a message similar to this:
      
         AGNPAC: 4007 030

      System Addressing
      ------------------
      
      Systems attached to AGNPAC are addessed most commonly by 9 digit Network User
      Addresses (NUA's). That's 1 billion possible NUA's. These NUA's follow a
      simple format of 9 consecutive digits (#########). Other NUA formats may
      exist but the only exception to the 9 digit NUA that I know of is something
      I call an "alias".
      
      Aliases are acronyms preceded by a dot. These aliases resolve to a regular
      NUA which is revealed when you connect to the host. Here are some examples of
      known aliases and their corresponding NUA's:
      
        .govtcpdial  =  4004 11188
        .cgsbbs      =  4004 059010  (oddly enough this resolves to a 10 digit NUA)
      
      Anyway, back to the NUA's. As far as I can tell the 9 digit NUA's have a 4
      digit prefix and a 5 digit suffix. Or possibly they break down like this:
      
                         (####)(###)(##)
                           :     :    :
              City Code? ..:     :    :
                                 :    :
         Address Prefix? ........:    :
                                      :
         System Address? .............:
      
      But that's just a hunch I've got based on the NUA's that I know of. I also
      have reason to believe there may be system subaddressing, or Logical Channels
      (LCN), in which case the address may be suffixed with 1 or 2 digits to
      connect to a subaddress of the system. And there may also be mnemonics, data
      characters which follow the address preceded by a comma. Mnemonics are used
      to connect to sub-systems of the host system. But again, this is all just
      speculation for now.
      
      
      ----------------------------
      Connecting to a Host System
      ----------------------------
      
      To connect to a system you enter it's NUA and if it is valid you will get a
      message like this:
      
         AGNPAC: call connected to #### #####
      
      Now you may receive an identifying message and the system's prompt depending
      on the system, or you may get a connect message and no prompt at all.
      Sometimes if you press <enter> it will forward you to the hosts prompt.
      
      To disconnect from a host that you have connected to and get back to the main
      prompt use the command "<ctrl>p clr".
      
      For a list of known NUA's refer to the "AGNPAC NUA Directory" (agnpacnua.txt)
      on www.hackcanada.com in the Canadian H/P-Hacking section.
      
      
      ---------------------
      Command Line Options
      ---------------------
      
      Some of these are used from the main prompt and some are used in conjunction
      with an NUA. Further experimentation is still forthcoming.
      
          Command   Use                           Description
          -------   ---------------------------   -------------------------------
          c                                       Closed User Group
          clr       Preceded by <ctrl>p           Used to clear a circuit locally
          f         [Restricted]                  Fast Select
          int       Preceded by <ctrl>p           ???
          l                                       Packet Size
          n         n ######### (where # is NUA)  Normal call (default)
          p         p ######### (where # is NUA)  Priority call
          par?                                    Displays parameters
          reset     Preceded by <ctrl>p           Resets locally
          set       <par>:<val> [,<par>:<val>]    Sets parameters
          stat                                    Displays statistics
      
      
      -------------------
      Scanning for NUA's
      -------------------
      
      The most important thing to know when scanning NUA's on AGNPAC is how to
      disconnect from an NUA that you have connected to and get back to the main
      prompt. This is done with the command "<ctrl>p clr". The second most
      important thing to know is that you will be disconnected from AGNPAC after
      ten failed attempts in a row. You will want to connect then disconnect from
      a known good NUA after every 8 or 9 failed attempts.
      
      
      ---------------
      Error Messages
      ---------------
      
      More often than not when scanning for NUA's you will get an error message
      rather than a call connected message. There are simply FAR more unassigned
      NUA's than there are NUA's in use. Here is a guide to error messages and
      their meanings.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - address not in service
      
         The most common message. It means the address is currently not assigned
         to a host system.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - access barred
      
         The calling terminal is not permitted to establish a connection to the
         host system. AGNPAC emits this error message on direction from the host.
         It is a system that only accepts calls from specified originating NUA's.
      
      AGNPAC: comma required before data characters
      
         This message is common when you mistype an NUA. This message may refer to
         the use of mnemonics to connect to sub-systems of the host as mentioned
         in the "System Addressing" section of this file.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - destination busy
      
         The host system may just be temporarily busy, permanently busy, or down.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - destination not responding
      
         The host is ignoring your connect request or it is down.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - remote directive
      
         This is likely a clearing of the virtual circuit in response to a clear
         request packet sent from the host system. The right subaddressing and/or
         mnemonics can probably get by this.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - local directive
      
         This message indicates that the user has used the command "<ctrl>p clr"
         to clear the virtual circuit in order to disconnect from an NUA.
      
      AGNPAC: call cleared - temporary network problem 
      
         The host system is either temporarily or permanently down.
      
      AGNPAC: invalid command
      
         Invalid command line option.
      
      AGNPAC: command not allowed 
      
         Command line option used improperly.
      
      AGNPAC: invalid packet size
      
         Command line option "l" was used in conjunction with an invalid packet
         size.
      
      AGNPAC: service option not subscribed
      
         Some NUA's result in this message. I don't know why.

       By Hans Lombardo
       Managing Editor, asia.internet.com 
                                                                                     International News Archives 
 
 
       [Hong Kong, CHINA] In a seething attack on the Cox Report, the Chinese government yesterday declared that performance data
       on US nuclear warheads was available on the Web and in printed publications. 
 
       Zhao Qizheng, the information minister for China's State Council, told reporters in press conference that "performance data on the
       seven types of nuclear warheads--W56, W62, W70, W76, W78, W87 and W88--have long been openly published in the United
       States." 
 
       "In recent years, performance data about various types of nuclear warheads, ranging from the early MK-1 to the latest W88, can
       easily be found on the Internet," stated Zhao. 
 
       The minister demonstrated how this nuclear warhead information was easily available on the website of the Federation of American
       Scientists (FAS). 
 
       The FAS website provides users with a "Complete List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons". 
 
       The Cox Report is the published findings of a US congressional probe lead by Republican Christopher Cox which alleges that China
       plundered nuclear weapons secrets from the United State over the last two decades. 
 
       The Beijing regime has condemned the report as a politically motivated attempt by forces in the United States to damage US-China
       relations and prevent China from developing into a economic power. 
 
       "the Chinese Government and people are strongly indignant over this groundless attack that fabricates facts and confuses black and
       white," Zhao also said about the report. 
 
       "This is a great slander against the Chinese nation and is typical racial prejudice," Zhao added. 
 
       The Chinese government has also criticized the Cox Report's suggestion it that the United States intensify control over the export of
       dual-purpose commodities and technology to China. 
 
       "It even unreasonably demands China should establish a so-called open and transparent system which enables American nationals
       designated by the United States to examine on the spot the end-users without advance notice," said Zhao. 
 
       "This is a hegemonic act that disregards China's sovereignty and violates the basic norms governing international relations." 
 
       Some local infopreneurs are concerned that a possible US backlash against the export of technologies to China will have an impact
       on China and Hong Kong's IT infrastructure development.

 16.0 Netscape Communicator 4.x "view-source:" JavaScript based security vulnerability
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From PacketStorm http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml
      
      Date: Tue, 1 Jun 1999 19:08:49 +0300
      From: Georgi Guninski <joro@NAT.BG>
      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: Netscape Communicator "view-source:" security vulnerabilities
      
      There is a security vulnerability in Netscape Communicator 4.6 Win95,
      4.07 Linux (probably all 4.x versions) in the way
      it works with "view-source:wysiwyg://1/javascript" URLs. It parses them
      in a "view-source" window.
      The problem is that it allows access to documents included in the parent
      document via
      ILAYER SRC="view-source:wysiwyg://1/" using find(). That allows reading
      the whole parsed document.
      
      Vulnerabilites:
      
       Browsing local directories
       Reading user's cache
       Reading parsed HTML files
       Reading Netscape's configuration ("about:config") including user's
      email address, mail servers and password.
       Probably others
      
      This vulnerability may be exploited by using HTML email message.
      
      Workaround: Disable JavaScript
      Netscape is notified about the problem.
      
      Demonstration is available at: http://www.nat.bg/~joro/viewsource.html

 17.0 Vulnerability in Broker FTP Server v. 3.0 Build 1

      Hi,
      
      I've found a vulnerability in Broker FTP Server v. 3.0 Build 1. Here's an
      example:
      
      You have it installed with FTP root in c:\FTProot and you have a user
      "test" with home directory in c:\FTProot\test. You also have checked the
      "Display as ROOT directory" checkbox for test, so he/she can't get below
      the home directory. CWD won't take him/here below it, but LIST will:
      
      LIST ..\..\winnt\
      
      will list the contents of c:\winnt and
      
      NLST ..\..\winnt\
      
      will also list the contents of c:\winnt. Of course this isn't as bad as if
      CWD or RETR had worked, but you probably don't want anybody to be able to
      look around in your private directories... I've contacted Transsoft about
      this, and they should have released a new version that fixed this more than
      a week ago. I've contacted them again but they haven't given me a reply
      this time.

      Version 2.0 is just as vulnerable.
      
      The commercial version (the one that runs on NT too :) is _not_ vulnerable
      since it does it's own socket thing instead of starting 'whois'.
      
      I've known of this bug in cdomain for about 6 months but never got around
      to writing up an advisory...

      To elaborate this a bit further: cdomain-free 2.4 and lower are
      _vulnerable_. cdomain-free 2.5 and all commercial cdomain versions I've
      seen are _not_ vulnerable, because they connect to the whois servers
      themselves.
      
      cdomain-free is available for download at www.cdomain.com.

 19.0 Linux kernel 2.2.x vulnerability/exploit

      I'm sorry if this has been noticed before, but since I did't find anything
      in the archives, I post it here.
      There seems to be a bug in kernels 2.2.x (tested on 2.2.7 and 2.2.9), that
      causes them to panic when they are sent a large number of specific ICMP
      packages. I think the problem comes from the combination of the mangled
      header length (shorter or longer ihl's don't cause hangup) and the random
      ICMP packets (random type/subtype and source address) this program sends.
      Windows 9x and FreeBSD 3.0 seem to be unaffected.

      Ok problem confirmed. Its not icmp however - in fact the program given
      has some bugs that cause it. If it had been a correctly written icmp tester
      it wouldnt have worked. A blessing in disguise.
      
      Anyway the fix seems to be this. Sorry it took so long to sort out.

      Subject: New Allaire Security Bulletin (ASB99-09)
      
      Dear Allaire Customer --
      
      We have recently become aware of a serious security vulnerability that may affect
      customers using Microsoft Access with ColdFusion. This issue is not a problem with
      ColdFusion, but can occur when using some versions of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver.
      
      We have created a new Allaire Security Bulletin that documents this issue and the steps
      that customers can take to protect themselves. If you are using Microsoft Access with
      your Web applications we strongly recommend that you review this new bulletin:
      
              ASB99-09: Solutions to Issues that Allow Users to Execute Commands through
              Microsoft Access
      
      You can find this new bulletin and information about other security issues in the
      Allaire Security Zone:
      
              http://www.allaire.com/security
      
      As a Web application platform vendor, one of our highest concerns is the security
      of the systems our customers deploy. We understand how important security is to
      our customers, and we're committed to providing the technology and information customers
      need to build secure Web applications. Allaire has set up an email address that customers
      can use to report security issues associated with an Allaire product: secure@allaire.com.
      
      Thank you for your time and consideration on this issue.

      Allaire Security Bulletin (ASB99-09)
      
      Solutions to Issues that Allow Users to Execute Commands through Microsoft Access 
      
      Originally Posted: June 1, 1999

      Summary 
      Some Microsoft ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access may allow users to execute Visual Basic
      for Applications (VBA) commands on the hosted server without permission. URL, form and
      cookie variables in a dynamic query in many development environments (e.g. ColdFusion, ASP,
      CGI, etc.) can be used to exploit this hole appending malicious VBA statements to existing
      queries. This problem can be easily fixed by upgrading to the Microsoft ODBC driver for Access
      included in MDAC 2.1 sp1a, available from Microsoft. In general, Allaire recommends that
      customers use proper coding methods for validating dynamic query variables passed on URL
      strings, http forms or cookies. This is not a security issue with ColdFusion itself. However,
      ColdFusion customers using Access are vulnerable to this issue. (This issue is similar to the
      vulnerabilities documented in ASB99-04, which are associated with appending malicious SQL
      statements to query strings sent to some enterprise databases.) 
      
      Issue 
      In a Web application there are often circumstances where queries are built dynamically using
      variables that are passed on URLs or in forms. Some versions of the Microsoft Access ODBC
      driver support the ability to append VBA commands to a SQL string. As a result, a malicious
      attack could be made by using URL, form or cookie variables to send VBA commands through a
      query. These VBA commands could potentially be used to damage the server or to gain
      unauthorized access to information and systems. (The potential for a similar problem using SQL
      statements and some enterprise database was documented in ASB99-04). 
      
      Some versions of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver allow for appending VBA commands to a
      SQL string. The VBA commands are appended by using the pipe character, or Chr(124), which
      is treated as a reserved character by the Access ODBC driver. See the following MS
      Knowledge Base article for details: 
      http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q147/6/87.asp 
      
      This reserved character allows users to modify a URL, form or cookie variable to execute VBA
      commands against the Web server using the ODBC driver. The following string is an example
      of one that can be used to initiate an attack by writing a file to the web servers hard drive: 
      
              '|shell("cmd /c 1 > c:\temp\foo.txt")|'
      
      This string could be passed to an application using a URL variable, so the page could be called
      as follows: 
      
              http://myserver/page.cfm?x='|shell("cmd /c 1 > c:\temp\foo.txt")|'
      
      This code, when executed as part of the following dynamically created query, will cause a file to
      be created at the location c:\temp\foo.txt. 
      
              <CFQUERY name="getUsers2" DATASOURCE="test1">
                      SELECT  * 
                      FROM    USERS
                      WHERE   lname = '#URL.X#'
              </CFQUERY>
      
      This code could also be vulnerable when processing form input from a template using a form
      variable called 'X'. Please note that you should always validate user-initiated input, including
      URL, form, and cookie variables. 
      
      Affected Software Versions 
      
             ColdFusion Server (all versions and editions) running with Microsoft Access through
             ODBC 
      
      What Allaire is Doing 
      This issue is not a problem with ColdFusion, but can occur when using Microsoft Access and
      some versions for the Access ODBC driver. It is not a problem with ColdFusion, but it can
      affect ColdFusion applications that use Access. To respond to this issue, Allaire has published
      an Allaire Security Bulletin (ASB99-09) notifying customers of the problem and remedies that
      can be used to address it. We have sent a notification of the bulletin to customers who have
      subscribed to Allaire Security Notifications. 
      
      What Customers Should Do 
      This issue appears to be fixed by the installation of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver included
      with MDAC 2.1 sp1a. We strongly recommend that customers install this ODBC driver. It
      should not adversely affect the functionality of ColdFusion applications using Access. This
      MDAC can be downloaded from the Microsoft site: 
      
      http://download.microsoft.com/msdownload/mdac/sp1a/x86/en/mdac_typ.exe 
      
      In addition, Allaire recommends that customers write their code to validate variables that are
      passed into SQL statements, configure their database security properly, and use standard
      database application development practices such as stored procedures where appropriate to
      protect themselves. These are general requirements of production applications regardless of the
      development platform. 
      
      There are many ways to address the issues raised by the risk of malicious SQL statements being
      inserted into dynamic queries. The Allaire Technical Brief  Securing Databases for ColdFusion
      Applications, details some of the steps you can take to secure your databases. 
      
      It is important to note that each individual application may require its own particular steps in
      both coding and database configuration in order to be fully secured. Some of the techniques
      for securing database applications built with ColdFusion are detailed in the Allaire Technical Brief
      - Securing Databases for ColdFusion Applications.

 22.0 ActiveState Security Advisory
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      From PacketStorm http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/new.shtml     
 
      Date: Mon, 31 May 1999 07:16:53 -0700
      From: Michael Smith <support@ACTIVESTATE.COM>
      To: NTBUGTRAQ@LISTSERV.NTBUGTRAQ.COM
      Subject: ActiveState Security Advisory
      
      Problem
      --------
      
      PerlScript and Perl-ISAPI that come with ActivePerl 516 and earlier
      versions, inadequately check the length of path information sent to open().
       Due to limits on path and filename length in Windows, this can crash IIS
      if sufficiently large strings are provided as paths or filenames.
      
      
      
      Solution
      ---------
      
      This is fixed in ActivePerl 517
      
      
      
      Work Around
      ------------
      
      If you are unable to upgrade to ActivePerl 517 then all path information
      should be checked for sane lengths before being passed to open(). The
      maximum length of a path, including drive, directory and filename is 259
      characters.  The maximum length of the filename portion of a path is 255
      characters. The maximum length of the directory portion of a path is 255
      characters.
      
      example:
      
      $filename = substr $filename, 0, 255;
      open FOO, ">$filename";
      
      
      
      General Comments
      -----------------
      
      Care should be taken when accepting input from users, especially in a web
      context where users are untrusted and relatively anonymous.  When designing
      CGI scripts some thought should be given to checking user input for sane
      values.  Use of taint mode and warnings (-t and -w) are also highly
      recommended.

      Hi everyone!
      
      
      I have found a bug which will freeze Internet Explorer 5.0
      I know that there are *many* bugs that will crasch browsers
      but what makes this one special is the following:
      
      In IE 5.0 Microsoft has fixed the bugs from IE 4.0 that
      was based on infinit loops in JavaScript. If a JavaScript
      contains a loop which will cause IE 5.0 to run slowly
      or be unresponsive, the user will be warned and he/she will
      be prompted whether the JavaScript should be aborted or
      not. This exploit is a JavaScript which changes the bgColor in
      an infinit loop and when you open it you wont get a warning.
      The browser will just freeze!

 24.0 IRIX 6.5 nsd virtual filesystem vulnerability
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To: BUGTRAQ@netspace.org
      Subject: IRIX 6.5 nsd virtual filesystem vulnerability
      
      I've been waiting since February for SGI to post an advisory about this.
      Enough.
      
      /******************************************************************************
      
      IRIX 6.5 nsd virtual filesystem exploit
      
      Author: Jefferson Ogata (JO317) <ogata@pobox.com>
      
      Please note that this program comes with NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. Your use
      of this program constitutes your complete acceptance of all liability for
      any damage or loss caused by the aforesaid use. It is provided to the
      network community solely to document the existence of a vulnerability
      in the security implementations of certain versions of IRIX, and may not
      be used for any illicit purpose. Many of the details of the bug this
      program exploits have been available to users of SGI's online support
      system since February 1999. The current revision of IRIX (6.5.3) corrects
      this bug, at least enough to stop this particular exploit, and I strongly
      encourage you to bring your systems up to date as quickly as possible.
      
      With IRIX 6.5, SGI has moved all name services, NIS services, and DNS
      lookups into a userland process called nsd, which exports the results of
      the queries it fields into a virtual filesystem. The virtual filesystem is
      normally mounted onto the directory /ns by the program /sbin/nsmount, which
      is invoked by nsd on startup. The nsd daemon itself is exporting the
      filesystem via NFS3 over a dynamically bound UDP port -- rather than a
      well-known or settable one -- typically in the 1024-1029 range. On a
      desktop system, 1024 is a good bet, since nsd is usually the first
      RPC/UDP service to be started.
      
      The NFS filesystem is not registered with mountd, so there is no way to
      query mountd for a mount filehandle. But because the NFS port is fairly
      easy to discover through port scanning, and because the mount filehandle
      nsd uses is simply a string of 32 zeroes, it is trivial to mount the nsd
      filesystem from a host anywhere on the Internet. nsd will serve an array
      of NFS requests to anyone. Furthermore, because the service's NFS port is
      bound dynamically, it is difficult to protect it with a firewall; it may
      change from one system start to another, or if the daemon is killed and
      restarted.
      
      This program can successfully mount the nsd-exported virtual filesystem
      >from a remote host onto a machine running IRIX 6.4 or higher. It makes use
      of the MS_DOXATTR mount flag defined in IRIX 6.4 and higher. I do not know
      what this flag does at the NFS protocol level, but it allows the client to
      ask the NFS server not to enforce certain permissions controls against the
      client. I don't know whether any other vendor NFS client systems support
      this flag. A clever person might write a userland NFS client that would
      accept an initial handle, NFS port, etc. as arguments.
      
      On an SGI with SGI C compiler, compile with:
      
          cc -o nsdadv nsdadv.c
      
      Run it this way:
      
          nsdadv /mnt sucker.example.com 1024
      
      with obvious substitutions.
      
      So what are the security implications of this? Well, at the very least, the
      nsd filesystem on an NIS server reveals the NIS domain name, and what maps
      it contains, as well as what classes are being used.
      
      By exploring the filesystem shortly after it has been mounted I have been
      able to retrieve data that should be hidden from me, including shadow
      password entries from a remote system's shadow file.
      
      Beyond retrieving keys and maps, you can also monitor the filesystem for
      changes. A great deal of information is leaked through the contents of the
      nsd filesystem. For example, if host A looks up a host B's IP address, a
      file named B will appear in the /.local/hosts.byname directory in A's nsd
      filesystem. The file's contents will be the IP address.
      
      By the way, though you be unable to chdir into a particular location in
      the nsd filesystem, you may yet succeed under slightly different
      conditions. Eventually you can do it. I'm not sure why or when, but nsd
      gets picky sometimes. Eventually it relents. Specifically, I've found that
      the entire nsd filesystem appears readable for a few seconds after it is
      initially mounted. If you can't look at something, unmount the filesystem,
      remount it, and try again immediately. It also seems that a stat() is
      sometimes required before a chdir(). Your mileage may vary, but keep
      trying. You may wish to write a script to mount the nsd filesystem, explore
      and take inventory of its contents, and unmount the filesystem quickly.
      
      Once you've chdir'd into a directory, it appears you can always read it,
      although you can't necessarily stat its contents. This suggests a strategy
      of spawning a group of processes each with its cwd set to a subdirectory of
      the nsd filesystem, in order to retain visibility on the entire filesystem.
      Each process would generate an inventory of its cwd, and then monitor it
      for changes. A Perl script could do this well.
      
      Another thing: it is possible to create an empty file in nsd's exported
      filesystem simply by stat()ing a nonexistent filename. This suggests a
      potential DoS by creating many files in a directory.
      
      Remember that the system keeps a local cache in /var/ns, so you may have
      to wait for cached entries on the target host to expire before you'll see
      them reappear in the virtual filesystem.
      
      For some fairly extensive info on the nsd implementation, take a look at:
      
          http://www.bitmover.com/lm/lamed_arch.html
      
      ******
      
      What got me into all this was that I found I could no longer run services
      chrooted if they required DNS. It took considerable effort to come up with
      a solution to this. This was a fundamental change from IRIX 6.4, and I know
      I'm not the only one who finds the nsd implementation to be a generally
      unpleasant direction, in part because it causes umount -t nfs to break
      system database services. I give SGI points for creativity -- in one sense,
      using NFS as a database access system is a very slick approach. But the
      database needs a security model, and the model needs to be implemented
      correctly. Neither of these needs appears to have been met.
      
      So how could SGI fix this?
      
      Without going back, SGI could at least make nsd respond only to queries
      >from localhost (see note below about IRIX 6.5.3). The problem here is that
      they actually intend to support remote mounts in later releases, in order
      to supplement or supplant other means of distribution. The web documents
      indicate this.
      
      They could create a well-randomized mount filehandle for the filesystem
      and pass that to nsmount. Then you couldn't remotely mount the filesystem
      without guessing the handle -- nontrivial with a 32-byte handle.
      
      At the very least, they should provide libraries of regular BIND resolver
      routines, file-based getpwent, etc. routines, so one could choose the
      resolution strategy at link time, perhaps by modifying the shared library
      path.
      
      ******
      
      With IRIX release 6.5.3, SGI appears to have fixed this problem, at least
      to some degree. The exploit does not appear to work as it does against
      6.5.2. Further testing is needed, and the behavior should be watched
      carefully in future versions of IRIX.

 25.0 a practical attack against ZKS Freedom
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Date: Sat, 29 May 1999 15:30:24 -0700
      From: Wei Dai <weidai@eskimo.com>
      To: cypherpunks@toad.com, coderpunks@toad.com
      Subject: a practical attack against ZKS Freedom
      
      Although the ZKS Freedom AIP protocol (as described in version 1.0 of the
      ZKS whitepaper) is conceptually similar to the PipeNet protocol, there are
      several attacks against ZKS which PipeNet is not susceptible to. The
      reason is that PipeNet uses end-to-end traffic padding, whereas ZKS only
      uses link padding. I came up with several attacks against link padding
      systems while developing PipeNet, which is why I ultimately choose
      end-to-end padding. However one can argue that end-to-end padding is too
      costly, and that these attacks are not practical because they require a
      global observer or the cooperation of one or more of the anonymous router
      (AIP) operators. ZKS has not publicly made this argument, but since they
      are probably aware of these earlier attacks they must have followed its
      reasoning.
      
      I hope the practicality of the new attack presented here will change their
      mind. In this attack, a user creates an anonymous route from himself
      through a pair of AIPs back to himself. He then increases the traffic
      through this route until total traffic between the pair of AIPs reach the
      bandwidth limit set by the ZKS Traffic Shaper. At this point the AIPs no
      longer send any padding packets to each other, and the real traffic
      throughput between them can be deduced by subtracting the traffic sent by
      the attacker from the bandwidth limit. 
      
      This attack implies that link padding buys virtually no security. An
      attacker, without access to network sniffers or cooperation of any AIP
      operator, can strip off link padding and obtain real-time throughput data
      between all pairs of AIPs. If end-to-end padding is not used, this data
      would correlate with traffic throughput of individual users, and
      statistical analysis could then reveal their supposedly anonymous routes.

 26.0 DoS against PC Anywhere

      Subject: DoS against PC Anywhere
      
      
      Hello all,
      This is my first post to the group so I'll try to keep it as brief as
      possible.  Searching through the bugtraq archives, I came across articles
      001732, 001734, 001737, and 001739 regarding PC Anywhere.  So, I fired up my
      telnet client, pointed it at port 5631 on a non-production host, and pasted
      about 512kb of garbage (I copied & pasted a dll I opened in notepad) into it
      when PC Anywhere responded with "Please press <Enter>".  About 200k through
      this dump, PC Anywhere hangs, utilizing 100% of the CPU, rendering the
      target host useless but not crashing it. There's your DoS.
      
      I ran this attack over TCP/IP against a couple of fully patched NT 4.0
      Workstations (SP4), and a couple of fully patched NT 4.0 Servers (SP4), with
      802up_a, 802up_b, and hostup_b applied to PC Anywhere, RAS was not installed
      on any of the hosts. I got the same results on all machines.
      
      I got in touch with Symantec development and found out that they do have a
      fix for this problem, it's a patched aw32tcp.dll, it just hasn't made it to
      their website yet.  I have applied this fix to several machines (all with
      the afore mentioned PC Anywhere patches applied) and it does indeed fix the
      problem.
      
      Hope this info will help.  Thanks for your time.

      Subject: Re: DoS against PC Anywhere
      
      Hello TRAQers,
      
      this is my second list-posting attempt, so please bear with me. Flames will be sent to /dev/nul anyways ;)
      
      Concerning PC Anywhere 32 v8.0x, I tried the following attacks:
      
      NT 4.0 Workstation (SP4) vs. NT 4.0 Workstation (SP4)
      and
      Win 98 (no patches, from what I was told) vs same NT 4.0 Workstation (SP4)
      
      All NT 4.0 running PC Anywhere 32 8.0 patched with formerly mentioned Updates except the aw32tcp.dll, which wasn't available to
      me. Major difference between Chris' and this version: I tested against the German version of PC Anywhere 32. RAS installed, no
      fancy firewalls, no 'special' security implemented.
      
      Not surprisingly the German Version of PC Anywhere didn't react much different. It hung when I posted those ~500KB of trash from
      the NT 4.0 attacker machine to Port 5631 of the PC Anywhere Host. Result: 100% CPU load, further connections blocked though the
      Host machine itsself still worked fine and was able to terminate the aw32host service by simply re-starting the Host mode in PC
      Anywhere.
      
      The more interesting one was the Win98 attack. Same procedure, different result. After pasting those 500KB the Server jumps to
      100% load for some seconds while working through the trash then it drops back to normal with the attacker's Telnet session again
      prompting for pressing the 'Enter' key. To make it short, a permanent DoS failed with a Win98 attacker's machine though
      generating quite some load to the host's 486 CPU ;-) Pheww...because this keeps us safe from about 99% of all attacks ;)
      Further difference: After pressing 'Enter' (unlike in the NT4.0 attack, where you loose connection) you are prompted for a
      Username and password.... Could this be due to different possible Host Type options in Telnet (VT 52 on the Win98 vs. VT 100 on
      NT 4.0)? In this case, could this also be the reason for the different reaction to the attack? Comments?
      
      In case this one gets through, thank you for your time.
      
      Jay.
      
      P.S.: Does anyone know about the release date of the German NT 4.0 Service Pack 5? I couldn't get information on that via the
      German or U.S. Web-Site.

      Hi,
      
      I managed to replicate this and checked Symantec's FTP site. There is a new
      aw32tcp.dll there dated May 26, 1999. I got it and patched one of my
      machines and it seems to work, although the description of the file on
      ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/products/pcanywhere/pcanywhere32/v
      er8.0/updates does not mention a denial of service.

      keywords: some dns packet decoders (sniffers, ids systems (?), dns
                servers) may be vulnerable to malformed compressed domain names
                inside dns packets. 
      
      
      hi,
      
      as I played with the DNS RFC (1035 especially) i came up with the idea to
      create malformed compressed dns domains inside the DNS packet to make it
      impossible for the DNS packet decoder to decompress it, which might lead
      to a denial of service attack.
      
      On my tests I found my BIND servers resisting all attacks (three different
      types), but all sniffers I used to view the DNS packets send to the
      server behaved in a very "special" way.
      
      
      First test (pointing-to-itself-compression (zlip-1.c))
      
      The DNS domain consists out of multiple labels, and message "compression"
      allows you to let a pointer point to a previous label inside the packet,
      to save bytes in the DNS packet. I just created a pointer that points to
      itself, meaning on a recursive domain decompression (like etherreal uses),
      this will produce effects like segfaulting or hanging.
      Etherreal alloc's memory until the system crashes, tcpdump stopped working
      before the packet is received, on SIGINT, it displays the malformed
      packet, but dropped all other packets:
      
      14:57:59.025013 128.75.9.2.48078 > victim.ns.org.domain: 30993 Type49159
      (Class 49168)?
      
      
      Second test (crossreferencing pointers (zlip-2.c))
      
      Similar to the first code, but now two pointer are used to reference each
      other, speeding up the effect on Etherreal.
      Results are the same as in the first test.
      
      
      Third test (very long label, decompressed multiple times (zlip-3.c))
      
      This time I used a long label (maximum of 63 characters), and referenced
      to it a dozend times, this will decode to a very long domain, therefore
      it may overflow some fixed-sized-buffers (because the rfc says "limited to
      500 characters" some programmers may prefer fixed buffers for dns
      decoders). This is the case in Etherreal, where such a request creates a
      segmentation fault (due to a buffer overrun).
      
      
      I just tested this with BIND as nameserver, which resisted all this tests,
      but I included the "exploit" code in this email to allow you to test your
      IDS, sniffers and nameservers against this.

      Another thing to remember is that it is possible to put ABSOLUTELY
      ANYTHING inside a DNS domain name. This includes whitespace, control
      characters, and even NULL.
      
      Imagine what could happen if some program did a strcmp() on the following
      name:
      
      rs.internic.net\0.xa.net
      
      where, of course, \0 is a null
      
      Interested readers may ponder what type of programs may be exploited with
      this type of attack.

 28.0 Microsoft Worker Raided

      VallaH, one of the victims of the recent FBI raids, was a
      contractor for Microsoft working on Windows 2000
      interoperability. Although he was not arrested and
      charges have not been filed against him he still lost his
      job. This of course raises the question of who is working
      where? Do employers really know the backgrounds of
      their employees? Is there anyway to tell?

      Perils of moonlighting as a hacker
                 
      Microsoft employee was raided by FBI last week; are hackers working
      all over the software industry?
                                  

                                 
                                                              By Bob Sullivan
                                                                      MSNBC

      June 2   Everybody does it; nobody wants to talk about it. Computer hackers  white hat or
      black hat  are among the brightest minds in the software industry, so many are hired by
      big-name software companies. Then they dance the awkward dance of dual identities, engineer
      by day, hacker by night. The consequences of a misstep in that dance can be severe, as a hacker
      calling himself VallaH learned last week. In his case, a visit from the FBI meant the end of
      his career at Microsoft, embarassment for the largest software company in the world, and a
      new focus on the role of hackers at work.
      
      JEFFREY ROBERSON, 19, was a self-described
      
      angry little kid two years ago, fairly well-known as VallaH
      on the hacking scene, dabbling in writing hacker software
      tools. At his worst, he says, he participated in relatively
      benign denial-of-service attacks  coordinated efforts to
      try to overwhelm a Web site with hits so it becomes
      unavailable. Then a Microsoft employee saw his
      programming code, was duly impressed and invited VallaH
      to Redmond, Wash. Over time, Roberson was convinced to
      put his skills to good use and took the job. Hes spent the
      past year working on Windows 2000, testing for
      interoperability with Unix systems  his specialty.
             (Note: Microsoft is a partner in MSNBC.) 


             But he also stayed involved in the hacker scene. He
      says he hadnt done anything illegal since taking his job at
      Microsoft; in fact he says he spent his time trying to
      convince other angry little kids that they could be creative
      instead of destructive. I talked to them because I wanted to
      try to help them program.
             But someone passed his handle to the FBI recently.
      Then his Seattle-area apartment was raided May 26 in the
      hacker sweep, and VallaHs life instantly changed. He was
      immediately fired by Microsoft and went back home to his
      parents in the Baltimore area.
             
      IM ASHAMED THEYRE INVOLVED 
      
      Some people
      who had
      absolutely nothing
      to with with
      hacking at all
      [were raided].
      People with
      things going for
      them, innocent
      people, who are
      going to face
      consequences. 
       JEFFREY ROBERSON
      
      
             Its Microsoft policy; I understand where theyre
      coming from, Roberson said of his dismissal. He was
      actually a contractor at Microsoft, working through the Volt
      Computer agency. Im more of a liability than an asset.... I
      owe a great debt to Microsoft, and Im really ashamed that
      theyre involved.
             Are other hackers working at Microsoft? Does the
      company recruit in the underbelly of the Internet, places like
      Internet Relay Chat rooms set up for hackers? The
      company wouldnt say.
             We dont recruit people who are involved in illegal
      activities, spokesman Adam Sohn said. But did one
      computer scientist see [VallaHs code] and thought, gee,
      this is ... great work, we should get this person? Surely that
      may happen.
             Other software firms wouldnt discuss company
      policies about hiring hackers when contacted for this article
       but hackers say the practice is common and
      complicated.
             
      ITS ONLY NATURAL
             It is only natural to assume that someone who defaces
      Web pages at night also works for a computer-related
      company, said a man calling himself Space Rogue. Rogue
      works for L0pht Heavy Industries, a company of
      professional hackers that is hired by firms to test
      corporate system security. 
             Last place I worked I tried to keep my involvement
      with L0pht and stuff quiet. Then word got around, as it
      always does. Then I get treated like royalty, and people tell
      me all the dirty deeds they have done to the company
      systems. Back doors, reading the bosss e-mail, all kinds of
      s***. I just shake my head and wonder.
             The issue is most employers have no idea what the
      background is of their employees. I mean, its not like
      youre going to put defaced 150 Web sites on your
      resume. And unless you have been arrested, no background
      check is going to turn anything up.
             
      FIND A HOLE, GET A JOB
             On the other hand, exposing security holes in front of
      the world is even better than a resume, said Russ Cooper,
      who moderates the most popular information service
      covering Windows NT security. His NTBugTraq mailing list
      has 25,000 subscribers, and his Web site gets 2 million hits
      a month. 
      
      The issue is most
      employers have no
      idea what the
      background is of
      their employees. I
      mean, its not like

      your resume.

      L0phy Heavy Industries 
      
             A lot of people release exploit information to get
      jobs, Cooper says. Posting an exploit, or a security hole, to
      his list is one sure way to get the attention of software firms.
      Certainly I know of people who have posted and gotten
      job offers. Companies are interested in people who have
      demonstrated an aptitude for discovering problems. Finding
      people with skills is hard.
             But is it worth the risk? No, says Christopher Klaus,
      who founded Internet Security Systems Inc. The company
      writes software designed to automatically test for exploitable
      security holes, so-called scanning software. For ISS
      software to work, his programs must imitate the thought
      process of hackers  still Klaus says he ignores the
      resumes he gets from hackers.
             We find we have more success finding people with a
      networking background, people who know Unix and can
      program in C++, then train them in security. That works
      better than the other way around, he said.
             
      HAVING A HACKER ON STAFF 
      
      Whats more fun
      than a buddys
      reaction when the
      CD-drive door is
      opened
      mysteriously. :)  
       CARL-FREDRIK NEIKTER
      
             Having a hacker on staff is complicated because of the
      vague distinctions often made between white hat, black
      hat, hackers and crackers. Anyone involved in computer
      security might be called a hacker (in fact, many say anyone
      involved in any kind of progamming is a hacker). Computer
      security administrators consider hacker mailing lists, Web
      pages and even chat rooms as part of their daily reading
      material, a requirement for keeping their systems secure
      against the latest exploits. 
             And theres all manner of playful hacking that goes on
      inside a company. One Microsoft employee told MSNBC
      that groups within the company sometimes hack each
      others Web pages, a harmless form of taunting. 
             But when does that kind of playfulness cross the line,
      become harmful? Many hackers dont believe temporarily
      defacing a Web page is destructive, though it is illegal. But
      what of the authoring of hacker tools, which are not
      illegal? For example, there are software packages used to
      scan Web sites for vulnerabilities; they are equally useful to
      security administrators testing their own systems and
      hackers looking for open doors. Other software simply
      makes it easy for someone whos less skilled to hack into
      Web sites. Thats what Roberson was writing when
      Micosoft contacted him  he was one of many coders
      who write and distribute software that can be used to crack
      Web sites, then share it with a wink, saying theyre not
      responsible for how others use it. 
             
      HACKING TOOLS
             Among the most popular examples is NetBus, which
      allows a hacker to control a victims PC from anywhere on
      the Internet, right down to opening and closing the
      CD-ROM door. Its author, Carl-Fredrik Neikter, said he
      wrote NetBus solely to have a fun program. Whats more
      fun than a buddys reaction when the CD-drive door is
      opened mysteriously. :) I didnt think about trojans or a
      hacking tool. Hes now trying to market the tool as
      commercial shareware.
             Others who write such tools say theyre doing it to
      draw attention to security holes  that was the motivation
      behind Back Orifice, written by members of the Cult of the
      Dead Cow, according to member Sir Dystic. 
             While writing such software is not illegal, its also not
      the kind of moonlighting many companies would be proud
      of. But how much control does a company have over its
      employees activity outside of work? 
             
      FACING CONSEQUENCES
             According to Roberson, his Microsoft employers knew
      he came from the scene, even knew he still communicated
      with hackers. Only the embarrassment of the raid cost him
      his job  and he now regrets his past as a hacker.
             I wish I didnt talk to these people, he said. But I
      grew up in the scene, it was all I knew, it was who I was.
      So he felt an obligation to keep up friendships and help
      these kids.
             But in the end those friendships cost him his job 
      and, says Roberson, others involved in the raids are facing
      similar consequences.
             Some people who had absolutely nothing to with with
      hacking at all [were raided], he said. People with things
      going for them, innocent people, who are going to face
      consequences. He says others raided last week got in
      trouble with school officials and employers but declined to
      elaborate. 
             Such consequences  and even threats of prosecution
      and computer seizure made by the White House, CIA and
      FBI  dont seem to be deterring many hackers, who on
      Wednesday continued to deface government Web sites.

      HACKING SUSPECT MAY BE CHARGED 

      Wednesday, June 2, 1999
      By TOM VOGT and RICHARD S. CLAYTON,
      Columbian staff writers

      It could be the fantasy of many computer-savvy
      students: hacking into the school's data system and
      changing your grades. 

          Now prosecutors are considering charges
      against an Evergreen High School student accused
      of using his home computer to raise grades for 22
      classmates. 

          Twenty-three students were disciplined. One
      was expelled, one was placed on long-term
      suspension, and the rest received 10-day
      suspensions. 

          The incident coincided with increasing national
      attention to computer security in the wake of
      high-tech vandalism against computers or Web
      sites in the FBI, the U.S. Senate, the Department
      of the Interior and a federal supercomputer
      laboratory in Idaho. 

          The expelled student is senior Adam Jerome,
      who was responsible for the hacking, according to
      a district source. 

          The computer hacking affected "the integrity of
      the whole system: kids working hard to earn
      grades," Evergreen Principal Jim Hudson said
      Tuesday. 

          Art Curtis, Clark County prosecutor, said his
      office is studying the case and will decide whether
      to file charges in the next week or so. The charge
      would be computer trespass in the first degree, a
      Class C felony. For a first offender, the maximum
      sentence is 90 days in jail. 

          Kirby Neumann-Rea, district spokesman, said
      each student paid $5 to have grades inflated. They
      might face charges of being accomplices to a
      computer trespass, Curtis said. 

          One of the students is Katy Hudson, daughter of
      the Evergreen principal. 

          At least one student used the grade boost to get
      a scholarship, Curtis said. 

          "This is not just a prank," Curtis said. "If there is
      an issue of a potential scholarship, there is a
      concern." 

          Some students received credit for courses they
      never took. 

          District officials said computer security has
      been upgraded since the incident. The school's
      computers are part of a system used by 262
      districts in the state. 

          The hacking started in February. When a
      teacher heard about the grade boosts, school
      officials investigated in April and confronted the
      students. 

          "All the kids came clean," Hudson said, and that
      included the computer expert. 

          "He sat down with us and gave us a complete
      rundown," Hudson said. 

          The district also forwarded correct information
      to colleges for the students involved. 

          All the seniors will graduate, although Jerome
      will not go through the graduation ceremony. 

          Evergreen School District School operates its
      own computer information system, which maintains
      student grades as well as other records. 

          Evergreen's system is separate from the
      regional data center maintained by Educational
      Service District 112. All but one other Clark
      County district (tiny Green Mountain) uses the
      ESD's center to secure student grades and other
      records. 

          The ESD is unaware of any hackers illegally
      entering its system in recent years, said Marge
      Cartwright, the ESD's director of communications
      and information management. 

          Cartwright knows of two attempts to hack into
      the ESD's data center. Both were unsuccessful. 

          "We feel confident in the security of the
      system," Cartwright said. "We haven't had a
      problem with students breaking into it. I'm not
      concerned about that." 

          To access the ESD's system, a user or hacker
      would need more than several passwords and a
      confidential user name. They also would have to
      navigate more than one "firewall." One of these
      firewalls limits access by allowing only specific
      computers at specific schools to enter, Cartwright
      said. 

          Cartwright said she was unaware how the
      student allegedly entered Evergreen's system, but
      could also have used "sniffer" software that helps
      decipher passwords and codes.

      Lobby group pushes for Police email snooping 
      NZ Police refuse to comment

      By Paul Brislen - AUCKLAND 

      An international lobby group aims to convince New Zealand's government that it should implement
      laws requiring Internet service providers (ISP) to allow law enforcement officers access to
      anyone's email.

      The lobby group, the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar (ILETS), is
      made up of police officers and security agents from a number of Western countries including New
      Zealand and Australia. Hong Kong is also included. 

      Set up in 1993 by the FBI to push building universal wiretap-ability into worldwide communications,
      ILETS now has its sights firmly set on tapping into the Internet and may have convinced a meeting
      of European ministers to adopt its latest plan.

      ILETS plans to lobby New Zealand's government to introduce similar laws here, although the
      minister's press secretary, Jonathan Kinsella, says he has not heard of ILETS.NZ Police refuse to
      comment

      "That sounds more like an operational matter. That would be handled by national headquarters."

      New Zealand Police does have a representative in ILETS but he would not comment on ILETS or
      its role in New Zealand. "It's all supposed to be top secret. I'm surprised you got hold of the name
      even," he says. He describes ILETS as an "advisory group" and feels that monitoring of Internet
      communication is a "worldwide trend" of which New Zealand is only a part.

      New Zealand law does not allow such interceptions to take place here and our strict privacy laws
      would also cause ILETS some trouble. However, the group will be pushing the issue at a political
      level.

      Enfopol 19, the document currently before the European council of ministers, requires
      manufacturers and operators to build in "interception interfaces" to the Internet and all future digital
      communications systems. Under the scheme, European ISPs would be required to install
      monitoring equipment or software on site. The European governments would then have the
      capability to track an individual's "static and dynamic IP address . credit card number and email
      address", according to the leaked Enfopol 19 document, available at the Foundation for Information
      Policy Research's (FIPR) Web site (www.fipr.org). 

      FIPR, which describes itself as "an independent body that studies the interaction between
      information technology and society", is based in the UK and has been following ILETS since its
      cover was blown by the German online publication Telepolis. In the UK, opposition from ISPs is
      growing.

      "Anything along the lines [of the ENFOPOL scheme] would probably have astronomical cost
      implications," says Keith Mitchell, chairman of the London Internet Exchange. "In the event such a
      scheme was ever implementable, the costs should be met by the enforcement authorities. Since the
      industry cannot afford it I doubt the public sector could." Mitchell doubts whether such a scheme
      would work on a technical level, something that Telecom is also concerned about.

      "The amount of email going through Xtra's email servers is around five times the volume it was last
      year and it's accelerating," says spokesman Glen Sowry. Telecom has recently installed a new
      email server which is scalable up to a million users.

      "At this stage you would have to take into consideration the sheer volumes of what you are trying
      to achieve."

      European ministers are to meet on May 27 to discuss the adoption of Enfopol 19.

      At approximately 2pm local time on Friday, June 4th,
      people will gather outside at least 16 Federal
      Courthouses across the country to protest the
      continued incarceration of Kevin Mitnick. The
      demonstrations hope to bring attention to the fact that 

      - Kevin has been denied a bail hearing
      - Lack of access by the defense to critical evidence
      - The outrageous claims by software companies as to
      the amounts of damages caused by copying software.
      - When this was reported by the media the court
      blocked access to the defense to further information.

      Kevin Mitnick has never been accused of being violent,
      malicious, or getting any sort of compensation for his
      acts and yet he has been in jail for over four years.
      Longer than most armed robbers or rapists.

      It is hoped that these peaceful demonstrations can
      increase public awareness of this issue and hopefully
      positively influence his sentencing hearing scheduled for
      June 14th.

     On Friday, June 4 at 2 pm, demonstrations will take

     imprisoned without bail in a pre-trial facility in Los
     Angeles for over four years. 

     The demonstrations are being organized by the
     FREE KEVIN movement and seek to shed light on
     the many injustices of this case. 

     They include: 

     --) Mitnick's denial of a bail hearing, something even
     a terrorist is given. 

     --) The inability of Mitnick's defense to have access
     to the evidence against him, making it impossible for
     them to mount an adequate defense. 

     --) The highly dubious claims of certain cellular
     phone companies in letters obtained by us which
     state that Mitnick's mere glancing at their source
     code cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.
     These losses were never reported to their
     stockholders as required by the SEC. 

     --) When the media started to report on these
     disclosures, the court's response was to prevent
     any further documentation from being released. 

     Throughout this ordeal, Mitnick has never been
     accused of doing anything malicious, profiting in any
     way from his talents, or being a violent criminal. Yet,
     since February 15, 1995 he has been locked away
     with some of the most dangerous people around. 

     Our demonstrations will take place to spread the
     word and put pressure on the appropriate
     authorities to end this nightmare once and for all.
     Even those who think Mitnick is guilty of everything
     he's been accused of are outraged by his continued
     incarceration. On June 14, the judge in his case will
     have the option of recommending his immediate
     release to a halfway house or extending his prison
     term even longer.

      Germany Endorses Strong Crypto
      Wired News Report 

      5:20 p.m.  3.Jun.99.PDT
      In an apparent response to corporate
      spying allegedly conducted in Europe by
      the United States, Germany is
      encouraging citizens and businesses to
      use strong cryptography. 

      "[Germany] considers the application of
      secure encryption to be a crucial
      requirement for citizens' privacy, for the
      development of electronic commerce, and
      for the protection of business secrets,"
      reads a translated version of a policy
      framework document released Wednesday
      by Germany's Federal Ministry of
      Economic Affairs and Technology. 

      "The federal government will therefore
      actively support the distribution of secure
      encryption. This includes in particular
      increasing the security consciousness of
      citizens, business, and administration." 

      Australia recently became the first nation
      to admit it participates in Echelon, a
      previously secret global surveillance
      network capable of intercepting
      electronic communications anywhere in
      the world. 

      
      Echelon is said to be principally operated
      by the United States' National Security
      Agency and its UK equivalent, the
      Government Communications
      Headquarters. In addition to Australia,
      the system relies on cooperation with
      other signals-intelligence agencies in
      Canada and New Zealand. 

      Earlier this month, UK investigative
      journalist Duncan Campbell submitted
      Interception Capabilities 2000, his report
      on Echelon, to the European Parliament's
      Science and Technology Options
      Assessment Panel. 

      Campbell had been asked to investigate
      the system in the wake of charges made
      last year in the European Parliament that
      Echelon was being used to funnel
      European government and industry
      secrets into US hands. In the wake of the
      report, the Australian government
      confirmed the Echelon alliance to media in
      follow-up interviews. 

      Though Wednesday's German government
      statement does not mention Echelon, the
      document alludes to the specter of
      industrial espionage. 

      "For reasons of national security, and the
      security of business and society, the
      federal government considers the ability
      of German manufacturers to develop and
      manufacture secure and efficient
      encryption products indispensable," the
      statement said. 

      The government added that it would take
      additional measures to strengthen its
      domestic crypto software industry. 

      The policy also cautioned that while
      encryption may be used to criminal ends,
      the need to protect electronic commerce
      overrides any such concerns. The
      department said it would prepare and
      release a report on the criminal uses of
      cryptography within two years. 

      The US government restricts the export
      of strong crypto on the grounds that it
      might be used by terrorists and hostile
      nations to conceal communications.

                                 Cornerstones of German Encryption Policy 
      
      The Federal Cabinet in its session of June 2 agreed on the German position on the use of cryptographical methods in e-commerce in the form of Cornerstones of
      German Encryption Policy. 
      
      The government followed the necessity to take position in this nationally and internationally vital question important for business and e-commerce. Security problems are
      on the rise with growing traffic on the net. Experts are estimating the losses caused by espionage, manipulation, or damaging of data by billions. Data security is
      becoming a serious issue with global competition and because of that is affecting jobs in respective businesses. 
      
      Improved protection of German users on the net by means of better encryption methods is the main concern of this decision. It states clearly that cryptographic methods
      and products are furthermore permitted to be developed, produced, and used without any restrictions. The yet low awareness towards this issue shall be raised by this
      decision. The initiative Security On The Net by ministries of economic affairs and interior is meant to serve the same purpose <http://www.sicherheit-im-internet.de> 
      
      Another main aim of the German federal government is to strengthen productivity and international competitiveness of the German suppliers in encryption business
      which are likely to intensify their efforts with regards to a growing demand. The further opening of the European single market is serving the same purpose: Germany
      together with its European partners abolished supervision of encryption mass products exported within the EU by revising the EU-dual-use-decree. Simplification of
      export supervision procedure are under examination by the Bundesausfuhramt (federal export agency?) 
      
      With the use of cryptography on the raise improper use cant be ruled out. Therefore the involved ministries will be watching further development thoroughly and deliver
      a report after 2 years. Efforts to improve the technical equipment of law enforcement agencies are underway. 
      
      With this well-balanced position the federal government met the requirements for Germany being a secure and productive site in the information age. 
      
      
      
      Cornerstones of German Crypto Policy 
      
      Introduction 
      
      Hard- and software for message encoding remained until the beginning of the nineties a negligible niche market. However this niche market is now of considerable
      importance to the economic and social development in the information age. The input information is developing more and more into a much demanded raw material.
      Effectively protecting this asset could can be crucial to corporate success and thus determine on prospective employment. This protection today can be effectively
      ensured only by use of strong encryption tools. 
      
      Controversy on encryption in Germany 
      
      The controversy on encryption is about whether or not and to which extent cryptography should be restricted by law. This point has been discussed recently in many
      democratic industrial countries in a controversial way. An intensive argument took place in Germany too, with several ministries, industry, and numerous social groups
      participating. 
      
      In October 1997 the federal cabinet passed the Federal report: Info 2000: Germany's way into the information age, containing a passage on cryptography: 
      
           The Federal Government agrees on waiving to regulate by law the trade and use of cryptographic products and methods. Thus the unrestricted freedom
           of users with choosing and use of encryption systems remains not affected. The Federal Government will watch further development in the field of
           cryptography thoroughly particularly within a European and international context. Further measures to reach its goals will be taken if necessary.  
      
      So far the Federal Government has not taken stand definitely and unequivocally. 
      
      Cryptography and economic interests 
      
      Due to the dynamic development of digital business dealings the markets for encryption products note high growth rates. Besides the traditional protection of confidence
      by now encryption systems are mainly used e.g. for digital copyright protection, digital signatures, and digital cash. Beyond this cryptography is a
      cross-section-technology indispensable for architecture and development of complex e-commerce applications. Indirectly much bigger markets are concerned like e.g.
      telecommunication, online-banking, or tele-medicine. 
      
      Its true that present-day security standards, few years ago affordable only to large-scale enterprises and administration, are now within means of medium-sized and
      small enterprises as well as private households. But still in Germany cryptography is not used in the required degree. The necessary security awareness is lacking
      frequently even though considerable losses can be caused by espionage, manipulation, or destruction of data. German crypto manufacturers would have a good chance
      of keeping up with international competition, if appropriate conditions are ensured. In view of the strategic meaning of the cryptographic sector many important industrial
      states spare no effort in order to strengthen their economical and technical capacities. 
      
      Cryptography and security interests 
      
      Cryptographic methods are of outstanding importance for efficient technical crime protection. That applies to ensuring of authenticity and integrity in data traffic as well
      as protection of confidence. 
      
      On the other hand protection of confidence is in favor of perpetrators: With cryptographic applications becoming more user-friendly spreading into criminal circles has to
      be expected. This could cause serious problems for law enforcement. Lawful surveillance ordered by a court has to remain effective even if the target guards
      concerned information with a cryptographic system. 
      
      Up to now abuse of encryption constitutes no serious problem for law enforcement. However there cant be derived a forecast from this. It is necessary to actively
      examine possible consequences with regard to the specific needs of law enforcement and national security to early identify any undesirable development and take
      effective action against them based on alternative strategies. 
      
      With the recent national discussion as well as the international development as foundations the Federal Government agrees on the following
      cornerstones of encryption policy: 
      
      1. The Federal Government is not intended to restrict the general availability of cryptographic products in Germany. It recognizes the crucial importance of secure
      encryption for data protection, development of electronic business dealings, and protection of corporate secrets. Therefore the Federal Government will actively support
      spreading of secure encryption in Germany. This is meant to particularly promote awareness on security issues among business, administration, and private people. 
      
      2. The Federal Government aims at strengthening users to trust in cryptographic security. It will take measures to establish a trust framework for secure cryptography,
      particularly by improving the ability to check cryptographic products on security and recommending of qualified products. 
      
      3. The Federal Government considers the capability of German manufacturers to develop and manufacture secure and powerful cryptographic products as crucial to
      security of nation, business, and society. It will take actions to improve the international competitiveness in this field. 
      
      4. The legal authority of law enforcement and security agencies to keep telecommunication under surveillance shall not be eroded by dissemination of strong methods for
      encryption. Therefore the competent ministries will be watching further development thoroughly and report after 2 years. Irrespective of that the Federal Government
      will support improving technical competence of law enforcement within the bounds of its possibilities. 
      
      5. The Federal Government sets a great store by international cooperation in the field of encryption. It stands up for market-developed open standards as well as
      interoperable systems and will speak up for strengthening of multi- and bilateral cooperation.

      Congress, NSA butt heads over Echelon

      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)

      Congress has squared off with the National Security Agency over a
      top-secret U.S. global electronic surveillance program, requesting top
      intelligence officials to report on the legal standards used to prevent privacy
      abuses against U.S. citizens.

      According to an amendment to the fiscal 2000 Intelligence Authorization Act
      proposed last month by Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), the director of Central
      Intelligence, the director of NSA and the attorney general must submit a report
      within 60 days of the bill becoming law that outlines the legal standards being
      employed to safeguard the privacy of American citizens against Project
      Echelon.

      Echelon is NSA's Cold War-vintage global spying system, which consists of a
      worldwide network of clandestine listening posts capable of intercepting
      electronic communications such as e-mail, telephone conversations, faxes,
      satellite transmissions, microwave links and fiber-optic communications traffic.
      However, the European Union last year raised concerns that the system may be
      regularly violating the privacy of law-abiding citizens [FCW, Nov. 17, 1998]. 

      However, NSA, the supersecret spy agency known best for its worldwide
      eavesdropping capabilities, for the first time in the history of the House
      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence refused to hand over documents
      on the Echelon program, claiming attorney/client privilege.

      Congress is "concerned about the privacy rights of American citizens and
      whether or not there are constitutional safeguards being circumvented by the
      manner in which the intelligence agencies are intercepting and/or receiving
      international communications...from foreign nations that would otherwise be
      prohibited by...the limitations on the collection of domestic intelligence," Barr
      said. "This very straightforward amendment...will help guarantee the privacy
      rights of American citizens [and] will protect the oversight responsibilities of the
      Congress which are now under assault" by the intelligence community.

      Calling NSA's argument of attorney/client privilege "unpersuasive and dubious,"
      committee chairman Rep. Peter J. Goss (R-Fla.) said the ability of the
      intelligence community to deny access to documents on intelligence programs
      could "seriously hobble the legislative oversight process" provided for by the
      Constitution and would "result in the envelopment of the executive branch in a
      cloak of secrecy."

 39.0 [ISN] Police will have 24-hour access to secret files

      Police will have 24-hour access to secret files
      Stewart Tendler 
      E-mail code-busters to join crime fight 
      
      
      A 24-HOUR technical centre to help to crack secret Internet and e-mail
      systems used by criminals is being set up by the computer industry and the
      police. 
      
      
      The centre will open encrypted messages for officers who have a warrant.
      If the codes cannot be cracked it will call in computer specialists.
      
      
      Ministers are also introducing laws giving police and Customs
      investigators powers to order Internet operators to unlock encrypted
      systems for taps. Users could also be forced to hand over codes protecting
      information.
      
      
      The plans were announced yesterday as ministers released a report by the
      Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit on the problems of
      encryption and police investigations.
      
      
      The report revealed that telephones taps last year led to the seizure of
      three tonnes of heroin and cocaine and the arrest of 1,200 criminals. 
      
      
      Underlining that interceptions have become an "essential tool" the report
      said that one suspect involved in serious crime was arrested for every two
      warrants issued by Jack Straw, the Home Secretary.
      
      
      Interceptions became vital when intelligence could not be obtained by
      surveillance or informants. In 1996-97 the taps resulted in the seizure of
      450 guns and 112 tonnes of drugs, such as cannabis, worth #600 million. 
      
      
      Looking at ways of dealing with the rise of encryption programmes for
      e-mail and telephone systems, the report found that although there was
      general public acceptance of current telephone taps there was strong
      aversion in some areas to secret police access to the Internet.
      
      
      The Government has already ruled out creating an authority which would
      hold the "keys" to encrypted systems sold by licensed firms and allow
      access to investigators. The report concluded that such a plan would be
      unwieldy and still would not give police enough access. 
      
      
      Yesterday Mr Straw said the plans showed that government and industry
      could work together. The aim was to develop the use of the Internet for
      commerce without encouraging or helping crime.
      
      
      Case histories released yesterday show how terrorists and paedophiles are
      already using encryption and slowing or halting investigations.
      
      
      In 1995 two men were arrested in the Home Counties and accused of being at
      the centre of a ring putting out child pornography. Detectives believed
      that encrypted material had been sent worldwide. The men were later jailed
      but 10 per cent of the material was never uncovered. Last year police
      investigating sex and attempted murder allegations found encrypted
      material on a suspect's computer. They finally cracked the code when they
      discovered the decryption key among other material.

 40.0 [ISN] Hack attack knocks out FBI site
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
   
      FBI cracks down on hacker group -- then fbi.gov is knocked offline by hack
      attack. 
      
      
      By Bob Sullivan and Brock Meeks, MSNBC
      May 26, 1999 6:44 PM PT 
      
      
      A skirmish between the FBI and a well-known hacker group seemingly erupted
      Wednesday. 
         
      Not long after federal agents served search warrants on members of hacker
      group Global Hell (gH), probably in connection with recent attacks on U.S. 
      government computers, the FBI's own Web site was attacked and is currently
      offline. 
         
      Earlier on Wednesday, MSNBC was told by a member of gH that the FBI had
      served search warrants on several members of the hacker group. Last week,
      gH member Eric Burns (who also goes by the name Zyklon), was arrested in
      connection with three separate attacks on U.S. government computers,
      including systems at the U.S. Information Agency. 
         
      A hacker identifying himself as "Most Hated," the founder of gH, told
      MSNBC he was raided by agents at about 6 a.m. Wednesday morning in what he
      described as a "a huge hacker crackdown." 
         
      He said he knows of nine people who were raided by government officials --
      including four in Houston, three in California and one in Seattle. None
      was arrested, but all had computer equipment confiscated, he said. 
         
      Late Wednesday, www.fbi.gov stopped working. 
         
      Credit claimed for hack
      
      
      According to the Web site www.antionline.com, an individual calling
      himself Israeli Ghost was taking credit for the attack on the FBI's
      site.
      
      
      The FBI was not immediately available to comment. 
         
      "FBI WILL NOT {expletive deleted} WITH MY FRIENDS FROM GLOBAL HELL," the
      hacker allegedly wrote in an e-mail to Antionline. 
         
      Other members of the hacking community, contacted by MSNBC, said the FBI
      site was hit by what's called a denial of service attack. In such an
      attack, the host computer is not actually controlled by an outsider;
      rather, outsiders bombard a Web site with so many simultaneous hits that
      it becomes overwhelmed and can no longer function.
         
      Most Hated said he didn't know who was responsible for the DOS attack.  He
      said the FBI agents who raided him said the raid was in connection with
      "illegal telecom activity," which he believes is related to fraudulent
      teleconferences he set up. 
         
      White House hack connection
      
      
      "The FBI told me that they were looking into illegal telecom activity," 
      Most Hated told MSNBC. "The FBI said some company lost $250,000."

 41.0 [ISN] What's a Little Hacking Between Friends?

      What's a Little Hacking Between Friends?
      Spin debates hacking: Enjoyable hobby or criminal activity?
      
      
      How much does hacking hurt? The companies hacked by Kevin Mitnick say the
      intrusions cost them millions of dollars in lost business and damages--
      and they're handing him a collective restitution bill of $300 million. 
      
      
      Mitnick's lawyer, Don Randolph, says it's moot. Mitnick has spent years in
      jail, and when he gets out will be forbidden to touch a computer. Even
      discounting his legal bills, Mitnick is broke. 
      
      
      Trying to decide how harmful hacking really is sent the Spin panel into a
      tizzy.  ZDTV's managing editor, Shauna Sampson, aligned with Forbes'
      Dennis Kneale to play down the dark side of hacking, while Suzanne
      Anderson from GlobalNet Ventures looked at the cost to businesses. 
      Finally, Spencer Ante of thestreet.com discussed how these financials can
      affect the market.

      New hacker attack uses screensavers
      By Erich Luening
      Staff Writer, CNET News.com
      May 28, 1999, 8:20 a.m. PT
      
      
      A new Trojan horse program sent by a hacker over the Internet via an email
      spam format as a screensaver could allow PCs to be accessed by
      unauthorized users. 
      
      
      BackDoor-G Trojan horse is considered a potentially dangerous new Trojan
      horse program that could allow hackers to remotely access and control
      infected PCs over the Internet, according to network security and
      management software maker Network Associates. 
      
      
      BackDoor-G affects Windows-based PCs. When executed, BackDoor-G turns a
      user's system into a client system for a hacker, giving virtually
      unlimited remote access to the system over the Internet. The Trojan also
      is virtually undetectable by the user, although it has been reported as
      spreading as a screensaver and an update to a computer game. 
      
      
      The program is the latest in a string of new hybrid security threats that
      blur the line between viruses, security exploits, and malicious code
      attacks, the company said. 
      
      
      BackDoor-G is difficult to detect because it is able to change its
      filename and therefore hide from some traditional virus eradication
      methods such as simply deleting suspicious files. 
      
      
      Though BackDoor-G is not technically a virus, Network Associates advises
      PC users to request an update for both their antivirus and
      intrusion-detection software from their system administrators. 
      
      
      Sal Viveros, group marketing manager for Total Virus Defense at Network
      Associates, said the company has received a few dozen samples of the
      attack since midmorning yesterday. 
      
      
      "There is no one file name it uses," he said. "It spreads everywhere in
      the system. 
      
      
      "There is a trend here. We're seeing more and more programs that are
      stealing information or creating holes to get access to systems remotely,"
      Viveros added.

43.0 [ISN] Hackers beware: IBM to sharpen Haxor
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Hackers beware: IBM to sharpen Haxor
      By Jim Kerstetter, PC Week Online
      May 27 1999 4:49 PM ET
      
      
      Hackers beware: Haxor is watching you from its perch in IBM's wide-ranging
      security suite. 
      
      
      This fall, Haxor is due for a face lift, along with IBM's Boundary Server
      firewall. They are two components of IBM's FirstSecure suite of
      applications, which includes everything from intrusion detection software
      to anti-virus software in the company's wider SecureWay security strategy. 
      
      
      Haxor will gain several new features, including better scanning for
      stealth attacks, such as low-bandwidth hacks and coordinated attacks from
      different geographic points, and improved ability to detect mangled and
      overlapping packets, company officials said. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is also trying
      to improve Haxor's ability to filter out the white noise of regular
      network traffic, tuning it down enough so it can catch stealth attacks
      while not setting off frequent false alarms. 
      
      
      Haxor was developed at IBM's Global Security Analysis Lab, in Hawthorne,
      N.Y., said Dave Safford, manager at the lab. There are two kinds of
      intrusion detection applications: One is based on servers or hosts and
      looks for attacks on that individual system; the other is network-based
      and sniffs packets as they come into the network, trying to determine if
      an attack is taking place. 
      
      
      Haxor is network-based and can be found within IBM's FirstSecure suite as
      well as Tivoli Systems Inc.'s CrossSite network management suite. "There
      is an incredible amount of data that comes out of these things," Safford
      said. "It can be a real problem." 
      
      
      To solve the problem, Safford said, IBM has developed "dynamic
      sensitivity," which will be able to correlate the difference between the
      attacks and legitimate traffic. 
      
      
      Network administrators are particularly interested in integration with
      management tools from companies such as Tivoli. "That makes the most sense
      to me. I want to be able to manage this from one point," said Doug Mallow,
      network administrator at a West Coast bank. 
      
      
      Also this fall, the Boundary Server firewall will be more tightly
      integrated with the SecureSite Policy Director, said IBM officials. Using
      the Common Content Inspection specification that is now under development,
      Boundary Server should be able to improve on performance, essentially
      sharing packets of data with other content inspection applications such as
      Content Technology Inc.'s MIMESweeper for e-mail inspection and Finjan
      Software Ltd.'s SurfinGate mobile code-scanning software. 
      
      
      IBM in January unveiled its SecureWay strategy for Internet and network
      security. Like competing packages from Hewlett-Packard Co., SecureWay is
      made up of both home-grown and OEM applications. 
      
      
      IBM also has developed a Security Policy Director to tie together its
      security pieces.

 44.0 [ISN] Feds Fend Off HACK3RZ

      Feds Fend Off HACK3RZ 
      You might want to resend any e-mails you fired off to the FBI or the U.S.
      Senate yesterday. Hackers shut down both Web sites in a two-for-one attack
      that online media outlets dug right into.
      
      
      News.com reported that the attackers' intent was to crash the FBI site,
      not intrude into its files. Are the perps international spies? Perhaps
      double agents? International anarchists? Most likely they're adolescents
      not old enough to drive, Alan Paller, director of research for the SANS
      (System Administration, Networking and Security) Institute told News.com's
      Paul Festa.
      
      
      ZDNet scored with colorful details that indicate Paller might be right. It
      ran with the story and reported that the Senate Web site, too, had been
      downed Thursday evening. But the level of threat appears more comic book
      than spy thriller, according to ZDNN reporter Joel Deane. Fbi.gov had been
      hacked by a group called Global Hell, and the nefarious culprits behind
      the Senate attack call themselves MAST3RZ 0F D0WNL0ADING, or M0D to their
      friends. Turns out M0D taunted the feds with the message they left
      plastered on senate.gov: "FBI vs. M0D in '99, BR1NG IT 0N!" ZDNet got into
      the story, going so far as to mirror the M0D hack and engage the
      assistance of CyberCrime's Luke Reiter.

 45.0 [ISN] High-tech snooping tools developed for spy agency

      High-tech snooping tools developed for spy agency
      The Vancouver Sun (May 24, 1999)
      Jim Bronskill Southam Newspapers
      
      
      OTTAWA -- Canada's electronic spy agency is quietly bankrolling the
      development of cutting-edge systems that can identify voices, analyze
      printed documents and zero in on conversations about specific topics. 
      
      
      Documents show the Communications Security Establishment has enlisted the
      help of several leading Canadian research institutes to devise
      state-of-the-art snooping tools. 
      
      
      CSE, an agency of the defence department, collects and processes
      telephone, fax and computer communications of foreign states, corporations
      and individuals. The federal government uses the intelligence gleaned from
      the data to support troops abroad, catch terrorists and further Canada's
      economic goals. 
      
      
      CSE and counterpart agencies in the United States, Britain, Australia and
      New Zealand share intercepted communications of interest with one another,
      effectively creating a global surveillance web, according to intelligence
      experts. 
      
      
      CSE's interest in high-tech devices that help locate specific
      conversations and documents is a clear indication the five-member alliance
      collects and sifts large volumes of civilian traffic, said Bill Robinson,
      a researcher in Waterloo, Ont., who has long studied the spy agencies. 
      
      
      "This technology is needed to process vast communications streams when
      you're hunting for nuggets within it." 
      
      
      Robinson said the devices have legitimate uses, but hold "potentially
      frightening" implications for people's privacy as the technology advances. 
      
      
      The Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence, located at
      Concordia University in Montreal, received $355,000 to develop two systems
      for CSE that automatically analyze printed documents, such as faxes, once
      they are digitally captured in a computer data bank. 
      
      
      The first system, completed early last year, quickly determines the
      language of a document, said the centre's C. Y. Suen. 
      
      
      "Some humans may have problems in distinguishing Spanish from Portuguese,
      for example, or Spanish from Italian," he said. "So what we have developed
      is a system that can do it automatically." 
      
      
      The second device electronically searches captured documents for distinct
      features, including logos, photos, text or signatures. 
      
      
      Combining the two systems enables a user, for example, to search a data
      bank for Japanese documents containing photos, or Russian faxes with
      signatures. 
      
      
      Records obtained by Southam News under the Access to Information Act show
      CSE commissioned several other projects during the last two years. They
      include: 
      
      
      - An $84,981 contract with the University of Waterloo in Ontario for the
      "development of multilingual computer speech recognition systems." 
      
      
      - A $115,000 agreement with the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi to
      research "speaker identification" procedures. 
      
      
      - Work by the Centre de Recherche Informatique de Montreal on "topic
      spotting" -- a means of identifying the subject of a conversation. The
      $150,393 contract was the most recent of several awarded to CRIM. 
      
      
      CSE spokesman Kevin Mills did not provide information on specific goals of
      the projects, but allowed: "In general, any research that we're funding
      has some kind of interest for CSE." 
      
      
      The agency has been working on voice and phrase-detection systems for at
      least a decade. The documents, however, show the research continues, with
      some devices yet to be perfected. 
      
      
      CSE and its four international partner agencies use computers capable of
      recognizing intercepted messages containing specified names, addresses,
      telephone numbers and other key words or numbers, says a new report on
      surveillance technology, by Scottish researcher Duncan Campbell. 
      
      
      However, Campbell found the agencies lack systems for homing in on
      conversations featuring particular words. 
      
      
      CSE would have trouble picking out a phone call with the words
      "assassination" or "revolution" because the speech recognition systems
      developed to date cannot instantly recognize an unknown person's voice
      traits. 
      
      
      "The key problem, which is familiar to human listeners, is that a single
      word heard on its own can easily be misinterpreted, whereas in continuous
      speech the meaning may be deduced from surrounding words,"  says
      Campbell's report.

      "voiceprint" or speech pattern of targeted individuals, though the
      technology is not yet fully reliable.

 46.0 [ISN] Privacy issues have taken center stage 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
       Forwarded From: William Knowles <erehwon@kizmiaz.dis.org>
      
      
      http://www.wired.com/news/print_version/business/story/19973.html?wnpg=all
      
      
      (Wired News) TOKYO [6.2.99] -- Privacy issues have taken center stage as
      Japan prepares to enact legislation allowing the police to eavesdrop on
      phone calls, intercept fax and computer transmissions, and read email.
      The draconian measures are ostensibly intended to help law enforcement
      halt premeditated murders, trafficking in drugs and guns, and smuggling of
      illegal aliens into Japan. 
      
      
      At least that's what a bill cobbled together by the country's coalition
      government says.
      
      
      The reality could be far more intrusive, especially after investigators
      receive an official green light to comb through private correspondence and
      communications.
      Japanese citizens' groups -- a hodgepodge of activists with little actual
      influence over policy decisions -- have decried the wiretapping
      legislation as a gross invasion of privacy, and opposition politicians
      boycotted a vote on the legislation last Friday. But the government
      insists that what Japan needs to restore public order is less civil
      liberty and more Big Brother. 
      
      
      People here are scared. Crime -- once unthinkable in Japan -- is on the
      rise. The country's yakuza racketeers are growing increasingly bolder in
      their schemes as nearly a full decade of recession eats away at
      traditional revenue sources, such as payoffs from companies and corrupt
      politicians.
      For law-enforcement authorities, the trouble began back in 1995 when Aum
      Shinrikyo cultists released sarin gas in the Tokyo subway, killing a dozen
      people. The cops simply never saw the attack coming, and have been
      agitating for greater surveillance powers as a means of preventing such
      nastiness from happening again.
      Wiretapping is a convenient shortcut for investigators. And, as the
      pervasive eavesdropping of former East Bloc countries made undeniably
      clear, once authorities start listening it's a hard habit to break.
      
      
      Yozo Marutake, a former senior executive with a manufacturer of hearing
      aids called Rion, said last week that the Japanese police have been
      bugging phones for decades. How does he know this? Because his company
      sold the cops all their surveillance gear, and had done so since first
      being approached by authorities in 1957, he said.
      
      
      So why would the Japanese police now be seeking legal backing for their
      electronic skulking? One reason might have to do with charges from an
      opposition politician last year that his phone had been bugged. The courts
      upheld the politician's claims, although the cops never actually admitted
      being behind the incident.
      
      
      The Internet undoubtedly will be a low priority at first for Japan's
      snoops, but this will change as more people, criminals included, go
      online. For now, it looks like the cops are still unsure how to proceed
      where matters of cyberspace are concerned.
      
      
      Police last week raided the Sapporo home of an 18-year-old who had posted
      a bunch of hit tunes on his home page using the MP3 compression format.
      The teen, needless to say, hadn't worked out copyright issues in advance
      with related Japanese recording companies.
      
      
      Police didn't reveal how they learned about the song-laden site. But they
      said they moved quickly to shut things down after concluding that illegal
      actions were being perpetrated. 
      
      
      This only took them three months of monitoring downloads to figure out.

 47.0 [ISN] Whitehouse to punish Hackers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
      
      Forwarded From: William Knowles <erehwon@kizmiaz.dis.org>
      
      
      http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,37257,00.html
      
      
      (News.com) [6.1.99] WASHINGTON--Annoyed by a recent wave of attacks
      against official U.S. government Web sites, the White House today warned
      hackers who target federal Web sites that they will be caught and
      punished.
      "There's a government-wide effort to make sure that our computer systems
      remain secure," White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said in a
      briefing. "For those who think that this is some sort of sport, I think
      [it will be] less fun when the authorities do catch up with them...and
      these people are prosecuted," he said.
      To protect against attacks that in recent days and weeks have disabled
      sites run by the Energy Department, the FBI, the Senate, the Interior
      Department, and the White House, the Defense Department said it planned to
      shut down its Web site for a short time today, said Ken Bacon, the
      Pentagon's chief spokesman.
      "This is much more protective than reactive," Bacon said. "It's looking to
      the future to prevent the types of problems that the other agencies" have
      experienced in recent weeks on their sites, he said. 
      
      
      Attacking U.S. government Web sites is becoming an increasingly popular
      tool of people angry with the Clinton administration and its agencies.
      
      
      Last week hackers responded to a six-state FBI sweep of about 20 suspected
      hackers by attacking several government Internet locations, forcing the
      FBI, the Interior Department, and the U.S. Senate to temporarily shut down
      their Web sites.
      
      
      After NATO jets hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May, hackers from
      China attacked a handful of U.S. government sites, including one
      maintained by the Energy Department. In an unrelated incident, the
      official White House site was shut down briefly because of an attempt to
      tamper with it by unidentified hackers, officials said. 
      
      
      In recent years the Justice Department's site was shut down once by
      hackers who put Nazi swastikas on its home page, and hackers forced the
      CIA to shut down its site after they changed the name from "Central
      Intelligence Agency" to "Central Stupidity Agency."
      
      
      With many U.S. government sites under attack, computer security experts
      are bracing for what could be a month full of additional Internet hacking
      incidents.
      
      
      Supporters of Kevin Mitnick, a hacker jailed in Los Angeles since February
      1995, will demonstrate in 14 U.S. cities Friday, seeking his release to a
      halfway house and an easy probation when he is sentenced on June 14. 
      
      
      Mitnick, 35, pleaded guilty on March 26 to seven counts of wire fraud,
      computer fraud, and illegal interception of a wire communication.
      Federal officials said he impersonated an employee of Finland-based Nokia
      Mobile Phones to steal software worth $240,000. He also stole software
      from Motorola, Novell, Fujitsu Network Transmission Systems, and Sun
      Microsystems, federal officials said.
      
      
      Supporters of Mitnick say the four years Mitnick has spent in jail
      awaiting trial is a harsher term than for many people convicted of violent
      crimes like robbery and assault. Their protest Friday will be seeking a
      more lenient sentence.
      
      
      The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California said Mitnick will
      be sentenced to 46 months in prison on June 14 as part of his plea bargain
      agreement with the government.
      
      
      Mitnick, whose exploits as a hacker inspired an upcoming Hollywood movie,
      also will be obliged to pay the victims of his crimes from any profits he
      makes from books or movies about his life, a spokesman for the U.S.
      attorney's office said.
      
      
      While hacking incidents may not be part of Friday's nationwide protest,
      there may be a surge in attacks across the Internet if Mitnick's sentence
      is perceived as too stiff, said John Vranesevich, the founder and director
      of AntiOnline.
      
      
      "Hackers attack when they're mad about something. The demonstration Friday
      will be an attempt to educate," said Vranesevich. "However, if Kevin
      Mitnick is put in jail, there very well could be more attacks after that." 
      
      
      Still, other experts said Internet sites should upgrade their security
      against possible attack before Friday.
      
      
      "Given the timing, it probably would be a good idea to be more on guard
      than usual," said Jevon Jaconi, the district attorney of Kewaunee County,
      Wisconsin, and an expert in the developing field of cyberspace law.
      
      
      Between 70 percent and 80 percent of all Internet hacking attacks come on
      systems that have not updated their security codes, routinely sent by
      computer manufacturers and network administrators, Jaconi said.
      
      
      The best way to prevent hacking attacks in the future is to heed those
      security warnings and implement the needed changes, he said.

      Federal Cybercrime Unit Hunts for Hackers
      By MATT RICHTEL  
      
      
      Raids by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week against
      several suspected computer hackers are part of a new Government cybercrime
      unit's crackdown against illegal tampering with computer networks and Web
      sites, a Federal prosecutor said Tuesday.
      
      
      The raids prompted a counteroffensive in which disparate hacker groups
      took responsibility for bringing down additional corporate and Government
      sites, including the F.B.I.'s public information site.
      
      
      The events escalated a longstanding game of tit-for-tat between pranksters
      using personal computers and a newly galvanized Federal police force stung
      by recent attacks on some of the Government's high-level Web sites.
      
      
      Paul E. Coggins, the United States Attorney in Dallas who is overseeing
      the effort, said yesterday that Federal prosecutors had issued 16 warrants
      in 12 jurisdictions after a yearlong investigation, but had not yet
      charged anyone with a crime.
      
      
      The investigation is part of the Government's new, Dallas-based cybercrime
      task force, which includes the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the United
      States Attorney's Office and the Defense Department, Coggins said.
      
      
      "It's probably the most far-reaching investigation of its kind," he said.
      "It's an investigation with national and international implications."
      
      
      Coggins declined to elaborate or to say whether the targets of the
      investigation were considered to be part of a conspiracy.
      
      
      Don K. Clark, a special F.B.I. agent in Houston, said the activities under
      investigation included stealing and misusing credit card numbers and
      computer passwords.
      
      
      Two of those who were raided by the bureau's agents last Wednesday said
      one connection between some of the targets was that they knew one another
      from various discussion groups in an Internet chat forum called Internet
      Relay Chat. The participants said that the talk sometimes revolved around
      hacking techniques but that they were not involved in any general hacking
      conspiracy with other members of the discussion groups.
      
      
      "I have never defaced any Web pages or taken out any major sites," said
      Paul Maidman, 18, of Waldwick, N.J., one of those who were raided. 
      
      
      Referring to proprietary computer systems, he said: "I got into other
      servers. I'd look around, read some E-mail, and that would be it."
      
      
      Maidman said he was awakened last Wednesday morning by five or six armed
      F.B.I. agents surrounding a living room couch where he slept. He said the
      agents confiscated a computer, some diskettes, CD-ROM's and other computer
      paraphernalia.
      
      
      Two Internet service providers have also received requests for
      documentation in connection with the case. The requests, parts of which
      have been posted on the Internet, seek information about dozens of
      hackers, hacker groups and software used by hackers.
      
      
      John Vranesevich, who operates the Anti-Online Web site, which chronicles
      hacker activity, said the information requested from Internet service
      providers involved software tools, computer files and aliases pertaining
      to hacker activities.
      
      
      Vranesevich said several of the aliases actually represented software
      programs called "bots," which are posted in chat rooms as automated
      monitors but may have been mistaken by F.B.I. agents for human
      participants.
      
      
      "Anything that has to do with hackers they're going after," he said. "I'm
      not going to call this a witch hunt, but it's an uninformed
      investigation."
      
      
      Meanwhile, hacker groups continued attacks on corporate and Government
      computers, in some cases making sites inaccessible and, in others, taking
      over sites with their own messages, some of them profane. The F.B.I. site,
      taken down last week, remained inaccessible yesterday.
      
      
      One hacker group, which calls itself F0rpaxe, says it is based in Portugal
      and takes responsibility for "massive attacks" on various Web sites, sent
      a statement to Anti-Online saying, "If the F.B.I. doesn't stop we won't,
      and we can start destroying."

 49.0 [ISN] Hong Kong Computer Hacking Syndicate Smashed
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 

      www.infowar.com
      6/1/99
      Hong Kong Computer Hacking Syndicate Smashed
      
      
      HONG KONG, CHINA, 1999 MAY 30 (Newsbytes) -- By Staff Writer, IT Daily.
      Hong Kong police arrested an organized group of computer hackers last
      week, seizing computers and CD-ROMS, after a five-month hunt. 
      
      
      The arrests marked the first time an organized hacking group has been
      arrested in Hong Kong. 
      
      
      Acting on complaints from several local Internet service providers (ISPs)
      that the accounts of their clients might had been hacked late last year,
      officers from the Computer Crime Section of the Commercial Crime Bureau
      (CCB) launched investigations in January, culminating in a series of raids
      last week. 
      
      
      Two men, including a suspected hacker and a middleman were arrested in the
      first two days of the operation starting on May 20. In all, ten men were
      arrested. The suspects were aged between 16 and 21 and included three
      hackers, six buyers of the passwords and a middleman who arranged the
      sales. 
      
      
      Operating as a syndicate, the hackers stole the passwords and personal
      information on legitimate Internet account holders and sold them. 
      
      
      The principal hacker collected information on over 200 accounts and sold
      them through a middleman to users who wanted cheap, unlimited Internet
      access. Hilton Chan, head of the Computer Crime Section of the CCB told
      ITDaily.com that most of the end-users wanted to use the time to access
      online gaming sites. 
      
      
      According to police, the buyers paid HK$350 (US$45.13) each for a month's
      access, and clocked up Internet time worth between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000
      ($257.88 and $386.82) each. Most local ISPs charge under HK$150 ($19.34)
      per month for unlimited usage, but users must still pay HK$1.98 ($0.26)
      per hour for the Public Non-Exclusive Telecommunications (PNETS) license
      fee. 
      
      
      The middleman communicated with its clients through telephone and the ICQ
      online cmessaging service. 
      
      
      Investigations also showed that one of the hackers set up a Web page on
      the Internet offering pirate music CDs for sale. Each disk featured over
      100 songs downloaded from the Internet or dubbed from copyrighted computer
      disks. The disks were selling for HK$88 ($11.35) each or HK$160 ($20.63)
      for two copies. 
      
      
      Ten sets computers and peripheral equipment believed to be used in the
      hacking and about 700 CD-ROMs were seized during the operation. 
      
      
      Chan said that the maximum penalty is five years' imprisonment. He also
      advised users to protect themselves against hackers. "Don't store your
      password on the computer terminal, and change your password more
      frequently," advised Chan. He also advised users not to use easy to
      replicate passwords and be careful when downloading from the Web. "If you
      don't know the source of it don't download it," Chan said. 
      
      
      Exchange Rate: $1 = HK$7.75

 50.0 [ISN] New Tools Prevent Network Attacks
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 

      http://www.nytimes.com/techweb/TW_New_Tools_Prevent_Network_Attacks.html
      
      
      June 3, 1999
      New Tools Prevent Network Attacks
      Filed at 8:49 a.m. EDT
        
      IT managers alarmed by high-profile security breaches are gaining new
      software tools to ward off network attacks. 
      
      
      Axent Technologies this week will release an intrustion-detection system
      with improvements to protect networks against a range of existing and new
      types of attacks in real time. 
      
      
      Internet Security Systems (ISS) will rollout a souped-up version of its
      RealSecure system that filters out false alarms from real attacks with
      greater efficiency and precision. Other vendors said they plan product
      updates by year's end. CyberSafe, for example, will deliver security
      features that detect intrusions in individual applications. 
      
      
      The advancing functionality of these high-tech burglar alarms comes as
      Internet-based computing exposes security vulnerabilities. Recent hacker
      attacks on the FBI and other government websites, as well as the loss of
      sensitive nuclear weapons information to China, have heightened corporate
      awareness of the need for multiple layers of network security. 
      
      
      As intrusion-detection systems "enter their midlife, they are starting to
      become a viable part of the total protection strategy in many
      corporations," said Mike Hagger, vice president of network security at
      Oppenheimer Funds. The investment company uses ISS' RealSecure to identify
      and respond to certain types of hacker attacks, such as SYN flood attacks. 
      
      
      "Intrusion detection is only one line of defense," Hagger added, citing
      the need for firewalls, antivirus and authentication tools. 
      
      
      Jim Patterson, director of security at service provider Level 3
      Communications, agreed, saying intrusion-detection systems must move
      beyond simple event detection to behavioral analysis. If an intruder is
      using a "valid ID or password, the typical system wouldn't pick that up as
      wrong behavior," he said. 
      
      
      IT managers also need tools that will help them build a baseline of
      typical usage patterns. Thus, if a user tried to access a network at 2
      a.m., for example, an IT manager would be notified. 
      
      
      "I want to get details on what things are being accessed and what systems
      are being used," Patterson said. 
      
      
      For Electronic Data Systems, intrusion detection could be the first line
      of defense. The IT services provider is testing Axent's NetProwler 3.0 on
      the access point into the network-outside the firewall, said Wayde York, a
      network operations supervisor at EDS. 
      
      
      By placing NetProwler at the network perimeter, it can detect "stealth
      scans and newer attacks" that the firewall typically won't pick up, he
      said. Placing the intrusion- detection system in front of the firewall
      also reduces the false alarms common to these network-based systems, York
      said, because it's less likely to have to monitor a wide variety of
      traffic types, as it would inside the firewall. 
      
      
      NetProwler 3.0 also can send alerts to Check Point Software Technologies'
      Firewall-1 product -- which EDS uses -- once an attack is detected so that
      the firewall could then be reconfigured to fend off future attacks of the
      same type, York said. 
      
      
      Tighter integration between NetProwler and Axent's host-based Intruder
      Alert system lets IT managers monitor network devices and servers from
      Intruder Alert's central management console. Protecting mixed platforms
      and critical resources is the goal behind ISS' product rollout, scheduled
      for the week of June 14.

 51.0 [ISN] U.K. Crypto Policy May Have Hidden Agenda
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      U.K. Crypto Policy May Have Hidden Agenda
      Filed at 5:06 a.m. EDT
      By Madeleine Acey for TechWeb, CMPnet
        
      Despite its abandonment of key escrow, the U.K. could be counting on the
      ignorance of new Internet users to provide law enforcement easy access to
      private communications, according to privacy campaigners. 
      
      
      Following a meeting in London on Wednesday, where ISPs drafted a code of
      practice for protecting user privacy, ISP and civil liberties groups both
      derided British and European Union attempts to regulate the use of
      encryption, caching and unsolicited email. 
      
      
      ISP organizations, such as the London Internet Exchange -- or LINX --
      described government policy as "extremely stupid," "misguided" and
      "infeasible." But some said they found it hard to believe incompetence was
      behind it. 
      
      
      LINX chairman Keith Mitchell said the latest version of proposed
      legislation regarding law enforcement access to encrypted email and
      computer files was based on a "misguided conception" that ISPs would
      provide users with encryption. 
      
      
      A senior government official said last week the government expected most
      warrants demanding keys to encrypted material would be served on service
      providers. 
      
      
      "The only encryption of any use on the Internet is end-to-end. The keys
      are generated between the users. All the ISP is going to see is an
      encrypted data stream," Mitchell said. 
      
      
      "I still don't know a single Home Office employee that has an email
      address," he said. But of the encryption warrant policy, he said the
      government "either doesn't understand or is deliberately
      misunderstanding." 
      
      
      "I think they are deliberate," said Yaman Akdeniz of Cyber-Rights &
      Cyber-Liberties. "They don't want to give away what they want to do." He
      said there was a lot of pressure on lawmakers from the National Criminal
      Intelligence Service, which wanted easy access. 
      
      
      "The Home Office believes users will go to [third parties], like the Post
      Office, to get keys," said Nicholas Bohm, spokesman for the Foundation for
      Information Policy Research. "They should not be promoting a policy where
      private keys are generated by anybody but the user." 
      
      
      He, along with Akdeniz, said it was possible the government was planning
      to create a new market, favorable to easy law enforcement access, where
      new Internet users -- unaware of the tradition of free user-to-user
      encryption -- would go to "trusted third parties" for encryption services
      because they were endorsed by the government as safe. "If these new
      services are there, many people will use them," Akdeniz said.

 52.0 [ISN] Tackling E-Privacy in New York
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Forwarded From: Dan Moniz <dnm@unix-security.net>
      
      
      Tackling E-Privacy in New York
      by Chris Oakes 
      
      
      If the federal government won't get tough with the issue of online
      consumer privacy, New York state is determined to do it. 
      
      
      The New York State Assembly has passed the part of a legislative package
      designed to erect unprecedented privacy safeguards for consumer
      information in the information age. 
      
      
      "The more you learn about computers and email and ordering and passing
      information by email and the Internet, the more people realize that laws
      that protect them in different venues are not in place on the Internet,"
      said Assemblywoman Audrey Pheffer. 
      
      
      Pheffer, a Democrat from Queens, is head of the Consumer Affairs and
      Protections Committee and author of several measures in the legislative
      package, considered the most comprehensive state action on consumer
      privacy to date. 
      
      
      Fourteen bills passed last week are expected to pass committee and reach
      the assembly floor as early as this week. The New York Senate plans to
      present its own privacy package this summer. 
      
      
      The broad-ranging measures grew out of the increasing availability of
      personal information. The bills target privacy invasions that the assembly
      said could lead to everything from personal financial loss and damaged
      credit ratings to discrimination. 
      
      
      The authors blame the new risks on computers and Internet use, and modern
      technology in general, which threaten privacy with everything from DNA
      advances to the widespread selling and distribution of digital
      information. 
      
      
      "We had to do this because three to five years ago we never thought when
      we passed legislation that this would be something we'd have to deal with
      -- the theft of identity, the selling of email information, the selling of
      digital photo images," Pheffer said. 
      
      
      The bills require confidentiality of personal records, prevent the selling
      of email addresses without consent, and prohibit various sophisticated
      telemarketing tricks enabled by modern technology. 
      
      
      "We tried to deal with the many issues we and the attorney general have
      received complaints on," Pheffer said. 
      
      
      Whereas consumers used to worry about the theft of a credit card or a
      driver license, Pheffer said that the dangers of information theft are
      much greater. 
      
      
      "[A thief] can steal everything so that they [can] become you. We've had
      stories where people had automobiles ordered [in their name] and just by
      luck were able to actually stop the delivery of the car. It's much more
      than the stealing of a credit card."
      
      
      Identity theft is enabled by electronic access to home addresses, social
      security numbers, and the like, Pheffer said. 
      
      
      The new legislation isn't just targeted at data collected by thieves. It
      places companies under scrutiny, too. 
      
      
      "As technology provides more efficient ways for commercial enterprises to
      gather and distribute information to consumers, it is vital that the laws
      of the state be modernized to ensure personal privacy," said Attorney
      General Eliot Spitzer in statement. Spitzer is one of the primary authors
      and presenters of the legislative package. 
      
      
      Spitzer said that the legislation he authored will strengthen the
      individual's control over personal information. 
      
      
      Privacy experts and advocates are enthused. 
      
      
      "The New York legislation package is very, very exciting," said Paul
      Schwartz, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School. "I think that this is
      something that is going to shift power to people on the Internet, and
      increase the transparencies of [privacy] policies [online]." 
      
      
      "It's not surprising that states are moving when Washington policy
      legislators are largely sitting on their hands," said Marc Rotenberg,
      executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
      
      
      Existing federal measures to protect consumer privacy are largely directed
      at children. The Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting
      privacy, but it can only bring limited civil actions. 
      
      
      Critics charge that the US Commerce Department has failed to put its teeth
      behind consumer privacy because the Internet industry has successfully
      lobbied the agency that the associated costs of such a move would threaten
      the nation's lead in global e-commerce. 
      
      
      In a privacy hearing in Washington last week, Rotenberg said that Congress
      showed itself to be inactive on the issue. 
      
      
      "Everyone sat back and said 'Oh, it looks like self-regulation is working
      [and we] don't need to do anything.... By and large, I think the states
      have not been very impressed. So now they're dealing with wide range of
      issues." 
      
      
      New York has been a state leader in areas of consumer protection and
      privacy protection, Rotenberg said. 
      
      
      But Rotenberg noted that the potential impact of the various bills on
      Internet activity is still unclear. "By and large, the bills really target
      activity off the Internet," Rotenberg said. "[They] treat the Internet as
      one of many privacy issues." 
      
      
      Still, one of the measures in the package would add a prohibition of the
      sale, lease, or exchange of any consumer's email address and any other
      personal identifying information that might be obtained online without a
      consumer's consent. 
      
      
      Jason Catlett, of the online privacy watchdog group Junkbusters, is
      especially pleased with that measure. 
      
      
      But he and others caution that the statewide reach of the legislation is
      one caveat for anyone hoping for far-reaching impact. 
      
      
      "Most privacy advocates and experts would prefer to see broad federal
      legislation for the protection of personal data," said Catlett. "But some
      of these piecemeal measures may prevent some very specific injuries that
      consumers are suffering daily." 
      
      
      Still, he said that some of the bills have a "private right of action,
      which allows individual consumers to sue companies that invade their
      privacy." That principle has worked well in telemarketing legislation and
      deserves to be extended to personal data protection, he said.

 53.0 [ISN] Congress, NSA butt heads over Echelon
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Congress, NSA butt heads over Echelon
         
      BY DANIEL VERTON (dan_verton@fcw.com)
         
      Congress has squared off with the National Security Agency over a
      top-secret U.S. global electronic surveillance program, requesting top
      intelligence officials to report on the legal standards used to prevent
      privacy abuses against U.S. citizens. 
         
      According to an amendment to the fiscal 2000 Intelligence Authorization
      Act proposed last month by Sen. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), the director of Central
      Intelligence, the director of NSA and the attorney general must submit a
      report within 60 days of the bill becoming law that outlines the legal
      standards being employed to safeguard the privacy of American citizens
      against Project Echelon. 
         
      Echelon is NSA's Cold War-vintage global spying system, which consists of
      a worldwide network of clandestine listening posts capable of intercepting
      electronic communications such as e-mail, telephone conversations, faxes,
      satellite transmissions, microwave links and fiber-optic communications
      traffic. However, the European Union last year raised concerns that the
      system may be regularly violating the privacy of law-abiding citizens
      [FCW, Nov. 17, 1998]. 
         
      However, NSA, the supersecret spy agency known best for its worldwide
      eavesdropping capabilities, for the first time in the history of the House
      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence refused to hand over documents
      on the Echelon program, claiming attorney/client privilege. 
         
      Congress is "concerned about the privacy rights of American citizens and
      whether or not there are constitutional safeguards being circumvented by
      the manner in which the intelligence agencies are intercepting and/or
      receiving international communications...from foreign nations that would
      otherwise be prohibited by...the limitations on the collection of domestic
      intelligence," Barr said. "This very straightforward amendment...will help
      guarantee the privacy rights of American citizens [and] will protect the
      oversight responsibilities of the Congress which are now under assault" by
      the intelligence community. 
         
      Calling NSA's argument of attorney/client privilege "unpersuasive and
      dubious," committee chairman Rep. Peter J. Goss (R-Fla.) said the ability
      of the intelligence community to deny access to documents on intelligence
      programs could "seriously hobble the legislative oversight process"
      provided for by the Constitution and would "result in the envelopment of
      the executive branch in a cloak of secrecy."

 54.0 [ISN] Visa, Wells Fargo Deliver E-Payment Alternatives
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
 
       Forwarded From: darek milewski <darekm@cmeasures.com>
      
      
      Visa, Wells Fargo Deliver E-Payment Alternatives
      
      
      New Options for handling credit card transactions over the Web are
      emerging as cheaper and simpler alternatives to the dormant SET standard. 
      
      
      As merchants continue to call for SET alternatives, two financial services
      giants--credit card company Visa International and online banking leader
      Wells Fargo & Co.--are trying a new approach: issuing digital certificates
      for use in SSL-based sessions. 
      
      
      Visa, which co-developed SET with MasterCard International, will now let
      banks issue RSA Data Security X.509 digital certificates to merchants and
      will provide those banks with data collection, authorization, routing and
      settlement services for Internet transactions through its new Visa Payment
      Gateway. 
      
      
      The gateway, to go live this summer, gives merchants using the Visanet
      point-of-sale network access to that same network through Web channels.
      That means there's no legacy-systems integration required by Visa USA's
      6,000 member banks, many of which have characterized the Secure Electronic
      Transactions (SET) protocol as a gamble because of the implementation
      costs. 
      
      
      Visa's gateway arrives just one week after Wells Fargo said it will offer
      merchants e-commerce services that combine Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
      encryption with digital certification. Wells Fargo has partnered with
      GTE's CyberTrust business unit to issue digital certificates to merchants. 
      
      
      While both Visa and Wells Fargo still support SET, the moves underscore
      the difficulties that SET has faced. 
      
      
      Few merchants and banks have installed SET-enabled systems because of
      their cost and complexity. In fact, less than 1 percent of U.S. merchants
      polled by Forrester Research said they are using or plan to use SET on
      their sites. Also, consumers have little incentive to use the e-wallet
      applications that SET requires, analysts said. 
      
      
      Today, most Web storefronts protect credit card data using SSL encryption
      but do not validate users' identities with digital certificates.

 55.0 [ISN] Protocols serve up VPN security
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
       Forwarded From: darek milewski <darekm@cmeasures.com>

      Protocols serve up VPN security
      By GREG MARCOTTE
      Network World, 05/31/99
      
      
      As the need to securely open corporate LANs to telecommuters and disparate
      corporate sites grows, virtual private networks (VPN) continue to meet the
      demand. VPNs - which establish private, secure sessions between two or
      more LANs or between remote users and a LAN - use the Internet or private
      IP networks to distribute data and enable corporations to eliminate
      additional, often expensive, dedicated lines or remote access servers. 
      
      
      Today, network executives must weigh two protocols that specify how VPNs
      should be built. The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and IP
      Security (IPSec) protocol enable private sessions over the Internet and
      securely link remote users to corporate networks. The protocols also
      possess relative strengths and weaknesses in data security and ease of
      deployment.  Network managers must determine which VPN protocol best suits
      the need of their organizations. 
      
      
      
      Diagram of how PPTP works
      
      
      PPTP vs. IPSec security
      
      
      Spearheaded by Microsoft and US Robotics, PPTP was first intended for
      dial-up VPNs. The protocol was meant to augment remote access usage by
      letting users dial in to local ISPs and tunnel into their corporate
      networks. Unlike IPSec, PPTP was not intended to address LAN-to-LAN
      tunneling when it was first created. 
      
      
      PPTP extends PPP - a protocol that defines point-to-point connections
      across an IP network. PPP is widely used to connect dial-up and broadband
      users to the public Internet or private corporate networks. Because PPP
      functions at Layer 2, a PPTP connection that encapsulates PPP packets
      allows users to send packets other than IP, such as IPX or NetBEUI. IPSec,
      on the other hand, functions at Layer 3 and is only able to provide the
      tunneled transport of IP packets. 
      
      
      The encryption method commonly used in PPTP is defined at the PPP layer. 
      Typically, the PPTP client is the Microsoft desktop, and the encryption
      protocol used is Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE). MPPE is based
      on the RSA RC4 standard and supports 40-bit or 128-bit encryption.
      Although this level of encryption is satisfactory for many applications,
      it is generally regarded as less secure than some of the encryption
      algorithms offered by IPSec, particularly 168-bit Triple-Data Encryption
      Standard (DES). 
      
      
      Protect and serve
      
      
      Meanwhile, IPSec was built for secure tunneling over the Internet between
      protected LANs. It was meant for a connection with a remote office,
      another LAN or corporate supplier. For instance, a large automotive
      company could use an IPSec VPN to securely connect its suppliers and
      support purchases orders over the 'Net. 
      
      
      IPSec also supports connections between remote users and corporate
      networks. Similarly, Microsoft added LAN-to-LAN tunneling support for PPTP
      in its Routing and Remote Access Server for Windows NT Server 4.0. 
      
      
      When it comes to strong encryption and data integrity, IPSec is generally
      regarded as superior. The protocol combines key management with support
      for X.509 certificates, information integrity and content security.
      Furthermore, 168-bit Triple-DES encryption, the strongest form of
      encryption available in IPSec, is more secure than 128-bit RC4 encryption.
      IPSec also provides packet-by-packet encryption and authentication and
      prevents the "man-in-the-middle attack," in which data is intercepted by a
      third party, reconstructed and sent to the receiver. 
      
      
      PPTP, however, is vulnerable to such assaults, primarily because it
      authenticates sessions but not individual packets. Note, however, that
      mounting a successful man-in-the-middle attack against a PPTP connection
      would take considerable effort and know-how. 
      
      
      For many corporations, the ability to run PPTP from the Windows platform
      (it supports Windows NT, 95 and 98) can make deploying and maintaining a
      VPN seamless. For others, PPTP is perceived as less secure than IPSec. 
      
      
      It is important to bear in mind, however, if deploying a VPN for remote
      users, IPSec requires an organization to load specialized client software
      on each desktop. Client software deployment and maintenance are a weighty
      undertaking that must be considered. In terms of simplicity, PPTP is
      substantially easier to deploy.

      I Am a Bad Ass 

      
      By Herbert Kornfeld 
      Accounts Receivable Supervisor 
      
            YO, waaasssuuup, baby? H-Dog is back, and don't nobody fuck with this BADASS. You wanna fuck me, motherfucker? You gonna wish you didn't. 'Cause I
      the Accounts Receivable supervisor of Midstate Office Supply, and I AM a cold-blooded badass motherfucker, and if you fuck with me I'll go stone cold crazy on
      your ass. 
      
            Like that motherfucker Steve Englebreiter of Associated Publishing House. Asshole thought he could postdate his goddamn check on a bill that was overdue for
      nearly a month and a half. I caught it right before we was ready to deposit it. Don't tell me it was no mistake; cocksucker knew what he was doing all along. Know
      what I did? Sent the goddamn thing right back along with a note saying we be passing his account along to a collection agency in two weeks if his bitch ass didn't pay
      up. 
      
            Now, legally, we only supposed to notify our collection agency after 90 days, not a month and a half. But I didn't have to tell thefool that. Three days later
      cocksucker sends us a cashier's check via overnight mail for the full amount. Ain't nobody fucks with my badass self. 
      
            Or take that ol' bitch Mildred Fladner who's always callin' up, bitchin' about her credit balance. 
      
            "Those staplers only cost $36.50 for the half-dozen, not $38.50. Your cashier rung it up wrong." 
      
            Then how come you didn't notice it then, y'ol ho? She high and everybody know it, but she make such a big deal about knowing the company president and
      everything she got everybody runnin' scared. Except this BAD ASS. 
      
            So I go downstairs to the register she bought the staplers at, reset the date, duplicate the cashier number and purchase number, and ring the goddamn shit up at
      $39.50. Then I call her back sayin' I found the original detail tape and check it out, it looks like you owe us a dollar additional, plus extra sales tax, your own receipt
      must have come out poor. A week later I get a payment for the full amount, with her apologies. I pocket the extra buck and change, spend it on a lotto ticket, and
      win five bucks. It's payback time for that bitch. 
      
            Now don't be messin' me up with the Accounts Payable Supervisor. The Accounts Payable Supervisor, he ain't no badass. Hell, he ain't even no man. His name
      is Myron or something, and he so old he can't even get it up no more. I gots a bitch in the cash room. Myron, everybody laugh at him. He supposed to be the one
      that got the money but everybody know I got it and it's no even my job. 
      
            If I ever see you within even six feet of the coffee machine I'll Bruce Lee on your sorry ass. Mister Coffee, he my man. 'Cause only I know the perfect
      proportion: two and three eighths scoops of Folgers to three and one quarter cups of water. Ain't no use trying to do it yourself 'cause you'll just fuck it up; only I can
      do it right. 'Cause I got Kung Fu Grip. You got a problem with that? I got a problem with your existence, motherfucker. I was fucking your mother while you were
      still watching Fat Albert in yo' Underoos. 
      
            I don't answer to nobody. One day I be blastin' the phat beats, and the company president come up to me and say, "Herbert, the Muzak is too loud, please turn
      down the receiver." I say, "I need my tunes when I be preparing account statements." Then he say, "I don't care, turn it down, it's distracting." So you know what I
      do? After he leaves for the day I steal a shitload of mints from his desk. He gets the message, and he don't give me no trouble no more. I be fucking his wife on the
      sly, anyhow. 
      
            So don't fuck with this H-Dog Daddy Mack Mack Daddy Comin' Out Your Ass Badass, 'cause if you do I be comin' after you like pastrami on rye to whip
      your muthafukin' sorry ass. I mean it. Don't. Fuck. With. Me.

      Keep Your Fucking Shit Off My Desk
      
      
      By Herbert Kornfeld 
      Accounts Receivable Supervisor
      
            Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, bruthahs 'n' sistahs. H-Dog here, His Stone Cold Baadness, The Original Gangsta, The Mack Daddy, The Freaky Gangbanga. And I got
      somethin' to say to all y'all bitches out there: Keep yo' motherfuckin' shit offa my desk, or I'll fuck your sorry ass up wit' a quickness. And I don't want to see y'all
      comin' around, puttin' your feet on it, neither. Or puttin' your goddamn coffee cups on it and leaving them fucked-up rings all upside the wood and shit. 
      
            'Cause I keep my fly shit on my desk. I gots my dope spreadsheets, my hangin' file folders, my delinquent-account file, my paper clips, my Post-It note
      dispenser, my monthly desk planner, my Midstate Office Supply business cards, my four-color ball-point pen, my motherfuckin' dot-matrix printer address labels,
      and my stoopid-fresh three-hole punch. Not to mention my computer. I swear, if I see any of y'all within three feet of my computer, I'll put a Lee Van Cleef on your
      bitch ass. I'll come at you like a mother fuck. 
      
            I'm just trying to keep it real, know what I'm sayin'? I wanna stop the violence before it starts. I could say nothin' and wait in the shadows like some
      motherfuckin' ninja, and when some punk-ass temp worker come along and start readin' my "Attitude Is A Little Thing That Makes A Big Difference" Successories
      mouse pad, I could jump out and knock the sucka's teeth the fuck out. 'Cause that would be my right. A man's gotta protect what's his, right? 
      
            Take what happened just last week. Judy Metzger, this li'l skank-ass ho from Accounts Payable, be runnin' her ass around the office, puttin' cupcakes wit' the
      goddamn smiley faces and shit on people's desks. I'm like, "Whus this smiley-face shit y'all be puttin' on my desk?" And she's like, "I made cupcakes for everyone in
      the office last night!" 
      
            Now, I don't take shit from nobody, and I sure as hell don't take no shit from some bitch from Accounts Payable, so I picks up my letter opener and do some
      crazy kung-fu shit on her. "Flag yo' ass outta here, bitch, and keep yo' fuckin' cupcake shit offa my fly desk." 
      
            She go runnin' out of the room and go gets her supervisor, Myron Schabe, from across the hall. Like I'm supposed to be scared of that. Myron older than shit
      and he wear bow ties like he Pee Wee Muthafuckin' Herman or somethin'. So then he come up to my cubicle and say, "Herbert, I think there's been a
      misunderstanding. It was Judy's turn this week to bring in a treat." I tell him I don't like no bitches from Accounts Payable puttin' no shit on my desk. But this Myron
      fool keep pushin' it, tellin' me: "It was meant as a nicety, Herbert, nothing else. It's Co-Worker Appreciation Month, and everybody's scheduled to bring in a treat.
      You yourself are signed up for next Wednesday." 
      
            So you know what I tell him? I says, "I ain't gonna be bringing in no motherfuckin' treat, motherfucker. Treats is for old ladies in the nursing home and shit. And
      ain't nobody gonna be layin' they smiley-face bullshit on my dope fly desk. I gots everything where I want it, and ain't no little ho gonna be fuckin' it all up. So take
      yo' bitch-ass, bow-tie self and get the fuck out of my cubicle before I cut you, beee-yaatch!" 
      
            After that, Myron walk out of there wit' his li'l dick between his legs. Ain't no Accounts Payable supervisor motherfucka gonna tell Herbert Kornfeld what to do.
      And no one else, for that matter. You put shit on my desk, you just signed your death warrant. I mean it. Heads will get flown. 
      
            H-Dog out. And to all my homies in Accountz Reeceevable and the bruthahs kickin' it down in Shipping, keep ya heads up. Peace.

     I Be The Real Employee Of The Month


      By Herbert Kornfeld 
      Accounts Receivable Supervisor 
      
            Yo yo yo yo, whassssuuup, G's. H-Dog in tha house, and you'll pardon me if I dispense with the usual formalities, but I'm out for muthafuckin' REVENGE. You
      see, some dirty cocksucka dared fuck with me, Tha Stone Cold Funky-Fresh Bad-Ass Of Accountz Reeceevable. I swear, before I sign out for lunch today I'm
      gonna Hong Kong on that sorry fool's ass. I'm gonna cut him a permanent smile wit' my Letter Opener Of Death. I'm serious. Heads will get flown. 
      
            The shit came down yesterday morning, when Gerald Luckenbill, head comptroller at Midstate Office Supply, called a big-ass meeting to announce the
      Employee Of Tha Month. I figure, this meetin' gonna be real short, 'cause everybody knows who be the best employee at Midstate Office Supply--ME. Hell, I
      already got me so many Employee Of Tha Month plaques on my desk, I need a bigger muthafuckin' cubicle. 
      
            So you know what that bitch-ass Luckenbill do? He give the muthafuckin' Employee Of Tha Month plaque to muthafuckin' Phil Weinstein from customer
      muthafuckin' service. Luckenbill say Weinstein got chosen because of "his outstanding service to the company and the gracious and courteous manner in which he
      always treats the customers." That's bullshit, man. Weinstein only got chose Employee Of Tha Month 'cause his supervisor, Sandra Schumacher, wanna ride his
      cock. 
      
            I don't need no dust-crotch supervisor ho wantin' to freak my ass, 'cause I be my own muthafuckin' supervisor, and I don't answer to nobody. I be the real
      Employee Of Tha Month. Everybody think, ol' Herbert, he don't deserve no Employee Of Tha Month award. He ain't got no shit on nobody. But think again,
      suckas. 
      
            Shit gets done when I'm around. Ain't nobody balance more spreadsheets in a pay period than me. I coordinate the second-shift check-processing schedule like
      a mother fuck. Bills be sent. I even do shit I don't need to do. Like when Rose Powell, that head payroll bitch from Human Resources, quit, I helped that
      department out, 'cause Human Resources manager Bob Cowan don't know shit about payroll and woulda fucked it all up. All this, and I'm goin' to night school. I be
      just three credits away from my two-year accounting degree, and Midstate be payin' my tuition, besides. 
      
            If that all wasn't enough, the second-floor vendin' machine even stopped servin' up them nasty muthafuckin' nut rolls 'cause of me. You see, last Tuesday, the
      man from Karlsen Vending came by to restock the vending machine, and I said to him, "You better stop loadin' this thing with them skank-ass Pearson's Nut Rolls if
      you know what's good for you, cocksucka." And just like that, he stopped. Why? 'Cause he shit-scared of me. He knows I gots the Kung Fu grip. And I gots so
      much dead presidents in my pocket from workin' all that overtime last Christmas season, when this fiscal year is through I'm gonna take me a long vacation and chill
      out with some of my bitches in Branson, MO. 
      
            I'm so good, I even got this one motherfuckin' delinquent account that's been in our files for months to pay the fuck up. That's right. See, one day, I was readin'
      the newspaper, and I saw this legal notice sayin' that the fucka who owed us all this cash was goin' bankrupt, and that any creditors who were owed money by him
      had best make theyselves known wit' a quickness. So I tell that Luckenbill about it, he calls our lawyer, and, before you know it, Midstate Office Supply gets this
      check for $4,130 in the mail. That bitch got wrote off. Uh huh. So when I says I superbad, I ain't just blowin' shit out my ass. H-Dog gots tha flava. 
      
            Luckenbill said he gonna recommend I get a raise for my swift resolvin' of that delinquent account, but I told him, "Don't do me no damn favors, L, 'cause I gots
      me a score to settle." It's payback time for that Weinstein asshole. He ain't even been with the company a year, and he think he can hustle in on my award. Guess
      again, punk. I'm gonna jump in my fly hoopty and run this cocksucka down like a fuckin' dog. Weinstein's eyes gonna be buggin' when he sees my 1981 Buick
      Regal, a.k.a. Tha Nite Ridahh, comin' up on his sorry ass in the employee parking lot. Pow! I'm gonna take him out like I'm muthafuckin' Scarface, man. 
      
            Daddy H over and OUT. But before I go, I wanna send some shout-outs to my homies around the office, and all the other righteous folks who be down with the
      H-Dog: my posse in Accountz Reeceevable, Gary, Linda, and Gladys; Ruth B. down in Inventory; tha Extra-Strength Disciples in Accounting; Janitor X; the whole
      gang over at Snap-Rite Corporation, makers of funky-dope spreadsheets and fly file folders; them cafeteria bitches Theresa and Donna; and Principles Of
      Accounting, Volume 4. Peace.
