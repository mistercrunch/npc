   SYNOPSIS (READ THIS)
   --------------------
   
   The purpose of this newsletter is to 'digest' current events of interest
   that affect the online underground and netizens in general. This includes
   coverage of general security issues, hacks, exploits, underground news
   and anything else I think is worthy of a look see. (remember i'm doing
   this for me, not you, the fact some people happen to get a kick/use
   out of it is of secondary importance).

    This list is NOT meant as a replacement for, nor to compete with, the
   likes of publications such as CuD or PHRACK or with news sites such as
   AntiOnline, the Hacker News Network (HNN) or mailing lists such as
   BUGTRAQ or ISN nor could any other 'digest' of this type do so.

    It *is* intended  however, to  compliment such material and provide a
   reference to those who follow the culture by keeping tabs on as many
   sources as possible and providing links to further info, its a labour
   of love and will be continued for as long as I feel like it, i'm not
   motivated by dollars or the illusion of fame, did you ever notice how
   the most famous/infamous hackers are the ones that get caught? there's
   a lot to be said for remaining just outside the circle... <g>

    WANTED!: POSTCARDS! YESH! POSTCARDS, I COLLECT EM so I know a lot of you are
    ~~~~~~~  reading this from some interesting places, make my day and get a
             mention in the zine, send in a postcard, I realize that some places
             it is cost prohibitive but if you have the time and money be a cool
             dude / gal and send a poor guy a postcard preferably one that has some
             scenery from your place of residence for my collection, I collect stamps
             too so you kill two birds with one stone by being cool and mailing in a
             postcard, return address not necessary, just a  "hey guys being cool in
             Bahrain, take it easy" will do ... ;-) thanx.



    Ideas for interesting 'stuff' to send in apart from news:

    - Photo copies of old system manual front pages (optionally signed by you) ;-)
    - Photos of yourself, your mom, sister, dog and or cat in a NON
      compromising position plz I don't want pr0n. <g>
    - Picture postcards
    - CD's 3.5" disks, Zip disks, 5.25" or 8" floppies, Qic40/80/100-250
      tapes with hack/security related archives, logs, irc logs etc on em.
    - audio or video cassettes of yourself/others etc of interesting phone
      fun or social engineering examples or transcripts thereof.
    
    
    Stuff you can email:
    
    - Prank phone calls in .ram or .mp* format
    - Fone tones and security announcements from PBX's etc
    - fun shit you sampled off yer scanner (relevant stuff only like #2600 meeting activities)
    - reserved for one smiley face ->        :-)            <-
    - PHACV lists of files that you have or phac cd's you own (we have a burner, *g*)
    - burns of phac cds (email first to make sure we don't already have em)
    - Any and all telephone sounds/tones/beeps/trunk drops/line tests/etc in .ram etc format or .mp*
    

    If you still can't think of anything you're probably not that interesting
    a person after all so don't worry about it <BeG>

    This list is not intended to be about cracking systems or exploiting their
    vulnerabilities. It is about defining, recognizing, and preventing use of
    security holes and risks.

    2. MOSTLY Unchanged since issue #1, although issues are a digest of recent news
       events its a good idea to check out issue #1 at least and possibly also the
       Xmas issue for a good feel of what we're all about otherwise enjoy - Ed ...

 00.4 Whats in a name? why HWA.hax0r.news??
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             
      
      Well what does HWA stand for? never mind if you ever find out I may
     have to get those hax0rs from 'Hackers' or the Pretorians after you.

     In case you couldn't figure it out hax0r is "new skewl" and although
     it is laughed at, shunned, or even pidgeon holed with those 'dumb
     leet (l33t?) dewds' <see article in issue #4> this is the state
     of affairs. It ain't Stephen Levy's HACKERS anymore. BTW to all you
     up  and comers, i'd highly recommend you get that book. Its almost
     like  buying a clue. Anyway..on with the show .. - Editorial staff

00.5  HWA FAQ v1.0 Feb 13th 1999 (Abridged & slightly updated again)
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Also released in issue #3. (revised) check that issue for the faq
    it won't be reprinted unless changed in a big way with the exception
    of the following excerpt from the FAQ, included to assist first time
    readers:

    Some of the stuff related to personal useage and use in this zine are
    listed below: Some are very useful, others attempt to deny the any possible
    attempts at eschewing obfuscation by obsucuring their actual definitions.

    @HWA   - see EoA  ;-)

    !=     - Mathematical notation "is not equal to" or "does not equal"
             ASC(247)  "wavey equals" sign means "almost equal" to. If written
             an =/= (equals sign with a slash thru it) also means !=, =< is Equal
             to or less than and =>  is equal to or greater than (etc, this aint
             fucking grade school, cripes, don't believe I just typed all that..)

    AAM    - Ask a minor (someone under age of adulthood, usually <16, <18 or <21)

    AOL    - A great deal of people that got ripped off for net access by a huge
             clueless isp with sekurity that you can drive buses through, we're
             not talking Kung-Fu being none too good here, Buy-A-Kloo maybe at the
             least they could try leasing one??

   *CC     - 1 - Credit Card (as in phraud)
             2 - .cc is COCOS (Keeling) ISLANDS butthey probably accept cc's

    CCC    - Chaos Computer Club (Germany)

   *CON    - Conference, a place hackers crackers and hax0rs among others go to swap
             ideas, get drunk, swap new mad inphoz, get drunk, swap gear, get drunk
             watch videos and seminars, get drunk, listen to speakers, and last but
             not least, get drunk.
   *CRACKER - 1 . Someone who cracks games, encryption or codes, in popular hacker
                 speak he's the guy that breaks into systems and is often (but by no
                 means always) a "script kiddie" see pheer
              2 . An edible biscuit usually crappy tasting without a nice dip, I like
                  jalapeno pepper dip or chives sour cream and onion, yum - Ed

    Ebonics - speaking like a rastafarian or hip dude of colour <sic> also wigger

              ebonics, speaking in a dark tongue ... being ereet, see pheer

            HNN affiliates ;)

    du0d   - a small furry animal that scurries over keyboards causing people to type
             weird crap on irc, hence when someone says something stupid or off topic
             'du0d wtf are you talkin about' may be used.

   *HACKER - Read Stephen Levy's HACKERS for the true definition, then see HAX0R

   *HAX0R - 1 - Cracker, hacker wannabe, in some cases a true hacker, this is difficult to
            define, I think it is best defined as pop culture's view on The Hacker ala
            movies such as well erhm "Hackers" and The Net etc... usually used by "real"
            hackers or crackers in a derogatory or slang humorous way, like 'hax0r me
            some coffee?' or can you hax0r some bread on the way to the table please?'

            2 - A tool for cutting sheet metal.

    HHN    - Maybe a bit confusing with HNN but we did spring to life around the same

            should have RTFM you dumb ass.

03.0 AVP releases Bo2K detection July 12th
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From www.avp.com;
     
     
     Win32.BO, (Back Orifice Trojan)
                  This trojan can be detected and removed with AntiViral Toolkit Pro
     This trojan is an network administration utility itself that allows to control remove computers on the
     network.  "Back Orifice is a remote administration system which allows a user to control a computer
     across a tcpip connection using a simple console or gui application. On a local lan or across the
     internet, BO gives its user more control of the remote Windows machine than the person at the
     keyboard of the remote machine has"

     The only feature makes this utility to be classified as malicious trojan software - the silent installing
     and execution. When this program runs, it installs itself into the system and then monitors it without
     any requests or messages. If you already have it installed on the computer, you cannot to find this
     application in task list. The trojan also does not manifest its activity in any way.

     The trojan is distributed in a package of several programs and documentation. All programs in
     package were written in C++ and compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. The date stamp on
     EXE files that we got says that all files in package were compiled at the end of July - first week of
     August 1998. All the programs in package have Portable Executable formats and can be run under
     Win32 only.

     The main executable in package is the BOSERVE.EXE file that might be found with different names
     on infected computer. This is the trojan itself. It is the "server" part of the trojan that might be called
     by clients from remote computer.

     The second file is the BOCONFIG.EXE utility that can configure the server as well as attach it to
     other executable files in the same style as viruses do that. While attaching (infecting) the host file is
     moved down and the trojan code is placed at the top of file. When "infected" files are run, the trojan
     extracts the original file image and spawns it without any side effects.

     There are two "client" parts of the trojan (console and window), they operate with "server" from
     remote computer. Two other executable files in package are used by trojan while
     compressing/decompressing files on "server".

     When the trojan is executed on the computer, it first of all detects its status: is it original trojan code
     or attached to some host file, i.e. modified by the BOCONFIG.EXE utility. In this case the trojan
     locates customized options in the host file and reads them.

     The trojan then initializes the Windows sockets, creates the WINDLL.DLL file in the Windows
     system directory (this file is stored as a resource in the trojan), then gets several KERNEL32.DLL
     APIs addresses for future needs, search for trojan process already run and terminates is (upgrades
     the trojan process), copies itself to the Windows system directory and registers this copy in the
     system registry as the auto-run service:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

     Creates a TCP/IP datagram socket, assigns a port number 31337 (by default) to this socket and
     opens this port for listening. The trojan then runs standard Windows DispatchMessage loop, i.e.
     stays in Windows memory as a process with hidden attribute (it has no active window and is not
     visible in task manager).

     The main trojan routine then listens for commands from remote client. The commands go in
     encrypted form and starts with the 

     "*!*QWTY?" (without " character) ID-string.

     Depending on the command the trojan is able to perform a set of actions:

     Gets and sends computer name, user name and system info: processor  type, memory size,
     Windows OS version, installed drives and free space on them,

     Shares selected drives

     List disk contents or searches for specific file

     Sends/receives files (reads and writes them), as well as deleting,   copying, renaming and running
     them (including updating itself)

     Created/deletes directories

     Compressed/decompresses files

     Logoffs current user

     Halts the computer

     Enumerates and sends active processes

     Enumerates and connects to network resources

     Terminates selected process

     Gets and sends cashed passwords (passwords that were used), then looks for ScreenSaver
     password (decrypts and sends them)

     Displays message boxes

     Access the system registry

     Opens and redirects other TCP/IP sockets

     Supports HTTP (protocols and emulations) Web-server, so one may access the trojan by Web
     browser

     Plays sound files

     Hooks, stores and sends keyboard input while the user is logging, (see below):

     While installing into the system the trojan creates the WINDLL.DLL file (it keeps this file image in its
     resources). In case of need the trojan loads this DLL into the memory and initializes it, the DLL then
     hooks keyboard and console (device console) input and stores hooked data to the
     BOFILEMAPPINGKEY and BOFILEMAPPINGCON files that are then available for main trojan
     routine.

     The trojan is also possible to expand its abilities by using plug-ins. They can be send to the "server"
     and installed as trojan's plug-in. The features and main functions (including possible malicious ones)
     are on its author responsibility.

      What Customers Should Know About BackOrifice 2000

      BackOrifice 2000; (BO2K) is a malicious program that is expected to be released on or about July 10, 1999. 
      Customers can protect themselves by following normal safe computing practices.

      Although the software has not yet been released, Microsoft is closely monitoring the situation and is committed 
      to providing information that will let customers understand and protect themselves against it when it becomes 
      available.  Following are frequently asked questions about the program.
      
      What is BO2K?
      BO2K is a program that, when installed on a Windows computer, allows the computer to be remotely controlled by
      another user.  Remote control software is not malicious in and of itself; in fact, legitimate remote control 
      software packages are available for use by system administrators.  What is different about BO2K is that it is
      intended to be used for malicious purposes, and includes stealth behavior that has no purpose other than to make 
      it difficult to detect.
      
      What's the danger from it?
      
      When BO2K is installed on a computer, the attacker can do anything that the user at the keyboard could do.  This 
      includes running programs, creating or deleting files, sending and receiving data, and so on.

      How would it get onto my computer?
      
      Like any computer program, BO2K must be installed on the target machine.  BO2K cannot be injected onto your machine.
      There are only two ways it can be installed: By giving the attacker physical access to your logged-on computer.  If
      the attacker learns your password or you leave your logged-on workstation unattended, he or she can install BO2K on
      your machine.

      By tricking you into installing the software.  This is known as a Trojan horse technique.  The attacker might send 
      you an email attachment that claims to be a game but which really installs BackOrifice.
      
      How do I prevent having BO2K installed on my machine?
      
      You don't need to take any extraordinary precautions.  Just follow normal safe computing practices:

      o Never share your password, and always lock your computer when you walk away from it.
      o Never run software from untrusted sources.
      o Always keep your anti-virus and other security software up to date.
      
      If it's on my machine, how do I get it off?

      The makers of anti-virus and intrusion detection software are standing by awaiting its release, and are poised to 
      quickly develop software that will detect and remove BO2K.  Microsoft is working closely with them to assist in this 
      process.  When BO2K's predecessor was released, defenses were available within days, and the same is likely to happen
      with this release.

      Does BO2K exploit any security vulnerabilities in Windows or Windows&nbsp;NT?
      
      No.  Programs like BO2K could be written for any operating system; this one just happens to have been written to run 
      on Windows and Windows&nbsp;NT.  On any operating system, if you choose to run a program, it can do whatever you can
      do.  And if you can be tricked into running a destructive piece of software, it can abuse that capability by erasing 
      data, changing information, or allowing someone else to give it commands.

      Trojan horse software doesn't target technology, it targets the user.  If BackOrifice did in fact exploit security 
      vulnerabilities in Windows or Windows&nbsp;NT, Microsoft would promptly fix the vulnerability, and BackOrifice would 
      be stopped.  Instead, the makers of BackOrifice realized it is easier to target people and trick them into running 
      harmful software than it is to target the technology.

      Is BO2K like the Melissa virus?
      
      Only in the sense that both were Trojan horse programs that performed malicious actions, and neither exploited any 
      security vulnerabilities in Microsoft products.

      What is Microsoft doing about BO2K?

      o Microsoft is closely monitoring the situation, and is committed to helping customers have a safe, enjoyable computing
        experience.

      o Microsoft security experts are standing by, and when the software is released, they will determine exactly how it works
        and what measures can be taken to protect against it
      o Microsoft has worked with other members of the security community&#151;especially anti-virus vendors, intrusion detection
        software vendors, and makers of mobile code security products&#151;and is working closely to ensure that software to detect
        and remove BO2K is available as soon as possible.
      o Microsoft will provide information to customers about the program as more details are known.

      New and improved Back
      Orifice targets Windows NT 

      July 7, 1999
      Web posted at: 10:36 a.m. EDT (1436 GMT)

      by Tom Spring 

      (IDG) -- In the consumer world, folks like Ralph Nader fight for consumer rights by
      helping pass tough consumer protection laws. Then there's the PC world. For us, there's
      a  self-proclaimed equivalent:Groups of (mostly teenaged) Hackers basking in the glow of
      computer monitors, who release nasty computer bugs under the guise of strong-arming software
      makers to get tough on privacy and security. 

      "We want to raise awareness
      to the vulnerabilities that exist within the Windows operating system. We
      believe the best way to do this is by pointing out its weaknesses," says a
      member of the hacker group the Cult of the Dead Cow who goes by the
      pseudonym Sir Dystic. 

      The Cult of the Dead Cow created and released the program Back Orifice
      last year to the general public at the Las Vegas hacker and security
      conference DEF CON. The program allows its users to remotely control
      victims' desktops, potentially undetected. 

      At this year's conference, on July 9, Sir Dystic says the cult will outdo itself
      and release Back Orifice 2000. The program, he says, is smaller, nimbler,
      and twice as nefarious. 

      Computer security experts question the Cult of the Dead Cow's intent. Releasing a
      hacking tool like Back Orifice 2000 in the name of safeguarding computer privacy is a
      bit like the American Medical Association infecting cattle with the deadly e. coli bacteria
      to inspire food companies to sell healthier meats. 

      New and Improved

      Unlike earlier versions that affected consumers and small businesses, Back
      Orifice 2000 hits large organizations because it runs on Windows NT systems, which are
      more used by businesses. Also, the updated program is modular, so users can add
      additional functions. For example, they could hide files or activate a computer's microphone
      for real-time audio monitoring, according to Cult of the Dead Cow. 

      Back Orifice 2000 will also be more difficult to detect via network monitoring programs,
      according to Sir Dystic. This is because the program can communicate back
      to the sender by using a variety of different protocols, making it hard to
      identify. The group also says it will make the source code available for Back
      Orifice 2000, which will likely spawn multiple strains of the program in the
      hacker community, experts say. 

      Another purported function is real-time keystroke-logging, which can record
      and transmit a record of every keystroke of an infected computer. Also, the
      recipient can view the desktop of a targeted computer in real time. 

      It should be noted that PC World Online has no independent confirmation
      that new Back Orifice 2000 program actually lives up to the claims of Cult
      of the Dead Cow. 
      
      (hahahaha - nice story, harumph - Ed)
      
      
      NAI Provides Detection Utility 


      contributed by nvirB 
      Network Associates is claiming that they have already
      written a detection utility. This utility claims to be able
      to detect if BO2K is running on your system and is part
      of the NAI Total Virus Defense Suite. 

      A statement released by cDc says that "While Network
      Associates (and other AV vendors) may well protect
      against the specific version of BO2K released at Defcon,
      cDc has said all along that we expect untold mutations
      of the software to be created in a matter of days, and
      seriously doubt they will be able to provide effective
      detection (for all of them)." 

      Network Associates
      http://www.networkassociates.com/asp_set/anti_virus/introduction/back_orifice.asp
      
      SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 10, 1999  Network
     Associates (Nasdaq: NETA) Anti-Virus Emergency
     Response Team (AVERT), a division of NAI Labs,
     today advised computer users and network
     administrators to protect their PCs against a new
     Trojan horse called Back Orifice 2000.  Released
     into the wild today, Back Orifice 2000 allows
     hackers to take control of a persons PC over the
     Internet, but only if the victim has been tricked into
     installing the Back Orifice software on the local
     machine. Users who click on an infected email
     attachment enable the Back Orifice installation, thus
     placing all control over their PCs into the remote
     hackers hands.  Network Associates is the first
     anti-virus vendor to make available comprehensive
     protection against the Trojan: the complete Total
     Virus Defense line of virus security products has
     been updated to detect the new Back Orifice
     software in email attachments, and its CyberCop
     intrusion detection products will be automatically
     updated to check for the Back Orifice client
     throughout a network of machines.  

     Symptoms:      

     Back Orifice 2000, the latest in a string of Remote
     Access Trojans (RATs), is a Windows 9x and NT
     program that acts as a hack tool.  When executed,
     Back Orifice turns a users system into an open
     client, giving virtually unlimited remote access to the
     system over the Internet.  Anyone remotely running
     the other half of the Back Orifice software can then
     control the users computer to do anything they
     could do while sitting in front of it, including reading
     and/or deleting all files on the computer. Back
     Orifice 2000 is virtually undetectable by the user,
     and has been reported as spreading via several
     benign email attachments such as screen savers. 

     Pathology: 

     Back Orifices qualities are ever-changing, the result
     of it being open source code released at a hacker
     convention. 

     Risk Assessment: 

     Though Back Orifice 2000 is not technically a virus
     because it does not self-replicate or propagate, it
     has been assessed as a Medium threat by
     Network Associates AVERT risk assessment
     team.  This assessment is due to Back Orifices
     destructive qualities, wide exposure, and availability,
     balanced by relatively few outbreaks at customer
     sites and widespread advance notice of the threat.  

     Cure: 

     Detection and cleaning for the Back Orifice 2000
     Trojan horse is now included in Network Associates
     Total Virus Defense suite and will soon be included
     in CyberCop Scanner via Network Associates
     AutoUpdate feature. To avoid the risk of contracting
     Back Orifice, it is recommended that network
     administrators and users upgrade to the latest
     version of their Network Associates anti-virus
     software.  The most recent protection is available on
     Network Associates website. 

     With headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Network
     Associates, Inc. is dedicated to providing leading
     enterprise network security and management

     What Do Hackers Really Want? 

     It's hard to get a clear picture of what the hackers who met at DefCon in Las Vegas
     over the weekend really wanted. Matt Richtel's New York Times report on the
     drumming of a National Security Council senior director indicated that they wanted
     the government to be more careful in securing its own Web sites. But they also
     wanted to hack into those sites. Oh, and they don't want the government to rely on
     Microsoft (MSFT) software to protect those sites. 

     Bruce Meyerson's AP report in the Washington Post said that members of the
     Cult of the Dead Cow released the cracking software Back Orifice 2000 because they
     wanted to expose security flaws in Microsoft Windows NT software so that Microsoft
     could fix it - presumably so that Microsoft's customers could feel more secure. 

     So ... some hackers want Microsoft's customers to be more secure, while other
     hackers don't want the government to use any Microsoft software. 

     Bob Sullivan's report on MSNBC suggested that they wanted to get together to share
     knowledge about how to commit crimes that none of them will ever actually perpetrate.
     Polly Sprenger's report for Wired suggested that they wanted to get together to watch
     teenage dancers, or maybe to settle online grudges by fighting them out in inflatable
     sumo-wrestler costumes. The Wall Street Journal headlined its Web and print editions
     with a come-on about feds and recruiters invading the conference. But instead of
     summer-movie-like action, John Simons' account yawned over routine conference
     activities: seminars, panels and talking heads. Make that talking feds. Simons
     reported that DefCon organizers regularly broke into panel discussions for a rollicking
     game of "Spot the Fed," which invited attendees to pick out the ubiquitous
     undercover agent in the audience. Winners - both the eagle-eyed attendee and the
     bagged agent - got T-shirts. 

     Sounded like a pretty regular convention, once you got past the black T-shirts and
     tattoos of circuitry. But the real story may happen this week as NT administrators
     watch for evidence of damage from the harmful new program, nicknamed BO2K. If it
     hits hard, the hackers will have proven their point. Which is, well ... something about
     Microsoft.

      Hackers Take Microsoft to School
      
     The makers of BackOrifice 2000, one of the
     most powerful hacker tools ever released,
     claim it's for our own good

     FROM WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 1999
     It's the kind of thing bellboys have nightmares about 
     an entire hotel full of hackers, messing with the
     computers, screwing up the phones and generally
     raising hell. That's the scene at DEF CON, an annual
     hacker convention held at the Alexis Park Hotel in Las
     Vegas. At last year's DEF CON a hacker group called
     the Cult of the Dead Cow released a program called
     BackOrifice that can completely take control of a
     computer over the Internet. This Friday DEF CON 1999
     kicks off, and the Cult of the Dead Cow is back with a
     new version of BackOrifice that's more dangerous than
     ever. Should we be grateful?

                 A little disingenuously, the Cult of the
                 Dead Cow released the original
                 BackOrifice as "a remote
                 administration tool," a simple way of
     operating a computer running Windows 95 or 98 from a
     distance over an ordinary Internet connection. While
     it's possible to imagine scenarios in which having that
     kind of power would be useful  and there are
     legitimate applications that perform similar functions 
     such a tool is obviously very much open to abuse.
     Say, for example, allowing a hacker (or, as malicious
     hackers are sometimes called, a cracker) to take over
     a machine, read your personal information, send e-mail
     under your name and then erase your hard drive.
     Fortunately, BackOrifice has certain weaknesses. It
     can only take over machines on which BackOrifice has
     actually been installed, and once installed, it's not that
     hard to detect and remove.

     According to its creators, the new version of
     BackOrifice slated for release on Saturday is more
     powerful than ever. It's tougher to detect, gives the user
     a greater degree of control over the infected computer,
     and works on Windows NT, the heavy-duty version of
     Windows used by most large businesses. While the
     original version of BackOrifice was a threat to small
     businesses and private users, BackOrifice 2000, as it's
     called, will affect a much broader and more vital sector
     of the world's computers.



     So why does the Cult of the Dead Cow claim they're
     doing it all for our own good  and why do some
     computer programmers agree? To quote from the
     Cult's press release, "BackOrifice 2000 could bring
     pressure on [Microsoft] to finally implement a security
     model in their Windows operating system. Failure to
     do so would leave customers vulnerable to malicious
     attacks from crackers using tools that exploit
     Windows' breezy defenses." In other words, don't
     blame us, blame Microsoft for making a shoddy
     product  now maybe they'll improve it. As one poster
     on a hacking bulletin board wrote, "I feel better
     knowing that at least these holes will be known
     publicly and raise some sense of awareness rather
     than in a closed private environment where exploitation
     could continue unfettered."

     Not everybody agrees, but you can bet that Microsoft
      currently at work on a new version of Windows
     largely based on NT  will be downloading a copy of
     BackOrifice 2000 and studying it closely. As the Cult
     of the Dead Cow  which claims to be one of the few
     hacker groups out there to include a female member
      puts it, "Information is a virus. And we intend to
     infect all of you."

     L0pht Heavy Industries announced at Defcon a
     revolutionary new proactive tool that will assist IT
     Managers in protecting their networks. Antisniff will be
     able to scan for NIC cards that have been placed into
     promiscuous mode. While this will enable Admins to
     determine what machine may have been compromised it
     will also allow intruders to find a company's IDS system.
     L0pht will release full details on how this product works
     to the public in the form of a white paper. They hope to
     have the white paper and the software ready to
     distribute within a few weeks.

     Hacker Think Tank To Unleash Anti-Sniff
     Tools

     Filed at 9:31 a.m. EDT

     By Rutrell Yasin for InternetWeek, CMPnet

     A Boston-based hacker think tank on Friday will
     unveil software that can detect whether or not
     Sniffer-type analyzers are being used to probe
     enterprise networks.

     L0pht Heavy Industries will introduce AntiSniff
     1.0 at DefCon, an annual hackers' convention.

     A typical way for hackers -- both black-hat and
     ethical -- to gain access to an organization's
     network is to use analyzers that can sniff or probe for passwords for
     networked systems.

     While many scanning tools can probe networks to expose potential
     vulnerabilities, they don't give IT managers a clear sense of whether or
     not systems have been compromised or broken into, said L0pht's chief
     scientist, who goes by the name Mudge.

     AntiSniff is designed to help IT managers be more proactive in thwarting
     security threats, Mudge told a gathering of security managers and experts
     today at The Black Hat Briefings.

     "Don't play reactive," Mudge said. "There are new ways to look for [new
     attack] patterns."

     L0pht said it plans to release all technical details for AntiSniff to the
     public .

     But the monitoring software carries a doubled-edge sword.

     While it can be used by "good guys" to thwart network intruders, it can
     also be used by the "bad guys" to sniff out a company's network intrusion
     systems, Mudge said.

      Security expert blasts shoddy software
      By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
      July 8, 1999 2:00 PM PT
      URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2290399,00.html
      
      LAS VEGAS -- Security experts and so-called "white-hat" hackers meeting at the Black Hat
      Security Conference lambasted current corporate security and the companies that make security
      products that are anything but. 
      
      "Do hackers have root [control] of all your systems? Well, yes, they do," said Mudge (an
      old-school hacker who does not give out his real name), the head of L0pht Heavy Industries -- a
      collection of hackers bent on improving the Internet's security -- during a Thursday keynote. The
      security "firm" accepts contracts from companies to break into systems as well as to write security
      products. 
      
                            Mudge's comments hit on a common theme at security conferences --
                            that, in the rush to beat competitors to market, product security plays
                            second fiddle to adding new (and possibly insecure) features. 
      
                            The solution: Don't let software vendors hide behind licenses that
                            stipulate that software is sold "as is." 
      
                            Liability the key
      "We need to hold all these software vendors liable," said Mudge. "But as soon as you say the
      word 'liability,' software lobbyists hit Washington to prevent any legislation." Instead, the security
      world needs to design incentives for software makers to test and certify their security, he said. 
      
      Mudge testified in front of the Senate last year to garner support for better security and to criticize
      the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was a piece of legislation that would have had the
      unintended consequence of making it illegal to test security products. 
      
      Rebecca Bace, president of security penetration testing firm Infidel Inc., agreed with his criticism
      of the software industry. "We really need methods to push for software quality," she said. She
      pointed out examples of major security flaws in many products from Microsoft Corp.
      (Nasdaq:MSFT), including SiteServer 3.0, Windows NT and demo code that ships with IIS 4.0. 
      
      Microsoft a popular topic
      In fact, pounding on Microsoft's insecurities became a common theme at the conference as well. 
      
      On Wednesday, Mudge and noted cryptographer Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane
      systems, published a paper critical of Microsoft's software for creating virtual private networks.
      VPNs use encryption to create secure channels across insecure networks like the Internet. 
      
      However, Microsoft's protocol -- known as PPTP and included free with Windows NT --
      creates virtual private networks that can be hacked, said both Mudge and Schneier. 
      
      "If security actually matters, (Microsoft's product) is unacceptable," said Schneier, who is
      frequently contacted by companies to test the security of encryption software. 
      
      A year ago, Mudge and Schneier released a paper on the original Microsoft PPTP software. At
      that time, Schneier called Microsoft "security charlatans" and pointed out that the encrypted
      network created by the software could be easily broken. 
      
      Schneier: PPTP 'sucks less'
      Today, the situation is a bit better, he admitted, adding that Microsoft fixed the most major issues.
      "It sucks less," he said. "Before you had something that was completely broken, but now it's a bit
      better." 
      
      Microsoft could not be reached for comment by press time. However, a Microsoft Network
      administrator at the conference, who asked to remain anonymous, pointed out that other operating
      systems have just as many problems. 
      
      "Every distribution of Linux, and Sun's Solaris, have all had just as many security holes," he said,
      adding that like Windows 2000's much-criticized code bloat (it's up to 40 million lines), Linux and
      Solaris have been growing bigger. 
      
      During his keynote, Mudge relented to some degree as well. "I use Microsoft as an example,
      because everyone knows them," he said. "Others have these problems as well." 
      
      Until we get them fixed, we can look forward to more break-ins, Web defacements, and perhaps
      worst of all, viruses, said Infidel's Bace. "Melissa and ExploreZip only begin to scratch the tip of
      the iceberg," she said.

                   SECURITY FLAWS FOUND IN MICROSOFT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF
                                POINT-TO-POINT-TUNNELING PROTOCOL (PPTP)
      
            Companies using Microsoft products to implement their Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may find that their networks are not so private
      
      MINNEAPOLIS, MN, June 1, 1998. Counterpane Systems today announced that it has discovered flaws in Microsoft's implementation of a communications
      protocol used in many commercial VPNs. These flaws lead to password compromise, disclosure of private information, and server inoperability in VPNs running
      under Windows NT and 95. 
      
      "PPTP is an Internet protocol designed to provide the security needed to create and maintain a VPN over a public Transmission Control Protocol/Interface Protocol
      (TCP/IP) network. This raises serious concerns as most commercial products use Microsoft's Windows NT version of the protocol. While no flaws were found in
      PPTP itself, several serious flaws were found in the Microsoft implementation of it. 
      
      "Microsoft's implementation is seriously flawed on several levels," according to Bruce Schneier, President of Counterpane Systems. "It uses weak authentication and
      poor encryption. For example, they use the user's password as an encryption key instead of using any of the well-known and more secure alternatives," explained
      Schneier. 
      
      "VPN implementations using PPTP products require management control software at both ends of the tunnel, as well as a cryptographic analysis of the system," said
      Wray West, Chief Technology Officer of Indus River Networks, a supplier of remote access VPNs. "Most implementors do not have the specific in-house
      cryptographic expertise to discern the subtleties that are often the root of security breaches in today's commercial servers. They rely on their vendors and information
      security providers to build robust, secured products," observed West. 
      
      According to the team that did the cryptanalysis, there are at least five major flaws in this implementation. They are: 
      
           password hashing -- weak algorithms allow eavesdroppers to learn the user's password 
           Challenge/Reply Authentication Protocol -- a design flaw allows an attacker to masquerade as the server 
           encryption -- implementation mistakes allow encrypted data to be recovered 
           encryption key -- common passwords yield breakable keys, even for 128-bit encryption 
           control channel -- unauthenticated messages let attackers crash PPTP servers 
      
      A host of additional attacks were identified including bit flipping, packet resynchronization, passive monitoring of Microsoft's PPTP, and PPP (point-to-point
      protocol) packet negotiation spoofingall further compromise the intended security of any VPN. The cryptanalysis work on Microsoft's implementation of PPTP
      was conducted by Bruce Schneier of Counterpane Systems and expert hacker Peter Mudge. 
      
      According to Mark Chen, CTO of VeriGuard, Inc, a Menlo Park based computer security company, "The flaws in this implementation are quite amateurish." Chen
      continued, "A competent cryptographic review would have prevented the product from shipping in this form." 
      
      "This should serve as a caution to VPN implementors and users," said David Wagner, graduate student of University of California at Berkeley. "There are a lot of
      corporate security officers out there who will be very glad the 'good guys' found this first," continued Wagner. Last year, Wagner, along with Bruce Schneier and
      John Kelsey of Counterpane Systems, discovered a major flaw in the privacy protection used in cell phones. 
      
      Counterpane Systems is a Minneapolis, MN-based consulting firm providing expert consulting in cryptography and computer security issues. The firm has consulted
      for clients on five continents. Counterpane's president, Bruce Schneier, invented the Blowfish encryption algorithm, which remains unbroken after almost four years
      of public testing. Blowfish has been incorporated into dozens of products, including Symantec's Your Eyes Only and McAfee's PCCrypto. Schneier is also the
      author of five books on cryptography and computer security, including Applied Cryptography, the definitive work in this field. He has written dozens of magazine
      articles, presented papers at major international conferences, and lectured widely on cryptography, computer security, and privacy.

      Hackers attack their own kind 
     By Tim Clark
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     July 9, 1999, 4:25 p.m. PT 

     update On the opening day of its annual hacker convention in Las Vegas, somebody hacked DefCon's Web site. 

     Instead of describing DefCon's seventh annual "computer underground party for hackers," the bogus page declared the show had
     been taken over by the ADM Crew and renamed to ADM Con. 

     "Can't make it to DefCon?" reads one entry. "No problem, Delta Airlines is willing to sell you expensive business class tickets for
     twice their value." 

     Jeff Moss, creator and producer of the DefCon event, took the hack good-naturedly. 

     "It's funny, it happens, I'm an unhappy client [of the service that hosts the page]", Moss told a press conference late this
     afternoon. "All we can tell is that ADM is a European hacker group. They weren't very malicious, they were cracking jokes and
     zapping me because the conference was held at place they couldn't come to." 

     The hacked page also spoofs the most anticipated news from the real event, tomorrow's scheduled release of a new version of
     Back Orifice. 

     "Cult of the Dead Cow will announces [sic] new remote administration tools for kids!" the bogus site claims. Back Orifice is a
     potentially destructive Trojan horse for opening security holes in computer networks running Microsoft's Windows NT operating
     systems. 

     "The president and vice president will be there for autographs and more," according to the hacked page, which links to the official
     White House Web site. 

     So far no one has publicly claimed responsibility for the hack, but a note in the page's HTML source reads: "This is an
     anonymous member of the ADM Crew. Well, I couldn't make it to DefCon this year, you know how expensive everything is these
     days...so sorry, but it looks like revamping this site was really too tempting for me." 

     The author adds what he or she calls the ADM motto: "You're lucky we're whitehats," which is a reference to being "friendly," not
     nefarious, hackers. There's also a hint of a German connection, citing the private annual ADM party in Berlin August 6 to 8. 

     A time stamp on the page indicates the hack was posted around 12:45 p.m. PT. As of 5:30 p.m. PT, the hacked version
     remained in place. 

     Moss said the hackers broke into the DefCon page about two weeks ago and compromised the Web server at the commercial
     hosting service where DefCon has had its page for five years. But the page wasn't changed until today. 

     "I'm not quite sure how it happened," Moss added, saying he was busy protecting the Web site for a parallel Black Hat show that
     just ended and didn't guard his own site. 

     The hacked ADM Con page indicates it will soon be mirrored at Attrition.org's hacked Web pages archive, to be retained for
     posterity.

      Kevin Mitnick had been scheduled to be sentenced on
      July 12th. That hearing has now been postponed until
      July 26th. The issue is restitution. The prosecution
      wants $1.5 million while the defense wants $5,000. The
      defense claims that there is no way that Kevin will be
      able to earn 1.5mil, especially since he will be banned
      from touching a computer.

      Mitnick sentencing postponed
      LOS ANGELES -- The sentencing of convicted hacker Kevin Mitnick was postponed until Monday July 26,
      after talks broke down on the issue of restitution. The government is asking for Mitnick to be 
      responsible for restitution on the order of $1.5 million, while the defense is asking for payments 
      on the order of $5,000, based on his projected earnings potential during his supervised release. He
      will not be able to use a computer during that three year-period. -- Kevin Poulsen, ZDNN

      Active Server 
      A collection of server-side tecdhnologies that are delivered with Windows
      NT. These technologies provide a consistent server-side component and
      scripting model and an integrated set of system services for component
      application management, database access, transactions, and messaging. 
      ADO 
      Active Data Object. A set of object-based data access interfaces optimized
      for Internet-based, data centric applications. ADO is based on a published
      specification and is included with Microsoft Internet Information Server and
      Microsoft Visual InterDev. 
      ASP 
      Active Server Pages. A Server side scripting enviorment that runs ActiveX
      scripts and ActiveX components on a server. Developers can combine
      scripts and components to create Web-based applications. 
      CGI 
      Common Gateway Interface script. A program that allows a server to
      communicate with users on the Internet. For example, when a user enters
      information in a form on a Web page, a CGI script interpets the information
      and communications it to a database program on the server. 
      COM 
      Component Object Model. The object-oriented programming model that
      defines how objects interact within a single application or between
      applications. In COM, client software accesses an object through a pointer
      to an interface--a related set of funcations called methods--on objects.

      Data Access Object. 
      DNS 
      Domain Name System. A protocol and system used throughout the Internet
      to map Internet Protocal (IP) addresses to user-friendly names. Sometimes
      referred to as the BIND service in BSD UNIX, DNS offers a static,
      hierarchical name service for TCP/IP hosts. The network administrator
      configures the DNS with a list of host names and IP addresses allowing

      MSNBC;
      
      Should you care about DEF CON?
               Its more than fun, games, and irreverence; 
               hacker convention offers up annual warning
                                                                      MSNBC

               July 12  You might be inclined to dismiss last
               weekends DEF CON conference as a collection of
               angst-ridden, troublemaking youths. And many of
               the hackers will help you to that conclusion  the
               extremist positions, the relentless electronic
               pranking, the irreverent insults, the blue hair. But
               make no mistake: These are not adolescent punk
               rockers who will soon grow out of a phase and go
               to work for IBM. Scratch below the surface, and
               youll find a crowd of geniuses, many playing the
               part of guardian angel of the information age.
               Ignore them, and their anything-but-sugar-coated
               message, at your own peril.
               
                     WE ALL KNOW that using the Internet you can
     connect to information on computers all around the world.
     But that also means almost any computer around the world
     can connect to you. Feel invaded? This is just the beginning.
     Soon, your pager, your cell phone, your VCR, your car, your
     watch  theyll all be connected. And that means they can
     all be invaded.
            Computer security isnt sexy, and it doesnt sell, but
     someday youll think about it as much as you think about
     locking the front door. 
            Its already that important to hackers, who live and
     breathe computer security. Their ranks run a confusing
     continuum from stodgy, conservative Army M.P. types who
     would never hurt a fly unless ordered, to reckless geniuses
     who aim to steal thousands of credit card numbers. For the
     record, hackers like to call those who engage in criminal
     activity crackers and reserve the term hacker for
     well-intentioned people out only to find out how things work.
     Careful how you use those terms; hackers now have the
     hypervigilance of any extremist special interest group. 


           In between the two extremes are several shades of
     gray, such as:
       Groups that hunt for computer vulnerabilities, then publish
     them to embarrass software companies such as Microsoft
     into fixing their products. 
       Groups that write tools to enable well-intentioned and
     ill-minded hackers alike, such as the Cult of the Dead Cow
     and its Back Orifice product. 
       Groups that perform criminal but relatively harmless
     hacks, such as defacing a Web page.
            All these groups find their home once a year at DEF
     CON.
            They dressed in black, swallowed caffeine straight (at
     least I think it was caffeine), stayed up all night, talked about
     rebellion a lot, held hacking competitions and tried to keep
     each other from breaking too many things. 
            Most of the attention was centered on the release of
     Back Orifice 2000, the best publicity stunt in the history of
     hacking. As far as the general public is concerned,
     platitudes aside, BO is a bad thing. That only reinforces the
     image of hackers as bad people, teen-agers bent on
     destruction, geniuses gone bad, screwing with the worlds
     information infrastructure. They could steal your credit card,
     filch money from your bank account, even start a cyberwar.
     Advertisement


           This image is unfortunate and serves to obscure the
     very real issues hackers seek to expose. It isnt necessarily
     wrong; just incomplete. Let me try to fill it in.
            
     HACKERS IN REAL LIFE
            When hes not at DEF CON, HackerDudes hair isnt
     blue. And far from being reckless and emotionally unstable,
     HackerDude is Bill Smith, overly fastidious network
     administrator at Newbie Inc. Newbies 500 employees,
     whose job is to sell Plexiglass, hate computers. They get
     frustrated when computers crash, lose data, or when theyre
     hard to use. And so Newbie workers tend to be careless.
     They put their login password on a sticky note on their
     computer monitor. They put their corporate computer
     dial-in number on a notebook and leave it in a hotel room.
            Mr. Smith, or HackerDude, cant stand this. Its his
     job to keep Newbies computers safe; that makes Newbie
     Inc. employees the enemy. 
            Meanwhile, employees think Mr. Smith is just an
     annoying Nervous Nellie, or even an obstacle. 
            And so the network administrator goes on preaching
     and getting frustrated. He can only pick up after his clients
     mistakes for so long. He knows someone out there with bad
     intentions will eventually break in, with disastrous
     consequences, and hell lose his job  in fact, a white hat
     hack, which exposes the vulnerabilities but doesnt result in
     any damage or theft, might be the best thing that could
     happen. 
            Hes unpopular, annoying and preaching a religion no
     one wants to hear. 

     
            Cut to Vegas in the summer: 3,000 like-minded
     computer security nuts  some hackers, some crackers,
     some in between. But all of them have a respect for
     technology, they share in the extreme rhetoric of free
     speech, and none of them leaves his password on sticky
     notes (OK, almost none of them). And they all hate stupid
     people, or put more elegantly, the fact that graphic
     interfaces have tricked people into thinking computers are
     easier and safer to use than they really are.
            At DEF CON, for perhaps the only time all year, Mr.
     Smith, a.k.a. HackerDude, doesnt feel alone. 
            
     THEIR MESSAGE
            See, theres one thing everyone in the security business
      hackers, crackers, virus writers, anti-virus companies:
     Security doesnt sell. Regular computer users are annoyed
     by logins and passwords, by firewalls, by extra dialog
     boxes. In the battle of security vs. features, in the consumer
     marketplace, security always loses. 
            This is sacrilege to a hacker, who knows whats
     possible, just like its sacrilege for a doctor to watch
     someone leave a public bathroom without washing their
     hands.
            But hackers take no Hippocratic oath (the physicians
     pledge to do no harm, respect privacy, etc.), and they have
     discovered that while one e-mail complaint to Microsoft
     might get little attention, defacing a government Web page
     can garner a front-page story. So armed with
     self-righteousness, an extra helping of sarcasm, caffeine,
     free time and sometimes good intentions, they set out to
     break things to force other companies to fix them.
            
     WHAT THEY DO AT DEFCON
            At DEF CON, sure, youll hear seminars on the
     simplest ways to bring down a Web server (and almost
     constant giggling with each PowerPoint slide). But youll
     also hear from law enforcement agencies (and even the
     White House), which have learned to take hacker groups
     seriously. 
            Like all conferences, youll hear a lot of
     locker-room-style banter about the years dirtiest deeds. 
            But talk to the right people, and youll get an earful
     from groups such as L0pht Heavy Industries, trying to raise
     awareness that the most devastating hacks are inside jobs,
     even though silly Web page defacements get all the
     attention. 
            Even the Cult of the Dead Cow, which does its best to
     maintain its reckless, bad boy image in public, has a softer
     side. Sir Dystic, author of the original Back Orifice, is
     working on a tool called CDC Protector that will allow Net
     users to execute Trojan horse programs without threat of
     infecting their machines. The Trojan will be quarantined in
     its own memory space. 
            Of course, it got little of the attention that Back Orifice
     2000 received at DEF CON. Why? The raucous release
     ceremony, the cult following, the chance to flog Microsoft in
     public are just too irresistible for the group. (This is just so
     much fun, said one member to me).
            
     DONT BE CONFUSED
            I was told again and again that real criminals dont go
     to DEF CON; they dont show their faces in a place where
     they know federal agents are lurking, and they dont need to
     learn how to hack. 

            But that doesnt mean DEF CON doesnt attract those
     who live very near the edge, and that there isnt a lot of
     information handed out with a wink and a disingenuous
     disclaimer like, Dont use this for illegal purposes.
            But its just as easy to find reformed computer
     intruders, those who have grown out of the thrill of breaking
     into Web sites. This creates an uneasy tension over some
     gatherings, as the more conservative hackers slip in points
     of perspective (albeit, gently) whenever possible. Like
     Attitude Adjuster, a former virus writer who said hes
     alarmed at the power that virus writers have today.
            DEF CON is a gathering in transition, Im told. It might
     be getting too big for its britches. This year it drew perhaps
     3,000 attendees; its so large that a big Las Vegas PR firm
     was hired to usher press around  hardly the thing for an
     underground group. Theres even been a bit of an
     embarrassment for the Cult of the Dead Cow  48 hours
     after the release ceremony, the tool wasnt available on the
     groups Web site. Copies of it were being distributed
     around the Net, but at least some are infected with the CIH
     virus.
            
     NOT ALL BAD OR ALL GOOD
            Just like in real life, all hackers arent bad, or good, or
     neutral. But they are smart, often annoying, theyre starting
     to get our attention, and they do have an important message:
     neglect computer security, and something bad will eventually
     happen to you. 
     
        They might even be the ones to do it.

     National centre planned to fight computer hackers
     Manitoba leads bid to protect nation's networks

     RICHARD MACKIE
     The Globe and Mail
     Monday, July 12, 1999

     Toronto -- Canadian governments plan to step up efforts to protect their computer systems against increasing
     attempts to break into them, with plans to establish a national Information Protection Centre to co-ordinate the
     defences.

     The need for the centre is growing rapidly as access to so-called hacker technology spreads and as
     governments' reliance on computers expands, said Robert Garigue, chief technology and information officer
     for Manitoba, which is leading the organization of the new centre.

     The other provinces involved in the initiative are Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.

     There is also rising pressure on governments to assure customers and citizens that the data on government
     computer systems is secure, said Scott Campbell, head of Ontario's information technology systems.

     Governments want to increase the use of computers to deliver services, he said. But potential customers "are
     saying we have to tackle the privacy issue and the security issue if we're going to fundamentally move forward
     aggressively on electronic service delivery."

     He said "no one's going to play ball" if governments can't guarantee the security of data and transactions
     delivered electronically.

     The national Information Protection Centre will also help strengthen the defences of computer systems in the
     private sector against viruses and attempts to break in to acquire data or damage the systems, Mr. Garigue
     said.

     The centre would provide a single location where those responsible for the security of individual computer
     systems could report illicit attempts to enter their systems, learn whether an attempt was part of a larger
     pattern, and obtain assistance in defending their systems.

     Its creation is the extension of an agreement among the chief information-technology officers of several
     provinces that each province should establish its own information-protection centre. The agreement was
     extended into a nationwide pact, which included the federal government, in May.

     A report by Mr. Garigue and his Manitoba officials last month marked a shift in the concept of information
     protection, making it a focus of each government's information-technology organization rather than an
     afterthought to be dealt with through technology such as virus scanners and firewalls.

     Mr. Campbell said because government computers are linked to the Internet, there would be limited benefits if
     the provinces and the federal government each had its own information-protection centre.

     "We live in a network-centred world. One security problem in one part of the country is a security problem in
     another part of the country. If something is in Alberta in the morning, it's in Ontario in the afternoon."

      Y2K panel to shift to security
 
      BY DIANE FRANK (diane_frank@fcw.com)
 
      With agencies nearing completion of fixing
      computers to avoid the Year 2000 problem, Senate
      leaders are considering shifting the focus of the
      special Year 2000 oversight committee to what
      many government officials see as the next big threat
      to government computers: security breaches and
      cyberterrorism.
 
      Since its creation in April 1998, the Senate's Special
      Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem
      has studied the impact of the Year 2000 computer
      problem on government and the private sector and
      has recommended legislation and other action.
 
      The committee has focused on the potential impact
      of computer or network failures on banking,
      transportation, utilities and other components of the
      nation's critical infrastructure.
 
      The committee chairman, Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah), and Senate Majority
      Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) recognize that security vulnerabilities in networks
      and computer systems pose a similar threat, as they are subject to attacks
      from personnel within agencies or from outside cyber-terrorists, according to
      a committee spokesman.
 
      The senators have held informal discussions about the possibility of changing
      the committee's mission when its current authority expires Feb. 29, 2000, the
      committee spokesman said.
 
      "There are several similar issues and problems that will be faced," he said.
      "The kernel of the idea was generated internally by people here at the
      committee who were examining critical infrastructure."
 
      Several high-level federal groups and organizations, including the Critical
      Infrastructure Assurance Office and the National Infrastructure Protection
      Center at the FBI, also focus on computer security and the integrity of the
      nation's infrastructure against attacks.
 
      But the government would benefit from congressional attention, said Olga
      Grkavac, executive vice president of the Information Technology Association
      of America's Enterprise Solutions Division.
 
      "There really is a link between information infrastructure [and] critical
      infrastructure in [Year 2000 and security issues] and the hearing track record
      that the committee has built up," she said. "The experience the members now
      have would be a big plus."
 
      A Senate committee would bring an extra level of discussion to what other
      groups on security and critical infrastructure around the government have
      raised because the committee could focus on policy and legal questions that
      have come up, said Dean Turner, information security analyst with
      SecurityFocus.com. "The technology is there to do these things, now the
      policy and the law have to catch up with it," he said. 
 
      It is important for the committee to look at more than just instances of World
      Wide Web site hacking, Turner said. Even though that is the phenomenon
      creating the biggest stir right now, it is the least harmful type of attack out
      there. "I think that if that's what the committee is going to focus on, then they'll
      be wasting their time," he said.
 
      Much of the committee's initial focus should be to educate government and the
      public about the need for security, said Bill Larson, chief executive officer of
      security company Network Associates Inc.
 
      "I think people do not understand in government the potential for
      cyberterrorism and the amount of havoc that can be created," Larson said.
 
      The CIO Council probably would work closely with the new security
      committee if the Senate chooses to shift the Year 2000 committee's focus,
      said Ed Caffrey, liaison for the CIO Council's Security Committee and a
      member of the State Department's Systems Integrity Division. The CIO
      Council recently expanded the focus of its Security Committee to include
      critical infrastructure and privacy. The council and its committees serve as the
      coordinators between federal and state government and the private sector,
      Caffrey said. Because the Senate committee probably would serve the same
      function, it would make sense for the two groups to work together, he said.

 18.0 Tempest Exporter Arrested

      The FBI has arrested Shalom Shaphyr, for trying to
      covertly ship van-eck/tempest interception equipment
      to Vietnam. Tempest technology is used to intercept
      emissions from computer screens or other sources from
      several feet away. This type of equipment is barred
      from export without proper licensing by International
      Traffic in Arms Regulations.

      House International Relations Committee Moves on SAFE Act
 
      7/13/99
      iDEFENSE 
      By Bill Pietrucha 
 
      The SAFE Act made it through the House International Relations Committee Tuesday afternoon, but it wasn't a completely
      safe trip. H.R. 850, the Security And Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Act, breezed by on a 33 to 5 full committee vote
      but not before being buffeted by a number of amendments diluting the bill's original intention. 
 
      As introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the SAFE Act would allow Americans to use any type of encryption
      anywhere in the world and allow any type of encryption to be sold in the United States. The bill also would provide a level
      playing field in the global marketplace by permitting the export of generally available software, hardware, and other
      encryption-related computer products. 
 
      According to Goodlatte, the legislation also would prohibit the government from mandating a back door into people's
      computer systems, and states that the use of encryption alone cannot be the basis for establishing probable cause for a criminal
      offense or a search warrant. 
 
      "Encryption products are the deadbolt locks of the 21st century," Goodlatte said, "This important data scrambling technology
      safeguards our privacy in the digital age, making electronic commerce viable and preventing online crime. The American
      people deserve to have the strongest encryption technology available to protect themselves in the Information Age." 
 
      But International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) managed to water down the bill, attaching and
      agreeing to a number of amendments. 
 
      Declaring the amendments would put the "safe" back into the SAFE Act, Gilman approved an amendment that would require
      consultations between the Commerce Secretary, the FBI director and the Drug Enforcement Agency top honcho before
      approving encryption exports to "any major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing country." 
 
      Gilman also approved other amendments prohibiting encryption product export if evidence existed that implicated the software
      in child abuse or child pornograpjhy activities, and extending the export license review period from 15 days to 30 days.

      FAIRFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- A
      6-year-old boy who slipped
      away from his day care center
      managed to hot-wire a toy
      vehicle and drive it for a mile
      along a bustling state highway,
      authorities said. 

      An alarmed motorist called police to say she was stunned to see little John T.
      Carpenter piloting the toy alongside regular-sized vehicles just outside
      Cincinnati. 

      Authorities said they were investigating how John got away from Kiddie
      Kampus Pre-School and Day Care Center on Friday. Police said his
      disappearance went undetected until officers contacted the center more than
      an hour later. 

      The boy apparently wandered away from the center, then came upon a mini
      Monster truck-type toy parked outside ReRuns for Wee Ones, a children's
      resale shop. 

      "I had the wires unhooked so no one could ride off in it, but he reconnected
      the wires without anyone seeing him, took off the price tag and rode away,"
      co-owner Trisha Taylor said Monday. 

      "I was just floored. I couldn't believe it. This kid is only 6, and he had to
      have lifted up that hood and knew which wires to put together," Taylor said. 

      John was unhurt and police returned him to his mother. 

      The Butler County Children Services Board said it will investigate and
      determine what action might be needed at Kiddie Kampus, said Jon Allen, a
      spokesman for the Ohio Department of Human Services. 

      An employee of Kiddie Kampus declined comment to The Cincinnati
      Enquirer. The boy's mother did not return messages left by the newspaper.

      Network Associates Ships CyberCop Sting - Industry's First 'Decoy' Server
      Silently Traces and Tracks Hacker Activity
      
      CyberCop Line is First in Security Industry to Scan, Monitor And Apprehend Intruders
      
      SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Network Associates, Inc. (Nasdaq: NETA - news) today
      announced the immediate availability of its CyberCop Sting software, a new ``decoy'' server that 
      silently traces and tracks hackers, recording and reporting all intrusive activity to security 
      administrators. CyberCop Sting, an industry first, is an integral component of the CyberCop intrusion
      protection software family which also includes CyberCop Monitor, a real-time intrusion detection 
      application that monitors critical systems and networks for signs of attack (see related release) and 
      CyberCop Scanner, the industry's most highly-rated network vulnerability scanner. CyberCop Sting 
      addresses the most unfulfilled need in intrusion protection products today by allowing IS managers to
      silently monitor suspicious activity on their corporate network and identify potential problems before
      any real data is jeopardized.
      
      CyberCop Sting operates by creating a series of fictitious corporate systems on a specially outfitted 
      server that combines moderate security protection with sophisticated monitoring technology. The Sting 
      product creates a decoy, virtual TCP/IP network on a single server or workstation and can simulate a 
      network  containing several different types of network devices, including Windows NT servers, Unix servers
      and routers. Each virtual network device has a real IP address and can receive and send genuine-looking 
      packets from and to the larger network environment. Each virtual network node can also run simulated daemons,
      such as finger and FTP, to further emulate the activity of a genuine system and avoid suspicion by would-be 
      intruders. While watching all traffic destined to hosts in its virtual network, Sting performs IP fragmentation
      reassembly and TCP stream reassembly on the packets destined to these hosts, convincing snoopers of the 
      legitimacy of the secret network they've discovered.
      
      ``More than 60 percent of all security breaches are caused by authorized employees or contractors already 
       inside the firewall,'' said Wes Wasson, director of product marketing for Network Associates. ``CyberCop
       Sting gives security administrators, for the first time ever, a safe way to observe and audit potentially
      dangerous activity on their networks before it becomes a problem.''
      
      CyberCop Sting provides a number of benefits for security administrators, including: 
      
          * Detection of suspicious activity inside network; Log files serve to
            alert administrators to potential attackers prying into reserved areas.
          * Ability to record suspicious activity without sacrificing any real
            systems or protected information.
          * Virtual decoy network can contain multiple "hosts" without the expense
            and maintenance that real systems require.
          * CyberCop Sting software's virtual hosts return realistic packet
            information.
          * CyberCop Sting logs snooper activity immediately, so collection of
            information about potential attackers can occur before they leave.
          * CyberCop Sting requires very little file space but creates a
            sophisticated virtual network.
      
      
      Network Associates' CyberCop Intrusion Protection suite is a collection of integrated security tools developed
      to provide network risk assessment scanning (Scanner), real-time intrusion monitoring (Monitor) and decoy trace-
      and-track capabilities (Sting) to enhance the security and survivability of enterprise networks and systems. The 
      suite is also enhanced by the development of technology and research derived from Network Associates' extensive 
      product line, and includes industry-first features such as AutoUpdate, modular construction, and Active Security
      integration to provide extensive product integrity. A Network Associates white paper on next-generation intrusion
      detection is available at http://www.nai.com/activesecurity/files/ids.doc.
      
      Pricing and availability
      
      CyberCop Sting is free with the purchase of CyberCop Monitor, Network Associates' new real-time intrusion 
      detection software. Sting is also available as part of the full CyberCop suite, which also includes CyberCop 
      Scanner, CyberCop Monitor and the CASL Custom Scripting Toolkit. The CyberCop Intrusion Protection
      suite is priced at $17 per seat for a 1,000 user license.

      Cult of the Dead Cow confirmed Thursday that official CD-ROM versions of its controversial
      Back Orifice 2000 program are infected with the CIH virus.
      
      "There must have been a virus on the duplicating machine and we didn't know about it," cDc
      member DilDog said in a phone interview.
      
                            "This incident is unfortunate and we are doing what we can do to
                            rectify it. We can't apologize enough. 
      
                            "We screwed up," he said. 
      
                            cDc, which distributed 32 official CD-ROM versions of BO2K at the
                            DEF CON hacking convention last weekend, had previously denied
                            that its CD-ROMs were infected with Win95.CIH, a virus that
      reformats hard drives and, on some machines, can erase the BIOS information that the computer
      needs to operate. 
      
      Web version clean
      Although an embarrassing publicity snafu for the high-profile hacking group, the CIH incident
      doesn't affect cDc's method for mass distribution of BO2K -- the Web.
      
      Like its predecessor, Back Orifice, BO2K was released on the Web on Wednesday, where it is
      available for free download.
      
      PC Week Labs senior analyst Jim Rapoza, who downloaded and tested the Web-version of
      BO2K, confirmed that the Web version is virus-free. DilDog said that the Web version of the
      program is "absolutely clean." 
      
      DilDog said cDc mistakenly believed that only pirated copies of BO2K -- burned and distributed
      at DEF CON within 45 minutes of the hacking tool's splashy debut -- were infected with CIH.
      
      However, cDc changed its tuned after several anti-virus firms and ZDNN reported finding CIH on
      official CD-ROMs -- confirming that the executable files in the CD-ROM were infected.
      
      "We would like to thank various individuals profusely for pointing this out to us," DilDog said. 
      
      cDc member Count Zero, who gave ZDNN its CIH-infected BO2K CD-ROM with "Virus Free"
      written on the case, said the incident was not malicious. 
      
      "We are not perfect ... It was human error. Our error. We weren't trying to do anything
      malicious," he said. 
      
      'We do accept responsibility'
      DilDog said he couldn't explain exactly how the CD-ROMs were infected with CIH; however, it
      appears the infection occurred before DEF CON, during the duplication of the official BO2K
      CD-ROMs. 
      
      "On my way to DEF CON I burned one CD with a series of stuff I needed (including the
      executable files for BO2K). All of this stuff was scanned ... nothing contained anything bad," he
      said. "As a last minute thing, we decided to make some duplicates to hand out at DEF CON." 
      
      DilDog said he handed the master CD-ROM to a "third party ... a very trusted friend of mine"
      who burned 25 copies of BO2K, using his PC. Those copies were identified with white cDc
      labels. 
      
      "It appears that the machine that we used in the duplicates had a virus on it," DilDog said. "We do
      accept responsibility for not having scanned the final copies of the CDs, but the master from which
      they were all duplicated was scanned and had nothing on it. So it must have been one of those
      flash in the pan kind of things where we had a virus apparently on the duplication machine and we
      didnt know about it." 
      
      By DilDog's count, 22 of those infected copies were handed out during BO2K's debut on
      Saturday. Within 45 minutes of the BO2K debut, cDc began hearing reports of infected BO2K
      copies from DEF CON attendees, who already had pirated copies of the official CD-ROMs. 
      
      Both Count Zero and DilDog said they mistakenly believed that the official CD-ROMs were virus
      free, and that only the pirated copies were infected. Count Zero said he then took one of the
      remaining official CD-ROMs and, without scanning, burned another 10 official copies of BO2K.
      "My error was I assumed that the original was virus free," Count Zero said. 
      
      Count Zero labeled those 10 new versions of BO2K with cDc stickers and wrote "Virus Free --
      Count Zero" on the CD-ROMs' jewel cases. He then handed out those 10 CD-ROMs. ZDNN
      received one of those "Virus Free" copies of BO2K, which Norton's Anti-Virus found contained
      CIH. 
      
      Believing its BO2K copies were virus free, DilDog said cDc discounted initial reports of CIH
      infection. "It was only one or two days ago, I guess, that we got word from people that it was our
      CDs," he said. 
      
      Since then, DilDog said, cDc has run virus scans on all its PCs, but every machine has tested
      clean. "We are really at a loss as to how it got on there," he said. "There must have been a virus on
      the duplicating machine and we didn't know about it."

 29.0 California Golf Course Computers Attacked

      The computer systems at the Ocean Trails golf course
      on the Palos Verdes Peninsula have been broken into.
      The devestating attack wiped out files ranging from
      payroll data to email. The intruders left a message for
      developers on a company computer terminal that read,
      "Got ya . . . !"

      Golf Course Struck by Landslide Gets Hit by Hackers 
                 Crime: Vandals putter around with computer at Ocean Trails, where last
              month part of the 18th hole fell into the Pacific. 
              By JEAN MERL, Times Staff Writer


            Computer vandals have hacked their way into the computer
             system at the Ocean Trails golf course on the Palos Verdes
        Peninsula, creating another setback for the seaside luxury course
        that lost part of its 18th hole last month in a landslide. 
             The weekend vandalism, which wiped out files ranging from
        payroll data to correspondence, "is devastating," said Kenneth
        Zuckerman, one of several members of the family of longtime
        landowners who have spent almost 15 years on the project. 
             "I think all the negative publicity associated with this project has
        somehow influenced someone whose head isn't screwed on right to
        do something malicious," Zuckerman said. 
             He said the hacker, or hackers, left a message for developers on
        a company computer terminal that read, "Got ya . . . !" 
             Zuckerman said he and the company's head accountant were
        working Sunday on a computer in offices at the golf course
        construction site in Rancho Palos Verdes when "she noticed things
        just seemed to have disappeared. We contacted our service
        company and they said it looked like somebody had hacked the
        system through our Internet connection. . . . Then the message
        appeared on the screen." 
             Zuckerman said he reported the incident to the Los Angeles
        County Sheriff's Department and the FBI. Deputies at the Lomita
        sheriff's station said they took a report on Sunday and forwarded
        copies to detectives and to investigators in a special unit set up to
        investigate computer crime. 
             A spokeswoman for the FBI's local office said she could not
        comment on whether the agency has received a report or opened
        an investigation. She said, however, that any such report would be
        reviewed for a possible violation of federal law. 
             The new course, with its $200 weekend greens fees and
        breathtaking ocean views, was nearing completion when a landslide
        on June 2 sent about half the 18th hole into the Pacific; a county
        sanitary sewer line running beneath the course also broke off in the
        slide. 
             Tests are still underway to determine the cause of the slide, but it
        has generated fresh controversy over development in the area,
        which has both ancient and active landslides. 
             The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has scheduled a session
        for next Tuesday to discuss Ocean Trails. 
             Meanwhile, cracks developed in a roadway about 200 yards
        east of the course almost three weeks ago, raising further concerns
        about land stability in the area. 
             Public Works Director Dean Allison said the land beneath Palos
        Verdes Drive South--a major, scenic road on the
        peninsula--occurred with settling of a landfill beneath the road,
        which was built in the 1940s. The settling could have been caused
        by a leaking sewer line or by temporary irrigation to establish a
        newly restored native vegetation at Ocean Trails, Allison said. 
             Workers built a bypass around the faulty sewer line last week,
        the irrigation has stopped and the road has been patched, Allison
        said, adding that the city will continue to monitor the road but
        believes it has the problems solved. 
             Zuckerman, who says that the brief and light irrigation could not
        have been responsible for the roadway cracks, said the computer
        hackers made a lot of extra work for his employees but did nothing
        that will keep the course from opening. 
             "There were no secrets, nothing of value to anyone but
        ourselves, but it is a terrible thing to do to a business," Zuckerman
        said. "It means an awful lot of extra work for our already
        hard-working employees." 
             "We've bent over backwards to try to be very responsible here,
        and to have someone come along and do this is very discouraging,"
        Zuckerman said. 
             Sheriff's Det. Michael Gurzi of the department's expanding High
        Tech Crimes Detail said there has been a dramatic increase of
        incidents of computer vandalism. 
             Sometimes it is done to steal trade secrets or help with a hostile
        company takeover, but other times it is done just to inflict pain on
        the victim. 
             "If [the hackers] are not as sophisticated as they think they are,
        they can be traced," Gurzi said. "But if they really know what they
        are doing, sometimes they can disguise themselves."

 30.0 Selling Your Privacy

      From HNN http://www.hackernews.com/

      Do people want privacy or not? The most recent survey
      seems to indicate that most people are more than willing
      to give out personal information for a few trinkets,
      cents off at the grocery store or other doodads. Are
      consumers being swindled? Are they getting fair market

      Privacy? Net Users Willing to Swap Data for Freebies  
      ALICE WANG  
      c.1999 Bloomberg News 

           HACKENSACK, N.J. - Most Internet users say collecting personal information in exchange for 
      free products and services doesn't violate their privacy as long as the policies are explained, a
      new survey has found.  The survey, conducted by Privacy & American Business and Opinion search Corp., 
      found that 86 percent of the Internet users it polled support such free offers. Fifty-three percent 
      say they would participate in an information-for-benefits program, provided the company explained how
      the information would be used. Companies such as Free-PC Inc. swap products and services for
      personal information and targeted advertising. Free-PC, an idealab Company based in Pasadena, California,
      gives Compaq Computer Corp.PCs, Internet access and e-mail to customers who fill out detailed
      questionnaires that are used to determine which advertisements appear on their computer screens.
      Many companies, such as Free-PC, use the information to sell advertising. Some sell the information itself, 
      which privacy advocates find alarming.
      `Some privacy advocates consider it a `dangerous threat to Net privacy' for Web sites to offer consumers 
       free products in exchange for personal information,'' Dr. Alan Westin, head of Privacy & American Business, 
       said in a statement. Westin's survey results suggest that such concerns may be overblown.
   
      No Surprise?
     The survey's findings ``aren't surprising,'' said Steve Chadima, vice president of marketing at Free-PC.
     The closely held company has received more than 1.25 million applications for its free machines. ``People know
     what they're getting in to,'' Chadima said. The company began shipping its first 10,000 free PCs at the end of June.
     Still, 82 percent of the Internet users polled say privacy policies matter when deciding whether to trade information 
     for freebies, the survey found. Only 14 percent said privacy policies wouldn't figure into their decision, as long
     as they got the benefit.
     Some companies, including International Business Machines Corp.,have made privacy matters an issue when advertising online.
     The world's largest computer company said in March it will withdraw ads from Internet sites without policies that safeguard
     privacy in response to consumer concerns about disclosing personal information.`Our privacy policy is very, very strict,'' 
     said Free PC's Chadima. ``We never give out personal information for any reason.'' Privacy & American Business, a non-profit think tank based in
     Hackensack, New Jersey, surveyed 457 Internet users drawn from a representative sample of 1,014 adults.

35.0 CODE NAME JANUS
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     by BHZ, Saturday 17th July 1999 on 3:28 pm CET
     Microsoft will, till March 2000, release new operating system with Windows
     NT legacy - Windows 2000 Data Center Server (code name Janus). It will, as
     Microsoft officials say, be a good competitor to UNIX. Janus will have all advantages
     of UNIX, and it will have ability of transferring current job to one of other 8 processors,
     if the main one fails.

36.0 ANOTHER ONE ON BO2K
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/
     
     
     by BHZ, Saturday 17th July 1999 on 3:15 pm CET
     As ISS interpreted Back Orifice 2000 as a "child play", other security vendors, like
     Data Fellows and Symantec Anti-Virus, immediately attacked that point of view. Their
     opinion is that open source of BO2K is a very big problem. Aled Miles, general
     manager at Symantec Anti-Virus said: "Anyone who calls BO2k child's play
     misunderstands the situation. If one person gets into someone else's computer and
     steals his or her data, that is a problem. It will probably not proliferate like Melissa,
     but that is not the point." Read the article below. 
     
     Hackers: BO2K 'child's play' remark draws fire

     Computer security experts in the UK have attacked US firm, Internet Security Solutions (ISS) for describing Back Orifice 2000 (BO2K) as
     "child's play". 
    
     "That does seem a bit glib," says Paul Brette of Data Fellows Anti-Virus in the UK. "We are worried about the fact that it is open-source.
     We could see that being a big problem because polymorphic changes to the virus signature would be relatively easy to make and would
     make it more difficult to detect." 
    
     The BO2K virus was released by media-savvy hacking group Cult of the Dead Cow to coincide with the Def Con 7.0 computer security
     extravaganza held in Las Vegas last weekend. It is designed to enable remote access to Windows 95, 98 and NT operating systems. 
    
     The Cult's "Minister for Propaganda" Deth Vegetable published a press release describing BO2K as, "the most powerful application of its
     kind which puts the administrator solidly in control of any Microsoft network." 
    
     But Brette sees other reasons to be concerned by the release of BO2K, He is particularly worried by the fact that the Cult of the Dead Cow
     has been careful to remain anonymous, while giving away this "administrative tool" for free. "It makes you wonder what sort of motives they
     really have, what they could be hiding," he says. 
    
     Aled Miles, general manager at Symantec Anti-Virus believes BO2K is anything but child's play. "Anyone who calls BO2k child's play
     misunderstands the situation. If one person gets into someone else's computer and steals his or her data, that is a problem. It will probably not
     proliferate like Melissa, but that is not the point." 
    
     Strangely, Microsoft Window's Marketing Manager, Francess Fawcett, believes there is little cause for alarm, despite Symantec's reasoning.
     She believes the fact that ISS could decode it's source code in under 24 hours shows the simplicity of the program, and says they will not be
     treating it differently to any other virus." 
    
     A bizarre example of how well publicised Back Orifice has been is that ISS reportedly asked the Cult of the Dead Cow for a Beta version of
     the program. The response was that this would be supplied in return for, "one million dollars and a monster truck."

37.0 BUG IN AMAVIS VIRUS SCANNER
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     From http://www.net-security.org/  
 
     by BHZ, Saturday 17th July 1999 on 3:04 pm CET
     Chris McDonough wrote to BugTraq about a problem in AMaViS virus scanner for
     Linux (http://satan.oih.rwth-aachen.de/AMaViS). Read about the exploit below.   
     
     The AMaViS incoming-mail virus scanning utility (available at 
     http://satan.oih.rwth-aachen.de/AMaViS/) for Linux has problems.

      I tried to contact the maintainer of the package (Christian 
      Bricart) on June 26, again several times over the course of 
      the last month, but I have not received anything from him 
      and the AMaViS website does not yet acknowledge the problem 
      or provide a fix.  However, on Jun 30, co-contributors to 
      the package (Juergen Quade and Mogens Kjaer) responded 
      quickly with an acknowledgement of the problem and a few 
      fixes.  Because the co-authors do not maintain the 
      downloadable package, however, the latest downloadable 
      version of AMaViS (0.2.0-pre4 and possibly earlier) still 
      has a bug which allows remote users to send arbitrary 
      commands as root to a Linux machine running the AMaViS 
      scripts.
      
      Exploit:
      
      Send a message with a virus-infected file attachment.  Use 
      something like "`/sbin/reboot`@dummy.com" as your reply-to 
      address in your MUA when sending the message.  When the 
      AMaViS box receives the message, it will go through its 
      scripts, find the virus, construct an email message to send 
      back to the sender of the virus-infected file... line 601+ 
      in the "scanmails" script:
      
      cat <<EOF| ${mail} -s "VIRUS IN YOUR MAIL TO $7" $2
      
                         V I R U S  A L E R T
      
        Our viruschecker found a VIRUS in your email to "$7".
                 We stopped delivery of this email!
      
          Now it is on you to check your system for viruses
      
        For further information about this viruschecker see:
                     http://aachalon.de/AMaViS/
              AMaViS - A Mail Virus Scanner, licenced GPL  
      EOF
      
      ... the $2 expands to a shell command (e.g. "/sbin/reboot") 
      which runs as root.
      
      To solve it, Juergen Quade created the following diff 
      file.  It represents the difference between his "secured" 
      and "insecure" scanmails shell script file.  I solved it 
      differently, using a procmail recipe, but this will work 
      too:

38.0 E-COMMERCE IS SECURE
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     From http://www.net-security.org/  
          
     by BHZ, Saturday 17th July 1999 on 3:04 pm CET
     IT vendors, analysts and lawyers gathered in London on Thursday to create an
     advisory document for the U.K. government about spreading e-commerce business.
     The main problem is that people are not aware that their credit card number is most
     likely to be stolen in a supermarket, then on the Internet. Frederick Wilson of Lloyds
     TSB banking group said: "There is no security problem, but only one problem - people
     don't understand. We have to convince customers it is secure".

     GAO (US General Accounting Office ), released a report about Y2K situation in US
     Navy. "Failure to address the year 2000 problem in time could severely degrade or
     disrupt the Navy's day-to-day and, more importantly, mission-critical operations" - the
     report says. US Navy answered that they will use some guidelines provided to them
     by GAO (for instance mission-critical systems must be fixed by 2000).

     enhance the security of its information systems. 
     
     The Defense Information Systems Agency through the Integrated-Computer Aided Software Engineering contract has executed the final option of a DoD-wide
     license with Netscape Communications Corporation.  The Netscape license provides the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community with a site license
     for a number of Netscape server products as well as the professional version of the Netscape client software. 
     
     The Netscape software, specifically the Certificate Management System (CMS) 4.1, will be a part of the pilot DoD public key infrastructure.  The CMS 4.1 product
     provides functions such as issuing and managing digital certificates, encryption key recovery, support for Federal Information Processing Standard-compliant
     hardware cryptography, and support for the Digital Signature Standard. 
     
     The deployment of this product is part of the Department's efforts to transition to a paperless environment.  With PKI technology, DoD will be able to ensure the
     authenticity of digital signatures on contracting documents, travel vouchers, and other forms that obligate taxpayer funds, to authenticate users of information systems,
     and protect the privacy of transactions over networks.  DoD plans pilot programs in electronic commerce, as well as in the Global Command and Control and
     Combat Support Systems.  PKI technology is also employed in the Defense Travel System to assure the authenticity of electronic travel transactions.

42.0 Federal Computer Week: FBI turns on new computer crime fighting system

     FBI turns on new crime-fighting system

     BY L. SCOTT TILLETT (scott@fcw.com)

     FBI officials announced today that they have successfully rolled out a
     massive new computer system that state and local law enforcement officials
     will use to fight crime.

     The new system, the National Crime Information Center 2000 -- like the
     original NCIC, which the FBI had used since 1967 -- allows crime fighters to
     search through 17 databases when investigating crimes or questioning criminal
     suspects. The databases include information on stolen guns, deported felons,
     missing persons and stolen vehicles, for example.

     NCIC 2000 will allow law enforcement officials with special hardware and
     software to transmit suspects' fingerprints to confirm their identity and to see if
     the suspects are wanted for other crimes. It also will allow the officials to view
     mug shots to confirm identities -- a capability the original NCIC did not have.

     Law enforcement officers also can use NCIC 2000 to identify relationships
     among information in the databases. For example, under the old NCIC, if
     someone stole a car and a gun as part of the same crime and if a law
     enforcement officer later stopped the car thief on the highway, the officer
     could use the system to find out easily that the car had been stolen. But he
     would not necessarily know that the car thief might also have a stolen gun.
     NCIC 2000 shows the connection, keeping related information on a crime
     linked together, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer said.

     The new NCIC 2000 also adds name-search functionality. For example, a
     search for the name "James" would return alternate spellings, such as "Jim" or
     "Jimmy," Fischer said.

     NCIC 2000 went online after years of escalating costs and congressional
     finger-wagging. System architects originally envisioned NCIC 2000 costing
     about $80 million, but the final price was $183.2 million, Fischer said. The
     discrepancy between the original cost and the actual cost came in part
     because contractors originally were "overly ambitious" when estimating the
     project, Fischer said.

     NCIC 2000 went live on July 11, but bugs in the system, as well as FBI
     attention on the capture of suspected railroad killer Angel Maturino Resendez,
     delayed the unveiling of the system, Fischer said. He added that bugs in NCIC
     2000 were fixed by Monday evening. The bugs related to connectivity with
     the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is used for
     approving gun purchases. That system draws on NCIC 2000 and other
     databases to approve or disapprove gun purchases.

     FBI officials will hold the formal ceremony unveiling NCIC 2000 next month
     in Clarksburg, W.Va.

43.0 NMRC: Netware 5 Hijack Vulnerability 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     
     via http://www.securityportal.com/
     
     it is possible to hijack a client's NCP (Netware Core Protocol) session and
     issue calls to the NetWare server as admin. The requirements are that the connection
     is using the IPX protocol and you know the MAC address of the admin's station (In IPX,
     the station address is a concatenation of the network segment number and the MAC address)

                                    Platform : Novell Netware
                                 Application : NDS/NCP
                                    Severity : High
      
      
      Synopsis
      --------
      
      Armed with the MAC address of the Administrator, an intruder can hijack an
      Admin's session and issue NCP calls as the the Admin on Netware servers.
      
      Tested configuration
      --------------------
      
      The bug was tested with the following configuration :
      
      Novell Netware 5, Service Pack 2 (with IPX configured)
      Latest Client Software for Windows 95/98
      
      Also confirmed on Netware 4.x.
      
      Bug(s) report
      -------------
      
      This is an old bug. We reported it to Novell over a year ago, and even released
      exploit code (see http://www.nmrc.org/pandora/). Since several people had
      problems using the exploit code and Novell still hasn't corrected (to our
      satisfaction) all of the problems with Netware 5, we've updated the exploit 
      code in the new Pandora v4, which is now in beta release. While Netware/IP is
      the recommended path for Netware 5, most organizations using Netware are still
      using Novell's proprietary IPX protocol for server access. IPX is required for
      this exploit to work.
      
      In essence, IPX fragmented requests/replies (NCP call 0x68) are not signed if
      the packet signature level is not set to 3. Setting it to 3 on the server side
      is good, but if the client is set at 1, it is possible to spoof or hijack a 
      portion of the client's session. If the target client is the Admin, we can tell 
      the server to make us security equivalent to the Admin. Please refer to the 
      details at http://www.nmrc.org/pandora/ncp.txt, especially sections 6 and 
      7, which detail how the attack works.
      
      The new Pandora Online utility will simply require you insert the MAC address 
      of the Admin's workstation into a dialog box, and Pandora will handle the rest
      of the sniffing required to make the attack work. As always, placement of your
      attack box is critical:
      
      ----------    ----------    ----------   -------------
      | Admin  |    | Attack |    | Router |   | Netware 5 |
      | Client |    |  Box   |    |        |   |   Server  |
      ----------    ----------    ----------   -------------
          |             |           |    |           |
          ---------------------------    -------------
      
      So here are the steps:
      
      0. Admin client is Packet Signature Level 1, and server is Packet Signature 
      Level 3.
      1. Attack box gets Admin's MAC address, and inserts it into the Pandora
      Online tool. Attacker has the option to adjust other parameters as needed, but
      the main one is the MAC address.
      2. Admin performs actions dealing with NDS that use fragmented packets (normal 
      administrator activity will give us the needed packets quickly).
      3. Attack box sends forged request to server, making us security equivalent to 
      Admin.
      4. Netware 5 server accepts forged packets.
      5. Admin client loses connection from server as its packet sequence is now out 
      of whack.
      6. Attacker adjusts security settings for self so that the attacker has full
      access to entire tree, and removes "equal to Admin", so s/he will not show up
      on a basic "who's equiv to me" investigation by Admin.
      
      Caveats:
      
      0. This attack will fail in a switched environment since sniffing is involved.
      1. This is a race. If the Admin client beats the attacker, the attacker must try 
      again.
      2. Obviously the attacker being on the same Ethernet segment as the Admin will 
      help considerably in an attack. In theory this should work if you are anywhere 
      in between the Admin client and the server, although you will need to use the 
      MAC address of the router interface the Admin's session is coming from. At best, 
      this may not work at all, but is still theoretically possible.
      3. In theory this could be adapted to a Netware/IP environment, as Novell's 
      TCP/IP stack is vulnerable to sequence number prediction. We have not explored
      adapting Pandora exploit code over to a pure IP environment, but will explore
      this possibility in future Pandora releases.
      
      Solution/Workaround
      -------------------
      
      Use Packet Signature Level 3 everywhere, and make sure clients cannot touch 
      their own signature settings. LAN Admins should never access a server unless
      using Level 3, and the security on the workstation should be restrictive enough 
      to prevent unauthorized adjustments (i.e. use a locked-down NT client with no 
      server services running, behind a locked door, although this simply places your 
      trust in Microsoft). Use switched Ethernet.
      
      Alternately, you can ask Novell to patch things. We did our part a year ago.
      
      Comments
      --------
      
      Simple Nomad had to leave Las Vegas right after Black Hat due to a minor 
      medical emergency at home, and missed DefCon. This advisory was one of the 
      things slated to be discussed during the DefCon presentation.
      
      As stated, Novell was contacted regarding this bug in June of 1998, 13 months
      ago. We got this to work in a lab setting. YMMV.
      
      The new Pandora v4 includes all of the Pandora v3 attacks against Netware 4 
      updated to work against Netware 5. It was developed with 100% freeware libraries 
      and compilers. We are proud that this code doesn't look like a normal 95/98/NT, 
      the GUI was developed on Linux. Pandora v4 is 100% freeware. Source code is 
      freely available.
      
      We always recommend using the latest versions of Netware with the latest 
      patches, and using the maximum security settings at all times on Netware 
      servers.

44.0 CNet: IBM offers privacy consulting services 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     via http://www.securityportal.com/
     
    - IBM has developed a process, using expert tools, to help customers develop privacy policies. 
      The consulting helps match the selected privacy policy with the appropriate systems and
      technology

     IBM offers privacy consulting services 
     By Sandeep Junnarkar
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
     July 16, 1999, 6:40 a.m. PT 
     URL: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,39283,00.html 
     
     Riding the raging success of its e-commerce services, IBM today announced consulting services aimed at
     helping businesses implement privacy policies, procedures, and technology. 
     
     The services will also try to provide insight into how to build consumer trust in in the far-flung 
     networked world. 
     
     IBM's announcement comes at a time of growing concerns over privacy issues on the Internet. An increasing
     number of e-commerce sites and portals collect consumer information and many companies place employee 
     information on access-restricted sites on the Internet so individuals can manage some aspects of their
     human resource needs. 
     
     The consulting services will be part of IBM's Global Services division. At the core of the services is
     a tool-assisted methodology that shows the steps involved and the questions that need to be addressed to
     set up the right privacy policies and systems. 
     
     Analysts said the services will help users identify "hard," costs such as new systems and upgrades, and
     "soft" costs--expenses that customers hadn't considered. 
     
     Privacy services are designed to address specific customer requirements and are based on work with IBM
     researchers, global service professionals, and industry experts. IBM plans to implement policies and 
     procedures needed to protect personal information that is collected and maintained on customers and employees. 
     
     "The growth of electronic commerce depends on trust," said Gary Roboff, chairman of Banking Industry Technology
      Secretariat (BITS) Research & Planning Steering Committee, in a statement. BITS is a organization that focuses
      on privacy issues. "These new services can help companies such as banks build that trust, and show individuals
      --the customers of our customers--that they are protected by a thoughtful, comprehensive privacy program." 
     
     IBM's privacy services also help identify the types of information being gathered and processed, ensuring that
     consumers get proper notification of how their personal information will be used.

                   THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I 
      am delighted to welcome Prime Minister Barak to Washington.  As all 
      of you know, he is the most decorated soldier in Israel's history.  
      And as a soldier, as Army Chief of Staff, Interior Minister and 
      Foreign Minister, he has made immeasurable contributions to his 
      nation's security and its emergence as a modern, thriving democratic 
      society, time and again taking on tough tasks and getting them done 
      right.
      
                   Now, as Prime Minister, he has put Middle East peace at 
      the top of his agenda, telling his fellow citizens that Israel's 
      triumph -- and I quote -- "will not be complete until true peace, 
      trust and cooperation reign between Israel and its neighbors."
                   
                   Mr. Prime Minister, if your mentor, Yitzhak Rabin were 
      here today, I believe he would be very gratified, seeing the 
      leadership of his cherished nation in your most capable hands.
      
                   For more than half a century, the United States has 
      stood proudly with Israel and for the security of its people and its 
      nation.  Now, Mr. Prime Minister, as Israel again walks bravely down 
      the path of peace, America will walk with you, ready to help in any 
      way we can.  
      
                   As we have seen before here at this house, as Israelis, 
      Palestinians, Egyptians and Jordanians have come together, what at 
      first seems unlikely, even impossible, can actually become reality 
      when the will for peace is strong.  America will help as 
      you move forward, as you put implementation of the Wye River 
      agreement back on course, as you work for a final status 
      agreement; as you seek to widen the circle of peace to include 
      Syria and Lebanon, and to revitalize talks among Israel and the 
      Arab world to solve regional problems and build a prosperous 
      
      common future.  I look forward to our meeting and to 
      strengthening the bonds between Israel and the United States.  
                
                First, Mr. Prime Minister, again, welcome.  The podium 
      is yours.
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  Mr. President, ladies and 
      gentlemen, I came here as a messenger of the people of Israel who 
      have called for change and renewal, and I am determined to bring 
      about change and renewal.  I and the people of Israel attach 
      great importance to the relations with the United States, its 
      friendship and support, and its invaluable contribution to the 
      peace process.  The United States has always been a true and 
      tried friend of Israel, and President Clinton personally has 
      played an important role in changing the Middle East landscape.  
                
                I came to Washington following a series of talks with a 
      number of Middle East leaders.  I assured them that we would work 
      as partners with mutual trust in order to overcome all the 
      challenges and complications that are still awaiting us down the 
      street. 
                
                We agreed that we need to abide by the previous 
      agreements signed by all parties, including the Wye Accords.  It 
      is our intention to inject new momentum into the peace process 
      and to put it back on all tracks.  For this, we need American 
      leadership and support all along the way.
      
                Mr. President, we are on the threshold of the 21st 
      century and the third millennium.  Mothers, fathers and children 
      all across the Middle East yearn for the dawn of a new era.  They 
      expect us to provide them with a better and safer future.  We 
      cannot let their hopes down.  Together, as partners in the search 
      for peace, we can help transform the Middle East from an area of 
      confrontation and enmity to a region of peace, security and 
      prosperity.
      
                I look forward to all my meetings here, and I hope that 
      this visit will usher in a new era in the peace process and 
      further deepen American-Israeli relations.  Thank you very much.  
      (Applause.)
      
                Q    Mr. Prime Minister --
                
                Q    Mr. President --
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you -- here's what we'll 
      do.  We'll take a couple of questions from the Americans, and a 
      couple of questions from the Israelis, but we'll start with a 
      question from the American press.  
                
                Sam?
      
                Q    Yes, sir.  Mr. Prime Minister, when you say as you 
      did the other day, words to the effect that the United States 
      perhaps should step back somewhat and let the parties do more of 
      the work, what do you mean by that?  
                
                And, Mr. President, how would that change U.S. 
      involvement in the process?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  I think that the United States 
      can contribute to the process more as facilitator than as a kind 
      of policeman, judge and arbitrator at the same time.  This was 
      the tradition when Yitzhak Rabin was leading the peace process.  
      And I deeply believe that this is the right way to have the best 
      kind of inference and the best kind of contribution that the 
      United States can bring into the peace process.  
                
                It is clear to all of us that without United States 
      participation, contribution, and without the leadership that had 
      been shown in the past by the President -- and I hope will be 
      shown in the future by the American administration -- we won't be 
      able to reach a peace.  And I'm confident we'll find these 
      resources and move forward towards peace that all our peoples are 
      awaiting.
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  I agree with what the Prime Minister 
      said.  I thought that the peace process worked best when we were 
      essentially facilitating direct contacts between the parties and 
      helping to make sure that there was a clear understanding, 
      helping to make sure that we were there to do whatever we could 
      do to, now and in the future, to make sure that it would work.
                
                We took a more active role, in effect, as mediator when 
      the bonds of trust and the lines of communication had become so 
      frayed that we were in danger of losing the peace process.   And 
      I did not want that to happen, and I didn't think either side 
      wanted that to happen.  So we did what was necessary to keep it 
      going.  But, obviously, if there is a genuine priority put on 
      this, there's a sense trust and mutual communication on both 
      sides -- the people in the region have to live with the 
      consequences of the agreements they make; it is far better for 
      them to take as large a role as possible in making those 
      agreements.  And so, to that extent, I agree with the Prime 
      Minister.
                Do you want to call on an Israeli journalist?  Is there 
      anyone --
      
      
                Q    Mr. President, you say that you are waiting for 
      Mr. Barak as a kid waiting for a new toy.  You don't think that 
      by this remark you make is some kind of patronizing on Mr. Barak, 
      that you want to play with him?  What kind of game do you want to 
      play with Mr. Barak?
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don't think it's patronizing at 
      all; it's just the reverse.  What I'm saying is that the United 
      States is a sponsor of the peace process.  We have done what we 
      could consistently for more than 20 years now through all kinds 
      of administrations to try to advance the peace process.  I have 
      probably spent more time on it than anyone has, and certainly 
      I've spent a lot of time on it.
      
                But my view is that we should not be in a patronizing 
      role, we should be in a supportive role.  We should do what is 
      necessary to keep the peace process going.  But you heard what 
      the Prime Minister said.  He said that the United States' role 
      was essential, it was best if it worked as a facilitator.  He has 
      already gone to see all the leaders of the region with whom he 
      must work -- or many of the leaders of the region with whom he 
      must work -- which I thought was the right thing to do in the 
      right order.  So I was supporting the position that he took.
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  Wolf Blitzer, you are half 
      American, half Israel, so you get priority.  (Laughter.)
      
                Q    Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  I think what the 
      previous reporter, Shimon Shiffer (phonetic) was asking the 
      President -- I don't think the President necessarily understood 
      the question.  Your comment at the Democratic fundraiser in 
      Florida the other day when you said you were as excited as a 
      young kid with a new toy about the meetings that you're going to 
      have with the new Prime Minister, which today have caused some 
      consternation, headlines in Israel -- that you were referring to 
      the Prime Minister as a new toy.
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  No, no -- I see, yes --  
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  May I tell you, Wolf, that I 
      feel like someone who got the mission of diffusing a time bomb, 
      and I believe that we are all under urgent need to deal very 
      seriously not with tricky interpretation of an innocent favorable 
      statement, but by looking into the real problems and focus on 
      solving them.
                THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, let me say, though -- I didn't 
      understand, you're right.  Thank you, Wolf.  That is -- in 
      English, what that means is that you are very excited.  It has no 
      reference to the Prime Minister.  For example -- (laughter) -- I 
      would never do that.  For example, if I -- no, no, if I were 
      taking a trip to Hawaii, I might say, I'm as excited as a kid 
      with a new toy -- doesn't mean I think Hawaii's a new toy, if you 
      see what I mean.  It means that it's a slogan, you know.  In 
      American English, it means I am very excited about the prospect 
      of the rejuvenation of the peace process.  And that's all it 
      means.  I would never say such a patronizing thing -- ever.  
                
                So I thank you -- thank you, Wolf.  This is an historic 
      moment.  Blitzer helps me make peace with the press and the 
      people of Israel.  That's wonderful.  (Laughter.)  Yes, now you 
      get a real question.
      
                Q    Mr. President, the Prime Minister has suggested 
      that he's going to have to use up a lot of his domestic political 
      capital in Israel in order to fully implement the Wye agreement.  
      Would it be wise to go right away to the final status issues and 
      let them save some of that political capital for the tough 
      decisions Israel is going to have to make down the road?  Would 
      you be willing to go along with deferring some of the agreements 
      that were achieved at Wye?
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I'm not quite sure that's 
      what he said, but I think that those kinds of questions ought -- 
      may be properly to be asked of us after we have a chance to have 
      our meeting.  But the problem is, we have -- maybe we ought to 
      let him answer it -- but there is another party there and they 
      have their expectations.  So maybe I should let the Prime 
      Minister answer that. 
                
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  We abide by an international 
      agreement, Wye Agreement included.  It had been signed by an 
      Israeli freely-elected government, by the Americans and by 
      Chairman Arafat.  We are committed to live up to it.  But there 
      is a need to combine the implementation of Wye with the moving 
      forward of the permanent status agreement.  It could be this way 
      -- first Wye, then final status.  It could be this way.  But only 
      through an agreement with Arafat after mutual, open, frank and 
      direct discussion.
      
                If we, together, agree, together with the Americans and 
      Arafat, that something could be made in order to bring those two 
      elements together, I hope and believe that even the international 
      press would not resist it very forcefully.
                Q    Prime Minister Barak, you have met with President 
      Mubarak, you have met with King Abdullah.  What are the 
      possibilities of a meeting between you and President Hafiz al 
      Assad?
      
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  We still wait to see.  When the 
      time comes, I hope we'll be able to meet.  It takes two to tango.  
      I'm ready, the arena is ready; maybe the dancing instructor is 
      ready.  We have to find opportunity and begin.
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  Now, let me say, that is not a 
      patronizing remark toward President Assad as the Prime Minister's 
      dancing partner.  (Laughter.)
      
                Helen, go ahead.
      
                Q    Mr. Prime Minister, when do you plan to disband 
      the heavily armed settlements in Palestine?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  I'm not sure whether I 
      understood the question, so could you please repeat it?
      
                Q    There are more and more settlements being built 
      around Jerusalem and so forth.  Are you going to disband them?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  No.  I'm not going to build new 
      ones.  I'm not going to dismantle any one of them -- Israelis 
      citizens live in them.  They came to these places -- almost all 
      of them -- through an approval of the Israeli government.  We are 
      responsible for them.  But the overall picture will be settled 
      once we end the permanent status negotiation and whatever will be 
      agreed, we will do.  I believe in a strong block of settlements 
      that will include most of the settlers in Judeo-Samaria and the 
      Gaza Strip. 
                
                Thank you.
                
                THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
      
                Q    Mr. President, many Arab American organizations in 
      this country are very skeptical about Arabs getting a fair chance 
      in Israel, while Arab Americans from Arab descent and from this 
      country going to Israel having very harsh treatment.  There are 
      four people sitting in a jail without due process.  They are 
      badly treated at the airport.  Can you comment on that?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  I will answer.  I'm ready to 
      look into this problem.  We have no intentions to humiliate or to 
      intimidate any Arab citizens, be it Israelis, Americans or other 
      countries.  And I cannot respond directly to the story you are 
      telling since I don't know the details.
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
      
      
                Q    Mr. President, do you personally believe in the 
      Palestinian right of return, even though you comments perhaps at 
      the press conference with Mr. Mubarak might not reflect a change 
      in U.S. policy?  
                
                And to Prime Minster Barak, one issue here in the 
      states has been the question of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel 
      from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.  Do you think that that has to 
      happen?  I'm sorry -- from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  Thank you.  Do 
      you believe that that needs to happen  now?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  Be careful about the directions 
      -- (laughter.) 
      
                Q    Do you believe that that needs to happen now, or 
      can that wait for progress in the peace process?
      
                THE PRESIDENT:  Do you want me to go first?  First of 
      all, as you correctly stated, nothing that I have said should be 
      interpreted as a change in United States policy.  I do think 
      there will be a general atmosphere when the peace is finally made 
      which will be positive.  That's all I said.  
                
                On that question, the question you asked me, that is 
      explicitly an issue stated for final status negotiations by the 
      parties.  That's part of the final status talks.  The United 
      States, as a sponsor of the peace process, has asked the parties 
      to do nothing to prejudge final status issues.  We certainly 
      should be doing nothing to prejudge the final status issues.  
      That is why I have had a consistent position on that, on the 
      embassy, on every issue -- whatever else we do, the United States 
      has no business trying to prejudge these final status issues.  
      That's what the parties have to work out in the final status 
      talks.
      
                     Q But Mrs. Clinton has certainly prejudged them, 
      sir.  
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  As the Prime Minister of Israel, 
      I would like to see all the embassies from all around the world 
      coming to Jerusalem, and we will do whatever we can to provide 
      the preconditions for it.  I feel that the essence of the peace 
      
      effort that we are trying to drive forward right now is the bring 
      within the shortest possible time a new landscape, political 
      landscape, in the Middle East that will make the whole question 
      irrelevant; you will see all the embassies together side by side 
      in Jerusalem.  Thank you very much.
      
                Q    Mr. Prime Minister, is there going to be Israeli 
      astronauts on the space station -- are you going to discuss this 
      issue, and do you desire such?
      
                PRIME MINISTER BARAK:  I like Israelis, especially 
      Israeli astronauts.  There is an officer, highly competent 
      officer in our Air Force and I would be more than glad to see him 
      walking in space when we enter the new millennium, maybe in 2001 
      or 2002.  Thank you.
      
                PRESIDENT CLINTON:  Thank you.  We have to go to work.
                
                Q    Mr. President, what about Mrs. Clinton?  She's 
      prejudged the issues.  What about Mrs. Clinton's prejudgment, Mr. 
      President?  Tell us about Mrs. Clinton's prejudgment, sir.
                
                THE PRESIDENT:  That's why Senator Moynihan's law is 
      good -- every individual member of Congress can express a 
      personal opinion, but because of the waiver, the United States 
      does not have to prejudge the final status issue.  That's good.  
      That's the way the law is set up, and it's good.  
                
                Q    Also, she's not President, is she?
                
                THE PRESIDENT:  That's right.
                
                Q    Yet.  (Laughter.)

      BY DIANE FRANK (dfrank@fcw.com)

      The Federal Technology Service's Office of Information Security has
      awarded the last of its Program Safeguard contracts for information security
      services and last week awarded the first task order under the program.

      The Safeguard blanket purchase agreement contracts provide services for
      agencies developing and implementing plans to comply with Presidential
      Decision Directive 63, which requires agencies to protect their critical
      infrastructures, including information systems, from cyberattacks.

      GSA awarded its first Safeguard task order to Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc.,
      according to Richard Krauss, program manager for Safeguard. The company
      will help the Department of Veterans Affairs develop a network security
      architectural plan for the agency's transition from a private network to the FTS
      2001 public network.

     Army awards $248 million ID contract

     BY BOB BREWIN (antenna@fcw.com)

     The Army awarded a $248 million contract Tuesday to Symbol
     Technologies Inc. to field and deploy a wide range of automatic identification
     devices including bar code readers, magnetic stripe cards and radio frequency
     "tags" to track supplies and parts for Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
     users worldwide.

     The Army Communications-Electronics Command, which manages the
     Automatic Identification Technologies II procurement, said the contract will
     enhance warfighting through real-time access to logistics data. Lack of such a
     coherent system in the Persian Gulf War caused tons of supplies to pile up at
     ports while service personnel had to manually determine the contents of crates
     and standard 40-foot shipping containers.

     Symbol, headquartered in Holstville, N.Y., said it will supply DOD with a
     "complete line of wireless mobile computing and scanning systems" on the AIT
     II contract. Symbol said the systems it plans to supply through AIT II will
     enhance the rapid and accurate deployment of materials and personnel
     throughout the world, track supplies through the military's global distribution
     centers. The AIT II contract also calls for Symbol to provide smart card
     technology for military personnel identification.

      - A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace()
        system call of AIX versions 4.2.x and 4.3.x allowing non-root users to 
        crash the system. A temporary fix is available from IBM

      ============================
      
      A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the ptrace() system call of AIX versions 4.2.x and 4.3.x allowing non-root users to
      crash the system. This vulnerability has been posted to the bugtraq mailing list.
      
      Temporary Fix
      
      =============
      
       
      
      A temporary fix is available via anonymous ftp from:
      
      ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/adb_hang.tar.Z
      
      Filename sum md5
      
      ======================================================================
      
      unix_mp.42.adb_hang_fix 00772 2693 960214a1945f2c70311283adc0b231a3
      
      unix_mp.43.adb_hang_fix 15044 3302 584d1c5ea0223110e2d8eba84388f526
      
      This temporary fix has not been fully regression tested. The fix consists of a multiprocessor kernel which can be used on either a
      uniprocessor or multiprocessor machine. There may be a slight performance penalty when using a multiprocessor kernel on a uniprocessor
      machine.
      
       
      
      Use the following steps (as root) to install the temporary fix:
      
       
      
      1. Determine the version of the kernel fileset on your machine.
      
       
      
      # lslpp -l <fileset>
      
       
      
      If the version of the kernel fileset for your machine is not at the level described below, install the requisite APAR listed. This will help ensure
      that the temporary kernel fix will run properly.
      
      Release Fileset Version requisite APAR
      
      ===============================================================
      
      AIX 4.2.x bos.mp or bos.up 4.2.1.23 IY00689
      
      AIX 4.3.x bos.mp or bos.up 4.3.2.8 IY00727
      
      2. Uncompress and extract the fix.
      
      # uncompress < adb_hang.tar.Z | tar xf -
      
      # cd adb_hang
      
      3. Review and run the adb_hang.sh script to install the new kernel.
      
      # view ./adb_hang.sh
      
      # ./adb_hang.sh
      
      4. Reboot.
      
       
      
      Obtaining Fixes
      
      ===============
      
      IBM AIX APARs may be ordered using Electronic Fix Distribution (via the FixDist program), or from the IBM Support Center. For more

50.0 Trinux revisited by www.securityportal.com 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
     
    The Linux Security Appliance


    BO2K Information Center
    July 12, 1999 - They say that good things come in small packages with Linux,
    but even so, it is hard to believe how much functionality you can get out of
    Trinux. Whether your network is primarily NT, Linux, or some other flavor of Unix is
    immaterial - if it is based on TCP/IP, Trinux can be a valuable tool. Trinux is the
    Linux Security Appliance, and is a valuable tool for any network engineer and
    security specialist.
    What is Trinux? Trinux is a small, portable, re-compiled version of Linux, stripped
    of non-essential modules and enhanced with GPL security tools. By doing an
    excellent job of identifying module dependencies, the authors of Trinux are able
    to create a special Linux distribution that can fit on two high density floppies.
    Some of the many tools included with Trinux are:
    Firewalk - this is a tool that employs traceroute techniques to discover and determine Access Control Lists for
    firewalls and routers.
    Ipfwadm - utility to administer the IP accounting and IP firewall services offered by the Linux kernel.
    Iptraf - IPTraf is a console-based network statistics utility for Linux. It gathers a variety of figures such as TCP
    connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and activity indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, and LAN
    station packet and byte counts. 
    Neped - stands for "NEtwork Promiscuous Ethernet Detector", a tool designed to detect Linux sniffers on a local
    network.
    Netwatch - monitors Ethernet traffic for hosts, packet counts and protocols.
    Nmap - The Network Mapper is the premier port scanning tool for Linux. Allows state of the art scanning using a
    variety of techniques.
    Snmpset/snmpget/snmpwalk - allows you to easily retrieve and set SNMP variables.
    Tcpdump - the standard packet sniffer for Unix.
    You can get Trinux at many sites that archive Linux tools. The authors have setup a site at www.trinux.org,
    containing the software, detailed documentation and version history. The software can be downloaded into two files,
    boot (the boot image) and classic (the applications). After downloading the files, simply use the rawrite utility (from
    DOS) or dd (from Linux/Unix), to create the floppies. Next, copy the module for your network card (a .o file, such as
    3c59x.o) to the boot floppy, and you are ready to go.
    How do we see usage of Trinux? Trinux is not a pretty, GUI-based management console, but a versatile tool you can
    take anywhere that can provide quick answers. Trinux is a must for consultants and network engineers who travel to
    many different sites and must diagnose a wide variety of problems. A Trinux user can quickly build a picture of a
    foreign network and assess security problems. Due to the fact that it can be carried around in just two floppies can
    give you the flexibility to quickly put a client's PC into service as a Trinux station. Make certain to carry driver modules
    for all of the network cards you think you will encounter. Network Administrators may want to keep a dedicated Trinux
    station in the computer room to provide a quick diagnosis of network security issues and to provide validation for (or
    contradiction with) other network management tools.
    The elegance and simplicity of Trinux displays not only the wisdom of the network appliance concept, but also shows
    the power of specially compiled Linux distributions to deliver on that concept. If you are responsible for the security of
    a network, large or small, you owe it to yourself to invest a couple hours of your time and test out this tool.

51.0 ComputerWorld: Crypto Expert - Most encryption software is insecure 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     via http://www.securityportal.com/     
     
     - Bruce Schneier, author of Applied  Cryptography, says it is hard to tell whether problems lie in the alogorithm,
       implementation, or elsewhere. He strongly recommends staying conservative, and use well known and highly 
       scrutinized crypto algorithms    
       
     



         Crypto expert: Most encryption
                software is insecure
                         By Ann Harrison


      LAS VEGAS -- Respected cryptography authority Bruce
      Schneier this week told a security conference that most
      products and systems that use cryptography are insecure
      and most commercial cryptography doesn't perform as
      advertised. 

      Instead, he recommended that companies use strong
      random number generators and published nonproprietary
      algorithms and cryptographic protocols. 

      Schneier, who is president of Counterpane Systems in
      Minneapolis, author of Applied Cryptography and inventor of
      the Blowfish, Twofish and Yarrow algorithms, noted that it's
      difficult to distinguish bad cryptography from good
      cryptography in security products. 

      Experienced security testing is needed to uncover bugs, but
      products are often shipped without this type of evaluation,
      he told the audience at the Black Hat Briefings. "Beta testing
      can never uncover security flaws," Schneier said. 

      According to Schneier, flaws can be found almost
      anywhere: in the threat model, the design, the algorithms
      and protocols, the implementation, the configuration, the
      user interface, the usage procedures and other locations in
      the design of products. 

      There is usually no reason to use a new or unpublished
      algorithm in place of an older and better analyzed one,
      Schneier said. "There is no need ever for proprietary
      algorithms," he added. 

      Insecure random number generators can also compromise
      the security of entire systems since the security of many
      algorithms and protocols assumes good random numbers,
      Schneier said. He noted that random numbers are critical
      for most modern cryptographic applications including
      session keys, seeds for generating public keys and random
      values for digital signatures. 

      Security consultants at the conference said they took
      Schneier's suggestions to heart. "I would suggest that no
      one ever purchase proprietary encryption products if it's
      protecting anything of value because someone can
      reverse-engineer it," said Byran Baisden, a software
      engineer at Edge Technologies Inc. in Fairfax, Va. Edge
      designed the Nvision product for network management
      platforms and consults for the federal government. 

      Matthew S. Cramer, lead security practitioner at Armstrong
      World Industries Inc. in Lancaster, Pa., said Schneier does
      a good job pointing out flawed systems and helping
      companies evaluate products such as virtual private
      networks that use encryption. "The tough job is picking
      which ones are snake oil and which ones are real and
      Bruce provides a lot of information to the community to pick
      out which is which," Cramer said.

52.0 Y2K Villains come in all shapes and sizes...

     You network may be covered from the inside but what about physically huh?
     got thos suckers bolted down and and id card system in action y'all?
     
     Y2K 'repairs' could open door for
          billion-dollar thefts
         By Thomas Hoffman


      Don't be surprised if crackers make off with at least one
      electronic heist in the $1 billion range by taking advantage of
      the year 2000 problem, according to a new report from
      Gartner Group Inc. 

      Gartner believes that contractors and programmers hired by
      companies to make Y2K fixes may have left "trapdoors" to
      move money between accounts. 

      "The likely perpetrator would be a highly skilled software
      engineer who has worked on Y2K remediation efforts and
      understands both computer systems and the underlying
      business processes," Gartner said in a statement today.
      "...The worst-case scenario for theft would include a highly
      skilled software engineer involved with Y2K remediation who
      feels unrecognized or unappreciated." 

      An opportunity for theft could occur when a system crashes
      and repairs are made by a single software engineer without
      usual oversight and review, Gartner said.

 3Com eyes new wireless standard for PALM
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     http://www.computerworld.com/home/news.nsf/all/9907165palmwap

     3Com eyes new wireless standard
                                          for Palm
                                         By James Niccolai


     3Com Corp. is exploring an emerging technology called the
     Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) for possible use in its
     Palm computer, a move that would bring new Web
     browsing capabilities to the popular handheld device,
     analysts and sources familiar with the matter said this
     week. 

     Moving to WAP would be a significant step for 3Com, which
     has invested heavily to develop a text-based technology
     called "Web Clipping" for its wireless Palm VII, which was
     launched in May in the New York area. But analysts said the
     momentum growing behind WAP might not leave 3Com
     with any choice but to switch to WAP. 

     Web Clipping allows mobile users to download short bursts
     of text information from Web sites that have tailored content
     for 3Com's technology. Web Clipping doesn't allow users to
     surf the Web at large, but downloads information to "query
     applications" offered by more than 60 firms, including United
     Airlines, The Weather Channel, ETrade Group Inc. and The
     Wall Street Journal. The list of content and service
     providers using Web Clipping is growing, and users can
     download new query applications from Palm's Web site,
     3Com said. 

     In contrast, WAP provides a set of open standards that
     allow mobile devices like cell phones, pagers and handheld
     computers to browse content on the Web. Sites, however,
     must be reformatted to support a programming language
     called Wireless Markup Language that supports both text
     and bitmap images. 

     WAP still is an emerging technology, but the industry
     momentum behind it, combined with its potential to offer
     users greater freedom to surf the Internet, may force 3Com
     to make a transition from Web Clipping to WAP, analysts
     said. 

     "I think they would be foolish not to support WAP. They're
     trying to push Web Clipping as a metaphor for surfing the
     Web, but I don't think they'll be that successful," said Ken
     Dulaney, vice president of mobile computing research at
     market analyst firm Gartner Group Inc. in San Jose, Calif. 

     Dulaney characterized 3Com's apparent reluctance to
     move to WAP as "a touch of Microsoft-itis." 

     "I think it's stupid for them to wait," he said. "They ought to
     be in the middle of things. They're obviously waiting, but
     what they're waiting for I don't know." 

     3Com denies it has any plans to move away from its
     proprietary technology, although the company
     acknowledges that WAP is on its radar screen. 

     "We're certainly looking at WAP and find it very interesting,
     but we don't have any imminent plans" to use the
     technology, Tammy Medanich, product marketing manager
     at 3Com's Palm Computing division, said in a recent
     interview. 

     But two sources close to the matter told IDG News Service
     that 3Com has already begun talks with the WAP Forum, an
     industry group formed to promote the technology. Other
     industry sources have indicated to Gartner Group's Dulaney
     that 3Com will move to the new technology sooner rather
     than later, Dulaney said. 

     The world's largest handset makers, including L.M.
     Ericsson Telephone Co., Nokia Corp. and Motorola Inc., all
     have announced plans to ship WAP-enabled phones late
     this year or early in 2000. Telecom carriers AT&T Corp.,
     France Telecom SA and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
     Corp. (NTT) are also backing the effort, along with IT
     heavyweights like Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. 

     "For 3Com to take on Microsoft and all the other players
     would be suicide in my opinion," Dulaney said. 

     3Com maintains that Web Clipping has proved popular
     among its early customers. What's more, the company
     notes, content for the Palm VII is available now, whereas
     companies are only just beginning to think about retooling
     their Web content for WAP. 

     Web Clipping is "fast and efficient" at downloading snippets
     of information, said Jill House, a research analyst at
     International Data Corp.'s (IDC) smart handheld devices
     group. Still, she characterized the technology as an "interim
     solution" to providing mobile users with wireless Web
     access. 

     Like Dulaney, House believes 3Com will be forced to yield to
     the market impetus building up behind WAP. IDC expects
     shipments of WAP-enabled products to increase rapidly,
     soaring from almost zero today to close to 10 million by
     2003. About 5 million Palm OS-based devices will ship in
     the same year, up from an estimated 2.9 million this year,
     House said. 

     "[WAP is] a strong technology with a lot of interest from the
     industry. Given both those factors, it would be very
     surprising if 3Com were not considering it" for use in the
     Palm, she said. 

     Officials at the WAP Forum declined to comment on
     whether any discussions with 3Com are under way, but
     said 3Com's membership to the Forum would be of great
     value. 

     "Our principal goal is to create one worldwide standard that
     all wireless handheld devices work on for Internet access
     and browsing, and it would be a huge accomplishment to
     have 3Com join," said Chuck Parrish, who recently
     completed his tenure as chairman of the WAP Forum.
     Parrish is also executive vice president at Phone.com Inc.,
     which makes client and server software for WAP devices. 

     One major benefit of having a single standard among
     wireless providers would be to enable content developers to
     write their content once and have it understood by all
     devices, Parrish said.

54.0 Intel creates Net-specific unit.

     (Online News, 07/16/99 11:36 AM)



         Intel creates Net-specific unit
                        By Cheri Paquet


     Intel Corp. has divided its communications business into a
     networking business unit and a new unit dedicated to the
     development of Internet-specific products. 

     Intel's new Communications Products Group will include
     communication servers, computer telephony hardware,
     network appliances, routers, hubs, switches, VPN (virtual
     private network) software and LAN management hardware,
     the company said in a statement issued yesterday.
     Meanwhile, the Network Communications Group will
     continue to focus on developing Intel's microprocessors,
     LAN chip controllers and network processors. 

     To form the new Internet unit, Intel combined its
     Communications and Internet Server Division, Network
     Systems Division, Systems Management Division and the
     Dialogic subsidiary it recently acquired. Dialogic makes
     computer telephony software, network interfaces and media
     processing boards. 

     Intel Vice President John Miner, formerly general manager
     of the Enterprise Server Group, will head up the
     Communications Products Group and will report directly to
     Craig Barrett, Intel's president and CEO. Michael Fister,
     vice president of the Intel Architecture Business Group and
     general manager of Enterprise Server Group, will succeed
     Miner in his former role.

          Reply: Claudio Telmon: "Re: Communicator 4.[56]x, JavaScript used to bypass cookie settings" 
     
     
     
     As Netscape has not acknowledged my email or bug report from last week, 
     and one form of this vulnerability is currently being used, I have decided 
     it best to publicize this problem. 
     
     SUMMARY 
     
     This post describes a flaw verified in Netscape Communicator 4.6-0 as 
     distributed by Red Hat software for x86 Linux and Communicator 4.51 and 
     4.61 for Windows NT. Communicator does not enforce "originating server" 
     cookie restrictions as expected when JavaScript is enabled, leading to 
     privacy issues for users who may think they have taken reasonable 
     precautions. 
     
     BACKGROUND 
     
     Communicator 4.6 has a setting to warn before accepting cookies, and 
     another to "Only accept cookies originating from the same server as the 
     page being viewed". That latter option is supposed to, and used to, 
     completely and quietly reject "DoubleClick" style third party ad cookies, 
     i.e., cookies from servers that did not produce the main HTML document. 
     
     These third party ad servers use cookies to track Web users as they move 
     through completely unrelated Web sites. By accepting the cookie, one 
     allows the third party to compile a profile of visits to other Web sites 
     that use the third party's ad service (though normally the third party 
     does not know the end user's exact identity). 
     
     PROBLEM 
     
     Last week I noticed a warning for a cookie (for doubleclick.net) not from 
     the domain of the page I was viewing (newsalert.com) -- which the cookie 
     settings should have rejected outright. If I turn off the warning, 
     Netscape silently accepts the doubleclick cookie, although I still have 
     the "originating server" restriction enabled. 
     
     MEANS OF EXPLOIT 
     
     The reason? I had JavaScript enabled for Web browsing. The offending 
     newsalert page used a tag something like 
      <SCRIPT language="JavaScript1.1" SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net/..."> 
     and Communicator seems to interpret this as a "page" from doubleclick when 
     it's only getting a snippet of JavaScript code. 
     
     INTENT ? 
     
     I have been in communication with DoubleClick on this issue. They raise 
     credible reasons to justify using <SCRIPT> instead of simple <A><IMG> 
     tags: preventing caching, and allowing the ability to use media other than 
     simple images for their ads. Nevertheless, this technique does subvert 
     user preferences, regardless of whether this was the original intent. 
     DoubleClick does have an "opt out" program that sets a generic cookie to 
     prevent further tracking; see http://www.adchoices.com/ for details. 
     
     Newsalert management and web staff have not responded. 
     
     COMPETING PRODUCTS 
     
     Initial tests with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows NT suggest 
     that it does not have any option like Netscape's "originating server" 
     restriction. By explicitly categorizing *.doubleclick.net in a zone like 
     "Restricted sites" where all cookies are disabled, MSIE 5 will reject 
     cookies offered by doubleclick.net <SCRIPT> tags; of course this must be 
     done for each third party domain individually. 
     
     WORKAROUNDS 
     
     Concerned Netscape users should either turn on warnings and read notices 
     carefully, disable JavaScript, or completely disable cookies. 
     
     SUGGESTED FIX 
     
     The cookie security mechanism should not accept <SCRIPT SRC="..."> as a 
     valid "page" for the purpose of the cookie settings. Nor should it allow 
     any similar means of bypassing the "originating server" restriction, 
     including external CSS files[1], or other documents not of type text/html. 
     
     For each rendered page, the domain of the main document's URL should be 
     compared against the domains of any other supplemental pieces in deciding 
     if those pieces qualify as "originating server" content. 
     
     VENDOR RESPONSE 
     
     While there has been no response from Netscape Communications, I am 
     grateful for the prompt, polite responses of DoubleClick's employees; 
     although I disapprove of their willfully continuing to use this technique, 
     and their advocacy of unwieldy "opt-out" procedures. 
     
     -Peter 
     
     [1] By specifying a style sheet from a different domain with 
       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..."> 
     you can also sneak a cookie past the "originating server" restriction, but 
     only if both style sheets and javascript are enabled.[2] 
     
     Even better, you can set cookies for more domains with "Location:" 
     redirects. E.G. "http://example.org/" can have a URL like 
     http://example.com/redirectPlusCookie in the LINK tag that issues a 
     Set-Cookie and a Location header, redirecting the user to 
     http://example.net/stylesheetPlusCookie. With JavaScript and CSS enabled, 
     Netscape will accept cookies from both example.com and example.net. 
     
     Or, a more vicious approach is to reference a URL on the same server which 
     issues the redirect for the CSS or <SCRIPT> SRC to another domain. Users 
     who look at the HTML source won't see anything unusual, but such 
     redirections will also bypass the "originating server" setting. 
     
     Finally, if you're not convinced of the problems, consider that these 
     "originating server" tricks also work if you're viewing a file:// URL, 
     even with a cookie-setting intermediate redirect. 
     
     [2] Sorry, Netscape, I didn't tell you this last week because only now did 
     I bother to test mechanisms other than the direct <SCRIPT> tag.

     Granny Hacker From Heck Visits Def Con 
     Thursday, July 15, 1999 at 16:29:59
     by Carolyn Meinel - Writing For AntiOnline 

     July 1, 1999. A staffer from Loompanics calls to say that the
     Def Con convention staff has ordered them to not sell my "The
     Happy Hacker: A Guide to Mostly Harmless Hacking"
     (http://happyhacker.org/buyhh.html) at their upcoming computer
     criminal soiree.

     This means war! How can I best stick it to the Def Con d00dz?
     Oho, their web site (http://www.defcon.org) is advertising a
     Bastard Operator from Hell (BOFH)
     (http://www.rangsoc.demon.co.uk/bofh_last.htm) contest. A
     true BOFH should run a computer with all sorts of tantalizing
     services. Build something that looks like an eight year old could
     break in. Then the attacker runs exploit after exploit against the
     box. And every attack mysteriously SCREWS UP!!!
     Muhahaha. By offering a prize for the best victim computer, the
     Def Con guys hops to get better targets for the hackers playing
     Capture the Flag.

     Amarillo, TX, July 6 and 7, I'm out there with Happy Hacker
     Wargame director Vincent Larsen and wargame admin Jon to
     put together our BOFH entry: Fangz. Ah, yes, Fangz, an Intel
     box running Red Hat Linux (at least that's what any port
     scanner would tell you, snicker). It runs ftp, pop3, smtp, a DNS
     server, telnet with a guest account with no password, guest
     access to vi and a C compiler; and a Lithium Quake server with
     back doors in place. Ahem, every service is working according
     to the RFCs, but not quite running the way hackers would
     expect:):)

     OK, let's get this straight. All I did was provide the hardware
     and use the Hacker Wargame to test various iterations of
     Vincent and Jon's Process Based Security
     (http://www.sage-inc.com) modifications to Red Hat Linux.
     Red Hat is a hacker's paradise. A clean install of the latest
     version has over 200 ways to break into it. Vincent and Jon's
     version of Red Hat, however, would make the BOFH himself
     proud. That's why I decided against entering a FreeBSD or
     OpenBSD system. They have pretty good security, too. But
     they don't TORMENT hackers the way Process Based
     Security does.

     At sunrise Friday morning, July 9, I caught a ride on the Happy
     Hacker Godfather's King Air business jet, along with him and
     Jon. Also there was this giant Texan on board. I asked him,
     "You look like a bodyguard. You look like you could pick up
     someone by the neck and hold him out at arm's length."

     "I'm an interior decorator. That's my story and I'm sticking with
     it."

     Nine AM we are on site at the Alexis Park hotel. We stagger
     along with Fangz, a monitor, laptop, my favorite Ethernet hub,
     my crummy backup Ethernet hub, lots of spare 10BASE-T
     cabling, tools, and duct tape just in case I need to tape anyone
     to the wall.

     A Def Con "goon" (security guard) helps us out by taking us to
     the head of the registration line. Who should be handling, um,
     exceptional cases such as ourselves but Pete Shipley. As his
     mouth drops with surprise to see us Happy Hacksters out in
     force, he fails to flash his copyrighted vampire fangs. Now these
     are very important, copyrighted vampire fangz, er, I mean,
     fangs. Shipley's lawyer actually sent several letters to the
     publisher of my Happy Hacker book claiming that Shipley had
     gotten a copyright on wearing vampire fangs, so the guy on the
     cover of my book wearing fangs owed Shipley royalties. Or
     something like this. 

     Anyhow, the publisher, being a hacker himself (Dr. Mark
     Ludwig), decided to have a little fun with Shipley. In the second
     edition he blotted out Shipley's fanged features with a green
     blob reading "hey man get my face off this cover."

     Anyhow, I think Mark using Shipley's copyrighted fangs on my
     book cover is why Shipley can't wear fangs any more. That
     must be what got Shipley to being such a major enemy of mine.
     After all, my lady BOFH personality ought to win the adulation
     of hackers everywhere. LART, LART, who has the LART?;^)
     (http://www.winternet.com/~eric/sysadmin/lart.1m.html)

     Shipley swears it isn't because I hacked him at Def Con 3 in
     front of dozens of witnesses (see Granny Hacker from Heck).
     Oh, yes, if you are a reporter, contact me and I'll give you
     phone numbers for two of those witnesses.

     Well, that fangless Shipley just about ruined my day. What next,
     would Cult of the Dead Cow's (http://cultdeadcow.com) Deth
     Vegetable trash can his Mr. T bust and prance on stage in a
     business suit? 

     We got Fangz set up pretty quickly. All I did was some physical
     stuff. Meanwhile, Jon changed the gateway, DNS server and IP
     address himself because there are some interesting twists to
     Fangz. Then he spent the next few hours waiting for the Capture
     the Flag/BOFH contest to start by changing a few more things
     on Fangz, like the process control tables for the "mv" and "cat"
     commands. Oh, you say you never heard of Red Hat Linux
     "process control tables"? Muhahaha.

     Then... Priest pays me a visit. Priest. He's a tall middle aged guy
     whose trademark is the loud Hawaiian shirts and shorts he
     wears at every Def Con. At Def Con 5 he won his "I am the
     Fed" T-shirt by showing off an FBI badge. Of course I believe
     everything I see.

     "Carolyn," he gestures to me. He sidles up close and whispers,
     "I left the agency a few weeks ago. An Internet startup in
     California offered me a chance to get rich. I have a
     nondisclosure agreement for you. Interested?"

     Of course I like to get rich, too. I sincerely believe that Internet
     startups like to offer FBI agents tons of money. "Sure."

     Meanwhile the Capture the Flag/BOFH game has finally gotten
     started. Less than 100 of the 3,600 Def Con attendees have
     signed up to play the game. What? Less than one hundred? I
     ask several players. They all say there are perhaps only 200
     people at Def Con who actually know how to break into
     computers. The rest? Feds, narcs, groupies, and fakes. And
     BOFHs:):)

     Suddenly people start shouting. I turn to see a man prancing on
     top of a table next to the Penguin Palace booth. He is naked
     except for an extremely tiny g-string. It's a good thing his
     genitals are tiny enough to fit into it. Then he pulls on his jeans
     and leads a parade of drooling teenagers out of the room.

     A tiny waisted bleached blonde with braless boobs in a
     spaghetti string shirt prances over to some Capture the Flag
     players. Not only is each boob the size of her head, they are
     powered by antigravity devices. From time to time she pulls up
     her shirt and sticks her naked boobs into the faces of the
     players. They keep on shooing her off -- "We're trying to hack,
     dammit!" 

     (to be continued: groupies get drunk and laid; Feds, narcs and
     Cult of the Dead Cow urge code kiddies to hack more
     government Web sites so Congress will boost the Information
     Warfare budget from $1 billion to $1.4 billion; fangz LARTs
     hackers; Michael Schiffman beefs up his muscles with a bicycle
     pump; Shipley remains fangless; Priest attempts an entrapment
     scheme; and Granny Operator from Heck gets into trouble.)

     The Granny Hacker From Heck 
     Tuesday, February 23, 1999 at 11:43:38
     by Carolyn Meinel - Writing For AntiOnline 
  
     I sit in my home office, slaving over a hot computer. It's an NT
     server; next to it is an Indigo running Irix 6.2. Across the room is
     my Slackware box. They are linked by, ta, da! Ethernet. Two
     modems hum with TCP/IP over PPP.
  
     I'm the grannie hacker from heck. Elite d00dz tremble before my
     wrath. You don't believe me? Check out this
     (http://www.attrition.org/slander/content.html). See? Some of the
     scene's most dreaded hackers and brilliant computer security
     experts are trembling before my awesome skillz as, so they say, I
     run around erasing the systems files of helpless hacker boxes. I'm
     talking about people such as admitted black hat
     (http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/16872.html)
     Brian Martin, AKA jericho, trembling in his boots. You know,
     the computer security professional from Repent Security, Inc.
     (http://www.repsec.com) Come on, check this out
     (http://www.attrition.org/slander/content.html) and see how
     terrified he is of me!
  
     Heck, even some FBI agents think I've waged a war of naughty
     images plastered over the likes of the New York Times and
     PenthouseWeb sites -- that I'm the Hacking for Girliez gang.
     Don't believe me? Martin even has a sound bite on his Web site
     with me apparently confessing to their crimes!
     (http://www.attrition.org/shame/www/admit.html)
  
     So how did I become the grannie hacker from heck? It all started
     in 1995 when I went to Def Con III. Being such a good
     housekeeper, I couldn't help but be the person who discovered a
     live phone line in the convention ballroom. Of course I sprawled
     out on the floor, plugged my laptop into the line and telneted into
     a shell account. Lo and behold, "Evil Pete" Shipley, leader of the
     Dis Org gang (http://www.dis.org/doc.html), strode over. He was
     quite a wonderment, with fangs and spurs and lovely black hair
     flowing to his waist. He crouched down beside me and asked,
     "You got a telnet session going?"
  
     "Yup."
  
     "May I borrow it for a minute? I need to do something at work."
  
     That was when the naughty side of me took over, you know, the
     Mrs. Hyde thing. "Suurreee:)," I replied. I handed my laptop to
     him, then leaned over and clicked a function key.
  
     "What did you just do?" Evil Pete demanded.
  
     "I turned on logging." I tried to wipe the cat got the canary look
     off my face.
  
     "You tried to steal my password!" Evil Pete stood up and started
     shouting, to no one in particular, "This woman tried to hack me!
     Bad hacker etiquette!"
  
     "Sheesh," I pouted. "It's my computer, I can run keystroke
     logging if I want to!"
  
     Maybe I was plum lucky. Full as that ballroom was with guys
     toting Miranda cards, not a single Fed rushed over to bust me.
     That was what really got me inspired. I could hack a big wig
     computer security fellow right in front of the Feds, and get away
     with it! The sense of power drove me mad, muhahaha....
  
     Anyhow, that is how I got started persecuting the biggest and the
     baddest hackers and computer security experts on the planet.
  
     Recently the organizer of Rootfest (http://www.rootfest.org)
     kicked me off the program of his hacker con because Evil Pete
     had warned him that I had put out a special, secret Guide to
     (mostly) Harmless Hacking showing newbies how to hack Pete's
     dis.org domain. Pete even showed him a copy of this GTMHH, a
     special edition of Vol.1, #3. It's one that you won't find anywhere
     on the Web, I think only Pete, Mr. Rootfest and I have copies of
     it. Anyhow, this smart move of Pete's has saved the planet from
     the live "how to hack" class I was going to teach at Rootfest.
  
     Intoxicated as I am by hacking, nowadays my spinning wheel sits
     gathering dust, and a shirt I was sewing lies half-finished. I used
     to be such a sweet housewifey, I swear! You don't believe me? I
     have witnesses! I used to demonstrate wool carding at the New
     Mexico State Fair! I used to make gourmet goat cheese and
     station bouquets of cut flowers from my greenhouse in
     Martha-Stewart-approved locations about my home. 
  
     What caused my fall from the Better Homes and Gardens set?
     The sweet taste of being a meanie against the world's hairiest
     hackers!
  
     Sooo, will the rampage of grannie hacker from heck ever end?
     My victims are trying to figure out how to defend themselves
     against me. Evil Pete told the organizer of Rootfest that in self
     defense, my hacker victims have brought many lawsuits against
     me. Much more effective than a firewall, right? Especially against
     us Uberhacker grannies!
  
     Now, I haven't seen any of these lawsuits, but as we all know,
     hackers never lie. The suspense is getting to me. When will this
     army of lawyers my victims have marshalled actually materialize?
     Will they sue me into submission? How much more damage will I
     and my Happy Hacker (http://www.happyhacker.org) army of
     newbies do before lawyers save the world from my
     depredations? Stop me before I hack again!
  
     In the meantime, while waiting for the lawyers to save you, what
     can you do to keep me from making naughty body parts sprout
     on your Web site? Here are my top five suggestions:
  
     1) Buy my Happy Hacker book. I don't rm the operating system
     of anyone who buys my book, because after reading it you will
     know enough to protect yourself from me. Also, when you see
     me trying to secure shell into your ftp port, you'll know I'm just
     yanking your chain.
  
     2) Send me computer jokes. I'm a sucker for them and will be
     too busy laughing and forwarding them to my friends to hack you.
     The following is an example of something that meets my
     laughability standards:
  
     An engineer, a systems analyst, and a programmer are driving
     down a mountain road when the brakes fail. They scream down
     the mountain gaining speed every second and screeching around
     corners. Finally they manage to stop, more by luck than by
     judgment, inches from a thousand foot drop to the jagged rocks
     on the valley floor. More than slightly shaken, they emerge from
     the car. "I think I can fix it," says the engineer. The systems
     analyst says, "No, I think we should take it into town and have a
     specialist examine it." The programmer, holding his chin between
     thumb and forefinger says, "Okay, but first I think we should get
     back in and see if it does it again."
  
     3) Give me a 120 cubic meter Cameron hot air balloon with
     complete accessories, you know, stuff like a rate of
     ascent/descent meter, GPS, one ton king cab chase truck with
     Tommylift gate... I'll be so busy accidentally landing on the
     classified areas of Sandia Labs, Area 51 etc. that I'll retire my
     computers next to the spinning wheel and unfinished shirt. I can
     see it now, "Gosh, Colonel, you know how these balloons are, I
     got caught in a thermal and next thing I knew I was here:)"
  
     4) After we had a fight, my ex-husband used thermite to melt
     down our 30 mm Finnish antitank gun. Gimme another one. With
     ammunition. Or else.
  
     5) Our church music director could use 50 copies of the score
     for Jesus Christ Superstar. If I can get some snivelling coward to
     give them to us in exchange for me promising not to hack him,
     maybe I can get to sing Mary Magdalene. If Lisa gets the part, I'll
     hack the church computer so Zippy the Pinheadisms creep into
     the bulletins.
  
     I guess that's enough extortionate demands. I gotta get back to
     sneaking Trojans into military computers so I can launch World
     War III while making it look like Y2K bugs so I won't get into
     trouble. As for those computer security professionals I've been
     fubaring, do you suppose I'll ever feel remorse? No way! If they
     want to call themselves computer security experts, they'd better
     be ready to take heat from the granny hacker from heck!

     expert and clown princess of the non-profit Happy Hacker, Inc.
     She lives in Cedar Crest, NM with her long-suffering hubby, four
     cats, three horses, three dogs, two toads and two mosquito fish.
  
     PS: The thing about the thermite is a slight exaggeration.
     Everything else is true -- remember, you read this on the Internet,
     so it must be true. Be sure to email a copy of this to Craig
     Shergold and everyone else your know and Bill Gates will give
     you $1000. Be sure to put "Good Times" in the subject. If you
     don't email this out within ten days, you will be cursed with seven
     years of bad luck and wake up in a bathtub full of ice with your
     kidneys missing. Honest!

          Date Loaded: 19990707
     
          Title: CDE Leaves Current Directory in root PATH
     
           
     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
          HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY SECURITY BULLETIN: #00100, 07 July 1999
     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted upon as soon as possible. Hewlett-Packard Company will not be liable for any
     consequences to any customer resulting from customers failure to fully implement instructions in this Security Bulletin as soon as possible.
     
      
     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     PROBLEM: The current directory is in the root users PATH after logging in using CDE.
     
     PLATFORM: HP 9000 series 700/800 at hp-ux revision 10.X
     
     DAMAGE: Increase in privileges.
     
     SOLUTION: Modify /usr/dt/bin/Xsession until a patch is available.
     
     AVAILABILITY: This advisory will be updated when patches are available.
     
      
     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
      
     
     I.
     
               A. Background - The PATH environment variable is constructed from several sources including dtsearchpath and scripts in
               /etc/dt/config/Xsession.d/ and /usr/dt/config/Xsession.d/. The resulting PATH contains the string "::" which will be interpreted as the
               current directory. The root user should not have the current directory in the PATH.
     
               B. Fixing the problem - Since the PATH environment variable can be affected by dtsearchpath and several scripts, the
               recommended solution is to clean up the root users PATH after is has been created.
     
     In /usr/dt/bin/Xsession just before this:
     
      
     
     # ###########################################################################
     
     #
     
     # Startup section.
     
      
     
     Add this:
     
      
     
     ###################### Clean up $PATH for root ##########################
     
     if [ "$USER" = "root" ]
     
     then
     
     Log "Clean up PATH for root user"
     
     Log "Old PATH = $PATH"
     
     PATH=echo $PATH | awk 
     
     {
     
     # Remove elements from PATH that are
     
     # (a) "."
     
     # (b) ""
     
     # © blank
     
     #
     
     gsub (" ",":", $0) # Substitite ":" for each blank
     
     n = split ($0, path, ":") # Split into elements with ":" as delimiter
     
     first = 1 # To suppress leading ":" in new PATH
     
     for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {
     
     len = length(path[i])
     
     dot = index(path[i], ".")
     
     dot_only = 0
     
     if ((len == 1) && (dot==1)) {
     
     dot_only = 1
     
     }
     
     # print element if it is not "" and not "."
     
     if (!(len==0) && !(dot_only==1)) {
     
     if(first != 1) {
     
     printf (":") # if not first element, print ":" in front

     Summary
     
     ======
     
     Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks against a Microsoft® Windows NT®
     workstation, server or terminal server. An unprivileged program can disable the local mouse or keyboard on a server or workstation, and disable
     the console mouse or keyboard on a terminal server.
     
     Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at
     
     http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-024faq.asp
     
     Issue
     
     ====
     
     The IOCTLs that are used to obtain services from the keyboard and mouse drivers in Windows NT do not require that the calling program have
     administrative privileges. A user-level program could use legitimate calls to disable the mouse and keyboard, after which the machine would need
     to be rebooted to restore normal service. On a terminal server, such a program could disable the keyboard and mouse on the console.
     
     Affected Software Versions

60.0 ZDNet: Does the media cause hacking? 
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    - short preview of DEF CON 7.0 in Las Vegas, July 9-11. Article quotes
    several experts, saying that the extensive reporting and fame given those who deface a government web page is
    adequate incentive to do it

     Does the media provoke hacking?
     By Robert Lemos, ZDNN
     July 5, 1999 6:34 PM PT
     URL: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2288043-2,00.html
     
     Could the media be the cause of the recent rash of hacker outbreaks? The answer may come at
     DEF CON 7.0, the world's biggest hacking spectacle, which kicks off this coming weekend.
     
                           DEF CON, an annual strange brew of security experts, law
                           enforcement officials, hackers and, yes -- "The Media" -- descends
                           upon Las Vegas this Friday.
     
                           The event will be televised. It will also be streamed on the Web,
                           reported upon for newspapers and Web sites, and written about in
                           magazines for months to come.
     
     And all that attention has some media analysts questioning whether the media's coverage of
     hacking and cyber vandalism promotes more of the same.
     
     "Every step in the evolution of hackers, the media has gotten the story
     wrong," said Jon Katz, a media critic with Slashdot.org and Wired Magazine.
     
     "When the media uses the term 'hacker,' they are really talking about vandals.
     It doesn't help that the media falls into the trap every time."
     
     Graffiti on the Net
     One indication of the media's effect on hacking: Such unwelcome Web
     intrusions, at least anecdotally, are on the rise.
     
     Boston-area security consultant B. K. DeLong says there have been more than 1,300 incidences
     of Web-page defacements so far this year (he only began tracking the number of hacks late last
     year).
     
     They're certainly gaining in prominence: Several Web site hacks, including the WhiteHouse.gov,
     Senate.gov and Army.mil, were covered extensively by major media such as CNN and the New
     York Times, as well as by the electronic media, including ZDNet (NYSE:ZDZ) subsidiary ZDNN.
     
     Whether you call them cyber vandals or hackers, they have the run of the Web, said DeLong.
     
     Most sites hackable
     "I personally think that 75 to 85 percent of sites are hackable," he said.
     
     DeLong believes that if hackers leave these sites alone, it stems more from fear of potential legal
     repercussions than problems breaking in.
     
     One old-school hacker agrees that media publicity and the notoriety it guarantees keeps the hacks
     coming. Like Katz, he doesn't view page defacements as hacks.
     
     "Web-page defacing is not hacking," said Space Rogue, a long-time hacker.
     
     Hackers have traditionally plied their trade in part to gain knowledge about computer systems. In
     a Web page defacement, "there is really little knowledge gained [about the network], and no other
     motives besides fame."
     
     Space Rogue works with the security group L0pht Heavy Industries and runs the Hacker News
     Network, an underground information site.
     
     Members of the Keebler Elves, a cybergang that hacked the National Oceanographic and
     Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center site last week, disagree.
     
                           "Defacing a site to me is showing the admins, government [and others]
                           that go to the site that we own them," wrote "soupnazi," one of the
                           founding members of the Keebler Elves, in a chat with ZDNN. "They
                           wouldn't even know we were in [their systems], if we didn't deface
                           [them]."
     
                           Only when they want to send a message do they deface a page,
                           soupnazi said.
     
     "I've told the Keebler members that I'm not a big fan of defacing pages," he said. "I'd rather have
     root [complete access] to someone's account."
     
     Getting the message across
     Another hacker, who claims responsibility for the Army.mil defacement, also defended the tactic.
     "Messages can be gotten across, if you hit the right machines," said "t1edown" in a chat with
     ZDNN.
     
                     The hacker theorizes that the seeming increase in defacements is partially due
                     to media coverage, which he thinks makes more kids want to learn to hack.
     
                     But he also thinks that gaping security holes are part of the problem.
     
                     For example, the Army.mil attack came through a known hole in the security
                     of a Web server tool, Allaire Corp.'s ColdFusion. Though a patch is
                     available, and L0pht says it informed the Army of the weakness in its
                     security, the Army failed to update all its servers.
     
                     Web defacement: A good thing?
                     But not everyone thinks Web defacement is necessarily bad.
     
     Alex Fowler, director of strategic initiatives at the cyber-rights organization Electronic Frontier
     Foundation, does not advocate hacking, but stresses that there can be valid reasons for graffiti.
     
     Fowler paraphrased an African-American woman who attended a recent EFF panel on public
     spaces in cyberspace, saying, "Graffiti is about a space for the disenfranchised to cry out and
     inform those around them, even when anonymity has been forced upon them."
     
     He added that graffiti -- cyber and otherwise -- is visible to those who may not agree with the
     sentiments involved, unlike a Web page.
     
     "Building AOLsux.com only preaches to the choir," he said. "You are not actually talking to the
     people who like AOL or the ones that have not thought about the issue."
     
     No danger?
     Slashdot's Katz believes there is no danger in the defacements, and hardly any reason for media
     coverage.
     
     In fact, he blames journalists for confusing vandals with hackers, and turning them into Orwellian
     villains.
     
     "Ever since the end of the Cold War, law enforcement and the media have been short of bad
     guys," he said.
     
     "The people that the media calls hackers have done very little damage to the Net," he said. "They
     are kids that like to show anonymous power. To make them into a serious menace, a danger to
     society, is ludicrous."
