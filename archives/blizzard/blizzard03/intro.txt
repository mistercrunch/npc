
 Blizzard Of Oz    Issue #3   Somewhere in the land of August/September.




 Another issue of Blizzard has somehow managed to magically throw itself together.
 I've added a couple of new staff members and I am trying very hard to crank out more quality
 and less quantity.  So,  thanks to my neighbor for all the free Alliance calls so I could
 research that article.  Here at blizzard of oz labs we've added some new equipment.  Namely
 a couple of nice portable scanners, making the cordless phreaking article possible, and 
 a GTE laptop.  I have made a copy of the original drive and zipped it up and posted it on
 a site.  I will give the address out to anyone who convinces me they really want to learn
 from the information and not just be real cool because they have some form of telco property
 stored on thier drive.  Please read the interview, I had a lot of trouble getting it 
 because I interviewed him while I was at work, and it's not just another piece of trash.
 Any comments, hatemail, or suggestions for improvement?  Please send mail to our new address.
