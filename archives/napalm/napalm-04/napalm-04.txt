  We got some amazing press from the Hacker News Network, and through
them, and PacketStorm, we managed to get over a thousand hits within 24
hours of Issue 3's release. We're also up to 70 or so subscribers, and
more trickling in every day. I've heard lots of good feedback from all of
you readers, and I really appreciate it. What I would ike to see even
more, though, is questions from all of you about things you need clarified
or can't figure out. As long as it's topical (see Napalm's main page for
what is topical) and we know the answer, we'll try to help out.
Speaking of topical, as it is mentioned on the main page, we deal with
music here, too, so starting with this issue, we're doing some music
reviews, as well as a music-related article now and then. Also, if any of
you have ideas for topics we should write about, feel free to email us at
napalm@firest0rm.org. If you have articles that you've written and would
like them included in the 'zine, those can also be sent to  
napalm@firest0rm.org. Again, thanks for all of the great feedback!

Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Just Intonation
                         or
           Western Scales Ate My Brain

First, some introduction: according to napalm.firest0rm.org:80, "Napalm
is an e-zine devoted to computer security, with a healthy dose of music,
news, and ethics." Well, maybe we oughtta live up to that, so here's some
music theory in your ear. (Or your eye, unless you're text-to-speeching
this.)

Generally speaking, a scale is a progression of notes that takes you from
one octave to the next.  (Although it can actually be much larger than
just one octave, generally we don't do that.)  Notes have pitches, which
can be measured in oscillations per second, or hertz.  The human ear can
perceive from about 20Hz at the low end to around 20,000Hz at the high
end.  Now, it turns out that the human ear differentiates pitch
logarithmically, and that doubling any given pitch raises it an
octave.  Thus the human ear has a range of a little under ten octaves.

Now it also turns out that when the ear hears any two notes in
combination, the interval, whether major or minor, is perceived to be in
tune when the ratio between the two notes approaches a ratio of two low
integers.  The degenerate case would be a 1:1 ratio, which would be two
notes in unison; a 2:1 ratio, as above, is an octave.  Roughly, the
intervals for the twelve-tone scale used in western music are:

1:1	unison
21:20	half step / minor second
9:8	whole step / major second
6:5	minor third
5:4	major third
4:3	perfect fourth
7:5	tritone / augmented fourth / diminished fifth
3:2	perfect fifth
8:5	minor sixth
5:3	major sixth
9:5	dominant seventh / flat seventh
17:9	major seventh / natural seventh
2:1	octave

The note that a scale centers around is called the tonic.  A scale in
which the ratio of any note to the tonic is an integer ratio is called a
scale of just intonation.  These scales have a very natural-sounding
quality to them.

The problem is, they're murder to implement in any stopped or fretted
instrument.  The difficulty is subtle, but it means big headaches.  It's
hard to explain, though, so I'll give an example.

For purposes of tuning we need a reference pitch, something all the
instruments can agree on.  Usually a 440hz sine wave is used as the
reference pitch, as an A natural.  Now, according to our table above, we
can calculate the pitch of any other note by setting up a simple ratio
relationship.  For example, if I wanted to calculate the pitch of a
perfect fifth from an A440, I would write:
    (X / 440) = (3 / 2)
and solve for X.  Simple algebra, right?  In the above, X comes to 660.
Let's calculate two more:
    (X / 440) = (9 / 8); major second = 495
    (X / 440) = (5 / 4); major third = 550
Now, assume that what you know about scale theory is right and that the
second of a second (of a tonic) is the same note (and pitch) as the major
third of the tonic.  If that were true, then in:
    (X / 495) = (9 / 8)
X should equal 550.  This is the subtle bit, so make sure you understand
it.  The above equation takes the second of 440 (495) and finds the note a
second up from it (9 / 8).  I'll let you all punch that into xcalc and see
what happens.

Didn't work, did it?  You got 556.875, right?
This is the problem.  Any given scale of just intonation must be tuned to
a tonic, which is fine if you only want to play in one key.  However, you
have to retune the instrument every time you modulate keys.  As many
classical composers (and pop ballad writers) will tell you, this has a way
of limiting your expressive power.

So what's a keyboard manufacturer to do?  Tha answer is simple: make one
note in tune, and space all the other notes equally (logarithmically
equally, anyway).  This is what happens on most fretted instruments and
keyboard instruments.  Now, instead of calculating pitch with integer
ratios, we just plug an interval into the following equation:
    P = 440 * 2 ^ (n / 12)
where n is the number of half steps sharp you want to go (and hey, guess
what, negative numbers work as expected; (n == -3) finds the pitch of the
major sixth below A440).  This is called a scale of even (or equal)
temperament, since the distance to any other note is independent of (and
consistent across) key centers.

Now, waitasec, doesn't this put everything out of tune?  Well, yes it
does, but not by very much.  Observe:

Note    Just Pitch      E.T. Pitch (approx.)    Error (%)
A       440             440                     0.0
Bb      462             466.16                  +0.9
B       495             493.88                  -0.2
C       528             523.25                  -0.8
C#      550             554.37                  +0.7
D       586.6-          587.33                  +0.1
D#      616             622.25                  +1.0
E       660             659.26                  -0.1
F       704             698.46                  -0.7
F#      733.3-          739.99                  +0.9
G       792             783.99                  -1.0
Ab      831.1-          830.61                  -0.1

As you can see, we're never more than 1% out of pitch, which most people
can't hear.  However, you *are* out of tune inherently, so when your
instrument then goes further out of tune you sound *really* bad.  The
advantage, though, is that you get stopped instruments, which makes
composition and playing much easier.

(Of course, you'll notice I cheated, and listed a just intonation scale
that happens to be close to the 12-step equal temperament scale.  Sue
me.  There are also Indian raga scales and other non-standard scales that
are "just intonation" scales, but I wanted to present something
understandable.)

***********************************************************************

  echo8's Solaris-securing script
  http://napalm.firest0rm.org/extra/sol.secure

Solaris is Sun's proprietary UNIX operating system, based on SVR4. It's
currently one of the most, if not the most, popular flavors of commercial
unix. While source code is available under various educational
arrangements, it is not freely distributed. Solaris has a long and
distinguished history of security problems. It's not the worst of the
commercial OSes in this regard, but it does not, in my opinion, rival many
freely available OSes in terms of "out of the box" security. Nonetheless,
as Solaris is very popular in the corporate world, many sysadmins find
themselves called upon to deploy it into applications where security is
important.

What follows is an attempt to summarize what I have read and learned
through practical experience with regards to how to make Solaris useable
in an environment which is less than fully trusted. I make no pretense of
being able to address all of the problems: I can't. I'm also not an expert
programmer, and I don't have access to Solaris source. However, it is my
belief that if one must use Solaris, the bar can be raised high enough to
maintain a tolerable level of security in some applications. 

Start off with a minimal OS install and Use the Most Current Version
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you install Solaris, choose to do a custom install. After selecting
the distribution set to use, pick and choose exactly which packages you
want to install. What to install will obviously depend on your
application, and you may discover later that you left out something
important. You can often add the necessary packages from the CD at a later
date without reinstalling if you find this to be the case.

The second point is a little more contentious. My opinion is that the best
course of action is to use the most current release whenever possible.
While it's true that new releases often include new bugs, it's also the
case that Sun tends to be more reponsive to holes in the newest versions,
and that the newest versions tend to incorporate more fixes for known
problems (ie. there is less ground to cover from the beginning). 

Install the Recommended Patches
-------------------------------

I can't stress this enough. While they may take their time about it, Sun
does fix holes. It's not at all uncommon for Sun to fix a hole without
documenting it (I can think of at least two examples that I'd be happy to
share upon request). While installing patch clusters on large numbers of
systems in a production enviroment is time consuming, the benefits are
obvious. If you need to remain secure, patch frequently, period. The patch
clusters seem to be updated very frequently; it's not a bad idea to
download a fresh copy whenever you do a new install. While patch clusters
are still available for all released versions of Solaris, it's often the
case that holes are fixed first in the most current releases.

[ They're also nowhere near as bad as some nameless, non-unix-making
  companies in terms of releasing patches. {ajax} ]

Turn off Any Services You Don't Need
------------------------------------

Like many commercial OSes, Solaris comes out of the box with just about
every service imagineable enabled. At least the following are enabled, by
default:

ftp
telnet
name
shell
login
exec
comsat
talk
uucp
finger
time
echo
discard
chargen
daytime
sadmind
rquotad
rusersd
sprayd
walld
rstatd
kcms_server
cachefsd
kerbd
in.lpd
xaudio
rpc.cmsd
dtspc
rpc.ttdbserverd
keyserv
sendmail
snmp (various utilities)

The vast majority of these do not need to be running in most environments. 
Many have known security holes, and many more give out information about
your system that you really don't need to be giving away. Start by going
through /etc/inet/inetd.conf and commenting out everything that you don't
need. If you find that you don't need anything there, disable inetd
entirely. If you don't need rpcbind running, shut it off too. If you need
either one, you should consider installing Wietse Venema's version of
rpcbind [1] (which restricts connections by IP address or range, which is
better than nothing) and xinetd. [2] Both of these allow more control over
who is allowed to connect than the default Sun versions, and the source
code for both is freely distributed and actively maintained. 

Do the same thing for the services started from /etc/r*.d. A lot of
systems don't need to have a lot of these running. Look at disabling at
least the following: 

In /etc/rc2.d:

S74autofs
S80lp
S88sendmail

In /etc/rc3.d:

S76snmpdx
S77dmi 

Read your rc scripts carefully. If you don't need it, don't run it.

NFS/NIS 
------- 

If you don't absolutely need to use NFS or NIS, do not enable them. The
security implications of NFS/NIS are beyond the scope of this document,
but suffice it to say that both present serious issues. If you absolutely
need NFS, look into using secure-RPC. NIS+ is preferrable to NIS, but it
is still best not to use either service if possible. Thankfully, Solaris
2.x (unlike SunOS 4.x) will work just fine with naming services other than
NIS. It's also worth pointing out that Sun has plans to drop NIS+ support
in the near future. If you choose to roll it out because of its improved
security, you may find yourself on your own as far as "official" support
goes before too long.

[ Note that NIS and NIS+ share no code and have very different database
  setups, so if you do end up having to convert, life will not be fun.
  However, back when Solaris 2.4 was released, Sun dropped server-side
  support for NIS from the OS and made plans to throw all their weight
  behind NIS+.  Look how far *that* got them.  Like echo8 says, if you
  don't have to, don't. {ajax} ]

If you must use NFS, be aware that even if you manage to use AUTH_DES or
AUTH_KERB for authentication, NFS traffic still traverses the network in
plaintext. [3] If you need to use NFS, be very careful about which hosts
you export filesystems to.  Export read-only where possible, and consider
using fsirand to install random inode numbers on the filesystems you're
exporting (to make filehandle guessing harder).

[ How would one go about guessing file handles and then using that
  information to gain unauthorized access? (NFS is pretty foreign to me
  at the moment) {kynik} ]

[ It's like TCP sequence number guessing.  NFS uses an amalgam of
  information in constructing filehandles, including inode numbers.  This
  is used as a token to determine which file is being operated on.  Now,
  most of the time NFS uses UDP, which has no sequence numbers, so if you
  can get the filehandle you can spoof NFS operations, like corrupting or
  unlinking files and such.  This is why NFS over TCP and Secure RPC are
  Good Things; now if only they worked... {ajax} ]

[ As an addition, file handles can be constructed without the assistance
 of the mount daemon, which enforces access control in the Secure RPC
 scheme. In this situation, the client can communicate with nfsd directly
 and proceed to operate with exported files. This bug is relevant
 specifically to the Sun Microsystem's "Secure NFS"/ SecureRPC
 implementation and has been patched. -phatal]

Remove as many SUID bits as Possible 
------------------------------------

Solaris comes out of the box with about 100 utilities installed setuid to
root. While many of them need to be suid root in order to have all of the
functionality Sun intended, there's a good chance that any given
installation doesn't need all of that functionality. Furthermore, many of
these programs have a history of bounds-checking problems that can enable
local users to gain root privileges. Without the suid bit set, such buffer
overflow attacks don't often yield as interesting a result. Use the find
command to locate all of the setuid and setgid programs on your system. 
Remove the suid bits from the ones you are sure will only be run by root,
or where you don't need the functionality that requires the suid bit to be
set. It's also a good idea to make a list of all of the programs that you
leave suid/sgid, and to store that list someplace other than on your
system. It's an even better idea to use a utility such as tripwire [4] to
keep tabs on ALL of your binaries, suid/sgid or not.

Casper Dik's fix-modes program [5] can be useful for changing permissions
to increase security. Sun's aset utility is also useful in this regard. 

Kernel and IP Stack Defaults 
---------------------------- 

Configuration changes can be made to the Solaris kernel and to the tcp/ip
stack to somewhat improve its security. Adding the following lines to
/etc/system will make the stack non-executable (providing some protection
against buffer overflow attacks):

* make the stack non-executable
set noexec_user_stack = 1
* this logs attempts
set noexec_user_stack_log = 1

[ Note that you can patch the Linux kernel to do the same thing. Solar
  Designer's patch is at http://www.openwall.com/linux/ {kynik} ]

[ Programs which map the stack executable will have problems running
  in this environment. See notes on the Sparc v8 ABI vs. the v9 ABI for
  more detail. -phatal]

You can deny access to NFS exports by non-privileged clients by adding the
following to /etc/system:

set nfssrv:nfs_portmon = 1 (for 2.5 and above)
or
set nfs:nfs_portmon = 1 (for older releases)

To keep from being smurfed, configure your IP stack NOT to respond to ICMP
echo requests from broadcast addresses, or to forward them:

/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forward_directed_broadcasts 0 
/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_echo_broadcast 0

Configure your IP stack to drop source routed frames: 

/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_forward_src_routed 0

You might also want to disallow routing between interfaces (if you have
more than one):

/usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_strict_dst_multihoming 1 

All of the ndd commands can be added to the end of an rc script so that
they run at every boot.

EEPROM Security
---------------

It's nearly impossible to effectively secure a machine which is in a
phyically insecure location. That said, taking some basic precautions is
worthwhile.

Either at the OK> prompt, or using the eeprom command, set the following
parameters:

security-mode=command
security-password=<password>
security-#badlogins=<however many>

The first two will restrict the command set available at the firmware
prompt until a password is entered. A user with unrestricted access to the
firmware state can, for example, boot from alternate devices, change
device aliases or change the uid on running processes. [6] The third
parameter defines the number of times the user is allowed to attempt to
supply a password to enter the unrestricted mode.

[ You Solaris people running on the Intel x86 platform need to set a BIOS
  password to avoid the headaches described above. Granted, one could pop
  the case open and clear it with a jumper, but I imagine there's a way to
  do that on a Sun box as well. Anybody know? {kynik} ]

Process Auditing
----------------

Solaris ships with a fairly robust and configurable facility for process
auditing. The interface is not particularly intuitive, but the package
allows a extensive logging of kernel and user-level events. The Basic
Security Module is installed by default if you install the full
distribution. If you do a minimal, selective install, make sure you
include the following packages: SUNWcsr, SUNWcsu, SUNWhea, SUNWman. While
configuration of auditing is beyond the scope of this document, you should
probably consider logging at least the following event-types: network,
process, administrative, login_logout, application, exec, other, and
non_attrib. If you really want a closer look at what's going on, you can
also enable the file_creation, file_deletion, file_attr_mod, file_write
file_read and file_close classes. More extensive auditing (down to the
system call level, for certain calls) is available.

Process auditing can impose a serious performance penalty, depending on
the extent to which you choose to audit. Make sure that you have the
necessary storage space and cpu cycles, especially if the application is
performance-intensive. Thought should also be given to how to secure,
replicate, and store your audit records to prevent their being corrupted
if your system is compromised. Full documentation on process auditing is
to be found in the SunSHIELD Basic Security Module Guide, which is part of
the System Administration Answerbook (Vol. I).

Other Add-Ons
-------------

In addition to the third-party products I've already mentioned, the
following products are not part of Solaris, but can be very helpful when
it comes to increasing the security of a Sun system:

* Secure Shell (ssh) - a replacement for the r* utilities for remote
  logins and file transfers, which provides strong authentication and
  encryption. At least two viable implementations for unix currently
  exist. [8][9]

* Super User DO (sudo) - a utility which allows an admin to give specified
  users access to specific commands with root privileges. In conjuction
  with inventive programming, this can almost always preclude having to
  provide root passwords to anyone other than a qualified, trusted admin.
  [10]

* TCP Wrappers - Allows an admin to restrict access to inet services by
  IP, and provides logging of all accepted and denied connections. [11]

* IP Filter - A free packet filter, suitable for use for firewalling. [12]

* nmap - The premier port scanner. Very useful for auditing systems. [13]

* anonftpd - Dan Bernstein's read-only anonymous ftp daemon. Useful if you
  must allow anonymous ftp downloads. [14]

* tcpdump - a packet sniffer. Yes, I know that Solaris comes with snoop.
  Use tcpdump and like it. [15]

* qmail - Bernstein's mail transfer agent. A good way to be rid of
  sendmail. [16]

* argus - a free intrusion-detection tool. [17]

[ I hear tripwire is good {blakboot} ]

Conclusion
----------

If all of these steps are taken, I believe that it is possible to "raise
the bar" sufficiently that most compromises of Solaris servers can be
prevented. This is obviously not a recipe for total security. Most of the
advice in this paper consists of removing functionality from the OS in
order to increase its security. This is not possible in all applications,
so the kind of host-based security described here should always be
implemented as part of a broader plan, which includes carefully-written
policies and operating procedures. Other mechanisms for increasing a
site's overall security (eg. firewalls, IDS, vulnerability scanning,
careful user education) should not be neglected.

Appendix
--------

The accompanying code is an example of a semi-automated way to implement
some of the modifications advocated here. It is just that: an example.
It was not meant to be a comprehensive or extensible piece of software. I
am aware that products like Dan Farmer's TITAN [7] are available, and they
are probably more suitable for intensive use.

I plan on doing at least one music review per article, with bands being
chosen by different people, and getting reviewed by at least 2 others.
Each reviewer will give the song a ranking from 1 to 5 in 4 categories:
Originality, Talent, Production (how well the song was put together
and/or recorded), and a fourth category ranking how much the reviewer
liked the song. Thus, a score of a 20 is perfect. Observe:

Since this is the first one, I'm choosing a band I found on garageband.com
called "Regrets". We reviewed their song "Hate This" this issue. Their
homepage can be found here:

I was immediately impressed by the drummer in this track. He's tight,
relatively complex, and mixed rather well. The band tends to stick with
the tried and true "hardcore" sound, but with a drummer like that, they're
liable to get real big real quick. The vocalist is mediocre, and could
liven up the song by adding a bit more melody. The guitars sound far too
fuzzy for my tastes, and it's hard to distinguish if they're playing one
chord or another. The 3 riffs they do play are decent, but similar enough
that it seems a touch repetitive. (Then again, what song isn't, to a
certain degree) The track could have been mixed better, as the vocals
tended to fade to the background. All in all, I would pay for a ticket to
see Regrets play live.

"Hate This" by Regrets certainly does its job well.  It's a heavy
aggressive, ear pleasing (if you like metal, that is) track.  However, its
real job seems to be that of filling a niche. "Hate This" is good to the
point that you *swear* Regrets is a popular band.  You *swear* you've
heard "Hate This" before.  They're not, and you probably haven't, but
that's the niche "Hate This" fills.  

The guitars in "Hate This" are good (where have i heard that riff
before?), and the lyrics very angry, and very distorted (maybe a bit
much - slightly hard to understand.) the song flows really well, and
the background sounds blend in well. Not a bad song - in fact, I like it.
Just sad that they don't apply thier obvious talent more, instead of
sticking behind the "safe" metal front.

Euchlid's review
--------------
Originality - 2.5
Talent      - 4
Production  - 3
I Like It   - 3.5

Originality only got a 2.5 out of 5 because I think I've heard it before.
Talent was not quite 5 due to singer being a bit crass but points for
kickass factor. Drums were a bit hollow sounding and the intro went on a
bit too long. All in all, a good rockin' tune, lacking slightly in
originality but making up for it in aggression. Vocals sounded a bit raw
in a tinny way but the drums kicked ass and the song really hit the spot. 

Overall rating
--------------
Originality - 2.67
Talent      - 4.33
Production  - 3.00
I Like It   - 3.83
Total       - 13.83/20.00 (69.15%)
