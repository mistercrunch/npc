  The Solaris Security Tool Readme File :
=============================================================================

The Solaris Security Tool [soltool2x] is a bash script, it can detect
exploitable programs, it can exploit programs, and it can fix them, the
usage details are :

soltool2x -scan   : Will scan the system for exploitable programs and write
                    a report to /tmp/report for you to view, it will also
                    echo results to the terminal by default.

soltool2x -root   : Uses the list of exploitable programs written by the
                    scanner in /tmp/suidprogs to determine which exploits
                    should be run to test security.

soltool2x -fix    : This will fix any exploitable programs, you must be root
                    to use this option however.

Version 0.55 of soltool [soltool25] is for SunOS 5.5.x (solaris 2.5.x) boxes,
and version 0.54 [soltool24] is for use with SunOS 5.4 boxes (solaris 2.4),
both versions are included in the soltool.tgz package, as most modules can be
shared.

I hope you all benefit from using this tool.
