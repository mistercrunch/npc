IJ#6 Errata
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately several mistakes were made in NuKE InfoJournal #6.
Article #4 ("IRIS Guide") was written by Nitro-187, not Ned-239 as
indicated in some copies of the InfoJournal.  In article #2 ("A Guide to
the North American Numbering System"), by Nowhere Man, the non-published
number percentage chart should list Bakersfield, California as being in
area code 805.  We apologize for any inconvenince to our readers or
writers.


Two Years Of NuKE!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This month marks the second year of NuKE's existance!  NuKE was founded
in August 1991 as an H/P group local to 514 (Montreal, Canada).  Since
then NuKE has matured and evolved in to an international pro-virus
group with a worldwide network and many inovative products.  Two
years may not seem like much, but there have been very few "groups"
that have lasted this long...


News From Europe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NuKE now has four sites in Europe, adding Land of Lost Souls in
Sofia, Bulgaria (sysop:  Winnie the Pooh).  Winnie is working on adding
sites in the former USSR and other parts of Eastern Europe.  Savage
Beast reports that sites are under consideration in Spain; he is unable
to add any French sites because of overzealous computer crime laws in
that country.  A Belgian site is on the way, too.  Besides Land of Lost
Souls, NuKE maintains three boards in Switzerland, one in the French-
speaking areas and two in the German-speaking areas.  NuKE's European branch
is finally growning again after the closing of several of its sites due
to hardware problems, personal difficulties, and police raids.


NuKE Site Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cybernetic Violence, NuKE's world headquarters, now has a new number.      
It can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at +1 514 426 9194.        
The old number is no longer valid!  Cybernetic Violence (sysop:  Pure      
Energy) is located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and runs 24 hours/day      
7 days/week at 14.4k v.32bis.  Cybernetic Violence is also the central
hub of NuKENet.
                                                                           
The Hell Pit (sysop:  Hades), located in Chicago, Illinois, USA, has
upgraded its modem and is now running at 14.4k v.32bis.  The Hell Pit
can be reached 24 hours/day 7 days/week at +1 708 459 7267.

                                                                           
New 500 Area Code                                                          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                          
In July 1993 Bellcore, the agency designated to assign area codes          
and exchanges (NXXs) for the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean,              
announced that starting sometime in August (pending U.S. government        
approval) it will allocate numbers in the 500 NPA for use by               
personal communication services.  Exchanges will be handed out             
to corporations if they show a real need -- already AT&T and               
Atlantic Bell have asked for exchanges.  In the future, NPA 500            
will probably also be used for cellular phones, pagers, and other          
mobile services.                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                           
Quelle Horrible!  Rock Steady French?!                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                     
In an interview done by Netta Gilboa of _Gray Areas_ Magazine              
(an excellent publication, highly recommended) with Urnst Kouch,           
published in Gray Areas no. 3 and reprinted in Computer Underground Digest 
vol. 5 no. 44, Urnst Kouch states in error that "Rock Steady is            
French-Canadian."  We here at NuKE would like to make it very clear that   
Rock Steady is not French, never was French, and never will be French.     
Not everyone who lives in Quebec is a Francophone...                       
                                                                           
                                                                           
NuKENet -- One Year Old And Still Growing!                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                 
This summer marks the first anniversary of the creation of NuKENet.        
NuKENet began in mid-1992 as a mail link between Cybernetic Violence
in Canada and Total Mayhem in Australia.  It has since grown into          
a huge multinational network with sites in Europe, Africa, Australia,      
and North America.  In fact, NuKENet can now be reached via the FidoNet    
backbone at NUKE_THEWORLD -- request it today!

Area Split For Alabama                                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     
On July 22, 1993 South Central Bell announced that Alabama will become     
the first state to gain an interchangable (NXX) area code.  In 1995 area   
code 205 will split; Huntsville and Birmingham will remain in 205, while   
Montgomery and Mobile will move to area code *334*.  More details
will be published as they become available.                                
                                                                           
The following chart summerizes the remaining North American area code

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                         
Special thanks to Vest from 708 for an intresting tidbit of information --
spent three volt lithium batteries (model number CR-2032) will register    
as nickles in coin-operated vending machines!  Use old, exhausted          
batteries only, though, since new batteries are around US$2.00 each...     
This has only been tested in the U.S., but the CR-2032 is even closer      
in circumference and weight to the Canadian nickle.  If you call around, you
might be able to pick up bags of spent batteries for "recycling."  Note:
this information is for informational purposes only, and is meant to alert
owners of coin-operated devices so that such fraudulent acts might be      
detected and prevented.


Tough Swiss Anti-Piracy Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In response to rampant piracy throughout the country the Swiss government
has enacted tough new anti-piracy laws that force people convicted of
using pirated software to name the person(s) providing the software or
face additional penalties.  In Switzerland piracy has been particularly
bad, with most businesses using pirated software and some huge pirate
boards charging up to US$500 for unlimited access to copyrighted programs.
Viruses are not affected by the new law:  possessing and creating viruses
are still legal in Switzerland.


Anti-Virus Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Savage Beast has conducted experiments with various anti-virus products
and has concluded that "a lot of them only look good...they're really
shit."  No surprise there...however Savage has provided us with scientific
data to back up his claims.  Below are the results of scanning with the
latest versions (as of July 1993) of various virus scanners -- judge for
yourself:

Product     Maker          Virus Tested  Virus Found  MTE Tested  MTE Found
~~~~~~~     ~~~~~          ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~

XScan       Anyware                2547         2151         200        200

As you can see, even the "best" products (F-Prot, XScan, SCAN) will miss
between 15% and 20% of current viruses.  Even if you think your computer
is "protected" from viruses you can still get a virus from one out of five
infected programs...and that's not counting MTE-using viruses -- only three
of the scanners provide acceptable protection against the Mutation Engine,
which has been out for over two and a half years.  Each time you put a
new disk in your floppy drive, ask yourself if this might be the "1 in 5."

With international telephone services becoming more and more integrated and
international calls becoming more and more common, it only makes sense than
calling cards would also evolve to ease international calling.  AT&T       
Calling Cards are usable to call back to the U.S. from over 170 different  
countries, and to even call *between* 46 countries outside the U.S. (called
AT&T World Connect<tm> service).  The AT&T USADirect Service<tm> is        
available in over 110 countries.  This service connects you immediately    
back to an English-speaking AT&T operator in the U.S., who will take your  
calling card number and place your call for you.  The following is the     
procedure for using USADirect:                                             
                                                                           
1. Dial the USADirect access number for the country you're calling from.   
                                                                           
2. An English-language voice prompt will ask for the telephone number      
   you are calling.  Enter the area code and seven-digit phone number.     
                                                                           
3. After the tone, enter your 14-digit AT&T Calling Card number, which     
   includes the last four digits, your PIN.  If you're calling collect,    
   press zero for an English-speaking operator.                            
                                                                           
If you are at a telephone that does not have access to automated service,  
simply wait for the English-speaking AT&T operator to greet you. To call   
from country to country using World Connect<tm> service, please wait for   
the AT&T operator to assist you.  The operator will ask for your AT&T      
Calling Card number and place the international call for you.  To place    
additional calls, press # after your party hangs up and follow the voice   
prompts.                                                                   
                                                                           
To call 800 numbers, ask the AT&T operator to connect you.  Unfortunately, 
she will only connect calls to AT&T 800 customers...however, this USADirect
service can be used by people who live outside the U.S. to reach 800       
numbers.  You don't need to have an AT&T Calling Card to do this.          
                                                                           
Use your regular AT&T Calling Card number, not the international number.

Notice that most numbers include 011, the international dialing prefix in  
the U.S. and Canada, or 288, "ATT" on the telephone keypad...  Note that
Canada is not included in the list since AT&T Calling Cards can be used in 
Canada the same way they are used in the U.S. (0+NPA+NXX-XXXX or placed    
through the operator).  The following countries will accept AT&T Calling   
Cards, but access to USADirect is restricted to special phones at certain  
places that Americans tend to congregate (hotels, airports, rail stations, 
etc.):  Barbados, Ethiopia, Mexico, Qatar, Romania, St. Lucia, Seychelles  
Islands, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, Uganda, and  
Yemen.                                                                     
                                                                           
AT&T USADirect is an easy way to call the U.S. from abroad.  Of course,    
you have to have an AT&T Calling Card to use the service...  Happily, AT&T 
will issue calling cards to people who do not use AT&T long distance       
service, including people who do not live in the USA.  Call (800) 525 7955 
for more information on obtaining an AT&T Calling Card outside the U.S. (or
call (800) 222 0300 if you want to obtain a calling card billed to your    
U.S. home phone line).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% Cellular System Operation %

The Cellular Mobile Telephone Systems is a low-powered, full duplex, radio/
telephone which operates between 800 and 900 Mhz, using multiple transceiver
sites linked to a central computer for coordination. The sites, or "cells",
named for their honeycomb shape, cover a range of three to six, or more, miles.
(five to nine kilometres) in each direction. Their range is limited only by
certain natural or man-made objects. 

The cells overlap one another and operate at different transmitting and 
receiving frequencies in order to eliminate cross-talk when transmitting from
cell to cell. Each cell can accommodate up to 45 different voice channel 
transceivers. When a cellular phone is activated, it searches available 
channels for the strongest signal and locks on to it. While in motion, if 
signal strength begins to fade, the telephone will automatically switch signal
frequencies or cells as necessary without operator assistance. It fails to
find an acceptable signal, it will display an "out of service" or "no service"
message, indicating that it has reached the limit of its range and is unable to
communicate.


% Identification %

Each mobile telephone has a unique identification number which allows the Mobile
Telephone Switching Office (MTSO) to track and coordinate all mobile phones in 
its service area. This ID number is known as the Electronic Security Number 
(ESN). The ESN and Telephone Number are NOT the same. The ESN is permanent 
number engraved into a memory chip called a PROM or EPROM, located in the
telephone chassis. 

This number cannot be changed through programming as the telephone number
can, although it can be replaced. Each time the telephone is used, it 
transmits its ESN to the MTSO by means of DTMF tones during the dialling
sequence. The MTSO can determine which ESN's are good or bad, thus individual
numbers can be banned from use within the system.

Call Switching 

Cell sites switching is done automatically by the MTSO. The MTSO constantly
monitors signal strength data of both the caller and the receiver. To maintain
signal quality, when signal strength begins to fade, the MTSO locates the next
best cell site and re-routes the channels to maintain the communications link.
The switch takes approximately 300 milliseconds and is not noticeable to the
user. All switching is handled by computer, with the control channels telling
each cellular unit when and where to switch.


% The Numeric Assignment Module (NAM) %

A Numeric Assignment Module, or NAM, is a programmable, read-only-memory (PROM).
The NAM holds a limited amount of data, usually only 128 or 256 bits. NAM's 
used are typically made by either NEC or Signetics. Common chip numbers are 
82S23, 82S123 or equivalent. Other NAM's are manufactured by National 
Semiconductors, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, AMD and others. The NAM is actually
a 32-word by 8 bit PROM which is programmed with a PROM programmer/burner. The
32x8 PROM (256 bits, 32 word by 8 bit) bits are like fuses. A programmer will
trigger certain fuses within the NAM in order to give the phone a unique
identity and certain options. 

NAM's are easy to purchase. Only the number of the chip is needed to buy one.
Consulting the latest issue of an IC MASTER is one way to determine what's 
inside the chip and who distributes it. 

The NAME is used to store the Mobile Identification Number (MIN), Lock Code,
the Home Systems Identification number (SIDH), and various other system
data. From the beginning address of the NAM, 00, you will find the System
Identification Home number (SIDH). Each market allows for two systems. These 
two digits are even for the wire-line and odd for the non-wireline. 

There are two kinds of NAMs used in cellular telephones:
"TRI-STATE" and "OPEN COLLECTOR" It is _mandatory_ to identify the type of
NAM in your cellular telephone before attempting to replace it. After it has
been identified, any of the electronic supply companies should be able to 
supply a replacement. A TRI-STATE NAM can be used in over 95% of the cellular
telephones on the market today containing replaceable NAM's.

*** The NEC cellular series will _only_ accept tri-state NAM's ***

The identify the NAM chip compare the numbers in the READILY AVAILABLE NAME
TYPES table to the various chips on the circuit board for a match. The NAM 
chip is usually factory mounted on a ZIF socket.

*** Motorola handheld phones, require special NAM's. Try calling the 
    cellular phone stores in your area. ***

% Cell Terms for the above abbreviations %

A/B : A switch located on the mobile telephone that allows the user to select
      which frequency black (carrier) he or she wishes to use. Some telephones
      have an internal switch from one block to the other when service is not
      available on the pre-set block. 

ACCOLC : Access Overload Class. There is no standard in use within the 
         United States at this time. This system offers priority depending
         on how it is selected in the event of system overload. Typically
         set to 0 plus the last digit of the phone number to provide random
         loading. Originally, when the Federal government began designing
         cellular systems, they intended to give emergency vehicles (such as
         police, ambulances, and Fire Departments) codes that would allow them
         priority over other subscribers, to communicate during emergencies.

EE : End to End signalling. DTMF signals are sent through the lines to
     signal the end of a conversation. A tone code is also used to access
     long distance carriers, to signal your answering machine, or to access 
     your voice mail.

GIM : Group Identification Mark. This is a two-digit number assigned by the
      cellular carrier which determines roaming rights throughout the system.
      As cellular systems are upgraded, the GIM will be on line real time,
      requiring all NAM information, including the Mobile Identification 
      Number (MIN), to be validated before a subscriber is allowed to call
      outside of their home area. 

IPCH : Initial Paging Channel. 334 - wireline systems. 333 - non-wirelne 
       systems.

LOCK DIGIT : This field is a one - four digit code. It locks the cellular
             telephone to prevent unauthorized use. The lock code is 
             programmed into the NAM, and is frequently factory set to
             either 1234 or 0004.

LU : Local Use flag. Occasionally used to initialize approval for local calls.
     The cellular carrier insures that local users are registered with a
     local system. Hackers use the Roaming Technique to avoid this 
     complication.

HA : Horn Alert. 0 or 1. A 1 in this field tells the cellular phone that
     this feature is available.

HF : Hands Free. 0 or 1. A 1 in this field tells the cellular phone that
     this feature is enabled.

MIN1 : Mobile Identification Number. The telephone number assigned to 
       the telephone by the cellular carrier. If the telephone is brought
       in, or a new one is purchased, the cellular service assigns this 
       number for both billing and for receiving calls. 7 or 10 digits in
       length.

MIN2: The area code of the cellular phone number.

MIN MARK : Can be 0 or 1. The home station sends extended address data upon
           origination and page response.

REP : Repertory dialling. Speed dialling. Some phones are capable of storing
      100 numbers.

SCM : Station Class Mark. Identifies the phone as either a hand-held or 
      transportable/fixed cellular phone. SCM is determined by the transmit
      power of the phone (0.8 watts for hand-held, 1.2, 3.0 watts for 
      transportable/fixed)

SIDH : Home System Id. Code used to identify the Home system where the cellular
       telephone is registered. (See the Home System Id Listing Article)


% What About the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) %

An Electronic Serial Number, or ESN, is the unique, 32-bit, eleven-digit
serial number for each cellular telephone sold. The ESN is transmitted each
time a cellular telephone places a call. It is used to verify whether a 
cellular telephone is registered with an authorized carrier. A dealer needs 
the ESN in order to restore the service on a used phone. 

The first three numbers are the manufacturer's decimal code. The fourth and
fifth are reserved, and may contain any digit, zero through nine. The 
remaining six numbers are the decimal serial number for each individual
phone.

      Manufacturers    Reserved    Decimal serial number
         ESN code        0-9          of the phone

The decimal serial number can occasionally be found within the documentation
provided with a new cellular phone. In some cases, the ESN is engraved on
the telephone itself, but this is not universal with all manufacturers. 

If a cellular telephone has been disconnected for any reason, the ESN must be
provided in order for service to be reestablished with the Carrier. Each 
manufacturer assigns their own ESN to every mobile telephone. Therefore, a
single ESN may be duplicated by one or more manufacturers. A hacker may 
bypass this system by altering other system information and leaving the 
particular telephone's ESN unaltered. 

*** CHANGING the ESN is THE ONLY SURE WAY to minimize any risk of getting
    caught ***

The ESN is assigned at the factory, and in almost all cases, is the only 
element that cannot be altered by use of the programming sequence without 
removing it and replacing it with a new chip. The ESN chip is always factory
soldered and occasionally epoxide onto the circuit board to reduce tampering.
A decent hacker will be able to remove it and install a ZIF (Zero Insertion
Force) socket in its place. The ZIF socket makes it easy to replace the ESN
chip at any time. The NAM chip usually factory installed in a ZIF socket.


% How to locate the ESN %

Several methods are available for locating a cellular telephone ESN. These 
methods are as follows:

  1. The ESN is normally located on a PROM. The ESN is intentionally made to
     be unerasable on most cellular phones to prevent the fraudulent use of
     the phone. The PROM is programmed and installed at the factory with the
     security fuse blown in order to prevent tampering. The ESN code on a PROM
     may be read by removing the PROM from the cellular telephone and placing
     it in a PROM reader to obtain a memory map of the chip. The ESN PROM is
     distinctive because of its size and package. The ESN PROM will have 
     between sixteen and twenty-eight leads, in a square or rectangular 
     package. This is a BIPOLAR PROM. Most cellular telephones will accept
     the National Semiconductor 32x8 PROM, which cannot be reprogrammed. 
     If a hacker knew the ESN of a particular cellular telephone, it is 
     possible to trace the memory map by installing the PROM in a reader and
     obtaining a fuse map by use of the READ MASTER switch of the PROM 
     programmer. Many PROM programmers contain a VERIFY and COMPARE switch
     to provide a comparison of one PROM's programming with another. 

     This may be a complicated task for the first-timer, so it is 
     recommended that a cellular telephone (bag phones are best) is
     purchased strictly for the purpose of dismantling it in order to locate
     the ESN. This will probably destroy the telephone, but will provide
     valuable experience.

 *** Some of the newer hand-held phone manufacturers (Motorola) are changing
     to VLSI (very large scale integration) which combine several other chips
     with the ESN chip, preventing hackers from programming those ships. Bag
     phones are almost an easy hack. ***
 
  2. Hire a "Cellular Consultant." A consultant is someone who works as an
     installer and/or programmer, and would be able to show the user where
     the ESN is located.

  3. Get in touch with a local cellular telephone servicer and simply ask 
     for their help in identifying the memory chips in the telephone. Most
     technicians will help without too much difficulty. (It's called 
     social engineering)

  4. As a last resort, remove each memory chip and place it in a PROM reader.
     When one if found that registers a reading, the ESN has been located.

  5. Take the phone to a cellular service provider and ask them to provide
     the ESN. They are often requested for insurance purposes, and can be
     supplied easily enough by use of a Cellular Service Monitor. The monitor
     reads the transmissions from the telephone and indicates the specific ESN.

  6. The ESN is also normally provided with the original user information, if
     available. 

  7. ESN chips may be identified by some of the following manufacturers'
     markings: 
        AMD, AMPS, DM, HARRIS, HM, MOTOROLA, MB, MMI, NS, NSC, TBP, TI.

*** ESN Readers are also available for personal purchase. See "Buyers Guide" 
    article for further information on Personal Readers. ***


% Replacing the ESN %

Now that you've located the ESN, how do you replace it? The ESN needs to be
unsoldered in order to remove it. The user should be familiar with soldering
techniques, extra care must be taken not to touch any of the surrounding
connections, solder joints or chips. I do recommend you get a de-soldering
pen, you should get the pen with the suction pump, it will remove the 
solder nicely. Chip pullers and de-soldering tools are available from any
electronical semiconductors store, even Radio Shack. 

The following steps will aid in ESN removal:

1. Unscrew and remove the entire PC board containing the ESN. This is done 
   to prevent inadvertent damage to the rest of the unit during the 
   removing process. 

2. Once you have determined which is the correct ESN chip, it is wise to make
   a sketch of it to insure that it is replaced in the proper place and
   direction. (Don't laugh, just DO IT.)

3. Using extreme caution, unsolder and remove the chip from the board. 

4. Solder in a ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket to provide for easier removal
   and placement of additional chips. 

*** WARNING: No retailer, manufacturer or servicer will work on a unit in
     which the ESN has been removed. In addition, it is their responsibility
     to notify the proper authorities of such tampering. So if you screw up
     get a _trustable_ friend to help or trash the unit. ***

5. Once the ZIF socket has been installed, reinsert the ESN and attempt to
   place a call. If the call is successfully completed, the ESN has been 
   properly removed and replaced. If the call does not go through, recheck
   the leads on the ZIF socket for proper installation.

6. Insert the ESN in a PROM reader to be sure it gets a reading. Use the
   search mode to identify the Manufacturer's Serial Number, in order to
   identify the first three addresses of the ESN on the PROM where 
   reprogramming will be done. 


% Programming the ESN %

Insert the ESN in a PROM programmer to be sure it gets a reading. Use the
search mode and "read master" to identify the Manufacturer's Serial Number,
in order to identify the first three addresses of the ESN on the PROM fuse
map where programming the new chip will be done. Record the locations of the
ESN. Use the "edit buffer" command to change one number of the ESN. A new PROM
is then programmed with the PROM programmer. Instructions will come with the
programmers. 

The entire PROM reading/emulating/programming process is relatively fast when 
a personal computer is available. (Some PROM programmers allow RS-232 interface
with the IBM-PC clone, with the help of a computer program.) This will allow
the use of an EPROM emulator and allow you to program (burn) PROM chips 
directly from the computer. 

The Installation of the ZIF socket makes it possible to insert an EPROM
emulator into the socket. The hacker will often try a hundred or more ESN codes
before finding a good one. Use of an EPROM Emulator will allow the hacker to
load ESN codes without burning EPROMs until a good code is found and will 
save the hacker hundreds of chips with the wrong codes programmed into them.

Use the emulator and the code read from the original chip, re-code a new PROM.
Change the original ESN code by one number. Load the emulator and try making
a phone call. Keep trying this process until a call is completed. The entire
process is often completed in less than one-two hours.

A Programmer for use with a personal computer will allow the hacker to store 
codes for easy editing and reprogramming new chips when the Cellular carrier
blocks the particular ESN is use. Use the working ESN code from above to burn
a new PROM and insert into the ZIF.

*** Most smart hackers also change the SIDH and MIN on the NAM in order 
    to minimize the possibility of being caught. ***
*** Remember Hackers will always be smart about who they are calling and
    any traceable calling habits. ***

Some other manufacturer's cellular telephones are privately labelled for 
certain companies. However, when reprogramming a cellular telephone, any
valid ESN code will work on any phone. The numbers listed bellow are all

% The ROAMing Technique %

Cellular telephones have a ROAM mode, which indicates that the user is in an
area other than his or her "home" area. This ability allows the user to place
a call in an area away from his own, such as another state, and allows the 
phone to be used when travelling or commuting. However, it is impossible for the
local MTSO to know when an "outsider" is on-line in their area, therefore,
incoming calls are not available when ROAMing unless a Call Following feature
is activated by the cellular carrier.

Cellular carriers have common agreements to cross-bill applicable charges, 
including extra charges for being an "outsider", when a cellular user takes
advantage of the roaming capabilities of a cellular telephone. 

It is possible for a user to make a call when ROAMing and not be billed. The
local area MTSO may put the call through and bill it to the registered user
at a later date, only to learn that the caller was using a stolen number. Keep
in mind that all call information is recorded and can be traced. It is 
possible for the authorities to follow up with the "called" party. The calls
most frequently followed up on are calls repeatedly made to the same number
(the user's home number, family members, friends, etc) and noticeable trends
in calling (calling from the same cell each time, calling at the same time of
day, the same area, etc.) 

The "ROAMing Technique" is frequently used, due to the fact that carriers 
normally will not commit to the time and expense of tracing a call to recoup
the small amount lost on short calls (less than one percent of these calls are
deemed a sufficient loss to be followed up on). 

This method requires the NAME be programmed with a fake SIDH (refer to the 
Home System ID article). This may provide access for a limited time. A smart
hacker knows to ignore any message to contact the cellular carrier. 


% Clone Approach %

A cellular phone can also be reprogrammed to imitate another cellular phone.
This is done for two reasons. First, the owner of two cellular phones does
not want to pay two individual service charges since he only uses one phone at 
a any given time. Secondly, a hacker wants to make free phone calls that will 
be charged to another cellular user. This approach will work until the wrongly
charged user reports these charges to the carrier at the end of the month
when they get their bill. Called numbers will probably be investigated for the
source. 

The entire ESN and NAM (MIN components) are required to accomplish cloning.
The NAM parameters of one phone should be programmed into the other. The ESN
PROM of the first should be read and programmed into the second. The idea is
to make both phones appear to the carrier as the same phone. If an ESN of a
particular phone is not known, then a Cellular Service Monitor or ESN Reader
will be necessary. Most cellular service centres will have one or you can
look in at the Buyer's Guide Article. 

Only one phone can be used at any given time. Both phones, will try respond
to incoming calls. The phone that offers the most powerful link will be 
connected to break the connection of the other, weaker phone link. 


Refer to the first part on how to program the ESN/NAM.
