Introduction Bitches,

Ok, so issue four, wow, I thought this was suppossed to be the big transition issue....guess not.

Telus, Payphone working together

VANCOUVER (CP) - Telus Corp. will provide operator services across the 
country to Canada Payphone Corp. 
under the terms of a three-year agreement announced Monday. "Working with
 Canada Payphones enables us 
both to further progress our national expansion goals," said Joe Grech, 
president of Telus Global Trading

Telus Corp. of Burnaby, B.C., is Canada's second-largest phone company, after Bell Canada of Montreal.
Both companies have been expanding beyond their respective regional bases to become national carriers.

Terry Novak, Canada Payphone's executive director of sales and operations, said the 
company expects a 
$1.2-million increase in revenues from collect, credit-card and other calls over the
 three-year agreement 
with Telus.

Telus didn't outline how much the deal is worth to it.

Canada Payphone, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, began operating payphones and 
Internet kiosks in 1999 
under the AT&T Canada brand name.

Hacker breaks into U.S. wireless network, reads Secret Service files
 
Canadian Press

January 13, 2005


WASHINGTON (AP) - A hacker broke into a wireless carrier's network over at least seven months and read e-mails 
and personal computer files of hundreds of customers, including the Secret Service agent investigating the hacker, 
the U.S. government said Wednesday.

The hacker obtained an internal Secret Service memorandum and part of a mutual-assistance legal treaty from Russia. 
The documents contained "highly sensitive information pertaining to ongoing...criminal cases," court records said.

The break-in targeted the network for Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile USA, which has 16.3 million customers in the 
United States. It was discovered during a broad Secret Service investigation, Operation Firewall, which targeted 
underground hacker organizations known as Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits.

The hacker was able to view the names and Social Security numbers of 400 customers, all of whom were notified in 
writing about the break-in, T-Mobile said. It said customer credit card numbers and other financial information 
never were revealed.

"Safeguarding T-Mobile customer information is a top priority for the company," said a spokesman, Peter Dobrow.

He said T-Mobile discovered the break-in late in 2003 and "immediately took steps that prevented any further access 
to this system."

Court records said the hacker had access to T-Mobile customer information from at least March through October last 
year.

The Secret Service said its agent, Peter Cavicchia, should not have been using his personal handheld computer for 
government work. Cavicchia, a respected investigator who has specialized in tracking hackers, was a T-Mobile customer 
who coincidentally was investigating the T-Mobile break-in, said court documents and a Secret Service spokesman,
Jonathan Cherry.

Cavicchia, who won the Secret Service's medal of valour for his actions in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, resigned 
to work in the private sector. He said he was not asked to leave and was cleared during an internal investigation into 
whether he had improperly revealed sensitive information or violated agency rules.

Nicolas Lee Jacobsen, 21, of Santa Ana, Calif., a computer engineer, has been charged with the break-in in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. Investigators said they traced the hacker's online activities to a hotel near Buffalo, N.Y., where 
Jacobsen was staying.

Court records said an online offer in March 2004, traced to Jacobsen, claimed hackers could look up the name, Social 
Security number, birth date and passwords for voice mails and e-mails for T-Mobile customers.

Jacobsen, who was arrested in October in California, has been released on a $25,000 bail posted by his uncle, who was 
ordered to keep his own personal computer locked up so Jacobsen couldn't use it.

The case against Jacobsen was first reported by the website Security Focus, which is owned by Symantec Corp.

Cherry, the Secret Service spokesman, said the agency's own e-mail servers were not affected by the T-Mobile break-in.

"The account was a personal account of a Secret Service agent that was for a time compromised," Cherry said.

Cavicchia's T-Mobile handheld computer contained "very limited investigative material" that was obtained by the hacker, 
Cherry said, adding no government investigations were compromised. Cherry said Secret Service policies prohibit agents from 
keeping work-related files on personal computers.

Cavicchia said Secret Service supervisors frequently e-mailed documents and other files to his wireless computer to review 
while he was travelling.

CRTC hits soliciting by phone

TORONTO -- Telemarketers will face stricter rules in Canada in the coming months, but the federal telephon
e regulator says it 
lacks the muscle to impose a U.S.-style national Do Not Call registry. The Canadian Radio-television and 
Telecommunications 
Commission said yesterday a Do Not Call registry is a good idea, but the CRTC also said it isn't equipped
 to administer such a 
list and doesn't have the power to enforce it properly.

Commission chairman Charles Dalfen said a registry should be administered by separate agency, not the CRTC.
 In the meantime, 
the CRTC will impose stricter requirements on telemarketers.

He admitted the the federal government's problems with the gun registry gave pause to the CRTC.

But even without that, the CRTC decided it lacks the power to impose fines on rule-breakers -- unlike its U.S. 
counterpart which 
can impose fines of $11,000 US per nuisance call made to people who register on the Do Not Call list.

CRTC regulations already require that telemarketers maintain a Do Not Call list and respect requests for three years. 
Telemarketers 
must also identify themselves and provide their phone number if requested.

Starting in October, they will be required to ask whether consumers want to be excluded from all
 lists maintained by the
 telemarketing 
agency, not just from a list used for a particular client.

EvilStein writes "Vonage is announcing plans for a WiFi phone that will allow Vonage subscribers to
 make VoIP calls from any 
WiFi hotspot. The phones are said to cost about $100. This looks to be a pretty cool setup and might
 rattle the wireless 
industry quite a bit if they pull it off." Another story notes that battery life won't be as good as
 existing cell phones.

And For the Sake of Public Interest:

*************************************************************
*A MOBLIE SOCIETY--OH WHERE OH WHERE DID THE PHONE BOOTH GO?*
*************************************************************

By Brad Stanhope - From some website

FAIRFIELD - Need help from Superman? Better hope he got dressed before starting the day.Phone booths - where
 the Man of Steel 
changed into his superhero clothing - are pretty much a thing of the past. And pay phones of all kinds may fol
low them into oblivion.
"You can't find pay phones," said Victoria Ortiz of Fairfield - standing about 30 feet from two unused phones on West 
Texas 
Street. "And when you can, a lot don't work. You used to be able to go to a gas station and find them."

You can still find them - but not as easily as in the past. In the era of cell phones - latest estimates say 
there are 150 million 
portable phones for 295 million Americans - the neighborhood pay phone is going the way of the 8-track player
 and laser disc.
"There were 300,000 (pay phones in California five years ago) and it's now 200,000 (actually about 172,000)," 
said Tom Keene, 
the president of the California Pay Phone Association. "But we think that it will be 100,000 or more for some
 time in this state. 
It's still cheaper than other options - cell phone calling plans or prepaid phone cards."
The need for pay phones is evident to Debbie Smith, the assistant manager of Circle K on Parker Road near
 Travis Air Force Base.
"Actually, our phone gets quite a bit of activity," she said. "It's usually people waiting for someone on
 base - mostly people who 
don't have cell phones."

That's the point.
Calling plans sink pay phones. Cell phones are the bane of the pay phone industry. "My impression is that 
(the decrease) is 
directly attributable to cell phone service becoming mass market," said Martin Mattes, counsel for the pay 
phone group. "When 
cell phones were primarily a business service, they charged higher rates and didn't compete with pay phones. 
But when cellular 
companies put in the monthly calling plans, people stopped caring how many minutes they used the cell phones. 
When everybody 
started having cell phones, it hurt."

The peak for pay phones was the late 1990s.
"From the 1960s to the '80s, there was a slow decline in pay phones," Mattes said. "In the mid-'80s, it turned around
 and gradually 
increased - and then in 1995-2000, there was rapid growth. The last four or five years, there's been a rapid decline 
(with the 
increase in calling plans)." That's evident to Gina Tomlinson, a Fairfield resident, who rarely sees pay phones in use. 
"Hardly 
anybody uses them now," she said. As mobile phones become ubiquitous - one study estimated 85 percent of 16-year-olds 
have a cell 
phone - the need for the corner pay phone decreased. And the use of those that remain is less than in the past.
"Typically, a phone is considered profitable if it makes over $200 in coin per month," Mattes said. "Five years ago, 
a good phone 
brought in $300."


Wrong number for crime?
In most communities, pay phones are loosely supervised - the industry in this state is regulated by the California Public
 Utilities 
Commission. But in Fairfield, the planning department requires new convenience stories to put their pay phones inside and 
not allow 
them to receive incoming calls - an effort to combat crime. "The city has some zoning authority as an element of street 
furniture," 
said Brian Miller of the city's planning department. "New convenience stores are one of our areas, but you can't retroactively
 do it."
That means the older convenience stores still have pay phones outside, although Miller said the police sometimes work with
property 
owners to get them to change.

Keene thinks Fairfield's approach is misguided.
"That is usually where there's an acceptance - and incorrect acceptance I think - that phones lead to illegal acts," he 
said. "I 
think a drug dealer is more likely to buy a prepaid cell phone. We get a bill just like the one you get at home. We have 
signs that 
say 'Are you aware this is a traceable call?' "

Richard Sherer, of Danville-based Pelican Communications, thinks Fairfield's approach is ludicrous. "Fairfield is unusual.
 They 
blame the pay phones for the drug problem - that's easier," he said. "It's hurt us financially. We were close to filing a 
lawsuit 
in there." The enforcement of such zoning rules - Fairfield is unusual, but not unique in doing so - is decreasing. "The 
last two 
years, I don't think I've been called about a new local ordinance," Mattes said. "The communities are more worried about 
preserving 
the phones rather than the problems they cause."

Future not all gloomyOne reason for pay phones is in cases of emergency, but even boosters realize that's not a mandate. 
"Congress 
wants a expansion and widespread availability of pay phones - partly for emergencies," Keene said. "But you define what's 
an emergency 
for you. If you have a bulk of people with a pocket phone (available for calling in emergencies), the public policy of 
having phones 
for emergencies is somewhat mitigated." So will the pay phone disappear? Not likely. "You have many in central cities -
 at the store 
or the tavern," Mattes said. "These have maintained better. A lot of lower-end folks don't have cell phones and 5 
percent of people 
still don't even have phones in their homes. The lower-income people really rely on the pay phones and in those areas, 
pay phones do 
better. Frankly, it's a utility for lower-income people. "And Keene said a decreasing demand doesn't mean the business 
will disappear.
"Even a quiet phone gets 200 to 250 calls a month," he said. "If a small business needed an item and it got 200 calls a
 month, that 
would be good."

Sherer, whose company is the largest privately owned pay phone company in the U.S., said a phone needs about 150 calls a
 month - 
an average of five per day - to make it. Insiders aren't giving up - they don't think pay phones will totally disappear. 
"I think 
it will settle at a certain level," Keene said. "One-third of people still don't have cell phones." But one thing should 
be noted: 
While he was talking, Keene's cell phone rang. The head of the state's pay phone association wouldn't likely need to use 
one of his 
own industry's product.

*****************************

Disclaimer

I shouldn't have to tell you that using this information to steal service
or commit fraud is a crime.  Use your common sense.

I.  Introduction

    The beige box is one of the most important tools in a phreaker's
arsenal.  However it is becoming increasing harder to find phones that have
all of functionality in the handset.  In this article I will show you how to
make a beigebox out of a $5 phone you can buy from your local WAL-MART. 

     This is intended for beginners looking to find tools to start phreaking.

II.  Equipment
     
     You are going to need some basic tools and equipment to complete this job.
     
     1. Durabrand - Model HAC PH-301
        This phone comes in a bright orange box.  You'll find it in the phone
        section at WAL-MART.  It should only cost you $5USD.  
     
     2. Test cables with shielded alligator clips.
        You can find these at your local Radio Shack for a few dollars.  It's
        always handy having some of these around to test circuits and things.
        You will need these to test the phone components an to create the 
        connector for the box.
     
     3. Electrical Tape
        You can find this any where.  I sometimes buy it from the local "every
        thing for $1" store.
    
     4. Super glue or hot glue gun.
        You will need to glue some stuff to the plastic on the phone. I used
        super glue.
     
     5. Screw Driver
        You will need a phillips head screw driver.  I recommend a cord less
        power one since you will need to screw into raw plastic. If you don't
        have one use your 31337 upper body strength.
        
     6. Soldering Iron with solder, flux and alcohol (OPTIONAL)
        I soldered all of the wires on my beige box.  You don't have to.
        You could use small wire nuts if you wanted.
     
     7. Wire Stripper / Cutter
        You should have a pair of these in your tool kit.  Make sure to get
        a pair that handles small gauge of wire for a project like this.
     

III.  Building the box
      
      After you gather all of the necessary equipment, set up a work area near
      a phone jack since you will need to test your set at various stages.
      
      The Durabrand phone has two pieces.  The handset which houses the DTMF
      pad along with the mic and earpiece.  It is connected by a small RJ
      connector to the base set which houses the ringer, the hook, and the 
      RJ11 connector for the phone jack.
      
      Disconnect the two pieces, save the chord that connects them as you will
      need it for testing purposes.
      
      Take the base set and turn it over.  You will notice four screws holding
      the thing together.  Take the screws out and open the base up.  You will
      see the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) on the bottom of the base. There will
      also be seven wires running from the PCB.  These wires connect to the
      speaker, the RJ11 connector to the jack and the small RJ connector for the
      handset.  
      
      The PCB is mounted on the base by two screws.  Unscrew the board and keep
      the screws you will need them later.  Remove the PCB, its wires and
      connectors and pull the speaker off of it's mounting.  Try to remove it
      with the foam attached.
      
      Now would be a good time to test it.  Carefully plug in all the cables and
      see if you get a dial tone.  If you don't, double check everything.  You
      may have shorted the board somehow.
      
      Now for the handset.  Remove the number indicator above the keypad.  You
      will see two small screws, remove those.  Now carefully pull the phone
      apart.  There are small plastic hooks holding the pieces together, you
      may need to use a small screwdriver or butter knife to pry the pieces
      apart.
      
      Once you have the handset apart, locate the small RJ connector at the
      bottom.  You will need to remove it.  Use your wire cutters to take the
      jack off and strip a little of the wire.  If you are soldering now is a 
      good time to tin the wires.
      
      Take the back of the handset. Tape the back of it from the top of the
      D logo to about the middle of the handset using your electrical tape.  
      Make a space large enough to mount the PCB from the cradle.  
      Now place the PCB on the back and find a place where it will mount
      smoothly.  Mine is located with the first screw directly above the back
      of the letter D in the logo.  The ringer volume switch is to the left.
      
      Mark the screw holes with a marker.  Screw the screws into the plastic
      first.  Take them out and then mount the PCB.  I placed the ringer 
      right above the ear piece on the back of the handset and glued it into
      place.  Then I taped its wires to the handset to keep it stable.
           
      The next thing you want to do is connect the wires together that had the
      small RJ connectors.  The colors will be red and green but don't think it
      is that easy.  In my case the red matched the green. Use some test leads
      to make sure the box is still working.  If it is then solder the wires.
      Or twist them together and insulate the wires.
      
      We are nearly complete. all that is left to is make the phone chord
      permanent, attach the connectors and secure the thing up.
      
      Cut the RJ11 plug off wires. Do the same with the male end of the phone
      chord.  Now the chord should only have two wires in it because it's a
      pretty cheap chord.  Strip the ends and test the connection with the
      test leads before you solder it up.  Once you have verified that it is
      working.  Connect the wires and insulate them.
      
      Now take the other end of the phone chord and cut the end off.  Strip
      the wires and tin them.  Take two of your test leads and cut them in 
      half.  I used the red and the green ones.  Solder the connectors to
      the chord and insulate them.  Use the other halves to create a dongle
      out of the male connector you cut off.  Use the dongle to test the
      box.
      
      Now you need a place to hold all of these connections.  I melted a little
      hole in the side of the phone so that the phone housing would close
      and not pinch the wires.  How you do this I will leave up to you.
      Once you have all of the wires safely tucked away in the handset you 
      can use a little hot glue to fill in the various holes in the handset
      and to protect some of the wiring and PCB.  This is keep it from getting
      too beat up out in the field.

IV.   Conclusion
      
      Now you should have a cheap beige box that you use to test the lines
      in your house.
      
      Thanks for reading this text file and I hope I've aided in your quest
      to learn how the phone system works.

In the computer enthusiast social underground, the name Microsoft is synonymous with evil, 
money whoring business practices, and poorly written, unstable software. 
This stereotype of “m$” is attached to the 
corporation by 
almost everyone in the computing scene. However, most of these people have
 not had the chance to converse 
with a Microsoft employee face to face.

A few weeks back I had the opportunity to interview a Microsoft Anti-Trust Attorney at a Uvic career fair. Nobody was 
at his display, 

so I thought I would pay him a visit. When I approached him and asked if I 
could interview him for a 
publication, he 
responded with an 
enthusiastic “yes”. Even though he agreed to be interviewed, I don’t think he would have consented to being 
recorded. 
Because of this, 
I will assign the generic name of “Charlie” to him for the interview. Anyhow, time for the questions

What does Microsoft think of the sustain ability of open source software as a business model?
 
(chuckles) No, open source software, more specifically the GPL in which it is published is 
fundamentally flawed. Think of it like this: I give you my wallet on the condition 
that whoever else wants it in it’s original state. That doesn’t sound very appealing does it? And besides, 
cost wise a Windows has a lower T.C.O (total cost of ownership) then Linux when deployed in a corporate 
environment.

But open source software is free..

Free as in Beer? Not really. Someone took the time to produce it in the first place, thus it cannot be
 totally free. Also, there have been many studies put out by reputable firms proving that Windows has a 
lower total 
cost over the long run.

It says here Charlie that part of your job is dealing with the legalities involving “hackers”. 
That is a fairly generic term, would you like to elaborate on it?

A big part of my job is the prosecuting  of the hackers who write exploits for the Windows 
operating system. It really annoys me the most is those self-righteous hackers, 
like the ones who write for 2600. They claim that all their exploits, so to speak, are covered by
 the right to freedom of speech; This usually holds true in the courts. Your not a journalist are you? 
(I shake my head) Because the Microsoft legal team is going to start to pressure congress 
in the United States to pass a bill that would prohibit the conspiracy to create software exploits, 
and the distribution 
of them.

But isn’t that a direct violation of the first amendment in the United States?

Sort of. 

Disgusted by what I had just heard, and my realizing that time was running low I thanked “Charlie”

*How to Bullshit Properly *
* Stagman                 *
***************************

EDITORS PREFACE: This bullshiting guide also works well for the aspiring Social Engineer

Your welcome (ahead of time),

Now the art of  "bullshiting" or pissing on others inferior intelects is an old well 
established form of trickery 
that could be said to trace back many years (most scholars would estimate 1969 bc) 
but for the use of 
avoiding debate and since I know better then you I have outlined here some
 guidlines 
by which you too
can become an honest bullshiter and more importantly one that people will
 believe! Just follow my steps 
and who knows maybe one day you could be as great a coniving prick as I....
 well not as great since Im
the Stagman and few step near to this greatness.

-(Important though, you must follow each step as described or you will fail)-

1.Always assume that your ideas are inherently better then those of other, 
but do so with dignity...
like tell them
"hmmm... thats a good idea,...if your a homeless crack head living in a 
card 
board condominium. Now listen to 
me before your last brain cells disolve in trying to form your next 
thought".

2. Never, I repeat never admit you have EVER been wrong before or will
 be in the future cause as 
the saying
goes "once a cunt always a lying cunt". Besides who has time to think of 
the past... 
a good bullshiter is always 
thinking of his next good scam/lie/cheat/etc. Never dwell on one thought to long
 (I like the 5 second rule, as
no one thought is better then 5 seconds of my time).

3.  Always come across as pompus... if your not to brain dead from suckling your 
meth addicted mothers
wilted tit maybe youll understand,...if not just go ahead and do society a favor 
and die.

4. If talking to a female you want to screw always just tell them the lie they are
 wanting to hear (and always involve
alcohol, or other similiar type destabilers of inhibition) like "yeah I really do 
care about you", and "oh we have so much 
in common", or my favorite "is it just me, or did we just have a connection". Oh, 
and remember to 
emphatize that this 
"means something", for some reason women are very dumb, and fall for things that 
"mean something" just be sure and 
not let them know that it only means you getting laid, and hopefully never seeing 
them again. (ps dont forget the classic
 "oh, now thats interesting".)

5. Always remember that the greatest bullshiters are also the best delegators, 
so never do anything, but always assume
responsibilty if asked, or put in a situation. the sole exception to the assuming 
responsibilty though 
is here is if your a 
bitch being delegated to, or if you woman needs any type of femine product, or 
if she is just being whiney for comfort.
No good bullshiter has time to comfort anyone, let alone any woman.

6. Always have a drink (alcohol for those of you weak tits whose livers still work). 
You will alway
 bullshit better drunk.

7. Always be braging about how great it is to be you, or how sucessfull 
you are in this, or that.
 Remember to use your
imagination here and talk about how you were voted the largest penis in 
porn, 
or how you were once a 70's Rock icon,
or how you have your own religion were your followers worship you at the 
foot of your 
throne all day,...you know 
believeable stuff.

8. Remember, deities are fallible, you are not so just do what ever you feel 
like doing when 
you feel like doing it cause
no bullshiter bows to the laws of god, or man.

9. Be sure to have lots of "beautiful" people around you because they divert 
attention and 
in that lapse of ones attention
span being focused on you you can then plan your next scheme. Because 
face it people are stupid, you are not and you
must exploit the herds weakness' at all given opportunities.

10. When in doubt refer to rule 1

Well that concludes this short self help formula for sucess in the fine acient 
art of BULLSHITLERY

An Insight into BC's Other Two Telcos:


Alright, we all know who Telus is, that big bad giant that moved here from 
Alberta in 1999. 
Like you, I too though they were The only Local Exchange Company here in BC, 
that is, until 
recently. 
As it turns out BC has two other LEC's, one of which is "Northwestel", which 
operates
primarily in the northern section of the province and the other is "CityTel," 
an LEC owned 
and operated soley by the city of Prince Rupert. And it is the only Independent 
LEC in Western
Canada

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**************
*Northwestel:*
**************


They operate primarily in the northern Territories but also in about the 
northern third of BC.
I've never been far north enough to be in Northwestel land, but here 
is a run down of the
Western Hemisphere's biggest phone company in terms of geographical 
coverage. In terms of numbers
this company serves and area of nearly 4 million square kilometers in
96 communities scattered 
throughout the north. Northwestel's operations include local telephone 
service; long distance 
communications by microwave radio, fibre optic cable and satellite; and 
advanced data communications, 
including high-speed Internet in many parts of our operating area. They 
have a subisdiary that serves
the north with cable access. Northwestel became a subsidiary of BCE Inc.
 in 1988 and of Bell Canada 
in 1999.



From their Website:

It is an enormous challenge to build and maintain world-class infrastructure to 
deliver services 
like these over such a vast and rugged area. Northwestel meets this challenge 
through a substantial 
annual capital spending program and the innovative use of technology. Our total 
investment in 
telecommunications infrastructure in the North now exceeds $500 million.


A Quick Fact Sheet:

# Operating area (km2) – 3,900,000
# Population – 110,000
# Network Access Services (NAS) – 75,194
# Number communities served - 96
# Communities served by satellite - 44
# Communities served by digital exchanges – 100%
# Toll exchanges – 4
# Kilometres of microwave radio – 7063
# Kilometres of high capacity fibre optic cable – 1439
# Long distance telephone service revenues - $ 43,100,000
# Local telephone service revenues - $ 43,400,000
# Private network, directory and other revenues - $ 39,900,000
# Supplemental Funding - $ 14,100,000
# Gross capital investment per NAS - $ 7,112
# Average full-time equivalent employees - 570

*********
*CITYTEL*
*********

CityTel is one of only 39 independent telephone companies left in Canada, 
where over 2000 once existed.
This company is owned by the City of Prince Rupert and it turns over about 
2 million of its profits to 
the city each year. Its contribution is so generous that it knocks a whole 
10% off taxes paid by residents
and businesses. It employs only 36 people and maintains about 20,000 phonel
ines on a Nortel DMS-100. (They
had a mechanical switch until 1991...)

It may seem like a weakness to be such a small company, however just the 
opposite is true. It is because 
they are so small that they are able to offer very personalized services. 
For example, recently CityTel 
began offering its own long distance service which was previously offered 
only by Telus. If residents signed
up for the Citytel plan, CityTel would call Telus to notify them that long 
distance services were cancelled with them. 
Does your local phone company offer a wake-up service? In fact, residents
 of PR are so happy with thier telephone company 
that about 75% of them choose to pay their bills in person at the office.

After being in email contacts with CityTel, I can say that they really are 
something special. They responded to my emails
within 2 or 3 days, on the other hand, I've never received a return email 
from Telus. In one such email, I was curious 
about the pay phones in Prince Rupert and they informed me that the local 
pay phones are in fact owned by CityTel, they 
cost 25 cents for local calls and that they allow only outgoing calls. But
 that remains to be seen, Telus makes a similar 
claim. They also informed me that they don't have a ringback number 
(bullshit) but each resident can just dial his or her
own number and have the phone ringback. I'm sure they have diagnosic
 version as well. They also wouldn't divulge their ANAC 
number, so if you live in PR, try 958, x11, xxx-6111, xxx-1111, a
nything else that seems obvious.

*Stealing Beer the Ninja Way*
*   "Kevin"                 *
*****************************

Hello, my name is Kevin, and I'm going to teach you how to steal beer. It's 
very simple. All you have to do is listen. I am a blackbelt in Ninpo (the 
higher order of Ninjitsu) and I have learned many things that I will simplify 
for you. OK, let's take an example ... you want to steal some beer? No 
problem ... how do you accomplish this? Easy. First you have to plan.... 
always know the layout of the store... a lot of convenient stores have their 
beer in plain sight from the cashier counter ... these are not a good place 
to steal beer from, unless there is a distraction ... in Ninjitsu it is 
taught that a target can only focus on 3 things at once ... in the case of 
the cashier ... the money, the person and the item. so whenever possible ... 
take the beer when there is someone at the counter ... and the more people 
the more the cashier's brain has to subconsciously distinguish between those 
persons actions, but beware ... a lot of customers might be on the lookout 
for shoplifters. OK, you have found a store that has the beer row hidden 
somewhat by another row of snacks or what have you ... the next step is to 
put that item in your concealed possession without anyone else noticing. It's 
easy. Wear the right suit ... it's hard to conceal big items when you wear 
shorts, a wifebeater and sandals. That's why it is so much easier to steal in 
the winter. You wear a coat and pants. Dress up when you steal. Try to wear a 
thick shirt or sweater when it doesn't look conspicuous. 

       Now you have to conceal the item in your person without being spotted 
... another easy one. Beer is setup in an unusual manner, they tilt forward 
at a 22 degree angle, so that the beer will make noise when it is being taken 
from the slot.

No doubt to alert the cashier of a possible shoplifter. Here is where timing 
comes into play. You need a time frame of about 7 seconds. That's it! With 7 
seconds you can retrieve the bottle without it clanking. Here's how. First I 
should note that is better to open a shelf beside the beer ... like a door 
that has 12 ounce plastic bottle cokes, because in all stores the cashier can 
see what door is being opened, and they are probably conditioned to what 
position the beer door is in their view of sight. 80% of the time I grab the 
beer through a door that does not have beer ... this makes it more difficult 
to keep the clanking down, but I believe it looks less suspicious. And also, 
the best beer to steal is 40 or 22 ounces, they are easily concealed. Do 
yourself a favor and don't try to steal 12 packs... 90% of the time it won't 
work. 

       Here is how to grab the beer ... the human hand is very jittery when 
in an anxious state of mind, not good for grabbing loud bottles. What you do 
is an old Japanese Ninjitsu exercise before you enter the store, it will calm 
you down, and you won't look suspicious either. Here's what you do - take a 
deep breath slowly, fill your lungs all the way up ... hold it for 3 seconds, 
then exhale slowly and totally ... push all your air out, and hold it for 3 
seconds, then inhale normally. I could go on for about 3 paragraphs about why 
this works, but I will spare you the time. This is a good way of clearing the 
mind, and I guarantee it will make you unnoticable. 

       Here is how to stop the bottles from clanking - the bottles are on a 
22 degree tilt, so when they are handled, there will be clanking noises, 
which alert the cashier. Another easy problem. You must have delicate 
hands... what you do is grab the beer above the beer that you are going to 
steal, and hold it in place, when you are doing this - focus on the word 
'Soften' just trust me on that. You have to seperate the bottle behind the 
beer you are going to steal away from the bottle you are going to steal, so 
it dosn't clank when you take it, by about 4 millimeters. That gives you 
enough space to pull it away from the other bottle without it touching. Now, 
once you have that bottle completly away from the bottle you were holding in 
the shelf, you have to think about the sound it will make when you let go of 
it. It will release from your hand, and clank next to the bottle behind it, 
and so will the bottle behind it, and the one before that... you get the 
point. So you have to ease the bottles back down, so the first bottle meets 
the end of the row, without it making a sound. Don't 'studder' your 
movements... if you did that breathing excercise you probly won't. 

       OK, you have gotten the beer and have completley made no sound... 
good! Now how to conceal it. The best way is to wear baggy pants., that has 
room in the wasteline to shove a beer into it, and have the proper shirt, 
sweater or coat will hide the presence of the beer. Practice this first, if 
you have a 40 ounce around. Or practice the movements in your head. 

       Now shut the door slowly and make your way to the door... do not make 
eye contact with the cashier... ever! Once you have possesion of the beer 
just keep your head down (look at items on the lower shelf)  and make your 
way to the door. Hopefully the cashier is still fixated on a customer, and 
won't pay notice to you leaving without buying an item. Contrary to populer 
belief it is not a good idea to buy a cheap item... it is best to just leave 
after you have stolen the beer (remember, the cashier has no clue that you 
have stolen anything). 

       Too easy. I have stolen alot of beer from stores, and alot of other 
items, you can adapt this teaching to any other item (that is easily 
concealed within clothes).

       If you have any questions or would like to comment or have used my 
method to get beer, or want me to write about another subject... e-mail me at
