BELL BEATS OUT FAVOURED TELUS TO SPONSOR 2010 OLYMPICS: 

Bell Canada has scored a big marketing coup, edging(eating ;)-sms) out 
local favourite 
Telus Corp. as the official telecommunications sponsor for the 2010 Winter 
Olympics in Vancouver/Whistler with a $200-million bid that greatly 
exceeded 
initial expectations.

		If Telus and Bell merged do you think they would call it 
Bellus?
				




CANADA PAYPHONE CORPORATION BEING BOUGHT OUT:

Canada Payphone Corporation (CPC) is in the process of finishing a deal

Globalive Inc. During Sept. 2004, CPC purchased all its outstanding shares 
from 
public shareholders for $0.02 per share and the CPC was delisted from the 
TSX

FCC INSISTS FEDS SHOULD REGULATE VOIP

prostoalex writes "FCC Chairman Michael Powell insists federal officials 
should be the only
ones regulating VoIP, as trusting the Internet phone regulations to states 
would result in
patchwork of conflicting legislature. Powell is a strong proponent of VoIP 
(and a Skype user),
and considers it the technology that ignites (not competes with) telecom 
industry. Research
shows that fewer than 1 millionn Americans use VoIP today, but that's 
expected to increase 12x
by 2009."

Verizon Taking FTTP Installation Orders

FTTP (Fiber To the Premises)! $39.95 for 5MB/2MB, $49.95 for 15MB/2MB, and

80, etc) for incoming or outgoing traffic; with 2MB upload, I hope to 
basically run a small data center in my basement. Both phone and Internet 
will come through the fiber, and there is an unofficial rumor of video 
services as well by the end of this year. Got Fiber? My install date is 
November 2nd in Falls Church, VA (near DC). Several people in Keller,

**********************Stupid Site of the Nite******************************
Well, I have been scouring the internet since 1994 and during that time I 
have come across
many websites that have been high in the fagg0ratry, retarted, and 
genreally stupid. So for 
this issue, I nominate http://www.angelfire.com/ak5/pm101 for the Stupid 
Site of the Nite.
Tune in next month for a site even stupider!
**********************And So its been Posted********************************
In this section, I visit some of the "big" message boards looking for 
hilarity laded posts. This Months was posted
by the user "Quill" from Totse.com . The threads title was "Need help with 
shit covered ass".


"oh fucks, ok here it goes. Last night I had some burritos, some spicy 
Chinese and some raspberries, and today I woke up with the worst killing 
stomach ache ever, it felt like my spine snapped in two and was sticking 
inside the stomach. So on the way to the toilet I saw a note on the table 
saying that my parents will be back in 3 hours. I went into the toilet to 
have the worst diarrhea I could have possibly ever had, with some gastric 
juice as well. My ass was exploding with shit and when I thought I was 
finally done 2 hours has gone by. I went to the roll holder only to find 
that NO PAPER WAS THERE! I was scared like shit when another gun shot was 
fired from my ass. I decided to make a run for the kitchen where the 
tissue box was, but before I did I took a look in the toilet. It looked 
like a big bear was slaughtered and the smell was so bad I covered my nose 
for the fear of lung cancer and having my alveoli corrupted. I run into 
the kitchen with shit dripping from my ass to find that THE TISSUE BOX IS 
EMPTY!!!! What the fuck should I do my parents are going to be here any 
minute, my ass looks like it's been shelled with nuclear bombs and painted 
brown, there's pieces of shit on the floor and the toilet needs to be 
detonated. Fuck Fuck FUCK!!

Holy shit, what happened to me was crazy, I ran into my parents room to 
hide my naked and shit covered self in the only closet in the house 
(there's only one closet in the house), and I did it just in time too as 
the front door opened like 10 seconds later. the first thing I heard was 
my parents walking through putting the groceries on the table and then my 
mum let out a cry, that's when I think she saw the drops of blood and shit 
on the floor. they started calling for me and a few minutes later I heard 
my mum walk into the room and I was like FUCK, because there was stench 
coming out of my ass, and the inside of the closet was covered in shit and 
stank like a dead skunk run over by a garbage truck. I saw out of the 
keyhole that she looked inside and under their bed, and then she headed 
out, but just as she did I LET OUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST FUCKING ASS 
EXPLOSIONS EVER. IT FELT LIKE AN ELEPHANT HAD FUCKED ME IN THE ASS FROM 
THE INSIDE, AND HAD TORN ME 3 NEW ASSHOLES. My mum was like "are you in 
here??? Hello??" and then she went away. 2 minutes later I heard my dad 
calling the cops, reporting a missing child and blood on the floor, and as 
I heard that I was like fuck I have to do something before the cops come 
and start searching the house and find me naked and covered in shit in my 
parents closet. I decided to take whatever I could find in the darkness 
and start wiping myself, and then I put on some pants I found in the dark 
and some sweater kind of thing and opened the closet door. I wanted to 
stop my parents calling the cops so I quickly made my way to them, and 
when they saw me, my mum stopped crying and my dad was like WHAT THE 
FLYING FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY BUISINESS SUIT AND YOUR MOTHERS PINK 
SWEATER!?!?? LOOK YOU EVEN GOT CHOCOLATE ALL OVER IT!!! They asked me 
where I have been and I said I went to the corner store to get some milk, 
and that all my clothes were dirty so I had to use theirs. They questioned 
the blood and shit on the floor and all over the toilet, I said as I was 
leaving the dog showed signs of sickness and probably couldn't make it 
outside to take a shit so it had exploded with shit. Holy shit, this was 
the most intense thing I have EVER BEEN THROUGH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, I took 
a shower short after and threw the shit covered clothes I was wearing into 
the washing machine. The water in the shower was fucking brown and I 
changed the color of the floor of the shower. The lesson is, never, ever, 
eat raspberries kids."

*********************What to do if your Pr0n is found****************************

Ah, so youve just spent the last few days downloading the Brianna Banks 
collection from IRC. 
Then that bitch of a Mother/Sister/Grandma is snooping on your pc and 
discovers the 5 GB
folder "My Documents/Porn". Now the first thought probably going through 
your head is
"fuck, damn, shit bitch, anal raping, cunt-face!". Well doing that and 
panicking is only going
to add more troubles to your current predicement. What you need to do is 
calm down, and remember
those social enginnering skills you used to convince that Wal-Mart 
operator to let you own 
the intercom.

1)Deny, Deny, Deny
Make up a story that Dad/Friend your Parents Dont Like/ Brother was using 
your computer
and downloaded all of that shit. 

2)If your Parents are the computer retarted, say that you miss spelt a URL 
and a consequcne of that
was a Trojan being installed on your PC. Say that the individual who 
installed this trojan used
your PC to act as a porn web host.

3) Ignore it. Just Say, "Mom, Im a 17 year old heterosexual male who 
cannot get any action.
What do you expect me to do? Now go back to your vibrator".

The most important point is to remain calm. If you panic you will start to 
spit out un
comprehensiable sentences. Then your parents will know your lying and take 
away your PC and 
submit you to e-sodomy. Just Remember, DONT PANIC. Now fuck off and read 
the next article. I
really hope nobody took this article seriously.

*********************Called ID Spoofing with Telus******************************
Telus' toll-free "dial-around" is 800-646-0000, by simply calling this 
number with an ANI-fail you can give the operator 
any number as where you are calling from.  Telus is odd, in that they keep 
upgrading and downgrading there dial-around call 
center, you used to be able to call any toll-free number through the Telus 
operator and it would pass whatever number you 
gave the operator as ANI to the toll-free number you called, now it apears 
that they have new toll-free trunks that only 
pass ANI-fails to toll-free numbers, and you can not call MCI owned 
toll-free numbers for some reason either.  
Never-the-less, the ANI is still passed when you call a long distance 
number through Telus dial-around service and the ANI 
is also used as Caller ID So by simply causing an ANI-fail to Telus 
dial-around service you can spoof Caller ID to anyone 
you want to call, not only that if the person you are calling is in the 
same area as the number you are spoofing, the NAME 
and number shows up on the caller ID display. To cause an ANI fail to 
Telus all you have to do is op-divert to 800-646-0000 
or dial 10-10-288-0 and touch tone 800-646-0000 when AT&T comes on the 
line.

 You can social engineer the Telus operator to place "test calls" for you 
which is a free call w/ no billing, you simply 
tell the Telus operator at the beginning of the call that you are a "Telus 
technician" calling from [number to spoof] and 
need her to place a "Test call" to [number to call].  Telus is not the 
only telephone company that has this type of 
dial-around system, AT&T used this in the past though they didn't use 
spoofed ANI as Caller ID, and there are a few other 
phone companies out there besides Telus that you can also use this trick 
on.

  Of course, the social engineer will probably become ineffective in the 
following weeks to come, though it has been several 
weeks since H2K2 and I placed a few "test calls" just the other day.  
However, the spoofed caller ID also shows up on 
collect calls(though I think you can only call people in Canada collect 
with this service), third party billing
(would you accept a third party bill call if the caller ID said your 
girlfriends number and the op said she was the one 
placing the call? :)), and calling card calls, so you could even 
legitamatily spoof Caller ID if you had a Telus calling 
card, however the rates are prtetty expensive, though you can get one if 
you have Telus as your local phone company or if 
you live outside Canada you can pay with a credit card, call 
1-800-308-2222 to order one.

 The sad thing is that ANI spoofing and Caller ID spoofing is so easy, yet 
many companies use ANI and Caller ID as a 
security feature, for example I got a credit card in the mail once that 
the only verification you needed to activate it was 
to call from your "home phone".  It didn't ask for the last 4 of my SSN or 
anything else, had the card been mis-delivered 
to my neighbor or I accidently through it away anyone could have easily 
spoofed ANI and activated the card without me 
knowing it.  Hopefully this will make everyone more aware that ANI and 
Caller ID should not be relied on as where you are 
really calling from.
****************************Hacking TELUS Pay and Talk*****************************


INTRODUCTION:

I'm sure everyone who owns a phone (land line or cellular) would be very 
happy
to be able to make long distance phone calls where the phone company gets 
stuck
with their billing system's thumb up it's ass because someone learned how 
to
confuse it. Well, it just so happens that I found a way to do just that. I 
will
detail what you need below, and then I will describe how exactly I figured 
it
out, and what you need to do to do it yourself. It's actually very easy, I
can't believe that Telus fucked up so badly with their system.


WHAT YOU NEED:

1. A cell phone would be nice, (digital is probably best, it might work 
with
   analogue phones but I don't have one so couldn't tell ya if it will or 
not)

2. Being signed up with Telus's Pay and Talk plan. (Please note that I am 
in
   southern Alberta, so I can't tell ya if this works elsewhere. Try it 
and
   find out.)

3. Having Evenings and Weekends (one of the add-on features available for 
$25
   a month on Pay and Talk) Remember, that Pay and Talk means that the 
plan is
   totally flexable. That means that you don't need to lock into a 
constant
   evenings and weekends plan. If you don't buy it for the month, you just
   don't have it until you add it, and it's valid for 30 days after you 
add it
   on.

4. Was there something else, nope, thats all. A mouth to talk with and an 
ear
   to listen, and maybe a finger to punch buttons and you're set.


HOW I FIGURED THIS ONE OUT:

It all started when I was dating this bitch long distance. The opposite 
sex
seems to have a way of making one do almost anything. Well, this was an 
issue
of (pay big ass bills to those bastards at Telus so that I could be on the
phone with my EX-GF (something which can't be avoided without serious 
female
bitching because of the lack of communication), or indirectly still 
talking to
a very bitchy EX-GF, but at the same time, kindly telling Telus to go fuck
themselves while I make several hours free use out of their system.

I discovered it by accident really, and when I found it I couldn't believe 
what
I had going. I'd phoned her for the usual big bill of the day, but I 
decided to
block my number before calling. At this time I restricted the call times 
to
about 10 minutes max.  At the end of the call I hung up first, and she 
hung up
after. I checked my minutes and "WHAT THE FUCK!!! I DIDN'T GET CHARGED FOR 
THAT
CALL!" So lets just say that Telus lost about on average of 1 or 2, 
sometimes 3
hours a day to my little exploit, which must not have made them happy at 
all.
And, if you're lucky, and she'll give ya it, you might even get some free 
phone
action!!! For anyone that has to sink to that, hey, it beats $5 a minute 
to
listen to some whore tell it to ya over the phone. Not that this bitch 
wasn't a
whore, I mean, I put the phone down one time to go and get a drink, and I 
guess
she decided to kiss the phone, and she was kissing it for probably 5 or 10
minutes while I was gone, because when I picked up the phone again when I 
got
back, she was still at it. Ok, so I don't know why you'd want to know 
that,
just sayin that the pros aren't always the best.

Ok, enough chatter, heres how you can do it. Really, you can.

1. Punch in the number like this "*671403xxxxxxx" (No dumbass, you don't 
put
   the quotes "" in it, just whats inside them and yes yes, the xxxxxxx 
part
   is the phone number, not real x's.)

2. Press talk or send or whatever the hell your cell's call button is.

3. "blah blah blah" away as long as you want.

4.  Make sure that you hang up before your other person does.

And thats it, a free call, courtesy of Telus. Make sure you test it first
before you try making any extravagant calls with it. Remember that the 
number
has to be blocked with *67 and you have to hang up first for it to work. 
On a
land line, you have to dial *67 and wait for a dial tone to dial the 
number,
but not on a cellular phone. It's all one string, and call blocking is 
free.
Oh ya, one other thing, it does not work to phone another cell phone. It 
only
works to phone land lines. I found this out the hard way.


***********************Hacking Catalouge Computers*******************************	
I noticed this sizable security flaw at the computer the allows you to 
view Sportmart's catalogue in Sport Mart in the Duncan mall. I was bored 
as hell that day, so I drifted aimlessly around the vile and alcohol 
stanched Duncan mall. These catalogue computers are found in many stores, 
namely SportMart, Sportcheck, Chapters, Walmart, and Home Depot. Walking 
up to it I immediately hit CTRL+ALT+Delete which gave me a  Windows 2000 
security screen that had everything shaded off sans cancel. So, with this 
option gone I turned to trying to right click on the page, and to my 
surprise it worked. Even further to my surprise it let me View the source 
in notepad. Doing this brought up notepad with the code of the website. So 
then I erased the code and added in <A HREF=" http://www.google.ca"> 
Google </A> then saved it as openme.html in the default directory it 
proved. Then I proceeded to go to open find the file in the open box, 
right click- open with selected internet explorer. To my abash I saw the 
google logo, then the search box.. Looking around, I saw one of the 
disgruntled Sport Mart employees looking at me in a cautious and odd way. 
In my haste I typed goatse into the search box, opened up the goatse page 
then fled. From a safe distance out of the store I saw that employee 
approach the computer, look at it for a second then turn away with a 
disgusted look on her face. 
NOTE: This procedure may also work on the terminal outside the National 
Geographic Store in the Royal BC Muesam in Victoria.

**************************Letters to Das editor!!!!**********************************
DO YOU LIKE HARDCORE PORN?

IF YOUR ANSWER IS YES CLICK HERE TO SATISFY YOUR URGE!!www.vesta-ex.com

Dear You,

I never write letters like this, but since there is no option stated for a 
"no" response to your question, in your case, I'll make an exception.

No. I most certainly do not like hardcore porn... however, I simply adore 
softcore pornography... really softcore... like old married couples 
holding hands and gazing lovingly into each other's eyes with the quiet 
intensity that shows a true bond that can weather time and adversity. Oh 
my god, I am hard as a fucking rock now! I'd imagine that such a 
description would put anyone in the same state who has half an imagination 
and a penis.

Do you have any porn sites handy where I can find pictures of that sort of 
thing? Like a woman in 20s garb with a dainty yellow parasol sitting in a 
park on a bench coyly observing a man wearing suspenders and a light, 
summery pair of dress pants in the distance?.... uhhhhh-hhhuuhhhhu....Wow, 
I just soiled myself.

Where could I ever find anything like that???
