as a preface, jay wanted me to state at the outset
that the people described in this poem are not I and I, but
rather a Kafkaesque part of our collective psyche that is in desperate
need of awakening. this was a spontaneous response to immersion into an 
accelerated culture. I and I are fine, peace unto all, keep it live...

THE INTERNET SUCKS

Corporate cowboys
Smokin' strong BC-Bud
Lookin' for herion or cocaine.
Spending their days
Hard-Wired into the machine
Spending their nights
Dosed on any number of drugs.

Twenty-two year-old webMASTER
Sedated with corporate ca$h
Gets paid to do shit
Except look smart
When the suits walk by.

"I had this quarter bag of grass
that was laced with crack.
I got crazy high from smokin' pinners.
It lasted long, almost a week."

A professional corporate slacker,
Covers his ass and nothing more.
Smart enough to revolutionize
The technological revolution itself,
Yet sedated enough to
Just not give a shit.

Young, bright, and even conscious
He did see the world for it's truth.
Now nihilism distorts his actions
And he courts death and destruction
As a welcomed alternative.

"All I do is get up, goto work,
Come home, get blitzed and pass out.
I think I'm dying,
I think I'm dissolving.
Man, The Internet Sucks.



editors (there is a light at the end of the tunnel) epilogue:

although the fog may be thick,
and the road seems mighty bumpy,
there's a good storm a brewin,
and with it rides radical change.
