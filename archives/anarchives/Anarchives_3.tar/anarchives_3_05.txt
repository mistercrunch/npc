the international brigade

from behind, I stole a kiss
on your neck
(and half your rations)
- solidarity
in class war
never filled my stomach

we'd kiss although
I'd always hold Kronstadt
wave it above your head
(hollow omissive victory)
our kisses: cannons breaking ice
decade and change later

violent watermelons
exploding overhead
fascist toothmarks in your boot
always dogs and god to kick
spanish holiday
in the ass of the twentieth century

carrying the red flag - carrying the black flag
you'd scold - I'd caress
my charming inability - the broccolied clump of mortar
to organize - you'd pass to me
always an anarchist - scarlet tongue in my ear
until we or the state have died
(bank window missed my brick by a mile)

both carrying handsome revolvers
our boots planted in soil
the colour and consistency
of dimestore
lipstick

you spoke of dead heroes
- couldn't help it
"Illych" sounds
like drinking vodka
from my naval
(call my naval Kronstadt)
