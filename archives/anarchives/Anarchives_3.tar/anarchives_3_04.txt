"The Space" by Patrick Borden is a literary exploration into the new media-based 
reality. A mixture of autobiography and fiction, Borden flys between political 
insight and implicit media analysis.
The novel depicts a 'generation' that has been 'neutralized' by drugs, elements 
of integration supplied by the 'state'. Borden dramatizes the perpetual conflict 
between the individual and the state, grounding it amidst anarchist history, the 
decline of the 'left', and the bio-machination of humanity.

Unlike conventional book reviews, this review seeks to draw out the 'space', 
that surrounds the novel "The Space". Borden chooses certain autobiographical 
figures, to narrate the self-realization of powerlessness in the face of a 
growing institution. This review chooses to examine the ground that surrounds 
these figures, drawing out the media analysis that is inherent in the language 
of this book, thus delving into the cold reality of our present existence.
Examining and embracing the ground is a Taoist approach to comprehension, a 
holisitic rather than linear conceptualization. The Taoist work, "Understanding 
Reality" by Chang Pu-Tuan, is an ancient text of metaphor analysis, that sought 
comprehension of one's environement through dynamic non-linear exploration. The 
modern equivalent of this Chinese text is "Understanding Media" by Marshall 
McLuhan, which seeks comprehension of one's environment through dynamic 
non-linear exploration. If Patrick hasn't read McLuhan, he should...

McLuhan was not an ideologue, nor was he a scientist. Rather McLuhan was a 
literary nomad, an explorer of the human mind who wandered through our various 
extensions, winding among trails through our collective and individual, 
conscious and unconscious. He studied media as extensions of humanity, all 
aspects of our conscious and unconscious expression, from language to art, 
printing presses to television, t-shirts to comptuers, light-bulbs to 
automobiles. He didn't create a school of thought, nor did he present a general 
theory. He is best known for his paradox: 'the medium is the message', however 
this phrase is more of a segue to the world of media study, rather than a be-all 
and end-all.

"Proximity to the drug, he could feel it now. He saw the pharmacist facing him 
from behind the counter, but it was junk that orchestrated the scene, junk that 
governed and shaped the space before him, junk that had led him there." <The 
Space, pp. 139>

The medium as the message is a play on the role of objects within an 
environment. Whenever a new medium is introduced into an environment it changes 
and permanently alters the 'space' that is the environment.
Throughout Patrick Borden's "The Space", junk or herion is the medium under 
examination. For the characters in the book, junk is the defining medium of 
existence.
However media do not exist in isolation, but often in direct relationship with 
each other. With the junk as figure, the ground can be viewed as 
society-at-large, a society that is itself a 'media environment', arguably an 
'Information Age', an era of technological domination fueled by the liberation 
of information, where everything is bits and bytes within a large automated system.
Within the context of a technological society, drugs and propaganda play 
complimentary roles.

"Junk was part of their culture - they just didn't want to admit it. Just wanted 
to pretend these other drugs were it, that designers would fulfill that role. 
Marketing. Consumption. Economic growth. So much propaganda. Junk reinforced it, 
covered its failures." <The Space, pp. 155>

Jacques Ellul wrote that propaganda within a technological society is an act of 
integration. Propaganda acts against the dysfunctions of the technology, 
integrating all into the technological order, ensuring that progress is equated 
with freedom.
In the Information Age, we are witnessing the literal integration of humans and 
machines. Technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 
even information networks appropriate humanity in an effort to gain total 
efficiency. Even tape players with miny headphones that fit into the small parts 
of our ears indicate our cyborg trends. With the proliferation of telepresence 
and the totality of the media environment, our psyches are exposed and 
transformed everyday in the face of thousands of paid-advertisments.
As bio-technology continues to develop, our bio-systems are off-set by the 
technological change. Drugs become agents of balance, media that attempt to 
engage and deal with the transformative change. Within the context of 
integration, drugs can become the propaganda, the agent of integration, that can 
traverse the modern psyche.

"It was the drug, it was junk that gave them access, access inside. Inner voice. 
A call to the muse. It was there - ther in the music, ther in the art. There in 
that subculture, a commnity, sharing it. It was real, not created by fashion, TV 
ads. So much more than clothes, slang, posturing." <The Space pp. 150>

With the proliferation of information, and the immersion into the media 
environment, the literate identity of the printed word transforms into the 
tribal identity of the spoken word, or in modern terms the electric word. 
McLuhan described this process as retribalization.
Within "The Space", Borden describes the tribilzation that has occured around 
the consumption of the legalized drugs. As the individual identity is zapped by 
the electronic omnipresence of information, lost souls thrive to the perceived 
collective identity of the drug. Borden depicts social groups wholly defined by 
their drug of choice. Perceivably, bio-technological integration is so complete 
that identity is entirely mediated by the substances of integration and control.

"They had been neutralized." <The Space, pp. 156>

Wallowing within the apathy of addiction, the protagonist lays a lament for the 
decline of the left. As the individual is subverted by electronic technology, 
Borden answers with anarchism, the hidden ground of resistence and revolution. 
With the development of 'group-think' and the collectivization of the drug 
experience, Borden cries for the autonomy of the individual to crack through the 
wall of consumerist homogeneity. The junk addiction however acts as the shroud 
of sickness that prevents any real political change.

"Sitting there exhaling the last of the smoke he was dying along with a dying 
world." <The Space, pp. 17>

The interdependency of the narco-techno world has synthesized all within the 
military-industrial-biological complex. Integration on all levels has 
constructed an institution of incredible power, and incredible destruction. The 
remains of the individual identity cry out in agony, grasping for air in a 
suffocating synthesis of collective homogenization.

"This was the source. This was the space. It was from here that they had 
created, from here that so much art had come." <The Space, pp 149>

For the characters in the book, "The Space" was the environment created by the 
medium of heroin. An environment which gave the individual temporary autonomy, a 
temporary get-away from the modern technological world. The irony of course is 
that the figure of escape is created by the ground of narcotic-dependency, and 
in this context societal integration. The more heroin taken by the characters, 
the greather their dependency on the drug, the more they became a part of that 
drug's culture. A process of consumption that mirrors our technological society.

"The Space" by Patrick Borden is an interesting and engaging book, that lends 
insight into the subconscious activities of our socialization, and the conscious 
acts of our desire for freedom.
