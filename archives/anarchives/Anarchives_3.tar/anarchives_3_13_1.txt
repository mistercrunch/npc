Hackers at the holiday inn

I checked into the hotel at 10pm on friday night. My arrival in Washington
was met with a dramatic lightning storm, yet no rain, as the city itself
harboured incredible humidity. As I chatted with the woman at the reception
desk, she explained to me that the hotel's computers had been infected with
a virus. As she said this, the other twenty-something also checking in
turned to me and smiled. I wondered if the woman behind the desk knew that
their hotel was hosting a hacker conference. As she handed me my digital
key, I pondered the possibilities for mischief with dozens of young hacks
running loose in the building.

When i entered the elevator, all of the buttons were lit up, and remained
so as i travelled up to the sixth floor. As it stopped on every floor, i
noticed scores of teenagers running amok, darting between elevators,
running through the halls, and generally getting themselves into all the
technology they could access.

After dropping off my bag in my room, I went for a stroll in greater
georgetown, to get something to eat, and to see the streets on a friday
night. Quite quickly i remembered that there is very little I dispise more
than rich white drunk kids.

I returned to my room by midnight, and promptly fell asleep, tired from the
plane ride and related hullabaloo. I was sleeping soundly until about 4am
when I was startled to hear a very loud fire alarm. At first I tried to
ignore it, thinking instead of the joys of a relaxing sleep. However within
a few moments I heard the distinct sound of fire engines screaming toward
us, and decided the best thing was to just get dressed and leave the
building.

Outside in the parking lot the patrons of the hotel stood, many still half
asleep, all wondering what was going on. Five fire engines promptly
arrived, and the firemen quickly dashed into the hotel to find where the
fire was, or why the alarms were blaring away. I crouched in the diagonal
end of the lot, positioned to observe the hotel, and all those in the
parking lot, as I began to ponder which one of the punks rigged the system.
I was joined by a few other hacks who joined my speculation on whether or
not the alarm was a hack. After 30 minutes the fire men concluded that
there was no fire, and that it was now safe to re-enter the building. We
were all frustrated and tired, but at the same time I almost expected as
much. I began to wonder how much more of this I would have to put up with,
as I noticed the official conference t-shirt, a picture of the unabomber
with the caption 'practical unix terrorism'.

The conference began at 10am, and the beer drinking began thirty minutes
later. As the second presenter made the comment, 'we start in the heap, and
we overwrite everything,' he held up his beer bottle in salute, as he
initiated the conference festivities.

From the very start the organizers of the conference demostrated complete
and total political ignorance. Potentially the most political force in the
current technological revolution, the hackers demonstrated a complete
absence of any political bearings, preferring instead to brush aside the
first and only political panel with a call for more beer.

As the conference itself began to flow, the involvement, and interactivity
of the audience increased. Hackers became hecklers as no words were sacred.
Every comment made by a presenter was met with five smart alec remarks from
the crowd. The group dynamic began to emerge as the hacker culture began to
define itself as alcoholic, mysoginist, pedophiliac, and just plain
ignorant. The room itself was completely dominated by technical power and
testosterone.

Fireflys from laser pointers darted across the room as hyper active boys
demonstrated their inability to sit still for more than 10 seconds.
Cabalistic cliques formed throughout the hall as hacker elite took their
ranks, as who you know reinforced what you know.

All the boys had shiny high-tech toys, as laptops filled the room, while
wired wizards wore beepers, scanners, radios, and cellulars. Theoretically
there was a program for the conference, however it frequently became
subverted by the determined desire to get drunk. Virtually extended as far
as technologically possible, alcohol acts as the numbing narcosis ensuring
the continued immersion into the technological sensorium.

Subjects covered ranged from the latest exploit for sendmail 8.6.12 to
covert channels to avoid packet sniffers. Talks on buffer overflows were
accompanied by belly overflow, as pizza and doughnuts were perpetually
passed around the room.

Perhaps the only valuable information that I received was a statistic from
the GaO which stated that the DoD received 175,000 successful attacks over
the last year. This number was met with a host of cheers and boasts, as
hacks from all over tried to claim credit. Very few questioned the fact
that the DoD spent over half of its budget on 'Information Warfare', and
furthermore needed an excuse to continue increased spending on computer
security. The hackers themselves were to busy getting drunk to realize
their own status as scapegoats.
