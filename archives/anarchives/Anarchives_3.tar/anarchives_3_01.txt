The light is sporadic and the dimensions are unreliable.
A sign hangs above reading, welcome to your head.
>From near and afar the horizon speaks to you, and you struggle to keep abreast 
of the change. You can wrap a story in its deeds, but do you have the sight to 
know what is?
Books cannot become you, and zines are for being. Art was live in 95, and 
sources of creativity never lost a moment recollecting reality, recognizing 
relationships and unknowable revelations. These are the words of you, the 
missions of warmth for you, biting your neck as your kiss holds swift.
This issue marks volume 3 issue 1 of The Anarchives, a journal of creativity and 
intelligence, love and revolution. Published through the TAO Media Collective, 
The Anarchives strives to develop our own radical culture, in conjunction with 
our community, who live all across the world.
The Anarchives has been around for well over two decades. It was originally 
named The Anarchives of Gonzo Psychology.
Its origins date back to that mysterious decade of the sixties, where love and 
humanity were on a collision course for liberation, only to be diverted by empty 
slogans and consumer dreams.
With the advent of the seventies, The Anarchives went to thehills, fleeing to 
the wilderness of the Canadian Shield, and the shelter of rural life in the 
northern Ontario bush. Along with a community of friends and loved-ones, The 
Anarchives took residence away from the urban wastelands, founding a new 
community outside of the corrosive consuming regime. Here in the natural setting 
of northern Ontario the second generation of The Anarchives was born and raised. 
Growing up in an environment free of domination and discrimination, The 
Anarchives flourished as it procreated. The energy of the community was used to 
create and explore, rather than destroy and deter.
However as the seventies waned on, and others like The Anarchives remained in 
the hills away from the power centers of the urbanlandscape, new enemies of the 
people arised. Without the opposition to power found in the popular movements of 
the sixties, political actors such as Reagan Mulrooney, and Thatcher rose to 
power with a backing as evil as power can be. With the forces of good resting in 
the rural areas, the  urbanlandscape was raped and transformed to meet the needs 
of the evolving elite.
As the seventies came to a close, The Anarchives realized that although living 
in the bush was nice and all, it didnt stop the rape and plunder that was going 
on in the cities. In the early eighties part of The Anarchives returned to the 
city(Toronto) to return to an active life of resistance and revolution. However 
as the eighties drew on, it was clearly a time of repression rather than 
revolution. The Anarchives did what it could to survive.
In zine format, The Anarchives began publishing in Toronto in 1992.
Through a collective of radical minds, The Anarchives published fiveissues 
within a period of six months. This period was more a gathering of young minds 
than a set schedule of publishing. The Anarchives was quickly becoming a forum 
for new ideas, and the definition of new realities. Realities based upon the 
emergence of a new social landscape that was more terrifying and more horrible 
than any previous.
After a year hiatus, The Anarchives began publishing again in the final months 
of 1994. This time however the publishing of the zine in newspaper format was 
also accompanied by electronic publishing over the Internet.
The first issue concentrated on the culture of cannibis, and the role of the 
free mind within the struggle for a free society. The second issue dealt with 
the Canadian student strike that took place in Febuary of 1995.
In working with different media, The Anarchives continued to explore the 
so-called information revolution, and the power involved in such a revolution; 
emphasis was on communications and power. Shortly after this initial examination 
however, The Anarchives found itself face to face with communications and power 
as it then faced political persecution by both predominant North American 
governments, resulting in an arrest of one member who faced trial September 7 
1995 in Toronto. This case has been resolved, but not without considerable 
electronic surveillance on the part of the authorities.
At present The Anarchives continues to develop and evolve, still striving for 
its own freedom, and the freedom of all who roam our beloved planet. We are busy 
establishing networks of resources and people in the aim of establishing a true 
peoples network that can provide for those who are ready to take their liberation.
The words we share, and the language we use, help communicate our dreams and 
visions for a beter world. Naturally this world cannot be created without the 
help of millions and billions. I and I is the concept that we can be our own 
saviours, and benefit from our own actions.
The Anarchives exists as a result of the love and warmth of a strong surrounding 
community. It is with this love in mind that we share our words with the world.
This issue begins with a focus on local activities: battles with the Harris 
provincial government, details on the Omnibusbill that centralizes provincial 
power, report from the toronto caravan to chiapas, news on feb 7 student strike.
The international section follows and covers recent riots in france, where the 
country was shut down for december 
due to a transport then general strikes. Anarchives contacts in france say the 
country will strike again in late January.
A technical section follows, critically addressing the information revolution 
and the power that accompanies such a revolution. The emphasis should not be on 
technology, but rather ecology.
The creative section rounds up the paper with poetry and gregory k.
We try to cover a wide format as a means of achieving a holistic and balanced 
expression. We are always open to submissions, send it to us :)
On a final note, with this issue we are offering subscriptions. Volume 2 reached 
issue 24 or something in cyberspace, but only issue 2 in the real world, as 
what-would-you-know these things cost $$. Were now going to be increasing the 
frequency of the anarchives, and will offer subscriptions for $20 per year, with 
four issues guaranteed. The Anarchives will still be free, and were mailing this 
issue for free, but we dont have money, and if you send us money well send you 
Anarchives. okay :)
either way, well still have the funk.
peace love and revolution
