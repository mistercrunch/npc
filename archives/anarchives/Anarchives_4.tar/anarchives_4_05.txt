^^^ ^^^^ ^^

sweet, hot, coiled spring
sticky, slippery syrup
sudden pounding veins
spouts burst forth

seeds, cycles, and sap
(such a strong word, sap... flowing, rhythmic)

i am 
sometimes driven more by instinct than rule of law
  (gravity or liberal)
standing outside, calling down rain
laughing and singing about nothing

she is 
  taller than me, yes. 
  & passionately dripping with life
  running, leaping, stretching
    outwards, across, nowhere but up up up

entwined we are
silken soft green-gold crown
  and rough brown base bark
street grrrls of light, dirt & water
  going nowhere, and doing nothing.

this geographic identity connected by roots,
streaked rings of growth, and
supple stretchmarks like living landmarks.

sap is blood, sister
it is milk, mother
it is life, lover

every year new(s)
  sweet, hot, spent spring
