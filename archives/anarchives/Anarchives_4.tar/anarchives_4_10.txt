Toronto - Nov 19 1997

during the fall in toronto, the univeristy decided to grant an hourary
doctorate degree in laws to convicted war criminal george bush. his
convocation was met with a loud and militant protest, demanding his arrest,
and justice for the peoples of the world.

media quoted the attendance at the demo between 400 and 4000. whatever the
number the community of resistance had come out in force. banners,
pickets, signs, costumes, drums, whistles, and many bodies had come out in
the toronto cold to participate in a drama that continues to unfold.

the police had setup barracades creating a perimeter around Hart House,
the building hosting the ceremony. protestors had gathered at all sides to
chant down the building, the participants, and anyone else who cared. a
great deal of frustration and pain was directed towards the suits on their
way inside, the vibe was that people had had enough. they were'nt going to
take it any more.

30 minutes into the event, a procession of 4 skull faced uncle sams on
stilts began to approach the demo. they were composed of 2 cops, a
shepherd, and a drummer, all herding in the peoples of the world, symbolic
representatives of the victims of george bush's actions and policies. the
sams were beating and abusing the people, until one by one to the rat a
tat tat of the sam's drum, they are each laid to death, as part of the
ritual of amerikkka. this continued until the very last was standing,
whereby instead of falling, she fought back, clashing symbols, and raising
the dead, rallying the many against the tyrannical few. down came the
uncle sam 4, and up went the people, celebrating and dancing the victory
for democracy.

as the theatre concluded, many, if not most of the participants in the
demo realized that audience they were not, rather actors in history were
they. and with renewed passion and fury they surrounded the limos and
security forces who dutifully stood by.

as old boys left the building they were pelted with snow balls, forced
back inside by a constant barrage of well packed wet snow. how could the
police and secret service fight back against canadian snow? although they
tried with their horses, in the end they could do very little, surrounded
by cameras, outnumbered and outflanked by protestors, the leaders of the
continent had to sneak out through the back kitchen.

for the movment itself is demonstrating 'the snow ball effect'. as the
elite consolidates and becomes global, the resistance and opposition to
them grows exponentially. local groups are active in every continent in the
world resisting the global ruling class and demanding true democracy and
rule by and for the people.

the main targets of the demonstration: george bush, brian mulrooney, mike
harris, peter munk, and robert pritchard, all got out of the building with
out any harm.

geroge bush received the honorary degree in connection with peter munk's
donation of nearly $7million dollars to the new peter munk centre for
international studies, a free trade policy play pen for neo-liberals and
neo-conservatives alike. brian mulrooney, mike harris, and robert
pritchard, are all just men who were lucky to escape.

geroge bush, a spook of spooks, has appeared in many human attrocities
and genocidal wars, both covertly and overtly, over all continents, to all
peopes, over the last several decades. the university of toronto choose to
honour him with a degree because 'he won the cold war'.

organizers in toronto plan to continue efforts to oppose the global
corporate agenda of privatization, trade liberalization, security and
surveillance by confronting power wherever and whenever it appears. the
george bush confrontation was a good festival of resistance by and for the
people. george bush was later quoted in the nightly news as saying he
'felt like he was in baghdad' commenting on the level of protest. he then
went on to comment how he thought 'mike harris is doing a good job in
ontario'.
