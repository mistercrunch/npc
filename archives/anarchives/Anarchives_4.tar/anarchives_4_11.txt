well...here i am in wonderful kingston again...shit iz fucked right
up...elections have been declared to take place on dec.18 1997...the
shooting has just gotten underway and nomination day is this monday...the
murder count for this year so far has long since surpassed ANY previous
record set in jamaica..including the grotesque elections of 1980 in which
over 850 people were killed...so far this year the count stands at 942.

the cia has reped some benefits from all this of ccourse..the collection
of fingerprints from over 1.5 million voters was carried out by a computer
firm that does plenty of work for the pentagon. Needless to say that as a
result, thousands have decided to remain unregistered..the voters list
here is a topic of controversy ...every voter on the list is supposed to
be crossmatched by computer but so far only 180, 000 people are
crossmatched..this means that the voters list is open to the type of
corruption that has traditionally plagued jamaican elections in the last
two decades.

the candidates are once again edward seaga and PJ patterson...seaga , who
is known for his ruthless gangsterism is preparing his constiuents for
what may be the bloodiest elections this country has ever seen..patterson
on the other hand is firmly in control of the police and army which
routinely sweep thorugh neighborhoods with a type of ruthlessness that
rivals duvaliers private forces..the "uncle knapsacks"...earlier this
year, the police laid siege to arden gardens..more popularly known as
TIVOLI ...and previously called "back-o-wall" until it was bulldozed by
seaga to make room for the worst projects in kingston. for three days this
last spring, the police and army engaged in a vicious street battle that
saw no arrests but several deaths..icluding that of a six year old boy who
lay sleeping in his bed when a bullet pierced his wall...and then his
brain.

the current governent saw the loss of michael manley this year and
recently, a councillor by the name of brian dixon was gunned down as he
exited a church ..the fallout from that shooting has sparked both fear and
anger from his party who seem convinced that the death of dixon was
ordered by the serving JLP MP , karl samuda. apparently, everyone knows
the men who did the killing but noobody is willing to report them in a
country that is often controlled by steet justice...

nomination day is this monday the 1st of december and it is expected to be
violent. on nomination day, people "flex" in the streets in order to
intimidate and fight down their opponents...
tribalism is still rampant even though the DONS or Community leaders (many
of whom are drug lords) no longer rely on their local politicians to
provide them with firearms.
in jamaica, coca-colonisation has had more consequences than the new crop
of McDonalds resturants that are all over kingston...another such
consequence is the prevalence and availabilty of some serious high powered
weaponry...children as young as ten are sometimes seen riding in their
bicycles in the inner cities with M-16 rifles propped up on their
handlebars...shit is crazy. as a friend of mine told me recently "guns
down yah like watah." And that aint no idle hype.

so...everyone here braces is bracing for the next three weeks which
promise to be pretty intense...pressure is showing on the faces of
everyone and an atmosphere of caution has taken over...the tourists stay
safely tucked away in places like Sandals and the Jamaica Grand, while
just outside the gates, the cauldron gets ready to blow its top...

Stay tuned...Live from Kingston Continues...
