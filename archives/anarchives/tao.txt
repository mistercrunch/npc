The Anarchy Organization is a collective of thinkers dedicated to
freedom. We believe in having a good time, living our lives the
way we want and the way we should. Our presence represents the
return of the radical.
The Anarchy Organization is first & formost a voice for freedom.
We are not here because we enjoy the forum for debate, slander,
or whatever. We're here as a matter of necessity, a matter of dire
urgency. Organizations are only valuable when you have a fight to
prepare for.
As anarchists we oppose all forms of coersion and domination.
We are here because our lives have been interrupted by hegemony,
hiearchy, and hate.
We are calling for the revolution and proposing the tools be anarchy,
love, reason, & the pursuit of the goals justice, individual freedom,
and community living.
We are an open, loving society dedicated to change. We need people to
help us with the monstrous task we and the rest of the world face.
If you like having a good time, using your noggin', and have the
desire for freedom, give us a ring...
