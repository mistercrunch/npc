Here is the first edition of Semiovirus. I didn't write this article. My
friend wrote it. My critique of digitalism will follow once I an through
with it.

On Post-Nuclear Condition

by a Renegade Rasta-Taoist-Ninjah

Two things are clear to me now.
1)  At the core of capitalism, there is an act of postponement,
deferment, delay, or 'libidinal economy', difference, whatever you name
it.  It all comes down to an act of not to be here and now. You are asked
to suspend your pleasure for anywhere/time other than the here and now. 
And 'work' stands between your desire and your pleasure.  We exchange our
time with the resources for the possible gratification in the future,
suppressing the idea that we might be dead by tomorrow. 
The economy (from its conceptual foundation, practical activities, to its
mythology) is founded on this space created by the collective deferment. 
Interest, Profit, Investment... All those nourishing elements for captial
generate from nowhere by this space.  It is a very fragile space,
indeed.  That is why economy is wrecked right now.  It has nothing to do
with anything that the Wall Street or Tokyo says.  It has to do with the
crude fact that more and more people are becoming aware of the whole
fallacy, the stupidity of the entire conceptual design.  More and more
people start retaining their life time and space to live here and now and
maximize their existience in the most positive way.  Of course unless we
make up some good scams or have access to a large piece of arable land,
the spector of "work" comes back to haunt us.  Nevertheless, there is no
turning back.
Instant gratification?  Not really.  Because instant gratification is
still a zero degree of postponement.  It is postponement nonetheless. 
You don't need instant.  You only need gratification.  Exchange without
delay.  A constant potlatch of the life energy.

2)  Deferment, delay, postponement... If you translate these into the
spatial language they well be distance, aloofness, and that infamous
word, "alienation."  Capitalism thrives on the spatial gap between our
sense and our existence.  Our raw experience is from the very beginning
of our life time, discredited.  It needs (so they say) so be mediated or
pre-mediated by the institution, media and school.  Prescribed imagery
premeditates our perception.  Benjamin's "loss of aura" in the mechanical
art is indeed a serious question.  Aura is not metaphysical:  It is
mediation that is metaphysical.  The only reason we cannot seriously talk
about the loss of aura in the age of cybernetic reproduction is simply
because the metaphysics of the simulation has taken over our life space. 

But it requires so much effort in maintaining the metaphysical robe. 
Specifically, it requires a constant effort to purge out the intrusion of

entropy thereby an artificial order can be maintained.  But Entropy
intrudes anyway and Chaos takes over anyway.  No matter how many nuclear
bombs they detonate, the world of simulation is crumbling everywhere at
this moment.  From the cracks, people come forward and demand life
without mediation.
