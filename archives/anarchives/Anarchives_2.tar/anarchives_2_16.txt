	Two of the key elements of the emerging techno-economic
paradigm are integration and synthesis. These two trends are
indicative of the  proccess of change modern capitalism is
undergoing.

	David Wolfe in a chapter on the new paradigm describes:

"The convergence of computers and telecommunications behind the
new IT  paradigm also allows electronic networks to integrate a
range of diverse  activities within firms or between firms
across distant geographic  spaces... As these firm-based
information handling systems are linked  into new digital
telecommunication sytems that integrate voice, data and  video
transmissions, the basic infrastructure of the new prardigm is 
forged." (D. Wolfe, Chapter 3, pp. 24)

Integration is the driving metaphor of change, describing the
emergence  of a new social system, based upon the socio-economic
organization of information networks.

	Parties with vested interests in the old paradigm may view the
current transformation as a crisis. Integration and synthesis
represent a new process of production departing from the
fragmentation of mechanization. Breaking the process of
production into specialized sectors, hierarchicly controlled, is
quickly becoming outdated. However new methods of exploitation,
domination, and control are quickly adapting to the new
environment.

"While westerners usually equate the marketplace with freedom of
opinion,  the hidden hand of the market can be almost as potent
an instrument of  control as the iron fist of the state."
(Chomsky, Noam; Neccessary  Illusions, Anansi Press, 1991 pp. 7)

	Attempts at managing the new paradigm have been indicative of
the identity crisis now facing international elites. Western
modes of management have failed to achieve optimum productivity
due to their emphasis on mechanical, linear, static organization.

	The message of the network as medium suggests a holistic, 
acoustic, electric 'environment', that by nature is comprised of
dynamic, continuously changing organization.

	Perhaps the dynamism of the eastern cultures are enabling an
easier transition into the new age. Western cultures, and
explicitly american culture have been based on individuality.
The emphasis on collectivity and community has enabled the
eastern cultures to cope with integration and synthesis as a
natural progression. Western culture has  met the challenge of
integration with the community of corporate culture.  The
corporate tribe integrates and co-opts all in total
commodification.

	As the elite and their systems of management adapt to the new
paradigm in an attempt to enable the full benefits of the new
media, integration and synthesis inspire the introduction of new
management concepts. As the process of production undergoes
synesthesia, previously excluded members become active
participants in the end result.

"As we saw above, the skill requirements of the new paradigm
support the  more effective integration of conception and
execution on the shopfloor.  Similarly, the new model of
production and innovation facilitates a  closer integration of
the shopfloor and the R&D laboratory. Both of these 
developments support the trend towards a less hierarchical
organization  and the shifting of the autonomy/control dimension
of skill towards  greater autonomy for front line workers." (D.
Wolfe, Chapter 3, pp. 35)

In the face of labour empowerment, management must preserve the
invested  interests of production. A new interaction between
human and techne,  human and machine, is established, removing
what autonomy ever existed.

"Computer screens established an interface between biological
and  technological electricity, between the user and the
networks." (Skin Of Culture, Derrick de Kerckhove, pp. 125)

	Domination and exploitation adapt to new media, becoming
holistic, and part of the new hidden ground.

"Literal censorship barely exists in the United States, but
thought  control is a flourishing industry, indeed an
indispensable one in a  society based on the principle of elite
decision, public endorsement or  passivity." (pp. 42, Pirates
And Emperors, Noam Chomsky)

	Illusions of democracy and information networks as 'anarchy'
divert political focus away from the real power imbedded in
electronic  information networks.

"At home, the state has often employed force to curb dissent,
and there  have been regular and quite self-conscious campaigns
by business to  control 'the public mind' and suppress
challenges to private power when  implicit controls do not
suffice." (necillu pp. 28)

	There are a number of competing conceptions of the emerging
environment. Many different factions are eager to describe the
new scape, identifying what should receive emphasis, and what
should not. The technological change is followed by a
proliferation of  language directed towards understanding and
acting in the face of such  dramatic change.

	However language has been controled by the cultural hegemony
that has been the american empire. Misconceptions of power, and
it's inherent relationship to the current technologies still
characterize much of the current debate.

"Leading technologies and sectors of the old prardigm are giving
way to  the new." (Wolfe, pp. 36)

This last sentence should read: ..are giving birth to the new...

"The Pentagon system, a device used to make the public finance 
high-technology industry by means of the state-guaranteed market
for the  production of high-technology waste and thus to
contribute to the  programme of public subsidy, private profit,
called 'free enterprise'"  (Noam Chomsky, Pirates And Emperors,
pp. 14)

Traditional power interests have existed for centuries, and will
probably  continue for centuries more, although their numbers
may dwindle. The so-called military-industrial complex has
driven this integration as a  means of evolving into the
military-industrial-biological complex. A holistic institution
of such totality as to achieve total integration accompanied by
total market saturation achieving the state of total visibility.
We become a society united by information.

"Investments in enhancing technological knowledge at every level
of  sciety will pay significant dividends in the future. The key
to  international competitivieness involves the cumulative
technological  knowledge base of the enterprise, including the
production skills and  tacit knowledge of much of the
workforce." (Wolfe, pp. 36)

Universal access becomes the rally call of the elite, co-opting
and  integrating all into a movement to get wired.

Once wired we are all sucsceptable to the analyses of neural
networks. We are all members of the global database. We are all
members of the process of production that rapes and maims while
it colonizes. 

	Integration and synthesis are the creation of the new economy.
Integration and synthesis are the creation of the new being.

"The integration of television and other news media within
computer  networks enables polling engineers to reduce the time
intervalk between  questions and answer, between action and
reaction. The potential for  manipulating opinions, in such
conditions, is greatly amplified. This has  many political and
social repercussions. Increasingly, the politicians of
western-style democracies owe their  power base to meticulous
computerized analyses of public opinion in any  given arena.
Campaign managers tailor their responses in locally  appropriate
media. During political campaigns the world over, TV stuffs  its
images into the electors' consciousness while computers analyze
the  polled responses, which are instantly presented as
statistical facts. All  tihs is supposed to help you make your
mind. But when television and  computers are integrated in a
single feedback loop on urgent issues, that  mind is made up for
you. Your own mind may hardly be involved at all. It is one
thing for polls to reflect, as accurately as possible, the 
opinions of a given community. It is quite another for the same
polls to  shape opinions, or present opinions which weren't
there before. This is  psychotechnology in action. Polls and
statistics have a homogenizing  effect on public opinion because
they highlight, and thus promote,  majority responses over
dissent. In a culture where the means of making  up one's mind
are given less weight and time than those which make up the 
collective mind, it is easier to let the majority hold sway.
This is one  of the trade-offs between book and television
culture." (Derrick de  Kerckhove, Skin Of Culture, pp. 211)
