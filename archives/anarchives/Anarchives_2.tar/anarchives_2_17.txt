This was a quick critique written in response to an article published by 
the Kick It Over Collective, then posted onto the Anarchist International 
News Service <a-infos@lglobal.com>.

We've been really busy lately and haven't had much time for writing, but 
traffic may pick up over the short term. Many ideas and activities are 
coming to the fore-front.

We're also in the early stages of forming a media group dedicated towards 
action, intelligence, and community empowerment in communications.

================================================================

This article made a number of excellent points, but it was also in it's own 
way misleading.

I need to make a few points in reading...

This is completely wrong and misleading.

Both the mainstream culture, and the counter-culture are primarily 
information. (going along with Gary's terms).

Knowledge evolves from the nature and media of this information.

The difference between the two is that the conter-culture is much more 
ready to share it's knowledge, whereas the mainstream hordes knowledge 
under the 'holy treasure' of intelectual property.

The key isn't understanding knowledge, (another misleading phrase), 
inherently knowledge is in itself comprehension.

The counter-culture needs to continue sharing knowledge.

This holistic approach can be facilitated with the aid of a computer 
screen.

This guy has already begun drawing away from his original concpets of 
information and knowledge.

> time (usually visually, especially in the computer age);

this is wrong

Information is increasingly absorbed acousticly not visually.
One of the most misleading 'myths' of electronic media is that they are 
visual.

The book and the written word were visual.

Electronic media are acoustic/oral. Email is almost a form of speaking. 
Television is useless without sound-over. (although really television is 
primarily physical, but that's another story).

Visual culture is linear, objective, and static.

Oral culture is holistic, subjective, and dynamic.

In the visual culture you're removed and a detached observer.

In the oral culture you're involved and a direct participant.

Other way around Gary. (He may have even said the opposite earlier in the 
paper).

What about the Gulf War when the state effectively controlled the media?

The maturity of the corporate state since the sixties has enabled the 
state to not only control media, but also own it.

this guy is taking 'popular', 'mainstream' conceptions of the emerging 
information environment and reflecting on their transformative 
properties. i think this is a waste of time. while his argument hear is 
good to hear, it is again, entirely misleading.

The activist establishment are shaking in their boots because they don't 
understand the new media, and they fear they never will.

I worry when I read this stuff, cause to me it just perpetuates the 
misunderstanding of the current media environment.

All is not futile, the opportunities, (albeit few), are emerging.

This guy speaks of mass indoctrination and corporate mind control as if 
it was a new thing. :)

Did my computer eat up my large library of books?
What about my radio, newspapers, and magazines?
What about my friends, family, and community?

Did they disappear when I became computer literate?

It is exactly the collectivization McLuhan predicted, (this guy would 
know if he ever read McLuhan), a collectivity based on shared ideas, 
feelings, emotions, and involved participation.

Unfortunately this collectivization is in the context of corporate 
collectivization.

But nonetheless it still is collectivity. Even if it doens't match our 
own conceptions of collectivity.

This guy is fucked. His analysis of the new media is limited to the 
context of old media.

He's making the exact same mistake by instead of running blindly out into 
the future he is running blindly out into the past.

The answer of course lies in neither running either way but taking the 
time to understand what the present has got to say.

Media should not be examined in a vacuum, nor out of context, nor without 
comparison between several media.

Old and new media should be used both in moderation and in complimentary 
facets.

We should not throw away the book for the computer, nor should we throw 
away the computer for the book.

We should understand all media. All aspects of the media.

We will only find liberation through a collective effort spanning many 
media, and many vehicles.

The specialist revolution of the past (which i'd argue this guy is 
promoting whether he knows it or not) is dead.

The revolution of today and tomorrow is holistic and inherently 
non-specialized.

As with the oral culture, we are all involved with the struggle for 
liberation.

This guy is somewhat messed up, kinda like those same right-wing 
survivalists.

He himself is a victim of the conditions he describes, and perpetuates 
their effects by perpetuating this misperception of the effects of media.

This is again wrong. McLuhan did not write or speak this interview. It 
was a fabrication of Playboy, and does not in any way represent his 
views. For a more accurate taste of McLuhan read: "Understanding Media".
He wasn't a political radical, but he was a radical nonetheless.

If I ever get to meet this guy he's going to get an earfull.
What bothers me the most about it is that I was previously under the 
impression that Kick It Over puts out good stuff.
guess not.

Love to all who made it this far in the analysis ;)
