pretending to be a preface
this was something i wrote in the spring
while under the uncertainties of an impending trial

i had been silenced from the net
financial conditions and political spight
kept me offline for a few months

it was supposed to be for a community
radio show i was involved in
but the radical staff said it wasn't,
"mainstream enough"
so i walked...

had it in my pocket for a bit
almost busted onto a stage to read it

but time has done it's dance
and the sky falls forward

Every morning I wake up at 6:45.
Internet syndrome.
I was linked with the global consciousness.
The synesthesia of minds eletronically fused.
Instead of coffee everymorning I began with a dose of information.
Mind candy for the sweet brain.
Accompanyed by a short toke; maybe the roach from last night
Free association
Patterns among the currents emerge
Does it have shape
It certainly has characteristics
I have danced with the creature as the sun rises.
I have had electric dreams of infinity and beyond
I've dosed for three hours linked into the machine.
The total perspective vortex. A vision of yourself sharing
ground with vast expanse. Size beyond figure visualization.
Size so great the centre is invisible; 'cause the centre is
everywhere.

Acoustic space.

You hear it rather than see it.
Staring into a flashing screen of a frequency based machine
receiving and transmitting data through phone lines.
The computer an extension of a radio
Receiving the signals of the new networks.
The digital networks.
In this environment you are everywhere and nowhere.
Granting new power
While extracting natural resources
Like the brains in the Universities
To help shape the future information age

The content is the old media, visualy based written word
Leading our linear existence into the new holistic environment

The transformative effecrts of the new media are so extreme that
they can only, if even then, be compared with the transformation
in media symbolized by Plato's publishing of The Republic and
the subsequent proliferation of the written word. Greek society
previous to this point was tribal and acoustic. Plato sought to
centralize greek society and shift the emphasis to the left
hemishpere. Plato was able to introduce the visual culture to
society through the publishing of his book The Republic. This
new medium carries within it the old media of oral culutre found
in the cities, but carries with it the new visual culture of the
state. The transformative effects of the new media introduced by
Plato were so successful that the majority have been in effect
to this century.

However with the advent of electronic media western society is
being transformed back to the acoustic, back to the right
hemisphere, shedding the visual culture that has been dominant
for centuries. The new media accelerate the amount of
information exchanged, greatly surpassing the old champion the
book.

Human minds become increasingly easier to control.

Programming of information, a/k/a propaganda, can be carried out
on much larger and extensive levels. The vulnerability that
accompanies union with the global consciousness places the inner
psyche within reach of outside forces. The amount of information
that is accessed becomes infinite. Information overload is
inevitable and the brain tries to keep up with the load.
Patterns of information can easily penentrate the psyche and
transform in its image.

The medium is the message.

It's transformative qualities are the issue. It's touch seems to
reach the inner regions of the human mind, the human soul.

It is an extension of humanity.

But who's humanity?

Little kid goes to his mommy: "Mommy where do computers come
from?"

"Well they come from the same place as all technology."

"Where's that?"

"The golden industries of the military-industrial complex."

"All of them?"

"Well some of them come from huge foreign conglomerates, but
they usualy have intimate links with the military-industrial
complex anyway. They're responsible for creating and developing
almost all of the media technology. What we have now they
invented maybe three decades ago. We cannot at times imagine
what they have now. But we'll be buying it in a decade or two
don't worry."

"So the technologies are their children, their products."

"Yes, extensions of the institutions themselves. They have been
able to effectively integrate military technology into the
innerworkings of our entire society. Their institutions have
upon ending the cold war successfully become the true war
society. The institution of war is so fully integrated that
actual mitlitary conflict is not a constant necessity. Small
conflicts dealt with by strong force every once in a while in
co-operation with a strong war-like economy sustain an entire
society that resembles a Platonic vision of gladiators ruling
the polis.

The new media complete the total reach of society's institutions
of war and economy that they become total and the centre
dissolves into the whole. Totality achieves subtelty as the cave
takes full effect in the total mass media environment. Shadows
on the wall become absolute, compromising an infinite ground.
Figure dissolves into obscutiry. The chains around our neck
become strengthened by information exposure. By becoming exposed
we hold ourselves out for manipulation, indoctrination, and
straight-out thought control. The noble lie becomes a reality.
Truth dissolves into the ground, becoming its own mystery.

The artist is presented as the messanger of the medium. The
person challenged to interpret the medium in terms of ground
(humanity in synesthesia) and the figure (dominating elite).

The search for patterns among the chaos.
Shapes that emerge among movements sporadically appearing.
Interpretation doubling as prediction, and prescription.

Minds to explore and define
wander among the blind
the quest for truth
the quest for a future

If you control the present you control the past
If you control the past you control the future
If you control the future you control the present
Information technology threatens total control

You can smell the change
Or more precisely you can hear the change
And more practically you can say the change
Words carry the change
On the back of the old media new ones ride
They've got the message
The global network is riding in on the visual horse of the written word
"The Blue Coats are coming! The Blue Coats are coming!"
It has the message;
And the message is change.

Are you ready for the change?
The answer of course is yes.
Television has been preparing you for decades.
The real question should be are you conscious of the change?
Probably not.

Most of us are not. At least conscious of the totality of the
change, and the extremeity of its consequences. Those open to
acknowleding the existence of this change immediately put
themselves at an advantage.

Action must be taken in the face of this change.

It's a corporate revolution of greed and profit
Accompanyed with the rape of humanity
A society to be raped by machines

Yet revolutions tend to be fairly volatile and unstable. The
early formative periods (which may already be ending) are the
most essential times in which to attempt participation in the
decision-making proccess.

My people our time is now. Our opportunity to rise up and invoke
change presents itself on the event horizon. And this time it
really looks like all or nothing.

A new age rapidly apporaches and society must begin to prepare
itself for the transformation.

Who's got power going in and who's going to have power going out?

You can bet your sweet stocks in AT&T that its going to a
smaller handful entities, perhaps at that point devoid of
humanity.

Organizations often primarily of strategic purposes will jostle
for supreme power in the accellerated age. The enitre globe
becomes transformed into an entity resembling its original
founder the human, complete with all aspects of the body. The
brain will be exponentially increased, while simultaneously
controlled by a smaller section. Perhaps organically linked with
the veins and nerves that traverse the body's anatomy the
central processing unit will have extensions reaching the enitre
organism.

The metaphorical parralel between the body and global entity;
veins and nerves with telephone lines and other media
transports; brain with computer core or CPU.

The extensions of humanity proliferate.

Every medium contains within itself its predecessor. The printed
word has as content the orality of the spoken word. Television
absorbed the medium of film, using it as content. The medium of
the automobile took over where the horse and buggy left off,
hence the references to horse power that still permeate.

The emerging information technology is the convergence of media.
It is the creation of the information super-highway which
absorbs almost all the reining major media. Television, video,
radio, computer, written word, spoken word, to name the obvious
are all converged to form the super media. It encompases a total
media environment within its boundaries.

The global information system becomes total.

An attempt to monopolize communication.

How can one approach looking at technology as new. We cannot
even begin to understand the technology that is possessed by the
military-industrial complex. They are the ones who developed the
internet twenty-five years ago. Imagine what they are developing
now. Their purposes for technological research are quite
different than ours would be. Yet our technology seems to rely
on hand-me downs from their more advanced systems. 

Nuclear technology is increasingly given less attention. The
stories that plague the media are of former eastern-bloc
countires potentially selling old-warheads, and plutonium. We
are not told however about third-generation nuclear weapons.
Nuclear development obviously did not stop after the first bomb
was dropped, and it has not stopped since the end of the cold
war either. Weapons exist today that are both extremely small
and extremely large in nuclear power. Obviously there exists
nuclear warheads that are large to the extent that one could
wipe out a large metropolitan area, such as New York or L.A.,
but there also exists warheads that can fit in a handbag, and
will destroy a city block, leaving only minimal fallout. Some of
the latter, third generation warheads have been developed for
warfare in the third world. Smaller explosives that can lay
waste to guerrilla armies, reducing radioactivity levels to
close to normal after a short period of three days. This way you
could wipe them out, and be able to reclaim the land after the
mess was cleared. They've got warheads with special heads that
can drill down into the earth towards bunkers or fortifications
and then dentonate their nuclear payload. No one is safe
anywhere, on top of the fact that with smaller explosives they
can avoid detection. (maybe)

And this is only the shit that we know of. Imagine some of the
things that they haven't mentioned to us.

TAO is bumrushing the media...
