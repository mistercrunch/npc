"The media extensions of humanity are the hominization of the
planet; it is the second phase of the original creation."1

"The extensions of human consciousness are projecting themselves
into the total world environment via electronics, forcing
humankind into a robotic future. In other words, the nature of
humanity is being very rapidly translated into information
systems which would produce enourmous global sensitivity and no
secrets. As usual humanity seems to be unaware of the
transformation."2

"As man succeeds in translating his central nervous system into
electronic circuitry, he stands on the threshold of outering his
consciousness into the computer."3



From millenium of fragmentation to holistic unity

Explosion of fusion and creation of an earthly and
simultaneously unearthly being.

A computer whose databases penetrate deep into nature and
civilization simultaneously, harnessing their powers for global
exploitation. Transforming and controlling its components with
programming of information. Generating its own consciousness and
intelligence drawn from human and digital resources. Soon
achieving the ability to project, and direct;. GAIA comes alive,
born from the technopoly of industry. The Global Market=99 The
Global Village=99 The Global Corporate State=99.

"Earth in the next century will have its collective
consciousness lifted off the planet's surface into a dense
electronic sympnoy where all nations - if they still exist as
separate entities - may live in a clutch of spontaneous
synesthesia, painfully aware of the triumphs and wounds of one
other. 'After such knowledge, what forgiveness.' Since the
electronic age is total and inclusive atomic warfare in the
'Global Village' cannot be limited."4

The revolution has no limits.

"There are no more passengers, only crew. Such a grap of
totality suggests the possiblily of control not only of the
planet but of change itself. Constant chage, for its own sake
threatens everybody."5

The revolution also has no limits, but it does have an agenda.
An agenda dictated by the same dictators who've been doin it for
centuries. This Information Revolution gives them the
opportunity to put it down for millenia.





The second industrial revolution is now upon us.

The information revolution.

A revolution that will transform the industrialized world into
an information economy.

Catapulting society into an information age.

Further enslaving humanity into the horrors of capitalism;
strengthening the oligarchy that has traditionally existed;
replacing the nation state with the global corporate state.

Immense amounts of power and wealth are being created and
simultaneously centralized into the hands of an increasingly
shrinking power elite.



The time is now brothers and sisters. It's act or be acted upon.



Music   -------- Run Niggers -----------  Last Poets



As the revolution comes it will be like a steam roll effect. A
groundwork needs to be laid for the Information Age. The
Information Infrastructure must be built. Fuck it, it is being
built right now. The Information Technology industry is rallying
to get the lines laid down, build up an industry, construct the
information economy. Create mass amounts of unemployment in the
process, not to mention abolish privacy, and destroy the
individual. Humanity turns towards the tribal in order to seek
security in a suddenly exposed and total world in which private
identity dissolves.



Puppets to technology will think, "Wow this shit is amazing!"
Marvelling at their two-way tvs, internet, and virtual reality.
Little do they realize they are selling their real freedom for
virtual freedom. Lost in their urban wastelands, staring into
their screens for hours thinking it's real life. They renounce
their privacy and expose themselves to twenty-first century
direct marketing. Living their lives virtually, entering data
into the global computer. As they plug-in and get on-line they
are transformed into a new being.

"Interactive - a cindition in which the user merges with the
data base or the system."6



People who I've talked to after initally plugging into the world
describe the event as "overwhelming" and "powerful", I even
heard a high school librarian call it "electronic heroin".
Connecting into a massive life form drawing from millions of
people and computers; simultaneously ovserving it and being a
part of it. Interactive in that it is you, and it is huge. When
you disconnect it is still in you for it changes you,
reconstructs your consciousness in relation to its, which is of
course part your own.

It lives Igor!



"In short, the entire operation has been miniatruized, speeded
up, and placed under the direction of one mind instead of
several."7

Unemployment from the new automation. The assembly line in the
information economy is travelled by electrons at the speed of
light. All potentially controlled by a handful of people.
Sys-ops and net administrators constitute a new bureaucratic
class of administrators or in some cases local sheriffs.
Enforcing "net-ettiquete" or their own operating agreements. The
control of the technology is centralized into the hands of the
few on the micro scale, and on the macro scale developed and
controlled by the few. The oligarchic controls of our society
are strengthened, and enforced. Organization remains oligarchy
as real control rests in hands of expertise and administraive
management. The government bureacracy is replaced with the
corporate model of sleek effeciency for profit. Your life
becomes tailor-made, all your needs could become met and
automatically served... Before your  even born.

"And holism will then emerge as a dominant form of thinking,
governed by a considerably smaller gourp of management elite."



Using EFT: electronic fund transfers, "banks are able to
transfer money electonically between customers banck accounts"
which in effect enables "the creation of a super bank through
the electric linking of literally hundreds of local and regional
data sources to provide the entire Western world a view of your
social and economic standing."8

Finance in the information revolution must be fairly unified. Or
in other words capital must be liberated to such an extent that
management and devlopment of the corporate state be efficient
and complete. GAIA the earth computer must be able to have all
resources easily accessible in order to function properly. Great
amounts of capital will be generated by the Information
Revolution and this capital must be available to be used to
further develop the revolution as it grows exponentially.

"There is no technical reason why the 40,000 - odd financial
isntitutions in North America devoted to banking, securities,
and insurance could not be merged into a single institution
through electronic means."9



"The future holds for us a corporate man who will accept the
goldfish bowl as a natural habitat - having recognized that
electronic espionage has already become an art form."10

Privacy is eliminated along with individualism so each person
can become a full participant in the Global Database. The
information they produce as a human being will be extracted for
the purposes of the whole. Their privacy will be traded in for a
corporate identity and global consciousness. Their participation
in the global computer comes at the price of their private
identities; faced with the immensity of creation; of millions of
people simultaneously existing in the same enviroment; what
McLuhan terms synethesia. A new consciousness.

"More and more people will enter the market of information
exchange, lose their private identities in the process, but
emerge with the ability to interact with any person on the face
of the glove. Mass, spontaneous electronic referendums will
sweep across continents. the concept of nationalism will fade
and regional governments will fall as the political implicatons
of spaceship earth create a wrold government."11

The emergence of the Global Corporate State.

And where will this Global Corporate State emerge from?

From where it already is now.

"The multi-carrier media corporation has the peculiar ability to
be a media orchestrator, to link all video-related technologies,
whenter staellite, earth station, microwave, date base, or
computer into a resonating whole."12

Now who's this going to be you ask?

The American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) or the
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

Personally I put my money on AT&T. I've conducted substantial
research on the fuckers and am now scared out of my wits for
both the present and the future.

In 1980 AT&T was bigger that GE, GM, USGold, Kodak, and Xerox
combined. They were also bigger than the entire US Army. Since
then there size on paper has diminished, but there power has
grown exponentially. With over 30 million shareholders they are
a nation unto themselves, their power earning them their own
sovereignty.

AT&T was and probably still is the core of the
military-industrial complex's research & development. They own
the patents and copyrights on almost all the technology that
exists today, and almost all the technology that will exist
tomorrow.

Through directorship-ties and partial or full ownership of
countless other companies they are a corporate empire equal to
none. As information technology continues to proliferate AT&T
will only continue to grow.

Similarly IBM a giant in its own right, will also benefit
greatly from the Information Revolution. They have a virtyal
monopoly on global computer production providing about 70% of
the mainframes used in the world. Mainframes are the central
part of any large or networking computer. They generate profits
around the $6 Billion dollar mark and also have their own nation
of shareholders. As computers become more of an integral part of
our lives, IBM will also.

It's also worth noting that they too are a part of the
military-industrial complex.

Both IBM and AT&T operate their own private networks, seperate
from the internet but still able to access its resources.
Included in these networks are two-way television communication
which AT&T as already started marketing.



"The bad news is that all persons, whether or not they
understand the processes of computerized high-speed data
transmission, will lose their old private identities. What
knowledge there is will be available to all. So, in that sense,
verybody will be nobody. Everyone will be involved in robotic
role-playing including those few elitists who interpret or
manage large-scale data patterns and thsu control the functions
of a speed-of-light society. The more quickly the rate of
information exchange speeds up, the more likely we will al merge
into a new robotic corporate entity, devoid of true specialism
which has been the hallmark of our old private identities. The
more information one has to evaluate, the less one knows.
Specialism cannot exist at the speed of light."13



"What is happening at the present time is that chagnes are
occuring so rapidly that the rearview mirror does not work
anymore - -at jet speeds, rearview mirrors are not very useful.
One must have a way of anticipating the future. Humankind can no
longer, through fear of the unkown, expend so much energy
translating anything new into something old but must do what the
artist does: develop the habit of approaching the present as a
task, as an envrionment to be discussed, analyzed, coped with,
so that the future may be seen more clearly."14
