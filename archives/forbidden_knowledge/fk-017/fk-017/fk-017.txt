' There is a kind of religion in science; it is the religion of a person who
  believes that every event in the universe can be explained in a rational
  way as the product of some previous event.

  This faith is violated by the discovery that the world had a beginning under
  conditions in which the known laws of physics are not valid. When that
  happens, the scientist has lost control. He reacts by ignoring the
  implications, or by trivializing and calling it the big-bang, as if the
  universe was a firecracker.

  For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the
  story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is
  about to conquer the highest peak; and as he pulls himself over the final
  rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there
  for centuries.'

[30/06/2002]

Today I was for-real arrested for the first time.

It was at 'The Mall of Rosebank', where I was wandering around bored, by
myself, thinking about how much I hate ppl, how ugly this place is, wotwot..

And there were these 'crime stop' ppl, standing at the foot of the escalators
collecting money, and there was this mingan old chiq with a 'stop crime'
t-shirt whining 'help stop craaim, rosebank police..'; and they had all of
these tiny yellow safety cones with 'POLICE' written on them, and they'd
arranged them all along the ends of the escalator, and put one right on top of
this pole that you have to walk around to go up the up-escalator, which was
annoying.- Sew on my way baq out of the mall I pull the d0rkiest face I can @
the crime stop lady, pick up the cone off the pole, and start walking away,
towards the exit.

I'm just outside, and I'm beginning to wonder if these ppl r gona come after
me or not, when I hear a security guard whistling after me. The smarter, more
paranoid, distrusting part of my brain is telling me to throw the cone at him
as hard as I can and run like hell, but the more rational, domestic part of my
brain walks me over to him and tries to give him the cone & explain to him
that it was all just a prank.

But he's not interested in taking the cone, or letting me put it back, and he
grabs me by the arm & marches me off into the security control room, where I
get to re-tell my version of what happened to a million other security guards
who either weren't there or weren't listening, or only decided they had
something to interrogate me about at that moment..

One suggests that I am stealing safety cones today, and will be stealing cars
and breaking into houses tomorrow.

Another suggests that I am going to use the cone to pose as a crime stop fund
collector. I tell him that I'd still need a T-Shirt & a collection tin, and
perhaps some more cones..

I point out again that it was a simple prank, and that the cone does not have
any retail value..

One particularly moronic, agressive security guard starts pointing at the
cone, on the part where it says 'POLICE', and asks me 'What does it say here?'

'Police.'
'What does it say here?'
'..Police.'
'Value!'

Um.

'Do you know what is the meaning of value?'
'Uuh.'
'Do you know what is the, dictit of value?'
 Em, know 4u what is the meaning of 'definition', mor0n? ;p
I mean: 'Uuuh, yea, uhm, like.. it's worth..'

At one other point this same moron was asking me 'Hell to who?' repeatedly
after I had, perhaps, said 'hell' in some sentence, but I don't think I was
even talking to him, and I had forgotten what I said already, so I just looked
at him and eventually he shut up. Neway..

So I'm trying to hurry things up a bit - asking them if I can make a call,
asking them if I can fill in my ID number on the form they've taken out for
banning ppl from the Rosebank Mall in terms of the Trespass Act 6/59, but
they don't seem to be in much of a hurry and don't want me to do anything else
except answer their retarded questions..

'Do you smoke druks?'
'No.'

'Are you siek?'
'Uuh, no.'
'I asked you a question, are you siek?'
'Uuuh, no.'
'Are you on medication?'

Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla. Enter Mister Inspector K. Pillay..

The Inspector tells me about how hard he's been working collecting money at
the Mall, and how he had to do this on this day and this on this day, shame..

He asks if I smoke druks and if they've searched me; this they have done..

'I just want to give you a klap, meyn!'
'Can I give you a klap?'
'Uuh, ..No.'
'Must I give you a klap?'
'No..' ;p

He asks me something else which requires me to say more than one word.
'Why are you speaking like that? Are you a moffie?'
'No.' - I'm just soft-spoken & polite, not very much like you, diqhed..

I think that all cops have very strong feelings of some kind about
homosexuality, which are very prominent amongst their other mounting
obsessions which eventually make them decide to become policemen..

'I've been working na na na to protect our community' - 'and because of
monkeys like you..' Bla Bla. Clowns. Monkeys. The Inspector calls the police
station, and tells them to send some1 round to 'lock me up', and leaves..

Later enter two black policemen, and every1 get's to re-iterate their 2 cents
about what happened..

One of the two policemen in particular seems to think this is all a bit mad,
and says that he doesn't think this will stand up in court na na na, and they
talk about it, and the one policeman phones my dad on the phone a security
guard had previously told me 'couldn't call out' -
'hello, umm, your son bla bla bla. is he healthy, or what? we don't know..',
and eventually the two policemen consult Inspector Pillay on the issue, who is
adamant that I should go to jail or whatever, so they take out the arrest form
and start painstakingly filling it all in..

'What colour is the cone?' one policeman asks.
'Lime.' says the other..
'Lime..' the first one repeats, and writes it down..

'What is it? A traffic cone?'
'Safety cone.' I suggest.
'Safety cone.' The other policeman echos.

'How do you spell `cone`?' the first policeman asks.
'C-O-N-E-S' a security guard suggests..
'C... C-O-N-E' the other policeman says..

Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla..

So eventually they finish filling out the form, and they take me out of the
control room, into the back of a police van, and off to the Rosebank police
station, where I sit in the back of the car for 10 minutes while the two
policemen have a chat. Then they take me into the station, where they put me
in a back room; not a detention cell, I notice, but a back room with computers
and papers n stuf.. I thought it a good omen that they had not thrown me in
a real holding cell yet, but as of yet I did not know what to expect.. And
it was Sunday, so I'd at least have to spend the night in jail until the
courts opened again the next day and they decided my case was too dumb to
actually be sent there..

My girlfriend calls, and I have a long-ish chat with her - she's all concerned
about my recent spate of kleptomania and me being in jail and all, and when I
get off the fone to her, I can hear my dad's boss's voice from the front of
the station. He's wearing one of the 'STOP CRIME' stickers they were selling
at the mall and he's telling the other policemen that Inspector Pillay says
it's ok to drop the whole thing and that they can fone him and check. Turns
out the Honourable Mr Pillay's change of opinion cost only a lousy 20 bux..
But the other policemen say that The Mall of Rosebank had written down that I
was arrested na na na, and another 100 bux later, they don't care either, and
magically, somewhere, somehow, justice, um, happens, and they let me go..

If you live in Jo'burg, look-up Mr Komoran Pillay's home phone # and tell him
you read about his fam0us ass on the effkay.org, and tell him that he released
one of ZA's most danger0us hax0rz to rape & pillage at will for a lousy 20
bux, and also that he is a gay-homosexual scrotum-scratching dog-raping
butt-bandit (write that down so as 2b sure that you get it verbatim mm'k)..

..Um. And that is all I have to tell you. ;) for now..

Some Thoughts On 'Vodacom's World of Games' from the ed.
---***----***------------(&*)--(*&)^---->%&^>

I signed up for a free WAP account @ vodacom4me.co.za, and have since been
using the site a bit, to send SMSz n wotnot.. & while I was browsing around
there site, I stumbled across this thingy about 'Vodacom's World of [SMS]
Games' @ 0820008200 mm'k..

Basically what is here is: IDOLS TRIVIA (did not look @ this), SUPER12 TRIVIA
(emm, ditto), LOVE M8 (eHEH), and SMS Chat.. The SMS Chat is real, albeit
completely krap (altho it is spozdly international, w ppl from New Zealand &
China n w0tn0t, which wz y i wz vaguely interested in it in the first place)
-- we will cm baq 2 this..

The LoveM8 Game (Send 'LM PLAY' to play (after sending 'REG YOURNAME' to
registr a handle)); is *completely fake*, I am sure.. ;p

After you tell it u want to play it SMSz u & sez 'I am looking for ppl to play
with u bla bla, wil wait up to 10 mins'; then it SMSz u like 'ok, these 3
handles picked at random from our database are competing for your attention',
'your first question is: when @ the beach, do u wear A) As little as legal ..
Bla Bla Bla, and you send it 'LM A' - as little as legal - and it SMSz u baq
saying that every1 has rated u 100%, and then SMSz u again asking:

'For me sex is a _______ thing
 A) Physical
 B) Emotional
 C) Necessary'

So then u send it 'LM C', and it SMSz u baq and tells you that u were sposed
to pick 'B' and every1 is now rating u @ 50%.. Thing is, I can't figure out
how you get on the other side of this game as such, which makes me think it
is a complete SCAM.. ;)

[Ammendment by the ed: The LoveM8 game no longer features on Vodacom's World
 of Games; it is now an assortment of other, equally arbitrary krap..]

The SMS Chat seems to be real, but is very krap. I was drawn to it bcoz I
thought harassing lots of ppl for the cost of one SMS could be ko0l - Guess
again. After you've sent 'REG WHATEVER', and 'T2 HELP', followed by
'T2 ROOMS', followed by 'T2 ENTER ROOM', you're sent a list of handles that
are in the room. You then send 'T2 HANDLE BLA BLA' to whoever you think sounds
like they could just be yor true love. And g0d you'll have a hard time
choosing..

Real life example:
OZCHICK1: HI, ASL? [in response to] LOVEHUNK: [that's me ;p] HELO!! I AM MOST
PECULIAR TO FUCK YOU! IF YOU LIKE HAM & BOILED EGGS, THAN I AM YOR MAN.

Another One:
WENDZ2: SO DO I. SO WHAT U WAITING FOR? I'M LONELY & BORED. C'MON - ENTERTAIN
ME. I'M ALL YOURS
[AND]
WENDZ2: AND NOW? Y U SO QUIET?
[in response to]
LOVEHUNK: I WONT VERY MUCH TO PLEAS TUCH YOR BOOB PLEAS.

... lonely? ;p you don't even have to pretend you're not a complete moron or
    have a vaguely attractive personality to be the man here..

One more, slightly more extreme, real life example: ;p

SUSIE15: Hi. You can fuck me if you want, I don't mind. So what are you going
to do to me first? [in response t0; a variation of one of the above..]
LOVEHUNK: HELO! I AM MOST PEKULIAR TO FUK YOU!! IF YOU LIKE POLONY &
HARD-BOILD EGGZ - THAN I AM YOR GUY.
[followed by]
LOVEHUNK: FIRST AM I UNWRAPPING THE POLONY. THAN AM I MAKING THE SANDWICHES.
[followed by]
LOVEHUNK: NOW I AM PEELING OFF THE LAST OF MY POLONY WRAPPER & SHOVING THE
REMAINS HARD RIGHT UP INTO YOR WET STINKY PUNANI. LOVELY, SEE?
[no response]

Btw, after the first T2 message you send you will get an SMS that sez that
'T2 is a great way to meet people' and that you shouldn't send content that
could be considered offensive in any way; but the msgz r not censored
none-the-less..

Sew, like, the only kool thing I could think about this is using it to play
dumb pranks on your friends who don't know about 'Vodacom's World of Games'
by registering them for it quickly while they're out of the room with
'REG HANDLE' to 0820008200, and then deleting the 2 SMSz it will send them
baq. ;p

You don't have to make them join a room or anything, sew just the one SMS to
register them is sufficient to create an anonymous SMS pipe to txt y0r er0t1c
p03tRy to that girl in yor class that u f4nCy or wotevr..

Just send 'T2 THEIRHANDLE BLABLA' to 0820008200 on yor fone to harass them
anonymously, then 'REG NEW NAME' to change your handle and harass them more,
or wotevr, bla... The first T2 message they get from you will come with
another SMS explaining how to reply.. ;)

Thoughts on Audio CD Copy Protection from the ed.
---***----***------------(&*)--(*&)^---->%&^>

The new Aphex Twin CD, druqkz (which is a highly recommended album, btw), has
a sticker on it reading 'This CD cannot be played on computers', which, as it
would seem, it cannot. Why? And what to do about this?

I figure it is probably just missing some industry-standard boot-sectory sort
of information, and if you were a re4lly klev3r fell0w you could just write a
driver to allow you to read it normally.

The easier alternative, if you just want to rip it, is plugging your hi-fi
into your sound-card's audio-in and ripping it through there. The main problem
with doing it this way is you'll have to record each track one at a time, or
make a rip of the whole album.

The same form of copy protection could arguably be achieved by making your
whole album on a single track, albeit it would annoy people and the other way
is obviously better. ;p

So, depending on what ur doing and h0w el8 u r, it may turn out faster to try
and write a driver to make these CDz work. Of course, it will also make things
faster for a whole bunch of other ppl, coz once sm1 has written a driver to
allow this, no1 els wil hav 2 do it. ;p

On Vegitarianism, by the ed.
---***----***------------(&*)--(*&)^---->%&^>

Few people know that I have, for some years, been a fairly strict vegitarian,
and when they find out that I am, they usually have something retarded to say.

A little soapbox here for the case for vegitarianism.

My primary rationalisation for not eating meat is purely from a
socio-economical standpoint; in that: the amount of food that is fed to a cow
before it is eaten could feed *many* more people than that cow itself - if
you did Grade 9 Biology you will understand that this is the case, and that
eating cows on this grounds alone could be considered unnecessary, stupid,
and wasteful.

My other reason for being vegitarian is more moral -- If you acknowledge that
all animals (including ourselves), are all built of the same crap, and are all
equally and completely worthless in the universal scheme of things; you might
want to allow everything equal & fair treatment as you would like to recieve
for yourself.

The act of eating a hamburger is not morally wrong. The act of *buying*
hamburgers, and allowing, through your financial support, for more animals to
be bred & slaughtered, could certainly be considered morally dubious at least
to anyone who thinks about it with a clear conscience.

One argument I've gotten from non-vegitarians is that plants are alive too,
which is true, however: plants are clearly non-sensate - they don't have eyes
or ears; and they aren't really even sensate enough to experience death as
such - a potato can grow again after being out of the earth for months -&
they really don't know any better for when they are plucked out of the ground
and eaten; where-as a cow would most certainly be quite aware of its impending
death, and would probably already be somewhere else were it able to be..

But the most-used argument by non-vegitarians is that they actually just don't
give a fuck, which is fine - but it's generally indicative that they aren't
able to think as far as to why it's obviously completely fucked-up, and
unnecessary. [Re: Protein: Once inside your body all protein is broken up into
constituent amino acids- only 4(/14) of which cannot be synthesised by your
body itself, all of which are readily available in various non-meat foods]

I consider myself a bit of a nihilist, but actually, I think most people,
regardless of what they say they believe, are much more nihilistic and fucking
A-moral than myself. They think everything is a theory and don't have the
capacity to compute anything they might believe into potential fact. They will
claim to be people of religious faith, but the underlying truth is that they
CANNOT THINK and that they BELIEVE IN NOTHING AT ALL.

[ I suspect that they are randomly generated. ;> ]

And if theres is no algorithm then is there another way to get credit,
or maybe call and not get charged?? As u know the peak rate for
Vodago/4U (per second) is 6 cents a sec, thats R3.60 a min!, which i
feel is too fuckin much. I'll try my best to help as well but as i
said im in Matric so i dont have alot of free time.

This wasn't mailed in, it's some commentary on the zine that a reader found on
the web, which was too cool to go unpublished. ;p Thanks to w3stside for

I am almost 100% sure there is going to be a backlash for me for what I am
about to write but I call 'em like I see 'em. I just spent the last hour
reading an e-zine called Forbidden Knowledge issue 15 and 16 (the links are
where I stumbled across them). All I can say is that I have never ever read a
bigger load of crap in my whole life. The author is so full of hot air I am
suprised he has not spontaneously combust. I suppose that you are allowed to
be like that when you [are] young and you have some computer skills. You get
so lost in cyber space that reality becomes non existent. Kind of like those
fanatical Arabs that are so immersed in their religion that the world around
them actually fades into oblivion. Never mind that if it were not for reality
their escapades into delusion would not be possible. [int3rest1ng k0nc3pt y0u
h4v3 th3r3, b0yo.. tell me that again..]

A case in point in issue 16 is how the author rants about 11 September 

"Attacks such as the ones that took place on September 11th are not a problem
 that America can solve; because they *are* the problem. It just happens that
 some people have finally gotten sick enough of what America is doing to the
 rest of the world to take matters into their own hands. And I support them.
 So fuck you. American Facist Swine." Very brave in the faceless world of
cyberspace, however in the same article [issue] he recites how him and his
friend went to hide from the cops when they came to their house cause the
party was to[o] loud. [ ;p ]

The cops should have found your drugs then you could have been taught a lesson
in reality by "BUBBA" [*BY ``BUBBA''!!* :))] while you waited for your parents
to come collect you from jail.

One day when I grow up I want to bee L33t like that. 

Until next time 

Cheers

He's advancing closer towards me again, still holding the monkey firmly by its
neck.

"Oob Num Nub Nummm`Twa", he says to me.

"n0 w4y do0d" I retort, completely 3l33t-l1k3, "bc0z, like, y0u're only seeing
half 0f the picture. man. I mean; I look at y0r monkey there and i see a *s1ck
fuck1ng m0nk3y*; d1g?"

He pauses a moment to glance at the ape and then quickly turns his attention
back towards me, stepping right up in front of me now, holding the now quite
battered-looking marmoset directly in front of my nose.

..Or is it a lemur?

"Ooba Num-Fuf GIG!" he insists.

I pause for a moment to try and think, wondering how I could word what I
want to say so as to prevent the situation from becoming ugly. And I have a
horrible feeling that thats precisely what's about to happen anyway...

But, like, h4rk, c0z, like, what the fuck is going on, man? For suddenly I
realised that I was in fact not in that terrible place, but asleep in front of
my computer, the edit0r of a l0wly e-zine; and that the man was nothing more
than a figment of my tortured little chemically-imbalanced mind.

And I realise that I *am* the man, *and* the ailing monkey, and everything
else that had ever seemed real to me..

And I close my eyes again.. and seek to be nothing at all.
