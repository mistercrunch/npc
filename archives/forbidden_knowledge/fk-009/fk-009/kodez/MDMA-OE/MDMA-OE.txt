Offline Explorer Advisory
Released by Wizdumb under MDMA (Mad Dumb Mid-Adolescents)

Offline Explorer by Metaproducts <www.metaproducts.com> is currently the most
popular Offline browser for the Windows platform. It is also a huge security
hazard. All versions prior to the *very* latest version are vulnerable and I
have a suspiscion that possibly even that one may still have some very
serious problems. (I'll take a look when I get a new video card and can boot
my PC again :P)

Regardless, the flaw is remotely exploitable, and requires only for Offline
Explorer to be open on the host being attacked. The problem is due to the fact
that OE starts a HTTP server on port 800 through which the cache is remotely
viewable. Worse yet, directory climbing is possible: Although a 'GET /../../'
or a 'GET ../../' won't yield any useful results, it appears that a simple
'GET ../..\' does the trick just great.

Also note that the server wants its input fast, so cut and paste to telnet
with gpm, or alternatively, just echo stuff through netcat.

Later,
Wizdumb
