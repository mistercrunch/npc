00> Why?

Because I'm tired of writing the same code over and over every time I
write an appy that uses sockets. This library was written so that *I* have
to do as little work as possible, coz I'm a lazy fuggin shmoe, okay? :-)

01> Usage of the API

First of all put the compiled tcpConnection.class in net/wizdumb/tcp
somewhere in your classpath. You are now ready to start using the API...

tcpConnectiom will have to be instantiated as null initially if it's
proper instantiation is gonna be in a try {} block.

01.0a> Constructors

tcpConnection(String connection) where connection is a string with a colon
deliminated host and port.

tcpConnection(InetAddress inet, int port) where inet is a InetAddress
object and port is the port to connect to.

tcpConnection(String host, int port) - Ditto, but host is a string

tcpConnection(String connection, boolean read, boolean write)
tcpConnection(InetAddress inet, int port, boolean read, boolean write)
tcpConnection(String host, int port, boolean read, boolean write)

Same constructors as before, except for read and write which are boolean
values for which I/O streams are needed, for if you're super-fussy about
free resources & un-used objects n stuff.

01.0b> Methods, etc

void disconnect()
Closes Socket & I/O streams

void reconnect() throws Exception
If no args, reconnects to host tcpConnection is or last was connected to
Otherwise, can recieve arguments as in the tcpConnection constructors

I/O is handled as it would be if you were using a BufferedReader and/or a
PrintWriter. Just instead of PrintWriter.print() and BufferedReader.read(),
you call tcpConnection.print() and tcpConnection.read(). If you don't want
your functions from BufferedReader to throw exceptions, prepend an "e" to
the routine you want to have exceptions ignored (eg. tcpConnection.eread())
