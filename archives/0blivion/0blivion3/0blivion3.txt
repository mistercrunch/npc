Issue 3 Introduction - Slider
**********************************************

Well, its the third coming of Oblivion and you might of noticed that im 
editing this month.

Why?  Caus I asked, and Cyber gave, aint he nice :]

This month Is a tiny bit special because as I was in charge i decided to 
change the outline of the zine to what i wanted, and the specifications of
articles :P

Also we have gone a little more technical thanks to Lockdown and this 
theorys, and generally i got my head down and wrote some better articles, also
cyber approached Attrition.org bowed his head got on his knees and pleaded for
an interview, and they gave it cos they feer'd... No honestly they did, no 
really...

So exactly what did you give them Cyber to get the interviews ?

Anyways, what have i been up to, well... I have been on holiday, and stuff and
been to my mates funeral, who was involved in a car crash on Friday 28th/
Saturday 29th May and was put onto a life support machine until the Monday,
when it was switched off.  He was a good friend and only 3 days before I had
spoken to him in a club, both blotted.

Anyway, life goes on and we must party hard, drink to much and get blotted :]
And o yeah, do some work once in a few years.

So heres issue 3, hope you like it, and this month we have had some audience
participation :]~

I also have had some good comments from followers, congratulating us on our
work, i would like to say thank you, the more comments we get the better we
can upgrade our work.

We also want more articles from you, the audience, because you make it what
it is, i also want some requests for articles, caus like i said you make
it what it is.

I would also like to thank 809, 2600-UK, [Spammy] and Nynex, Spaceman,
Abbattis, Sadarar, Si, and other friends.

I would like to say thank you to Hacker News Network, and to Net-security 
for putting us on their sites.  We had about 1000 hits in the first day, and
we have been getting articles sent in, which have been included in this months
issue, if it has not been added, then you should know why, because we 
emailed you back the reason :]

Exploits havent been added this month, due to the fact i ran out of time... 
It will be in next months bigger and better than normal with a few changes.

Also what amused me was when someone on IRC asked me if the UK was really 
like it is portrayed in "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", lets just say he
aint coming over here... Period... hehe

Feer Us f00ls Or We Will Shoot Your Knee Caps Off

Also, ANARCHY SUCKS ASS... So dont bother doing it f00ls cos I will shoot your
kneecaps off :]

Also it was noted this month that Ali G is getting letters from a group 
called Combat 18.  Guys, he is taking the piss out of black/white culture and
how it is inter-linked into todays society, The guy is a geniues in the eyes
of many, including myself.  If it is because he is Jewish, then get a life,
because this kind of racism is not wanted in todays world, nor will it be
tolerated.  If it was not for the culture of Jewish people to be non-racist
or for its non-violent nature, then i would personally cart you to the nearest
country where they hang out and help them give you the kicking you deserve.

Slider.

                  AGHHH SHIT, I'VE BEEN SHOT. I DONT FUCKING
               BELIEVE THIS... COULD EVERYONE STOP GETTING SHOT?

********************************
Deputy Editors Rant - Cyber0ptix
********************************

So you've just decided to read the deputy editors section of this months zine
and what do you find? Me, writing the deputy editors slot! NO, its not an
error in the editing.  We decided to let Slider edit this months zine, for a
few reasons.  Firstly I have a lot on with work and Uni at the moment, and it
just so happened that Slider said he would like to edit an issue.  So this is
it.  Hopefully over the next few months we will be able to get different
members of the team to take a turn at editing issues so that they can appear
different and not start to look stale and the same each month.

Well another month has passed in the life of Oblivion, and yes we do seem to
be getting more popular, both with hits to the website and people joining in
the fun on #oblivionmag on efNET.

Well this month we seem to have gained a new writer to the team, Lockdown.
If ya aint already read any of his articles in this months issue then i would
advise you to make sure you do, as this bloke is just plain mad ;) but he also
know a thing or two about networking and has written some excellent texts on
network protocols and security.

Well the team at Oblivion have kind of decided to change direction a little,
this doesn't mean we will be not bringing you the quality articles every
month, that you have grown to love ;) but we are going to be changing a few
things around.  Anyway enough of that for now, at the moment we have postponed
any changes until the release of issue 4, which will be on the 15th of June.
just make sure you go to www.oblivion-mag.org.uk to get your latest copy and
all will be revealed then ;)  If your on the mailing list, dont worry we will
be sending out full details of the changes when we send you issue 4.

So what will you be expecting?  Well we are currently developing a new
website, which along with all the issues of the magazine, will carry all the
latest news, links to some of the best resources on the net, a large file
area with files in all aspects of computer security.

Well thats enough about that for now.  So what else has been happening this
month?  Well no doubt you saw on the news about the 'Love Bug'.  Well for
some reason the world seems to of woken upto the reality of computer security.
Sometimes the worst things make people realise what is possible.  If everyone
wasn't so hell bent on using Microshaft products then maybe it would of just
passed by like the majority of viruses/worms that appear and no-one takes any
notice of.

Cancer Omega Interview - Cyber0ptix
**********************************************

Interview with Cancer Omega, member of the top class Attrition.org site.

Q1) Introduce yourself?

Cancer Omega.  Former "token fed" of Attrition (now ex-NASA). I perform
updates to the system where requested and do occasional PERL & shell scripting
to make tasks simpler for Attrition Staff. I also do occasional paper
authoring that goes up in various Attrition sections.  I'm also the
maintainer of the Attrition "Firearms Demystified" section.

Q2) When did you get into the computer Underground?

That would have been in the mid '80s during the BBS craze.  I stayed largely
on the periphery as it was apparent that anyone who went out for publicity was
generally subject to LE investigation.  Times are much different now.

Q3) Why do you run attrition.org?

Why not?  As Attrition is a not-for-profit site and has no political masters
to serve, it is an excellent vehicle by which the unadulterated and
non-sugar-coated truth about security may be told.  We don't have a product to
pitch, nor do we have capital interests to serve.  While this does limit our
"authority" in the eyes of some, it is incredibly liberating in that we can go
in whatever direction we see fit.

Q4) What do you think of 'crackers'?

I have no respect for them.  They could be utilizing their time in far better
ways.

Q5) Have you ever defaced a website?

No.

Q6) What was your first computer?

Timex Sinclair ZX80 with a whopping 16K of RAM.  ;-)

Q7) What Systems do you have set-up at home?

Two windows boxes, and two Solaris 7 (x86) boxes in progress.  One Sparc 1
that's in serious need of a lobotomy.

Q8) What Operating Systems do you most rate?

I'm not sure I understand the question.  Can you rephrase?

< what O/S do you most like, Mines OS400 :]~ - Slider >

Q9) What, in your opinion, is the most secure Operating System?

Out-of-box install: OpenBSD.
Modified/locked-down install: Just about any flavor of UNIX.
Bottom line: a system is only as secure as its admin is competent.

Q10) What do you think of the state of the Underground today?

These days, especially in the States, the bulk of the underground has been
taken over by juvenile angst and egotistical posturing.  The pure research
and discovery of vulnerabilities has long since moved to above-board
specialists like the l0pht and other groups who make full disclosure their
policy.

Q11) Who do you most respect in the Underground?

As I mentioned in my previous reply, most of the skilled people aren't really
"underground."  They're above-board.  With that in mind, the people I respect
most are the l0pht crew, the people at dis.org, eEye and others.

Q12) Who were your mentors, when you started to get into the Scene?

When I first started, anyone who did original work accorded much respect in my
book.  I was never actually mentored by any one person.  Quite often it was
more a case of me visiting with them, learning what resources (books,
periodicals, and so on) they deemed of value, and pursuing those resources
myself.  I wasn't much of a social creature when I was younger, but I've
broadened my social scope since I've grown older.

Q13) Have you ever read Oblivion Underground Magazine?

Until now, no.

Q14) Do you think you will ever read it?

Possibly.  Judging from the site content, it looks pretty new.  Time will
tell.

Q15) What do you think of people getting arrested for hacking?

If you mean people who defaced websites getting arrested, I'd say the criminal
investigation is misguided.  It seems a waste of time and money to run around
tracking down kids who did little more than digital graffiti.  It strikes me
as far more advisable to spend said time and resources on educating admins so
their machines aren't such easy targets.

On a tangential note, I find the turbo-legal harassment of hackers (like those
who created the DVD encryption crack and the CyberPatrol crack) to be utterly
criminal.  The people being persecuted in these cases did nothing more than
show inherent flaws in a system that was touted as secure.  In my view, those
hackers should not be on trial; the people who developed said insecure
products should.

Q16) What do you think of 'skript kiddies'?

Apart from readily demonstrating that most admins on the 'net don't have a
clue about security, they have no purpose.

Q17) What other groups have you ever belonged to?

None, really.  I prefer to be solely responsible for my own actions. Being in
groups tends to foster issues of "guilt-by-association" and sometimes charges
of "conspiracy" that I'd sooner avoid.  It's better to say that I have friends
with whom I share common interests.

Q18) Do you ever admire any of the 'crackers' that you mirror on
     attrition.org?

While I don't admire the crackers of the present day, there were some historic
website defacements that I found amusing or elegant in some way. But the vast
majority of defacements are just a waste of space.

Q20) Any greets?

I'd like to say hello to my Mum & Dad.  Dad used to say that I was wasting my
time with my computer hobby.  ;-)

Q21) Any links you wanna plug?

http://www.attrition.org/technical/firearms/

AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORKS - Virtual_Byte
**********************************************

Virtual_Byte@hotmail.com

Ok I was just reading through and interview with Slider and he describes his 
systems at home. And I was thinking shit, how many people would really
understand all this? Cause I had to go through it twice.

< Well, it did take 1 1/2 years to get everything and put it together -
Slider >

So came to a conclusion... write an article on networks. Since I know a little
about this I thought wicked. So here I go.

First I will tell you about basic communications.

Simplex - This allows communication in one direction only. Must switch 
between transmit and receive on agreed signal.

Duplex - Two channels one for each direction and both permanently available.

Half Duplex - A single channel that may be used by communication in either 
direction but not at the same time.

Asymmetric Duplex - Same as duplex but one direction has a lower 
transmission speed than the other.

Network topologies.
- Different shapes and layouts of the network.
- Each terminal is referred to as a Node.
- Host, is the central computer that controls the network.
- Subnet, is the type of communication within the network.
- Methods of data transmission.
    - Point to Point. Only goes to addressee
    - Broadcast. Goes to all stations and reads the address to see if the 
      message is for them.

I will start to go through the different topologies.

Star - This type has a central computer known as a hub. And have a number of 
nodes (nodes) they each have a separate connection. This type of network is
good for LANs (Local Area Network) and for WANs (Wide Area Network). This
uses Point to Point transmission for communication.

A hub can be a big PC. Or even a minicomputer or a mainframe. Usually
determined by the size of the network. If it's a bigger network there will be
more activity and will put more strain on the hub.

< A hub can also be a multi-port terminal that allows extra
port's on the network.  You can pick up a cheap one from Net Gear, which has 
4 ports, and allows for master connections - Slider >

Ring - This is only suitable for LANs or MANs (Metropolitan Area Network). 
All the nodes are in a ring. There is no hub. None of the nodes have overall
control over the network. But one node is used to monitor and control
communications. All communication is in one direction. Broadcast is used for
communication.

Bus - Here all the nodes are connected along the same cable connection in one
line. The ends are left open, which means there is nothing at the ends. Data
is transmitted in both directions in a broadcast manner.

It is possible to connect these together. So you may want a small Star network
connected to a ring network or whatever.

INTERNATIONAL NETWORK STANDARDS

ISO OSI (International Standard Organisation. Open Systems Interconnection)

The ISO OSI model is used to define the ways in which different computer 
networks be connected with each other. Without standards such as this it would
be impossible to work towards the idea of a global communications network.

The ISO OSI model is a comprehensive structure for data communications so 
that different systems can be connected This is a very complex task and it is
subdivided into seven different subtasks.

These are all at the software level
- Application layer
- Presentation layer
- Session layer

This is the interface
- Transport layer

These are the Hardware considerations.
- Network layer
- Data link layer
- Physical layer

I would now like to go on to into error detection and collisions. And how 
networks avoid or detect this.

Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
This method of access control is used on broadcast systems such as the bus 
network. Each device is theoretically free to any other device at anytime.

First, Carrier Sense means that the NIC (Network Interface Card) listens to 
the medium to check whether there is any activity on the wire. The wire is, of
course, the carrier and the interface card is sensing whether the cable is
busy when a packet is ready for transmission. This is sometimes known as
Listen before the Transmission. If the NIC can 'hear' activity on the cable it
waits until the line is clear. Generally the delay will be in the region of a
few millionths of a second.

Second, Multiple Access means that it is quite possible for more than one 
station to be ready and waiting with data to send. It is therefore multiple
access since many stations could in theory transmit simultaneously in order to
gain access.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
Since it is possible that two stations will transmit simultaneously, action 
must be take if and when a collision occurs - so a Network interface must be
in a position to

(a) detect a collision,
(b) take appropriate steps to alert other stations that a collision has 
    occurred and
(c) re-transmit a packet which has been in a collision.

- Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

This strategy attempts to improve on that of CSMA/CD, which allows a device 
to place a packet onto the network path as soon as its network card detects it
as being free. In the time between the test (measured in fractions of a
microsecond) and the placing of the packet onto the path, another device's
network card may have deterred the path as free and be about to place another
packet onto it.

CSMA/CA seeks to remedy this problem by requiring a device's network card to 
test the path twice once to see if the path is free and a second time, after 
alerting the device that it may use the network, but before the packet is #
placed onto the path.

And I think that leaves you with a better understanding of networking. So 
you can go away now and build small networks at home.

< NetGear supply a nice hub and two NIC's for about 50ish English Pounds, 
dunno what the cost is over seas, so drop me a line and tell me - Slider >

Anyway hope you enjoyed the article. I'm sure you'll see many more from me. 
Any comments or anything please don't hesitate to email me.

Overview Of OS/400 and Security Facilities - Slider
**********************************************

*[Spammy] is back -[ bbs ]- gone 18 min 22 s
<[Spammy]> hrm
<[Spammy]> odd gardening van outside
<[Spammy]> blacked out windows and 2 ariels...

Unfortunatly as OS/400 is not well known, i will have to give a brief run 
down on the O/S.

The Application System/400* (AS/400*) has a very sophisticated and modern
architectural base. While it has evolved from the System/36 and the System/38,
it contains many facilities that AS/400 customers are only now utilizing to 
the maximum capability.

Like the AS/400, its operating system, Operating System/400* (OS/400*), has
evolved from the S/36 and S/38, and offers a very sophisticated and powerful
computing base.

This chapter is an overview for readers who are not regular AS/400 users. It
offers an overview of OS/400 architectures and relevant object structures, 
and then highlights OS/400 security features.

- Basic AS/400 Terminology

This section introduces basic AS/400 terminology. Understanding these terms
and concepts are essential to understanding AS/400 security. For a more
information on these, refer to the AS/400 Concepts And Facilities manual.

- System Object Structure

There are a few basic concepts that will enable you to quickly start work 
with the AS/400 system. These are described below.

- Objects

Everything on the system that contains some form of information and can be
accessed via the standard OS/400 interface is represented as an object.An
object is made up of a set of attributes that describe the object and some 
form of data. The attributes of an object include its name, type, size, the
date it was created, a short description, and the name of the library in which
it is stored.

Every object on the system has an owner, who plays an important part in the
security functions. The owner of an object can grant or revoke access of 
other users. A user cannot be deleted before all objects that are owned by
the user are deleted or assigned to another user.

The data component of an object is the collection of information that is 
stored in the object. The data part of a program is the instructions that make
up the program. The data portion of a file is the collection of records that
make up the file. The term 'object' is used to refer to a number of different
items that can be stored in the system, regardless of what the items are.

- Object Types

Different object types have different operational characteristics. These
differences make each object type unique. For example, because a file is an
object that contains data, its operational characteristics differ from those 
of a program, which contains instructions.

Objects are arranged with a common object header and a type-dependant
functional portion. For example, a program object header would contain a
description of the object, including the type (program), and the owner (the 
user who created the program). The functional part of the program object
contains information that governs the way the object can be used. This allows
the system to perform operations collectively on all objects, as well as
permitting each object to be tailored for its own purposes.

There are over 60 different object types. Some examples are: files, commands,
documents, programs, libraries, controller descriptions, device descriptions,
user profiles, and job queues. Each object type has an abbreviated form
preceded by an asterisk, to signify this as a reserved word. For example a
file is referred to as an object of type *FILE. For the purposes of security,
each individual object may be secured, tailoring user access to the function
of the system.

In addition, certain object types may have many attributes which further
differentiate the types. For example, an object type of program (*PGM) could
have an attribute of RPG, CBL, C, or CLP, for instance. An object type of 
file (*FILE) could have an attribute of PF, LF, DSPF, DDMF, or SAVF, and so
on. Each of these attributes allow deeper levels of sub-typing for particular
specialized function.

- Libraries

A library is an object that is used to group related objects and to locate 
objects by name. Thus, a library is like a directory to a group of objects. 
Libraries can be used to group the objects into any meaningful collection.
Objects can be grouped according to security, backup, processing, or any other
user requirements.

Some libraries come with the AS/400 system and are standard parts of the
system. The QSYS library contains the base operating system components, as
well as other libraries. It is special in that it is the only library that 
can contain other libraries. Users can create other libraries. IBM Program
Products usually have their own libraries. Users should avoid adding objects
to IBM libraries.

Library access rules govern the use of commands, programs, files or any object
you may want to use. You must have access to the library as well as the object
you want to use. The system will look for the object in the libraries
specified in the library search path (called a library list, abbreviated to
*LIBL), or you can refer to an object by specifically stating a library and
the object name.

- Object Names

Each object has a name. The object name and the object type are used to
identify an object. The object name is explicitly assigned by the system for
system-supplied objects, or by the user when creating an object. The object
type is determined by the command used to create the object. Several objects
can have the same name so long as their object types differ, or as long as 
they exist in different libraries.

Object names can be qualified using the name of the library where that object
exists. The combination of the object name and the library name is called the
qualified name of the object. An unqualified name contains only the name of 
the object, and is useful only when the object and type are unique on the
system or within the object's library list.

The object name in the following examples is always MASTFILE; the different
library names and object types identify the following objects uniquely:

ACCTPAY/MASTFILE *FILE - file MASTFILE in library ACCTPAY
ACCTPAY/MASTFILE *PGM - program MASTFILE in library ACCTPAY
ACCTPAY/MASTFILE *MENU - menu MASTFILE in library ACCTPAY
ACCTREC/MASTFILE *FILE - file MASTFILE in library ACCTREC

These four objects may all exist at once without naming or type conflicts.

- Document Library Objects

Within the OfficeVision/400 and PC Support/400 products, two main object 
types are used: documents (*DOC) and folders (*FLR). Collectively these are
termed Document Library Objects (DLOs). These are most commonly created using
OfficeVision/400 or PC programs accessing the AS/400 with the PC Support/400
product, although they can be created and used outside of these products.

A folder is an object that is used as a directory for documents or other 
folders.

For example, a user of a personal computer could store personal computer
programs, files and documents created with his PC programs in folders on an
AS/400 system.

Folders can be filed within another folder. Folders within folders can be
considered to be like drawers in a filing cabinet. The filing cabinet itself 
is the root directory, (as it is termed on a PC), and the drawers are
considered as sub-directories. The AS/400 folder structure was designed like
the directory structure on a PC, so that PC users could easily use AS/400
folders for storing their objects. These objects can be shared with
OfficeVision/400 users, as this same folder structure is used to store
OfficeVision/400 documents.

Users can access the documents and folders through the PC Support and
OfficeVision/400 interface. However, all documents and folders are actually
located in the IBM supplied library QDOC. The library name QDOC is never
specified by the user when accessing documents and folders; this is simply a
storage mechanism.

- Document Library Object Names

A document or folder name can be 1 to 12 characters long, including an 
optional extension. If no extension is included, a document or folder name
can have a maximum of 8 characters. If an extension is included, the extension
must start with a period and can have up to 3 additional characters.

Folder names should not begin with a Q because the IBM-supplied folder names
begin with Q. The following are examples of permitted names for Document
Library Objects:

LTR001.DOC
LETTERS/LTR001.DOC
PAYROLL/LETTERS/LTR001.DOC
APPMAIL/PAYROLL/LETTERS/LTR001.DOC

The / is used to separate folder names in the path and the document name.

- Files

Files are commonly secured objects on any computer system. On the AS/400,
there are twelve categories of files:

PF Physical files (for data records and program source)
LF Logical files (for relational database functions)
SAVF Save files (for online save/restore)
DDMF Distributed Data Management (DDM) files
DSPF Display file (for I/O to the screen)
PRTF Printer file (spool file definition)
DKTF Diskette (for I/O to diskette)
TAPF Tape files (for I/O to tape)
CMNF Communications files
BSCF BSC communications files
MXDF Mixed files
ICFF ICF communications files

Typically, discussions of security are related to physical and logical 
files, as these are used by application programs and contain application data.
Most often, the other file types do not present the same security exposure.

Physical Files: A physical file contains both the description of the data 
fields of the file, and the data itself. The record description is maintained
in a separate portion of the object from the data. Before any records can be
written in a file, the file must be created with the record description.

Logical files: Logical Files, or views, as they are called in SQL/400*, do 
not actually contain data, but describe how records contained in one or more
physical files are to be presented. They define an alternate record layout or
access path for the file.

Physical files have three main parts: a description, an access path and data.
Logical files have two parts: a description, an access path, and it also
contains pointers to data fields that are in physical files.
Programs using logical files treat them exactly the same as if they were 
physical files.

File Members: A physical file may contain members, which are groups of
records. Records are made up of many fields. Database files - files with
transaction and master file data - often consist of only one member. In 
contrast, a file holding source program statements usually contains several
members, one per source program.

Authorities for a file apply to all the members in the file. The members are 
not seen as having individual authorities. However, individual authorities are
actually stored with each member. All these 'extra' authorities can affect 
the performance of system save and restore operations, but they have no impact 
on the normal user. There are no commands to individually manipulate the
member authorities.

- Work Management

Work management supports the commands and operating system functions
necessary to control system operations and the daily workload on the system. 
It controls resources for applications, such as workstations, and storage, so
that the system can support multiple applications and system tasks.

All the work done on the system is submitted though the work management
functions. When OS/400 is installed, it includes a work management
environment that supports interactive, batch, and communications jobs. The
operating system can be tailored to create an individual, user-defined work
management environment.

- Jobs

The AS/400 system uses the term job to refer to your workstation session as 
well as any 'batch' jobs or 'system' jobs that may be in the system. There are 
five types of jobs relevant to security:

> Interactive job
> User or operator submitted batch job
> Communications job
> Autostart job
> Prestart job

The security implications of each of these are discussed below.
Interactive Job: An interactive job is started when a user signs on to a 
work station. That is, a workstation session is called an interactive job. The 
user is identified to the system with a User Profile, and the authentication
is tested through password checking (at security levels 20 and above).

Batch Job: A workstation user or operator can submit a batch job. The user
profile under which the batch job executes can be the same as the profile of 
the submitting user, or it can be a different user profile. In order to use a 
different user profile, the submitting user must be authorized to use a job 
description, an object containing the job execution attributes, which includes
the other user profile name. Alternatively, the user can submit a job under a
different user profile by specifying a profile name on the user profile
parameter of the Submit Job command. In both cases, the submitter must be
authorized to the user profile. These techniques allow good control over job
submission on behalf of other users.

Communications Job: A communications job is started when another system
issues a request over a communications line. Many techniques are available 
to control the attachment of a proper user profile to that job.

Autostart Job: This type of job is started automatically when a subsystem is
started. It requires a job description to identify the user profile for the 
job. An autostart job can be used to perform some operations on a routine
basis. For example, the QBASE and QCTL subsystems have autostart jobs that
start up printer spooling.

Prestart Job: This type of job is used for communication purposes. When a
program A on a remote system wishes to communicate with a program B on the
local system, program A must send a request to load program B. This takes
time. To speed up the load process program B can be loaded in advance by
defining it as a prestart job. A prestart job is started when its subsystem 
is started.

- Job Queues

A Job Queue (*JOBQ) is a list of jobs waiting to be run by the system. Each 
job queue is associated with a subsystem (the processing environment). A job
is placed on a job queue by the SBMJOB command or by starting a spool reader
that reads the job from a diskette or database file. Jobs are selected from 
the job queue to run based on the job queue scheduling priority. Security
information can be included in the job queue description to define who can
control the job queue and manage the jobs on the queue.

- Subsystems

A subsystem (*SBSD) is a single, predefined operating environment through
which AS/400 work flow and resource use are coordinated. A subsystem is a
means to separate activities on the system - for example, interactive users 
and batch jobs. Each piece of work running in a subsystem is called a job. In
a subsystem, work entries are defined to identify the sources from which jobs 
can be started for running in that subsystem. A Communications Entry is an 
example of a work entry. Devices are simply a source of work for a subsystem.
Each work entry defines one or more devices or remote locations that are 
controlled by the subsystem. The devices are allocated by the subsystem for
receiving program start requests for the jobs.

Regardless of how a job is started it must use a job description (JOBD). 
Jobs are processed as one or more consecutive routing steps. A routing step
is the processing done as a result of a call to a program specified in the 
subsystem's routing entry. When a job is started, the correct routing entry
is selected by means of routing data. Routing data is extracted from the job
description for the job.

A single AS/400 may have many subsystems defined. There are several
subsystem configurations shipped by IBM with OS/400 and with additional
licensed products. AS/400 software vendors may supply software packages with
subsystem descriptions. Customers may also define their own subsystems.
The QBASE subsystem provides a single combined environment for interactive,
batch, and communications jobs and also provides the subsystem control
function. It is typically used with less complex environments. Most often,
customers with a mixed workload will choose to separate the workload and use
other subsystems - either shipped by IBM (such as QCTL) or defined by the 
user.

Other subsystems may be created for installation needs or supplied with
packaged applications.

- Subsystem Function

QBASE Control function, interactive, batch and communications jobs
QBATCH Batch subsystem
QCMN Communications subsystem
QCTL Controlling subsystem. Supports only the system console
QINTER Subsystem for interactive work
QPGMR Programmer subsystem
QSNADS For SNA Distribution Services
QSPL Spooling subsystem
QSYSSBSD Backup subsystem - used if controlling SBSD is damaged
QSYSWRK Operating system jobs
QDSNX For Distributed Systems Node Executive
QFNC For Finance communications
QTCP For TCP/IP communications

- Output Queues

An Output Queue (*OUTQ) is a list of spooled files waiting to be printed. 
Printer files are objects used to define the attributes for output from jobs
on the system. If the processing of a job results in output, the subsystem
running the job creates the output as one or more spooled files in the output
queue. Subsystems themselves have output associated with starting and
completion status.

- Message Queues

A message queue (*MSGQ) is a list in which messages are placed when they are
sent to a user or program. A message queue is like a mailbox for messages.
Messages sent to an 'address' in the system (such as a user or a program) 
are put in the message queue associated with the address.

System operator message queue: The QSYSOPR message queue is a special
message queue to which the system sends messages regarding changes in the
status of the system, devices, and jobs, and messages indicating a condition 
that needs operator intervention.

- Configuration Descriptions

Configuration Descriptions are objects used to define the characteristics 
and arrangement of devices and communications links attached to the AS/400.
Configuration descriptions are linked together to form a hierarchy:

Networks (*NWID)
Lines (*LIND)
Controllers (*CTLD)
Devices (*DEVD) printers, displays, tape, diskette, communications
Modes (*MODD)
Classes of Service (*COSD)

The AS/400 has the capability to create certain configuration descriptions
automatically such as locally attached controllers and devices. This is 
called autoconfiguration. This significantly reduces the initial installation
tasks that need to be performed. The default authority given to configuration
objects is such that any user can use it, for example, to sign on to a locally
attached display station.

- Programs and Commands

AS/400 terminology differentiates between programs and commands. A
command is used to request a function of the system. A command consists of a
command name, indicating the type of action to be performed, together with
optional parameters, defining more detail about the command. For example, to
create a user profile, enter the command CRTUSRPRF and specify the
parameters to create the required user characteristics. Users can create 
their own commands, using the 'create command' command (CRTCMD). A command
invokes program code, called the command processing program.

A program means a user or vendor program, written in a language such as CL,
RPG, COBOL, or C. Program source statements are created as members of a
source file. The members are compiled (using one of the create program
commands) a process that creates the program as a new object (*PGM). Like
commands, a program can also be invoked from a workstation, but requires a
CALL command to invoke it.

Since commands and programs are objects (*CMD and *PGM), they are subject to
normal AS/400 resource security.

- Control Language (CL)

The commands mentioned previously make up the primary user interface on the
AS/400, which is called Control Language (CL). This is a large, rich and
functional set of commands that are used in every environment including
programming, communications, configuration, performance management,
messaging, save and restore, printing, problem management, office, online
education and security. These commands can be combined to make up a
program (called a CL program). Some applications can consist of only CL
programs.

- Application Program Interface (API)

An API is a functional interface supplied by the operating system or a 
separately orderable licensed program. It allows an application program in a
high-level language to use specific data or functions of the operating system
or licensed program.


* AS/400 Security Architecture

System security is an integrated function of the AS/400 system. It is
implemented at the instruction level and controls all AS/400 software 
functions. Users are identified and authenticated by a single security
mechanism, at the system level, for all functions and environments available
on an AS/400, including program development and execution, data base
applications, office applications, and so forth. All objects on an AS/400
system are under security control, including libraries and files, display
stations, operator console functions, programs, menus, and so on.

- S/36 and S/38 Compatibility

AS/400 is the follow-on system for the S/36 and the S/38, and has been 
designed to be compatible with both architectures. Similarly, security
features from both environments have been combined in AS/400 system security,
with significant enhancements. Combining both original security facilities
results in some functional redundancy that is necessary to accomplish easy and
secure migrations to AS/400. It is possible to operate an AS/400 in a S/36 or
S/38 environment in which the user command interface (the screen menus) are
similar to the prior system. This does not, however, affect the underlying
security functions of the AS/400.

- System Integrity

The integrity of the operating system is an important prerequisite for the
implementation of security controls. The AS/400 system has good integrity 
for several reasons:

> Precisely controlled storage addressing limits for a user
> Security implementation at the instruction level
> A physical keylock controlling the operating system security environment
> A precisely defined method for providing limited capabilities for users
> A security system that is an integral part of the total system
> A communications environment with security features built in at the lowest
  level
> Special hardware to validate software pointers
> Complete auditing capabilities of system and user functions

- Single-Level Storage

Storage allocation on the AS/400 is very different than on most other 
computer systems. The AS/400 uses a shared storage system in which all
portions of main and auxiliary storage are addressed as though they are
within a single area (or level). The system uses the object name to determine
where it exists in storage. This means that the user can find objects by name,
rather than by storage locations. Because operations cannot be performed on an
object that is not in main storage, the system moves all or part of the object
into main storage as it is needed, and moves it back into auxiliary storage
when the object is not needed. This transfer is controlled by the system, and
does not require control by the user or programmer.

Because objects can be accessed only by name, security cannot be bypassed to
access an object directly.

- AS/400 Security System Values

The AS/400 has over 100 variables that control system-wide functions. These
are called system values. Some of the system values are security-related.
These security-related system values fall into four main categories:

> General Security Defaults
> Audit Control
> Password Rules
> Other System Values Related to Security

- AS/400 Users and Groups

The following terms and concepts are involved in defining users and their
authorities to the AS/400. Users are defined with profiles; the users can:

> Be organized into groups
> Have special capabilities
· Have special limitations

- User Profiles

User Profiles contain information describing a system user, that user¢ s 
privileges and limitations when using the system, and lists of objects the
user owns or is authorized to use. For objects owned by a user, the profile
also contains lists of other users¢ authorizations to those objects.

- Special Authorities

All security systems have special user privileges for certain security and 
system administration functions. Special authorities allow certain users to 
administer AS/400 security and system tasks. There are eight special
authorities. These special authorities are not hierarchical.

*ALLOBJ 	All object authority is granted for accessing any system
                resource
*AUDIT 		Allows the user to perform auditing functions
*JOBCTL 	Allows manipulation of job and output
*SAVSYS 	Used for saving and restoring the system and data without
                having explicit authority to objects queues and subsystems
*SECADM 	Allows administration of User Profiles and Office
*SERVICE 	Allows access to special service functions for problem
                diagnosis
*SPLCTL 	Allows control of spool functions
*IOSYSCFG 	Allows change of system configuration

- User Classes

There are five user classes which are hierarchical in authority. The classes
represent different roles in the DP environment. These are convenient ways 
to assign the special authorities listed above to different types of users. A 
higher class can perform all the functions of a lower class; for example,
*SECOFR includes the privileges of *SECADM by default. The following are the
five user classes:

*SECOFR 	Security Officer
*SECADM 	Security Administrator
*PGMR 		Programmer
*SYSOPR 	System Operator
*USER 		End User

The user class also affects what options are shown on the system menus. A
user with higher authorities will see more of the system menu options. A 
user with less authorities will only see the menu choices allowed by the user
class. A user may be given any of the special authorities regardless of his
user class. Letting the special authorities be assigned automatically to match
the user class is a convenient way to get started.

Special authorities can be assigned specifically, by the security officer or
security administrator, when one of the standard user classes does not have 
the desired combination of authorities.

- IBM-Supplied User Profiles

The AS/400 has a number of user profiles provided as part of the operating
system. Only QSECOFR is intended for signon. Others are for ownership of
various objects and system functions.

		QDBSHR 		QMSF 		QSRVBAS
		QDFTOWN 	QNETSPLF 	QSYS
		QDOC 		QPGMR 		QSYSOPR
		QDSNX 		QRJE 		QTCP
		QFNC 		QSNADS 		QTSTRQS
		QGATE 		QSPL 		QUSER
		QLPAUTO 	QSPLJOB
		QLPINSTALL 	QSRV

- Group Profiles

A User Profile may be linked to a group profile. This allows all the members 
of the group to share common attributes, common access to selected objects,
and common ownership of objects. A user is not required to be a member of a
group. In V3R1 a user may be a member of up to 16 different groups. In 
earlier releases the user can only be a member of one group. In addition, only
one level of grouping is permissible. For example, if user profile FRED
belongs to group profile DEPTA, DEPTA cannot belong to another Group Profile.

Group profiles are used to organize users along job functions and to 
simplify the assignment and administration of object authorities by
authorizing users through a smaller number of group entries. When designing
groups, it is important that the group ownership concepts are well understood
and that good naming conventions are used.

A group profile is implemented as a user profile; that is, it is created 
just like a user profile, and when granting authority, the AS/400 does not
treat groups any differently than user profiles. The two uses may be
intermixed. For easy management it is better that user and group profiles be
used as separate entities. One way to enforce this is to set the group profile
password to *NONE. This prevents any sign on to the profile.

- Limited Capability

A user may be assigned limited capability. This is done when creating or
changing a user profile. Limited capability, when used with an appropriate 
initial program or initial menu, can restrict a user to a desired subset of
the system's functions. Some local programming (or the use of a packaged
application) is necessary to accomplish this.

Limited capability (LMTCPB keyword of CRTUSRPRF or CHGUSRPRF commands)
may be set to no, partial, or full. The selected value will affect initial 
program, initial menu, current library, the current attention program
(associated with the attention key on the terminal), and access to general
system commands.

- AS/400 Object Protection

Since all AS/400 data structures (system and user) are objects, the security
system is primarily concerned with protecting objects. All objects have some
common structures in their control blocks (invisible to the normal user). 
This allows a unified approach to security, since all objects interface the
same way to the security routines.

- Authorities

In AS/400 terminology, an authority is the permission to access an object. 
The object owner and the security officer (or other *ALLOBJ users) can grant
or revoke authority to an object. It is important to understand the difference
between authority to an object and authority to the data in the object.

Operations such as moving, renaming, saving, or deleting apply to the object 
as such. It is possible to have authority for these operations without having 
access to the data stored in the object. Likewise, one can have full access
(read, write, update, delete, execute) to the data in an object without having
full authority to manipulate the whole object.

The following authorities are independent (not hierarchical). For some
operations a combination of authorities is required:

*OBJOPR: The object operational authority controls the use of an object and 
the capability to look at the description of the object. It is needed to open
a file and therefore usually assigned in combination with the desired data
rights.

*OBJMGT: The object management authority controls the move, rename, and
change attribute functions for object, and the grant and revoke authority
functions for other users or groups.

*OBJEXIST: The object existence authority controls the delete, save, 
restore, or transfer ownership operations of an object.

*AUTLMGT: This authority is needed to manage the contents of an 
authorization list associated with the object. This is a specialized security 
authorization that is not usually grouped with the other seven object
authorities.

*OBJALTER: This authority is needed to alter the attributes of data base 
files and change the attributes of SQL packages.

*OBJREF: This authority is needed to specify a data base file as the first 
level in a referential constraint.

*READ: Controls the ability to read data from the object.

*ADD: Controls the ability to insert a new entry (such as a new record in a 
file) into the object.

*UPDATE: Controls the ability to modify existing entries in the object.

*DELETE: Controls the ability to remove existing entries (for example, 
records) in the object. To delete the whole object requires *OBJEXIST
authority.

*EXECUTE: Controls the ability to run a program, service program, or SQL
package, and to locate an object in a library or a directory. Some common
combinations of authorities have been given special names as an abbreviated
form. For example, *USE is the combination of *OBJOPR, *READ, and *EXECUTE.

*ALL Allows unlimited access to the object and its data

*CHANGE Allows unlimited access to the data in the object

*USE Allows data in the object to be read

*EXCLUDE Allows no access to the object or its data

- PUBLIC Authority

Public authority is the default authority for an object. It is used if users 
do not have any specific (private) authority to an object, are not on the
authorization list (if one is specified) for the object, or their group(s)
has no specific authority to the object.

- Authorization Lists

An authorization list is an important and commonly used security structure. 
It is used to authorize a user or a group of users to different types of
objects (such as files or programs) secured by the authorization list.

An object may have only one authorization list associated with it. An
authorization list may secure more than one object. A user can appear on 
many different authorization lists. Authorization lists are not affected when 
objects secured by the authorization list are deleted. If an object is deleted
and then restored to the same system, it is automatically linked to an
existing authorization list for the object. This is an important advantage of 
authorization lists.

- Adopted Authority

Certain programs or commands called by a user may require a higher level of
authority (for the duration of the command) than is normally available to 
that user. Adopted authority provides a means for handling this situation. 
Adopted authority allows a user to temporarily gain the authority of the owner
of a program (in addition to the user¢ s own authorities) while that program is 
running. This provides a method to give a user additional access to objects,
without requiring direct authority to objects.

- Audit Journal

The Security Audit Journal is a facility that allows security-related events 
to be logged in a controlled way that cannot be bypassed. The following are
some of the events that may be logged:

> Authorization failures
> Object creations
> Object deletions
> Changes to jobs
> Move or rename of objects
> Changes to system distribution directory or office mail actions
> Obtaining authority from programs which adopt
> System security violations
> Printing actions, both spooled and direct print
> Actions on spooled file data
> Restore operations
> Changes to user profiles, system values or network attributes
> Use of service tools
> System management functions
> Users¢ access to audited objects
> CL command strings

Information from the audit journal can be extracted into a database file, 
then examined by an auditor using a tool such as Query/400 to locate security
violations or exposures. Security/400 has programs that produce reports from
the audit journal receiver.

- Authority Holder

An authority holder is an object that specifies and reserves an authority to 
a program-described database file before the file is created. When the file is
created, the authority specified in the holder is linked to the file. The 
authority holder is for use mainly in the System/36 Environment.

- Physical Security

Physical and procedural security controls provide the basis on which other
controls such as software security are built. In addition to physical access
control and output distribution procedures, which are necessary controls in 
any computing environment and therefore not mentioned here, the AS/400 has two
unique hardware features, which are important for physical security:

> System Keylock - to enable or disable certain system service functions
> Display Station functions - keylock, and play/record keys

- The History Log (QHST)

The history log (QHST) contains a subset of messages that are sent about
system operational events to the system operator message queue.
Some messages relating to system security are written in the system history 
log. However, this function is now superseded by support offered by the
security audit journal. QHST should not be used as a source for tracking 
security-related events as it may have been in the past.

- Cryptographic Support

The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture Services/400 PRPQ is used for
hardware cryptography on the AS/400. The hardware encryption feature is
available in two versions. The full function version has a restriction on 
who is allowed to use it. The *commercial* function is without such
restrictions.

The product currently provides the following:

> Data Encryption Standard (DES)
> Public Key Algorithm (PKA)
> Key Management functions
> Security Application Programming Interfaces (SAPIs) to invoke 
  cryptographic functions from user-written applications
> Security for the IBM 4700 banking terminal

The Security Application Programming Interface (SAPI) verbs must be used to
implement file cryptography. A system command or utility program for the
encryption or decryption of files is not currently available.

The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture Services/400 is capable of
exchanging encrypted data with any products that implement DES.

- IBM Security/400

IBM Security/400 allows the system administrator to monitor and track system
users to ensure they are in compliance with their security policy. It will
accomplish this task by providing the ability to create reports on files, 
libraries, command, user profiles and job descriptions. In addition, it
provides reporting on programs that adopt authority, user profiles with access
authority, authorization lists, and network values. This reporting will help
control system compliance and also identify areas that may require tighter
controls.

IBM Security/400 allows you to tailor the applications to your individual
environment by supplying the source code at no additional cost. This allows 
you the flexibility to design and implement your own security control for your
environment. To aid in tailoring your applications, IBM Security/400 includes:

> Installation Instructions
> Technical Documentation
> Object Code
> Source Code

- IBM Security/400 Components

The major components of IBM Security/400 are:

* Auditor

The Auditor function is menu driven. It provides the following functions:

· Reports public authority to libraries, files, commands, job descriptions, 
and user profiles

> Reports on specific system values and network attributes
> Reports contents of authorities on authorization lists
> Reports programs that adopt authority
> Reports all user profiles on the system (optionally reported by profile
  attributes)
> Reports all the attributes contained within QAUDJRN (change to profiles,
  invalid signon attempts, and restore objects report)

* Remove Inactive User

Users who have not changed their password in the last 186 days (6 months)
will have their user profiles disabled. Two notifications are sent to the 
security administrator as a warning that the user profile has been disabled
and will be deleted from the system if no action is taken.

* Use SECADM Profile

This utility is designed to give a user the ability to sign on to the system 
with a profile which has *SECADM authority. The user profile is named SECADM
to avoid any confusion. All activity is tracked while the user is signed on 
with this profile. This allows queries to be run against usage of the profile.
After the user signs off the system, the SECADM user profile's password is
changed to *NONE. If the user wants to sign on to the system again using the
SECADM user profile, the SECADM command must be executed again to reset the
password.

* Universal Access *NONE

This program revokes *PUBLIC authority from root folders and libraries, with 
the exception of registered objects. Root level folders are the very top level 
folders. For instance, if you have a folder VANRIPER, which is not contained
within another folder, and contains a folder SUSAN, then VANRIPER is
considered the root level folder and SUSAN is the subfolder. Objects may be
registered by having the object name entered into a database file. If the
object is not registered and has *PUBLIC authority, a warning notification is
sent to the owner. The owner must ensure that proper authority is granted to
all users who need access to the object. If the owner does not justify the
need for public authority to this object within 10 days, the public authority
will be changed to *EXCLUDE.

* Systematic Logon Reporting

This utility is designed to report excessive invalid signon attempts and 
user profile disables. (Excessive is determined by the user at installation 
time.) The utility uses the QAUDJRN journal to extract the information needed
to count the number of invalid signon attempts and revokes (user profile
disables caused by exceeding the limit of invalid signon attempts). If the
invalid signon attempt exceeds the value stored in the data access, a message
is distributed to the system administrator.

* Security Design For Performance

One of the causes of performance problems may be excessive security processing
by the system. System performance on the AS/400 can change significantly based
upon how objects are secured. This chapter provides an overview of the way
AS/400 stores object authority and the authorization lookup process. This
overview of the AS/400 authority checking internals gives you the background
needed to understand the performance impact of different methods used to
secure objects. Based on this understanding, the second part of the chapter
gives practical rules you can use to secure data in the an efficient
and effective manner.

- Architecture

The hallmark of the AS/400 is the simplified system operation resulting from 
the integration of function by the system and operating system.

Traditional systems often have separately installed products for 
communications, security, and data bases. The AS/400 integrates all of these
features into OS/400. Access control of traditional systems often is done by
a security product that is separate from the operating system. Traditional
operating systems call this security product when access checks are needed.
The security product performs the access control checks and returns a go or
no-go indication. The operating system then proceeds or prevents the
operation.

Like other AS/400 functions, security is highly integrated. All security 
functions are included in OS/400 and the AS/400 system. A separate security
product is not required. In traditional systems often the different products
have their own access control rules and enrollment. The AS/400 operating
system, data base, and communications functions all use the same access check
rules and security enrollment.

The AS/400 access control checks are built into the machine instructions. 
Each time an AS/400 program runs any instruction that uses a system pointer
to reference data (an object), the machine interface makes an access control 
check as part of the instruction execution. If the user is authorized to the 
object, the instruction continues. If the user is not authorized, the
instruction is not executed and the system signals a
'not authorized exception'. Moving security into the machine instructions
prevents a system programmer from altering the operating system to bypass
the access control checks. In traditional systems, a system programmer has
the potential of altering the operating system to bypass security.

The following common operations use several instructions that reference an
object using a system pointer:

· Running a CL command
· Calling a program
· Opening a file
· Sending a message stored in a message file

The AS/400 performs an access check on each instruction that uses a system
pointer resulting in multiple access checks for a single CL command. On 
first reference to an object, the operating system may store the user's
authority in the pointer, which eliminates the search for user¢ s access on
subsequent references using the authorized pointer. For example, when a
program opens a data base file, the user¢ s access is checked and OS/400 data
management stores the user¢ s authority in the system pointer. Subsequent read
and write operations to the open file do not require searching for authority.
Open files are allocated so that authority to the file does not change. Most
CL commands are not able to retain the authorized pointer after the command
has completed. As a result, each time the command is issued the access checks
are repeated.

The program retrieves a data area, increments the number, and places the
updated number back in the data area. The seven access checks that are made
each time the program is called are shown to the right of the program. The 
objects checked are shown to the right of the program. The seven access checks
that are made each time the program is called are shown to the right of the
program.

You cannot control the number of times that the AS/400 checks access, but 
you can select a security implementation that minimizes the overhead for each
access check.

- Security Design Options

This section discusses how you can secure objects to minimize the 
performance overhead associated with access control checks. The security
design goal is both efficient and effective control of access to system
resources. An efficient security option would be to give all users *ALLOBJ
access or have the *PUBLIC authority of *ALL for every object. This is very
efficient but would not be effective. The following are some rules that are
both effective and efficient.

NOTE :Only secure objects that require protection.

Authority to objects are similar to the door locks used to limit access to 
rooms. You do not put locks on every door in your home or office. If you had
to lock and unlock a door every time you moved between rooms, it would be a
slow process and a waste of time. In a similar manner, you should not secure
every object in the system. When objects are restricted the system will check
user's access on each reference which can impact performance. Only the objects
that need to be secured should have restricted access. When ever possible make
*PUBLIC access adequate for most operations. The system uses the No private
access flag in the object header to eliminate the need to check individual
profiles for access.

NOTE : Avoid giving users less authority than *PUBLIC access.

Giving any user less access than *PUBLIC will cause the system to perform an
individual access check for every user. Giving a user less access than 
*PUBLIC is like placing a guard at a door to prevent one person from entering.
The guard requires every person that enters the door to produce
identification. The guard will allow access to all users but the restricted
individuals. However, every user is required to produce identification each
time they enter the door.

In a similar manner, if you give users less access than *PUBLIC for an 
object the system must check all users. The flag No private authority less
than *PUBLIC eliminates the need to search individual user profiles when
*PUBLIC authority is adequate for the operation. Access to *PUBLIC authority
in the object header can be done with less CPU resource than the searching for
private authority in user profiles. If a single user has less authority than
*PUBLIC access the flag is turned off. This results in an authority search
for every user that has access to the object.

It is best to reduce *PUBLIC access for an object to the lowest access rather
than giving a few users less access than *PUBLIC. Some users may require
more access than the *PUBLIC. The system will search the user profiles only
when the operation requested requires more authority than *PUBLIC. For
operations where *PUBLIC authority is adequate no search of the user profile 
is required.

There are no authority lookup operations when there are no private
authorities, or all private authorities were higher than the public authority.
When a user was given less authority than *PUBLIC, the authority count
increased to 20,000. The 20,000 represents two authority lookup operations for
the data area (once for the RTVDTAARA and once for the CHGDTAARA command) each
time the program loops.

NOTE : When granting users more access than *PUBLIC, use private authorities 
       not authorization lists.

Users can be granted more access than public using explicit private 
authority or using of an authorization list. If an authorization list is used,
the performance advantage of the No private authority less than *PUBLIC flag
is lost. An authorization list should not be used to give users more authority
than *PUBLIC authority. Users should be explicitly granted access to the
object rather than using an authorization list. When an object has an
authorization list there will be a check of the authorization list.


- Securing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

There are many protocols that can be used to enable computers to share
resources and transmit information across a network. Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the best known 
protocols. Since they are the most widely used, the term TCP/IP has become
synonymous with a whole family of protocols.

The AS/400 implementation of TCP/IP includes:

· File Transfer Protocol (FTP) allows the user to log on to the remote 
system to PUT or GET files.

· Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is supported on the AS/400 using normal
SNADS functions. It allows the sending and receiving of mail across a network.
An AS/400 user can use OfficeVision/400 to handle mail. SMTP can also be
accessed using the Send Distribution (SNDDST) and Receive Distribution
(RCVDST) commands.

· TELNET Protocol allows you to access and use the resources of a remote
system as if your work station is locally connected to the remote system. The
AS/400 TELNET support consists of two elements, 'TELNET client' and
'TELNET server', which means that users on the AS/400 can request access
(client) to another system (server) and vice versa. The TELNET application
forces a user to sign on as if at a local terminal.

· Packet Internet Groper (PING) used to verify a TCP connection to a remote
system.

· Application Program Interface (API) are programmable modules that may be
called from AS/400 Pascal. The APIs provide no security features; it is up to
the applications using the APIs to provide security.

- Configuring for AS/400 TCP/IP

AS/400 TCP/IP is supported via Token-Ring, Ethernet, or X.25 line. You must
create a line description depending on the type of network you are using. 
The controller and device descriptions can be automatically created for the 
TCP/IP jobs or configured manually. A subsystem, QTCP, is used for all the
jobs associated with TCP/IP.

- TCP/IP Port Security

There are TCP/IP configuration commands (ADDTCPPORT and RMVTCPPORT) that
restrict ports, so that only configured user profiles may use them. You can
use this function when a server application has been developed that uses a
specific port. The system administrator can prevent users from starting 
other applications that use the port.

- TCP/IP File Transfer

The target AS/400 supporting TCP/IP must have a user profile created for 
each user who needs to send files from their system (AS/400 or non-AS/400) to
the target system. When the file is sent, the sender specifies the name of the 
library that the file will be placed into. The library must already exist and
the user must be authorized to it. The default library is the user's current
library. The user can issue the FTP subcommand 'CD', (change directory), which
changes the user's current library.

Since the AS/400 supports files of fixed length and record size, the file 
being sent to the AS/400 must have a file length and record size no greater
than the file on the AS/400. If the file does not already exist in the
library, one will be created automatically. The file being sent will be
created as a member of that file. Other files will be added as members of the
file created.

Although these are normal functions for FTP, they pose some security
considerations for the AS/400.

Users already having a user profile on the AS/400 should be authorized only to
the libraries and files they need to access. Allowing such users access via
TCP/IP support should not present any additional security risk. Users who need
only to send files from other systems using TCP/IP but have no need for
interactive sign on, still need to have a valid user profile and password
on the AS/400. Such users should be LMTCPB(*YES). Menu security can be
used to control the user should they attempt to sign on interactively, or 
use an initial program that signs them off.

Library and file authorizations are particularly important. By using FTP on 
other systems (AS/400 or non-AS/400) a user can retrieve a copy of a file
member using the GET command. Read authority (*USE) is required for this
function. TCP/IP users added to the AS/400 should have *EXCLUDE authority to
all but the required libraries and files.

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

Using the SMTP function of AS/400 TCP/IP, a user can send documents, notes 
or messages to another user. When using OfficeVision/400 to send mail to a
host defined to SNADS as a TCP/IP host, the TCP/IP routines will automatically
be used if the TCP/IP and SNADS subsystems are started.

Configuration of SMTP requires several steps. You can also use the AS/400 as
an office gateway between SNADS and TCP/IP networks. In this situation you
will have to configure your AS/400 for both environments.

Of particular importance is the updating of the system distribution 
directory and the SMTP host and alias tables. In simple terms, the host and
alias tables contain the address and addressee information needed for sending
and receiving distributions. The alias table is a nickname-type table, used to 
shorten lengthy addressee information or where special characters may cause a
problem. Each SMTP user can have an alias table. Only the owner of the alias
table and users with *SECADM authority are able to work with the alias table.
Entries should only be made for known hosts and users.

- TELNET Client

The AS/400 TELNET client allows an AS/400 TCP/IP user to sign on to and use
the applications on a remote system that has the TELNET server application. 
It is up to the remote system (the server or target) to enforce security 
through normal user profile, password, and resource security measures.

- TELNET Server

The AS/400 TELNET server allows a TCP/IP user on a remote TELNET client
system to sign on to and run applications on the AS/400 system. With few
changes to the system values, the TELNET server is automatically set up to
support TELNET connections when TCP/IP is started. In 5250, 3270, or VT220**
full-screen mode, the AS/400 automatically sends the AS/400 signon display
when a TELNET connection is made.

- Security Officer¢s Password

What happens if the security officer forgets his password? Or if he is 
unavailable for some reason? Other users with *ALLOBJ cannot completely
duplicate his functions, especially since (in most installations) the security
officer is also the security administrator (*SECADM).

One approach is to have the security officer keep a written copy of his 
password locked in the company¢ s safe. This can work if the security officer
never changes his password without changing the written record. (Working
through a list of passwords is one way to accomplish the same thing).

There are various problems with this approach. Another approach is to have a
defined user (named RESETSEC in this example) that is never used, except in
one circumstance. If it is never used, there is no need to change passwords 
at intervals. The only circumstance in which this user profile is used is to 
reset the security officer¢ s password. The company president or a senior
manager would keep the (unchanging) password for RESETSEC locked away.

The RESETSEC user profile would have an initial program that causes the
security officer¢ s password to be reset to QSECOFR. That is, the RESETSEC 
user profile would have INLPGM(FIXIT).

The fixit program must be owned by the security officer and run with adopted
authority. (Obviously this program must be installed while the security 
officer, with his password, is available. It cannot be installed after the
problem arises). This program's access should be very restricted, of course.
The program could be very simple:

FIXIT
PGM
CHGUSRPRF USRPRF(QSECOFR) PASSWORD(QSECOFR)
SIGNOFF
ENDPGM

The situation described here may seem amusing, but it could be very real in 
a good, secure installation. An auditor should insist on some defined
recovery procedure for the described situation.

DST (dedicated service tools) also provides a method for recovery in this
situation. However, DST requires usage skills that may not exist in all
installations.

- Security Checklist

The following checklist can be used by auditors or system administrators to
evaluate security setup on an AS/400 system. This checklist is broken down 
by function to give good principles for every system.

Before you start on this security checklist we encourage you to take a look 
at the Basic Security Guide. It has a number of forms that may be very useful
in a security audit.

Physical Security

> The machine room should be water-proofed and fire-proofed. The door can be
  locked to control the entrance. Each entrance should be logged.

> UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) should be used to allow for a normal
  shutdown in case of a power outage.

> Physical access to the system console should be restricted.

> Recording confidential information such as user passwords on workstation/
  terminal record/play keys should be prohibited.

> Backup tapes and documentation should be protected from damage and theft.

> The key should be removed from AS/400 system panel and stored in a secure
  location. The keylock switch setting on the processor unit should not be in
  the manual position.

> The following questions should be asked:

Are users of non-programmable terminals allowed to store information in the
keyboard.

Should the signon screen warn about unauthorized/illegal attempts to log on to
the system.

-- System Values/Network Attributes

> The following questions should be asked:

Who has authority to change system values, network attributes and work
management? Are such changes documented and filed?

> Signon for users with *ALLOBJ or *SERVICE special authority should be
  limited to specific devices.

  System value QLMTSECOFR should be set to *1* to restrict users with
  *ALLOBJ or *SERVICE special authority to specific devices.

> System value QSECURITY should be set to 30 or higher to activate
  resource security.

> Security-related system values and network attributes should follow
  recommended guidelines.

Use the following two commands, WRKSYSVAL (Work with System Value) and DSPNETA
(Display Network Attributes), to list all security-related system values and
network attributes:

WRKSYSVAL SYSVAL(*SEC) OUTPUT(*PRINT)
DSPNETA OUTPUT(*PRINT)

Refer to the AS/400 Security Reference for information about the valid
parameters.

> Decisions about system values and network attributes should be reviewed
  periodically, particularly when the system environment changes, such as
  the installation of new application or a communication network.

  If you activate QAUDJRN any changes to system values and network
  attributes can be logged. Refer to the AS/400 Security Reference about
  how to activate QAUDJRN.

User and Group Profiles

> Naming conventions for user profiles, group profiles and authorization 
  lists should be followed.

> Each user should be assigned a unique profile. The system value
  QLMTDEVSSN should be set to *1*

> Users should be limited to signing on at only one device at a time.
  System value QLMTDEVSSN should be set to *1* to limit users to one
  signed on device.

> Users should be able to change their own passwords. Allowing users to
  define their own passwords reduces the need for users to write down their
  passwords.

  Users should have access to the CHGPWD (Change Password) command
  or to the Change Password function from the Operational Assistant menu.

> Users that are limited to menus should have LMTCPB(*YES) specified to
  prevent override of initial program or initial menu at signon. This also
  restricts use of commands on system menus.
  But you should modify the query definition to list all user profiles with
  LMTCPB(*YES).

> Programmers should be restricted from production libraries.
  Use the DSPOBJAUT (Display Object Authority) command to determine the
  public and private authorities for production libraries and critical 
  objects in the libraries. The administration of user profiles should be 
  adequately organized.

  No user profiles should have large numbers of private authorities.

> There should be a routine on how to register a new user.

> Employees should be removed from the system immediately upon notification of
  transfer or termination.

  Regularly review the DSPAUTUSR (Display Authorized Users) list to make sure
  only active employees have access to the system.

> User profiles should be checked to verify that they are not used as group
  profiles.

> Owners of applications should verify the authorized users, including *PUBLIC
  access. The verification should be performed according to the company's
  security policy.

> Management should regularly audit the users with special authorities,
  particularly *ALLOBJ special authority.

> Users that are limited to menus should have no menu option that allows
  entry of commands.

> The security officer profile or user with *ALLOBJ special authority should
  not be a group profile.

  If other profiles have the QSECOFR as a group profile, then these profiles
  should be controlled in a tight security environment.

> Group profiles shall have PASSWORD=*NONE.

> Group profiles should be identified with a naming convention.

  The naming convention GRPxxx for group profiles makes it apparent that
  multiple users are authorized when the group profile name is shown on a
  list of authorized users.

  Check the DSPAUTUSR (Display Authorized Users) command list:
  DSPAUTUSR SEQ(*GRPPRF) OUTPUT(*PRINT)

> Membership in a group profile should be changed when job
  responsibilities change.

  To verify group membership, use one of the these commands:

  DSPAUTUSR SEQ(*GRPPRF) OUTPUT(*PRINT)
  DSPUSRPRF USRPRF(group profile name) TYPE(*GRPMBR) OUTPUT(*PRINT)

-- Password Controls

> The passwords of IBM supplied profiles should be changed.

  If you are on release V2R3 or earlier verify that password of the 
  following IBM-supplied user profiles have been changed: QSECOFR, QPGMR,
  QUSER, QSRV, QSRVBAS and QSYSOPR.

  If you are on V3R1 only QSECOFR needs to be changed. The rest of the
  Qxxxxxx profiles are shipped with password = *NONE.

> Only a limited number of users should know the passwords for the Qxxxxx
  profiles above.

> The passwords for these Qxxxxxx profiles must be documented and kept in
  a safe place.

> Only authorized user should be able to change the passwords for the
  Qxxxxxx profiles.

> The IBM dedicated service tools (DST) passwords should be changed.

> Only a limited number of users should know the DST passwords.

> The DST passwords should be documented and kept in a safe place.

> There must be a rule for when the DST passwords are changed.

> Only a limited number of users should be authorized to change the DST
  passwords.

> The passwords of group profiles should be *NONE.

  Check the DSPAUTUSR (Display Authorized Users) command list:
  DSPAUTUSR SEQ(*GRPPRF) OUTPUT(*PRINT)

> Check when a user last changed the password.
  One way to do this is to copy all user profiles to an outfile. (QADSPUPB in
  QSYS can be used. It has all the necessary fields predefined). Run a query
  sorted on the date when the password was last changed.

· Password expiration active.

  System value QPWDEXPITV should be set to meet the organization¢ s
  security guidelines.

> Trivial passwords should be prevented by selecting QPWDxxxx system
  values.

  Use the WRKSYSVAL (Work with System Value) command to list all
  security-related system values beginning with QPWD.

> If a user profile has a password expiration interval that is different 
  from the system value, it should meet or be better than the organization's
  security guideline.

-- Applications and Ownership

> Applications in the production environment should be owned by a single
  user profile, not a group profile.

> Application ownership should correspond with the 'Plan to protect the
  business processes'.

> Documented routines should be followed when authorizing a user to an
  application.

> Authorization to applications should only be given to users who need it.

> Some objects within libraries may be secured better than others.
  Programs

> Only specific libraries should contain source code.

> Request for changes to an application must be authorized and
  documented. The documentation must be kept.

> Changes must be done in a test environment.

> The programmer must document the changes made, and the
  documentation must be kept.

> It must be verified that the programs have been changed according to the
  programmer¢ s documentation.

> It must be verified that someone is responsible to check if changes to an
  application do not require a change in the backup routines, the restore
  strategy or the 'Plan to protect the business processes'.

> The ownership of the objects must be changed when they are transferred
  to the production environment.

> Programs in production environment should prevent use of DEBUG
  facilities to change variables.

> The source for programs should be captured when programs are moved
  into the production environment.

> The SECURE parameter in all override commands should be specified as
  *YES to prevent the file name being redirected to another file.

> Control the library list in applications to prevent a library that 
  contains a similar program being added before the production libraries.

  You should specify a library name instead of default *LIBL in the source
  for programs.

> Programs that adopt authority must be checked for ownership, where they
  are used, and who has access to them.

> DFU and SQL should only be accessible by those who need them.
  Authorization Control

> Owners of data should understand their obligation to authorize users on a
  need-to-know basis.

> Written forms should be signed by the application owners when a user is
  authorized to an application.

> Data should not be over-protected.
  System performance is improved when *PUBLIC authority is used for objects
  that do not justify protection. This also saves time during a backup of the
  system (SAVSYS or SAVSECDTA).

> Sensitive data should need public *EXCLUDE.
  Check the authority for user *PUBLIC for critical objects using DSPOBJAUT
  (Display Object Authority) command.

> Authorization should be defined at the library level where possible.

> The public authority to user profiles should be *EXCLUDE.

> Users are not allowed to sign on by pressing the Enter key on the Sign On
  display.

  Make sure no workstation entries in subsystem descriptions specify a job
  description that has a user profile name specified for the USER parameter.

> Authorization lists should be used to secure physical files. If the 
  physical file has multiple members the use of an authorization list will
  provide better performance on save/restore than individual authorities.

> When the S36 environment is used authority holders must be checked.

> When the authorization to an object in the QSYS library is changed, it must
  be changed in all QSYSxxx libraries on the system, such as QSYS38 and
  QSYSVxRxMx.

> Job descriptions with *PUBLIC authority should specify USER(*RQD).

  To find out what job description are on the system, use
  DSPOBJD OBJ(*ALL/*ALL) OBJTYPE(*JOBD) DETAIL(*BASIC) OUTPUT(*PRINT)

  To check the USER parameter of a job description, use the DSPJOBD
  (Display Job Description) command.

> Job descriptions that specify a user profile name should have public
  authority *EXCLUDE, and should be authorized to specific users.

  To find out what job description are on the system, use
  DSPOBJD OBJ(*ALL/*ALL) OBJTYPE(*JOBD) DETAIL(*BASIC) OUTPUT(*PRINT)

  To check the authority to a job description, use the DSPOBJAUT (Display
  Object Authority) command.

-- Auditing Access

> Activate logging of security relevant events.
  System value QAUDLVL should be at least *AUTFAIL and *PGMFAIL.

  Regularly reviewing entries in the audit journal is the best method for
  detecting unauthorized attempts to access information.

> Entries in audit journal that report authorization failures should be
  reviewed for repeated offenders.

  Authorization failures cause AF type entries in the audit journal.

> Periodically review of changes to user profiles.

  Use the OUTFILE option on DSPUSRPRF to detect changes in user
  population and authority assignments.

> System value QMAXSIGN should limit number of access attempts to five or
  less. The QMAXSGNACN system value should be set at two or three.

> Message queue QSYSMSG should be created in library QSYS and
  monitored.

> The message CPF1116 shown when the user is about to exceed the retry
  limit for passwords should be changed to be the same as the invalid
  password message CPF1107. This change prevents the user from knowing
  that the next attempt will notify the security officer.

-- Communications

· It should be verified if users on other systems can log on to this AS/400. 
If so, which users and which systems?

Munge Interview - Cyber0ptix
**********************************************

Q1) Introduce yourself?

munge, a.k.a celsus, bastiat, Matt Dickerson.

Q2) When did you get into the computer Underground?

Officially: as soon as I executed BitchX and entered #hack2000.  Ph33r.

Q3) Why do you run attrition.org?

Shell access and chicks.

Q4) What do you think of 'crackers'?

Ma and Pa is good folk.

Q5) Have you ever defaced a website?

My own HTML has been called a defacement.  Otherwise, no.

Q6) What was your first computer?

Apple II.  Unfortunately, it was much later that I became interested in the
computer technologies I was using.

Q7) What Systems do you have set-up at home?

Linux, FreeBSD, TI 1500S (sometimes labled HP 9000), Solaris (x86),
Windows 95; though I spend the vast majority of my time on Linux and FBSD.

Q8) What Operating Systems do you most rate?

I'm keen on *BSD.  Unix, all the way though.

Q9) What, in your opinion, is the most secure Operating System?

Depends on the administrator, ultimately.  Out of the box, OpenBSD has a great
reputation, but I have yet to try it.

Q10) What do you think of the state of the Underground today?

What's the Underground?  Whatever is illegal? Warez pups trading pirated
programs?  Defacers?  If so, it's a sad state.

Q11) Who do you most respect in the Underground?

If you're referring to the security scene, I have always had a lot of respect
for L0pht. I have huge respect for Elias Levy, a.k.a. aleph one, bugtraq
moderator among other things. Fyodor for creating nmap.  Not really associated
with the Underground, but: Randal Schwartz, Perl and shell guru, and the
Master of Ceremonies for The Coveted and Immortal UUCA has my respect, for
being a great instructor and writer, and enduring the ugliness of corporate
scapegoating (Intel).

Q12) Who were your mentors, when you started to get into the Scene?

comp.unix.shell is a harsh mistress.  mal_vu taught me a lot as well.

Q13) Have you ever read Oblivion Underground Magazine?

Not yet.

Q14) Do you think you will ever read it?

Sure.

Q15) What do you think of people getting arrested for hacking?

It's a pity that the U.S. government has resorted to arresting kids instead
of promoting security, and uses these instances of mild vandalism to justify
curtailing the necessary freedoms of it's innocent citizens.

Q16) What do you think of 'skript kiddies'?

Sad, isn't it?  Hopefully the skript kiddies will get over the joy riding and
discover, in the best sense of the word, hacking.

Q17) What other groups have you ever belonged to?

None, really.

Q18) Do you ever admire any of the 'crackers' that you mirror on
     attrition.org?

Without condoning their vandalism, I think that it is possible to admire the
message, artwork, humor, or skill that all too rarely shines through the
mountain of dung. So yes.

Q19) If Yes.  Which ones and why?

ULG, for the art, humor, and the skill.

Q20) Any greets?

mal_vu, null, dpr, Innocent III, skb

Q21) Any links you wanna plug?

Lighten up:
www.leisuretown.com (justifies the existence of the Internet)
www.spacemoose.com (justifies the existence of Canada)

pr0n:
www.nerve.com (justifies my continued existence ;)

because we're all still kids at heart:
www.yenz.com (I know I will get flak for this, but this justifies the
              existence of flash)

  it, i have just stuck up a index.html that redirects, fuq u freenetname!
  Anyways, keep an eye out for our totally new site which will be going live
  in about 1 month - Cyber0ptix>

As we can see, a much better trace, don't worry about hop 6/11, thats a router
which is not responding to the traceroute packets (usualy a configuration
problem, or reservse routing problem...sometimes for security reasosn!).

So, we know we can get to the oblivion boys, There a very strong chance that
the xara.net backbone can still access the linx backbone as it will take
another route around the network, thus letting our packets escape to the rest
of the world.

This is where we use VN tunnel's to reroute around the fault.

Question: arn't internet protcol's like rip/ospf/bgp supposed to do this
          automaticly.

Answer: In theory yes, but many networks are single homed (attached to a
        single bgp as), many are multihomed, linx.net for example is attached
        to every backbone in the UK!. The Peering agreements between the
        bandwidth providers can lead to some very strange routing agreement's
        in the UK, so traffic you send to linx can take a very very strange
        r oute around the UK. If all network's in the UK we're equal, then a
        problem like this would be less likley, as the routing protocol's
        would reroute around the problem dynamicly. But, network's are owned
        by different companies, peering agreements, routing policy etc etc,
        all determine where you packets go in the real world, not internet
        routing protocol's.

BGP has a very large 'human' element, i.e manually entering route's backup
path's, peering etc etc. If you let lose a BGP newbie on your network, it can
lead to big routing problems for everyone else....I might write more on this
if someone can lend me a router with BGP on it!!!!


First my broken network - [x] = Router Hops.. [*]= End of the line for my
packets


so,  ME!-----[0]-------[1]-------[2]--------[3]-------[*] www.linx.net


So, Example... we run a VN Server on the oblivion network, and connect...

           -----------------Public Internet-------------------------
           |                                                       |
so,  ME!--VN<--Good route-->VN OBLIVION SERVER------------> www.linx.net
                                    NAT      <------------- www.linx.net

here the oblivion server, handles packet's in both direction, and runs a layer
of NAT, to translate IP address. think of it as proxying as you would a http
connection, but at IP packet layer with NAT.

           -----------------Public Internet-------------------------
           |                                                       |
so,  ME!--VN<--Good route-->VN OBLIVION SERVER--IP SRC SPOOF-------> 
www.linx.net

     ME! -------------------Run's Over Different Route-------------> 
www.linx.net

Here we do not need a NAT layer, as the oblivion server rewrites the
IP source address, (we spoof the IP for legal reason's ;-). www.linx.net
will return packets directly to ME! This assumes that the routing outage
from me to www.linx.net is one way (which is usually the case), Packet
take a different route back from www.linx.net to ME!. That sounds a bit
weird, but on large packet internetworks, this is ususally the case, due
to traffic engineering, inefficient routing tables, or BGP instablity!

As you can see, I managed to reroute my packet's over a VN tunnel, thus
doing what the ISP supposed to do ;-)..... and I get my boring data from
www.linx.net ;-). In actually fact, I've managed to connect to another
IP backbone!

This method is inefficient, as you need to send packets over more hops than
is necessary, but with the poor state of routing on some large networks,

A VPN tunnel might be the only way to reach a network from you location.

VN cloud's can also be used in otherways, for anon ip connections,
distributing traffic load (without using fancy OSPF or cisco Routers!),
and traffic enginneering. Don't think VPN's are limited to private
networks...:-).

I hope this got you thinking..., if wish to discuss!!!

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) - Slider
**********************************************

Channel : #oblivionmag
<Slider> Its just one of those days just when you dont wanna wake up, 
         everything is fucked, everyone sucks... - LimpBizket

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a fast growing technology 
for accessing common directory information. LDAP has been embraced and
implemented in most network-oriented middleware. As an open, vendor-neutral
standard, LDAP provides an extendable architecture for centralized storage and
management of information that needs to be available for today's distributed
systems and services.

After a fast start, it can be assumed that LDAP has become the de facto access
method for directory information, much the same as the Domain Name System
(DNS) is used for IP address look-up on almost any system on an intranet and
on the Internet. LDAP is currently supported in most network operating
systems, groupware and even shrink-wrapped network applications.

LDAP: The New Common Directory

People and businesses are increasingly relying on networked computer
systems to support distributed applications. These distributed applications
might interact with computers on the same local area network (LAN), within a
corporate intranet, or anywhere on the worldwide Internet. To improve
functionality, ease of use and to enable cost-effective administration of
distributed applications information about the services, resources, users, 
and other objects accessible from the applications needs to be organized in a
clear and consistent manner. Much of this information can be shared among
many applications, but it must also be protected to prevent unauthorized
modification or the disclosure of private information.

Information describing the various users, applications, files, printers, and
other resources accessible from a network is often collected into a special
database, sometimes called a directory. As the number of different networks
and applications has grown, the number of specialized directories of
information has also grown, resulting in islands of information that cannot 
be shared and are difficult to maintain. If all of this information could be
maintained and accessed in a consistent and controlled manner, it would
provide a focal point for integrating a distributed environment into a 
consistent and seamless system.

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open industry
standard that has evolved to meet these needs. LDAP defines a standard
method for accessing and updating information in a directory. LDAP is 
gaining wide acceptance as the directory access method of the Internet and is
therefore also becoming strategic within corporate intranets. It is being
supported by a growing number of software vendors and is being
incorporated into a growing number of applications.


- What is a Directory?

A directory is a listing of information about objects arranged in some order
that gives details about each object. Common examples are a city telephone
directory and a library card catalog. For a telephone directory, the objects
listed are people; the names are arranged alphabetically, and the details
given about each person are address and telephone number. Books in a
library card catalog are ordered by author or by title, and information such 
as the ISBN number of the book and other publication information is given.
In computer terms, a directory is a specialized database, also called a data
repository, that stores typed and ordered information about objects. A
particular directory might list information about printers (the objects)
consisting of typed information such as location (a formatted character
string), speed in pages per minute (numeric), print streams supported (for
example PostScript or ASCII), and so on.

Directories allow users or applications to find resources that have the
characteristics needed for a particular task. For example, a directory of 
users can be used to look up a person's e-mail address or fax number. A
directory could be searched to find a nearby PostScript color printer. Or a
directory of application servers could be searched to find a server that can
access customer billing information.

The terms white pages and yellow pages are sometimes used to describe
how a directory is used. If the name of an object (person, printer) is 
known, its characteristics (phone number, pages per minute) can be retrieved.
This is similar to looking up a name in the white pages of a telephone
directory. If the name of a particular individual object is not known, the
directory can be searched for a list of objects that meet a certain
requirement. This is like looking up a listing of hairdressers in the yellow
pages of a telephone directory. However, directories stored on a computer are
much more flexible than the yellow pages of a telephone directory because they
can usually be searched by specific criteria, not just by a predefined set of
categories.

- Differences Between Directories and Databases

A directory is often described as a database, but it is a specialized 
database that has characteristics that set it apart from general purpose
relational databases. One special characteristic of directories is that they
are accessed (read or searched) much more often than they are updated
(written). Hundreds of people might look up an individual's phone number, or
thousands of print clients might look up the characteristics of a particular
printer. But the phone number or printer characteristics rarely change.

Because directories must be able to support high volumes of read requests,
they are typically optimized for read access. Write access might be limited 
to system administrators or to the owner of each piece of information. A 
general purpose database, on the other, hand needs to support applications
such as airline reservation and banking with high update volumes.

Because directories are meant to store relatively static information and are
optimized for that purpose, they are not appropriate for storing information
that changes rapidly. For example, the number of jobs currently in a print
queue probably should not be stored in the directory entry for a printer
because that information would have to be updated frequently to be accurate.
Instead, the directory entry for the printer could contain the network 
address of a print server. The print server could be queried to learn the
current queue length if desired. The information in the directory (the print
server address) is static, whereas the number of jobs in the print queue is
dynamic.

Another important difference between directories and general purpose
databases is that directories may not support transactions (some vendor
implementations, however, do). Transactions are all-or-nothing operations
that must be completed in total or not at all. For example, when 
transferring money from one bank account to another, the money must be debited
from one account and credited to the other account in a single transaction. If 
only half of this transaction completes or someone accesses the accounts while
the money is in transit, the accounts will not balance. General-purpose
databases usually support such transactions, which complicates their
implementation.

Because directories deal mostly with read requests, the complexities of
transactions can be avoided. If two people exchange offices, both of their
directory entries need to be updated with new phone numbers, office
locations, and so on. If one directory entry is updated, and then other
directory entry is updated there is a brief period during which the 
directory will show that both people have the same phone number. Because
updates are relatively rare, such anomalies are considered acceptable.

The type of information stored in a directory usually does not require 
strict consistency. It might be acceptable if information such as a telephone 
number is temporarily out of date. Because directories are not transactional,
it is not a good idea to use them to store information sensitive to
inconsistencies, like bank account balances.

Because general-purpose databases must support arbitrary applications
such as banking and inventory control, they allow arbitrary collections of 
data to be stored. Directories may be limited in the type of data they allow
to be stored (although the architecture does not impose such a limitation).
For example, a directory specialized for customer contact information might
be limited to storing only personal information such as names, addresses, and
phone numbers. If a directory is extensible, it can be configured to store a
variety of types of information, making it more useful to a variety of
programs.

Another important difference between a directory and a general-purpose
database is in the way information can be accessed. Most databases support
a standardized, very powerful access method called Structured Query
Language (SQL). SQL allows complex update and query functions at the cost
of program size and application complexity. LDAP directories, on the other
hand, use a simplified and optimized access protocol that can be used in 
slim and relatively simple applications.

Because directories are not intended to provide as many functions as
general-purpose databases, they can be optimized to economically provide
more applications with rapid access to directory data in large distributed
environments. Because the intended use of directories is restricted to a
read-mostly, nontransactional environment, both the directory client and
directory server can be simplified and optimized.

- Directory Clients and Servers

Directories are usually accessed using the client/server model of
communication. An application that wants to read or write information in a
directory does not access the directory directly. Instead, it calls a 
function or application programming interface (API) that causes a message to
be sent to another process. This second process accesses the information in
the directory on behalf of the requesting application. The results of the read 
or write are then returned to the requesting application.

The request is performed by the directory client, and the process that looks
up information in the directory is called the directory server. In general,
servers provide a specific service to clients. Sometimes a server might
become the client of other servers in order to gather the information
necessary to process a request.

A directory service is only one type of service that might be available in a
client/server environment. Other common examples of services are file
services, mail services, print services, Web page services, and so on. The
client and server processes might or might not be on the same machine. A
server is capable of serving many clients. Some servers can process client
requests in parallel. Other servers queue incoming client requests for 
serial processing if they are currently busy processing another client's
request.

An API defines the programming interface a particular programming language
uses to access a service. The format and contents of the messages
exchanged between client and server must adhere to an agreed upon
protocol. LDAP defines a message protocol used by directory clients and
directory servers. There is also an associated LDAP API for the C language
and ways to access LDAP from withing a Java application.

The client is not dependent upon a particular implementation of the
server, and the server can implement the directory however it chooses.

- Distributed Directories

The terms local, global, centralized, and distributed are often used to
describe a directory or directory service. These terms mean different things
to different people in different contexts. In this section, these terms are
explained as they apply to directories in different contexts.

In general, local means something is close by, and global means that
something is spread across the universe of interest. The universe of 
interest might be a company, a country, or the Earth. Local and global are two
ends of a continuum. That is, something may be more or less global or local
than something else. Centralized means that something is in one place, and
distributed means that something is in more than one place. Like local and
global, something can be distributed to a greater or lesser extent.

The information stored in a directory can be local or global in scope. For
example, a directory that stores local information might consist of the 
names, e-mail addresses, public encryption keys, and so on of members of a
department or workgroup. A directory that stores global information might
store information for an entire company. Here, the universe of interest is 
the company.

The clients that access information in the directory can be local or global.
Local clients might all be located in the same building or on the same LAN.
Global clients might be distributed across the continent or planet.

The directory itself can be centralized or distributed. If a directory is
centralized, there is one directory server that provides access to the 
directory. If the directory is distributed, there is more that one server that
provides access to the directory. When people refer to a distributed
directory, they are usually referring to distributed directory servers.

When a directory is distributed, the information stored in the directory can 
be partitioned or replicated. When information is partitioned, each directory
server stores a unique and non-overlapping subset of the information. That 
is, each directory entry is stored by one and only one server. When
information is replicated, the same directory entry is stored by more than one
server. In a distributed directory, some information may be partitioned, and
some information may be replicated.

The three *dimensions* of a directory scope of information, location of 
clients, and distribution of servers are independent of each other. For
example, clients scattered across the globe could access a directory
containing only information about a single department, and that directory
could be replicated at many directory servers. Or clients in a single 
location could access a directory containing information about everybody in
the world that is stored by a single directory server.

The scope of information to be stored in a directory is often given as an
application requirement. The distribution of directory servers and the way 
in which data is partitioned or replicated can often be controlled to effect 
the performance and availability of the directory. For example, a distributed 
and replicated directory might perform better because a read request can be
serviced by a nearby server. A centralized directory may be less available
because it is a single point of failure. However, a distributed directory 
might be more difficult to maintain because multiple sites, possibly under the 
control of multiple administrators, must be kept up-to-date and in running
order.

The design and maintenance of a directory service can be complex, and
many trade-offs are involved.

- Directory Security

The security of information stored in a directory is a major consideration.
Some directories are meant to be accessed publicly on the Internet, but any
user should not necessarily be able to perform any operation. A company's
directory servicing its intranet can be stored behind a firewall to keep the
general public from accessing it, but more security control is needed within
the intranet itself.

For example, anybody should be able to look up an employee's e-mail
address, but only the employee or a system administrator should be able to
change it. Members of the personnel department might have permission to
look up an employee's home telephone number, but their co-workers might
not. Perhaps information needs to be encrypted before being transmitted over
the network. A security policy defines who has what type of access to what
information. The security policy is defined by the organization that 
maintains the directory.

A directory should support the basic capabilities needed to implement a
security policy. The directory might not directly provide the underlying
security capabilities, but it might be integrated with a trusted network 
security service that provides the basic security services. First, a method is
needed to authenticate users. Authentication verifies that users are who they
say they are. A user name and password is a basic authentication scheme. Once
users are authenticated, it must be determined if they have the authorization
or permission to perform the requested operation on the specific object.

Authorization is often based on access control lists (ACLs). An ACL is a 
list of authorizations that may be attached to objects and attributes in the 
directory. An ACL lists what type of access each user is allowed. In order to
make ACLs shorter and more manageable, users with the same access rights are
often put into security groups.

- LDAP Concepts and Architecture


LDAP is based on the client/server model of distributed computing.

LDAP has evolved as a lightweight protocol for accessing information in
X.500 directory services.

It has since become more independent of X.500, and servers that specifically
support the LDAP protocol rather than the X.500 Directory Access Protocol
(DAP) are now common. The success of LDAP has been largely due to the
following characteristics that make it simpler to implement and use, 
compared to X.500 and DAP:

* LDAP runs over TCP/IP rather than the OSI protocol stack. TCP/IP is less
  resource-intensive and is much more widely available, especially on
  desktop systems.

* The functional model of LDAP is simpler. It omits duplicate, rarely-used
  and esoteric features. This makes LDAP easier to understand and to
  implement.

* LDAP uses strings to represent data rather than complicated structured
  syntaxes such as ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One).

- Overview of LDAP Architecture

LDAP defines the content of messages exchanged between an LDAP client
and an LDAP server. The messages specify the operations requested by the
client (search, modify, delete, and so on), the responses from the server, 
and the format of data carried in the messages. LDAP messages are carried over
TCP/IP, a connection-oriented protocol; so there are also operations to
establish and disconnect a session between the client and server.

However, for the designer of an LDAP directory, it is not so much the 
structureof the messages being sent and received over the wire that is of 
interest. What is important is the logical model that is defined by these
messages and data types, how the directory is organized, what operations are
possible, how information is protected, and so forth.

The general interaction between an LDAP client and an LDAP server takes
the following form:

* The client establishes a session with an LDAP server. This is known as
  binding to the server. The client specifies the host name or IP address and
  TCP/IP port number where the LDAP server is listening. The client can
  provide a user name and a password to properly authenticate with the
  server. Or the client can establish an anonymous session with default
  access rights. The client and server can also establish a session that uses
  stronger security methods such as encryption of data.

* The client then performs operations on directory data. LDAP offers both
  read and update capabilities. This allows directory information to be
  managed as well as queried. LDAP also supports searching the directory
  for data meeting arbitrary user-specified criteria. Searching is a very
  common operation in LDAP. A user can specify what part of the directory
  to search and what information to return. A search filter that uses Boolean
  conditions specifies what directory data matches the search.

* When the client is finished making requests, it closes the session with 
  the server. This is also known as unbinding.

Although it is not defined by the LDAP protocol and architecture itself, 
there is a well-known LDAP API (application program interface) that allows
applications to easily interact with LDAP servers. The API can be considered
an extension to the LDAP architecture. Although the C language LDAP API is
only an informational RFC and the most recent update to it is an Internet
Draft, it has achieved de facto standard status because it is supported by 
all major LDAP vendors. The philosophy of the LDAP API is to keep simple
things simple. This means that adding directory support to existing
applications can be done with low overhead.

Because LDAP was originally intended as a lightweight alternative to DAP for
accessing X.500 directories, it follows an X.500 model.

The directory stores and organizes data structures known as entries.

A directory entry usually describes an object such as a person, a printer, a
server, and so on. Each entry has a name called a distinguished name (DN)
that uniquely identifies it. The DN consists of a sequence of parts called
relative distinguished names (RDNs), much like a file name consists of a 
path of directory names in many operating systems such as UNIX and Windows.

The entries can be arranged into a hierarchical tree-like structure based on
their distinguished names. This tree of directory entries is called the 
Directory Information Tree (DIT).

Each entry contains one or more attributes that describe the entry. Each
attribute has a type and a value. For example, the directory entry for a 
person might have an attribute called telephonNnumber. The syntax of the
telephoneNumber attribute would specify that a telephone number must be a
string of numbers that can contain spaces and hyphens. The value of the
attribute would be the person's telephone number, such as 512-555-1212.

A directory entry describes some object. An object class is a general
description, sometimes called a template, of an object as opposed to the
description of a particular object. For instance, the object class person 
has a surname attribute, whereas the object describing John Smith has a
surname attribute with the value Smith. The object classes that a directory
server can store and the attributes they contain are described by schema.
Schema define what object classes are allowed where in the directory, what 
attributes they must contain, what attributes are optional, and the syntax of
each attribute. For example, a schema could define a person object class. The
person schema might require that a person have a surname attribute that is a
character string, specify that a person entry can optionally have a
telephoneNumber attribute that is a string of numbers with spaces and 
hyphens, and so on.

LDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries such
as:

* Searching for entries meeting user-specified criteria
* Adding an entry
* Deleting an entry
* Modifying an entry
* Modifying the distinguished name or relative distinguished name of an
  entry (move)
* Comparing an entry

LDAP is documented in several IETF RFCs.

There are different models assigned within the use of LDAP, they are the :

* Information Model
* Naming Model
* Functional Model
* Security Model

The rest are generally the same :[, but we are more intrested in the 
security model.  If you want to look the other models up, be my guest.  Or
contact me and i will send them to you in an email.

- The Security Model Part 1

As previously described, the security model is based on the bind operation.
There are several different bind operations possible, and thus the security
mechanism applied is different as well. One possibility is when a client
requesting access supplies a DN identifying itself along with a simple
clear-text password. If no DN and password is declared, an anonymous
session is assumed by the LDAP server. The use of clear text passwords is
strongly discouraged when the underlying transport service cannot guarantee
confidentiality and may therefore result in disclosure of the password to
unauthorized parties.

Additionally, a Kerberos bind is possible in LDAP Version 2, but this has
become deprecated in LDAP Version 3. Instead, LDAP V3 comes along with a
bind command supporting the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
(SASL) mechanism. This is a general authentication framework, where
several different authentication methods are available for authenticating 
the client to the server; one of them is Kerberos.

Furthermore, extended protocol operations are available in LDAP V3. An
extension related to security is the *Extension for Transport Layer Security
(TLS) for LDAPv3*. It defines operations that use TLS as a means to encrypt
an LDAP session and protect it against spoofing. TLS is defined in *The TLS
Protocol* Version 1.0. It is based on the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol
3.0, devised by Netscape Communications Corporation which it eventually will
supersede.

TLS has a mechanism which enables it to communicate to an SSL server so that 
it is backwards compatible.

Some vendors, like Netscape and IBM, have already extended the LDAP
protocol and added some SSL specific commands so that an encrypted
TCP/IP connection is possible, thus providing a means for eliminating the
need of sending a DN and a password unprotected over the network
Once a client is identified, access control information can be consulted to
determine whether or not the client has sufficient access permissions to do
what it is requesting.

- Security part 2

Security is of great importance in the networked world of computers, and 
this is true for LDAP as well. When sending data over insecure networks,
internally or externally, sensitive information may need to be protected 
during transportation. There is also a need to know who is requesting the
information and who is sending it. This is especially important when it 
comes to the update operations on a directory. The term security, as used in
the context of this book, generally covers the following four aspects:

Authentication Assurance that the opposite party (machine or person) really is
who he/she/it claims to be.

Integrity Assurance that the information that arrives is really the same as
what was sent.

Confidentiality Protection of information disclosure by means of data
encryption to those who are not intended to receive it.

Authorization Assurance that a party is really allowed to do what
he/she/it is requesting to do. This is usually checked after
user authentication. In LDAP Version 3, this is currently
not part of the protocol specification and is therefore
implementation- (or vendor-) specific. This is basically
achieved by assigning access controls, like read, write, or
delete, to user IDs or common names. There is an Internet
Draft that proposes access control for LDAP.

The following sections focus on the first three aspects (since authorization 
is not contained in the LDAP Version 3 standard): authentication, integrity
and confidentiality. There are several methods that can be used for this 
purpose; the most important ones are discussed here. These are:

* No authentication
* Basic authentication
* Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)

Because no other data encryption method was available in LDAP Version 2,
some vendors, for example Netscape and IBM, added their own SSL calls to
the LDAP API. A potential drawback of such an approach is that the API calls
might not be compatible among different vendor implementations. Therefore,
in LDAP Version 3, a proposal is made (Extension for Transport Layer
Security) to include SSL or, more accurately, its successor, TLS, through
extended protocol operations. This should make the vendor-dependent
functions redundant in the near future.

* No Authentication

This is the simpliest way, one that obviously does not need to be explained 
in much detail. This method should only be used when data security is not an
issue and when no special access control permissions are involved. This
could be the case, for example, when your directory is an address book
browsable by anybody. No authentication is assumed when you leave the
password and DN field empty in the bind API call. The LDAP server then
automatically assumes an anonymous user session and grants access with
the appropriate access controls defined for this kind of access (not to be
confused with the SASL anonymous user as discussed later.

* Basic Authentication

The security mechanism in LDAP is negotiated when the connection between
the client and the server is established. This is the approach specified in 
the LDAP application program interface (API). Beside the option of using no
authentication at all, the most simple security mechanism in LDAP is called
basic authentication, which is also used in several other Web-related
protocols, such as in HTTP.

When using basic authentication with LDAP, the client identifies itself to 
the server by means of a DN and a password which are sent in the clear over
the network (some implementation may use Base64 encoding instead).

The server considers the client authenticated if the DN and password sent by 
the client matches the password for that DN stored in the directory. Base64
encoding is defined in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
standard (RFC 1521). It is a relatively simple encryption, and therefore it 
is not hard to break once one has captured the data on the network.

* Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)

SASL is a framework for adding additional authentication mechanisms to
connection-oriented protocols. It has been added to LDAP Version 3 to
overcome the authentication shortcomings of Version 2. SASL was originally
devised to add stronger authentication to the IMAP protocol. SASL has since
evolved into a more general system for mediating between protocols and
authentication systems. It is a proposed Internet standard defined in RFC
2222.

In SASL, connection protocols, like LDAP, IMAP, and so on, are represented
by profiles; each profile is considered a protocol extension that allows the
protocol and SASL to work together. A complete list of SASL profiles can be
obtained from the Information Sciences Institute (ISI).

Each protocol that intends to use SASL needs to be
extended with a command to identify an authentication mechanism and to
carry out an authentication exchange. Optionally, a security layer can be
negotiated to encrypt the data after authentication and so ensure
confidentiality. LDAP Version 3 includes such a command (ldap_sasl_bind()).

The key parameters that influence the security method used are:

dn 		This is the distinguished name of the entry you want to bind
                as. This can be thought of as the user ID in a normal user ID
                and password authentication.

mechanism 	This is the name of the security method that should be used.
		Valid security mechanisms are currently Kerberos Version 4,
                S/Key, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL. There is also an
                ANONYMOUS mechanism available which enables an authentication
                as user *anonymous. In LDAP, the most common mechanism used is
                SSL (or its successor, TLS), which is provided as an EXTERNAL
                mechanism.

credentials 	This contains the arbitrary data that identifies the DN. The
		format and content of the parameter depends on the mechanism
                chosen. If it is, for example, the ANONYMOUS mechanism, it
		can be an arbitrary string or an e-mail address that
                identifies the user.

Through the SASL bind API function call, LDAP client applications call the
SASL protocol driver on the server, which in turn connects the 
authentication system named in the SASL mechanism to retrieve the required
authentication information for the user. SASL can be seen as intermediator
between the authentication system and a protocol like LDAP.

Of course, the server must support this SASL mechanism as well, otherwise
the authentication process will not be able to succeed.

The basic idea behind SASL is that it provides a high level
framework that lets the involved parties decide on the particular security
mechanism to use. The SASL security mechanism negotiation between client
and server is done in the clear. Once the client and the server have agreed 
on a common mechanism, the connection is secure against modifying the
authentication identities. An attacker could now try to eavesdrop the
mechanism negotiation and cause a party to use the least secure
mechanism. In order to prevent this from happening, clients and servers
should be configured to use a minimum security mechanism, provided they
support such a configuration option.

As stated earlier, SSL and its successor, TLS, are the mechanisms commonly
used in SASL for LDAP.

I believe that I have already written a text on SSL, if not it will be 
coming soon, but im to tired to connect to the net to check.

- Designing and Maintaining an LDAP Directory

-- Directory Design Guidelines

Creating a design that has the flexibility to accommodate changes within the
organization is probably the single most important task in implementing a
directory service. This will help save time and money as the directory 
service grows. When designing the directory service, the project can be
divided into several smaller projects: surveying the directory service
contents, creating access control strategies, replication and partitioning
strategies, and network planning (physical planning):

* Planning the directory content includes deciding on what data to store in
  the directory and how it will be arranged in the tree structure. When
  deciding on what to put into the directory, all the owners of data relevant 
  to the contents of the directory tree in the organization should be
  identified. It is very probable that the information you will be choosing to
  put in the LDAP directory already resides on some other system in your
  organization. For example, the personnel department most likely already
  has databases with personnel information. Also be sure to make adequate
  use of processes already in place to administer that data even in the
  planned directory service.

* Data management and access control are both important when maintaining a
  directory service. Plans must be made to identify resources for keeping the
  data up to date and identifying resources with the authority to decide on
  access control policies regarding the data residing in the directory tree.

* In sizing the directory service, consideration must be taken to which
  clients will be accessing what data, from where, and how often. If there are
  client applications which use the directory extensively, consideration must
  be taken to ensure that the network availability and bandwidth are
  sufficient between the application servers and the directory servers. If
  there are network bottlenecks, they must be identified because there may
  be needs to replicate data into remote LANs.

-- Defining the Data Model

There are many steps involved in designing a directory tree, such as 
deciding on the kind of data that the entries will contain, what schema to
use and finally how the entries are going to be arranged in the tree
structure. During design, several different aspects must be taken into
account:

* What type of application/applications will use the directory?
* Will the LDAP service be participating with an X.500 directory service?
* How will the organizations infrastructure be mapped into the directory?
* What are the requirements for manageability and scalability?

--- Directory Data

Planning the directory's data is the most important aspect of the directory
planning activities, and it is probably the most time-consuming aspect as 
well. A considerable amount of the time spent planning the directory data will 
most likely be spent surveying the organization to locate all the data stores 
where directory information is managed. As this survey is performed, expect to 
find that some kinds of data are not well managed; some processes may be
inefficient, inadequate, or nonexistent altogether; and some kinds of data
may not be available at all. All of these issues should be addressed before
finishing a data-planning phase.

We start by looking at the requirements on the data to be used in the
directory service. Some types of data are better suited for a directory 
service than others. Ideal candidates in a directory service have some of the
following characteristics:

A directory service is not a file system, a file server, an FTP server, a Web
server, or a relational database.
Therefore, large, unstructured objects of data should not be put in the
directory. For that kind of data, a server more appropriate for the task
should be used. However, it is appropriate to store pointers to these kinds of
applications within the directory service through the use of FTP, HTTP, or
other types of accesses. The data should typically be read much more often
than it is written. This is because directory services usually are tuned for
read operations; write operations are more expensive in terms of resource
utilization than reads, and they may impact the directory server's performance
in typical directory server implementations.

Another *rule of thumb* is that the data should typically be accessed from
more than just one system or client. For example, an employee's preference
settings for a specific application may not be meaningful to put in the
directory if that application is only run on the employee's single 
workstation. If the user wants to run this application on different systems,
such as a mail client application, then the application would certainly
benefit from a central directory for storing user preferences. This would
allow the employee to use the same setup on multiple systems or even
platforms within the organization.

Having in mind the types of data suitable and unsuitable for use in a 
directory, it is now possible to survey what the directory service data will
be. In doing this, it may be helpful to do the following:

* Determine what directory-enabled applications to deploy and what their
  data needs are.
* Survey the organization and identify where the data comes from (such as
  Windows NT or Novell NetWare directories, Human Resources databases,
  e-mail systems, and so forth.).
* Determine who needs access to the data, particularly the organization's
  mission-critical applications. Find out if those applications can directly
  access and/or update the directory.
* For each piece of data, determine the location where it will be mastered,
  who owns the data,that is, who is responsible for ensuring that the data
  is up-to-date.
* For each piece of data, determine the name of the attribute(s) that you will
  use to represent the data in the directory and the object class(es) (the
  type of entry) that the data will be stored on.
* If data is going to be imported from other sources, develop a strategy for
  both bulk imports and incremental updates. Try to limit the number of
  applications that can change the data. Doing this will help ensure the data
  integrity while reducing the organization's administration.
* Identify duplications and data that is not actually used or required.
  Harmonize the data by eliminating such duplications and discard
  unnecessary data.

Having decided on the type of data to use in the directory service, what the
directory will be used for and how the data will be updated, it is possible 
to start structuring the data. Structuring data is done by designing a schema,
choosing a directory suffix, branching the directory tree and finally 
creating a naming style for the directory entries.

- Security Policy

Having designed the directory tree, we now need to decide on a security
policy. A security policy should be strong enough to prevent sensitive
information from being modified or retrieved by unauthorized users while
simple enough that administration is kept simple so authorized parties can
easily access it. Ease of administration is very important when it comes to
designing a security policy. A too complex security policy can lead to
mistakes that either prevent people from accessing information that they
should have access to, or allow people to modify or retrieve directory
information that they should not have access to.

The security policy that needs to be designed for the directory service is a
reflection of the:

* Kind of information that will be stored in the directory
* Ways in which clients will be accessing the directory
* Ways which will be used to update and manage the directory
* Acceptable administration effort for security

To reach these goals, two basic areas must be considered and the following
question must be answered: What level of security is needed when clients
identify themselves to the directory server, and what methodology will be
used when authorizing access to the different kinds of information in the
directory?

-- Authentication

Conceptually, directory authentication can be thought of as logging in to the
directory. LDAP terminology, however, usually refers to this operation as
binding to the directory.

Generally, bind operations consist of providing the equivalent of a user ID 
and a password. However, in the case of an LDAP directory, the user ID is 
actually a distinguished name (or a distinguished name derived from a user
ID). The distinguished name used to access the directory is referred to as the
bind DN.

So, what level of authentication should be considered? There are, generally
speaking, three different approaches:

No Authentication		 This is the simplest approach, which might be
				 perfectly suitable for most directories when
                                 all users are equally granted read (or even
                                 write) access to all data. There is no need
                                 or user authentication when this is the case.

Basic Authentication		 This lets the client bind by entering a DN
                                 and a password. Using basic authentication
                                 will not ensure integrity and confidentiality
                                 of the login data since it is being sent over
                                 the network in a readable form.

Secure Authentication 		 SASL (Simple Authentication and Security
                                 Layer) is an extensible authentication
                                 framework. It was added to LDAP Version 3,
                                 and it supports Kerberos and other security
                                 methods, like S/Key. SASL provides the
                                 possibility to securely authenticate LDAP
                                 clients and LDAP directory servers. There is
                                 a so called EXTERNAL mechanism in SASL that
                                 allows the use of authentication identity
                                 information from security layers external to
                                 the SASL layer. One possibility is to use the
                                 authentication information from SSL. SSL is
                                 generally used to secure the connection
				 between a client and a server through the
				 exchange of certificates. The client
                                 certificate can get used through SASL as
                                 authentication identity. SASL is already used
                                 within several Internet protocols including
                                 IMAP4 and POP3 (mail server protocols).

It is possible that there is a need for both basic and secure authentication.
The choice will be dependent on the security policies in the organization's
networks and what type of access rights the different types clients will 
have when communicating with the server. For example, when setting up
server-to-server communication, it may be valuable to use strong, secure
authentication since server-to-server communication will often rely on
unrestricted access to each other's tree structures, including individual
entries access settings. On the other hand, for client-to-server
communication, where clients only have read access to names, phone
numbers, and mail addresses, there is most likely no need for anything but
basic authentication.

When using secure authentication, it is possible to choose from different
methods depending on the vendors' implementations, for example Kerberos
or SSL. If Kerberos is not already deployed in the organization's intranet, 
then it will probably be sensible to use SSL, since support for SSL is
included in most popular LDAP clients. When using SSL, it is possible for the
server to authenticate to the client by using its server certificate. A server 
certificate can be thought of as a secure, digital signature that
unequivocally identifies a server. It has been generated and registered with
a trusted certifying authority, also known as a Certificate Authority (CA),
such as the United States Postal Service CA or the IBM World Registry CA.
Also, when using server certificates, an encrypted communication can be
established between the client and server, enabling a secure basic
authentication of the client to the server.

Using SSL server certificates will be particularly interesting when setting up
LDAP services on insecure networks, such as the Internet/extranet. This will
enable the clients to verify the identity of the server and to encrypt
communication of the basic authentication from the clients to the server on
the insecure networks.

When using basic authentication, administration of passwords on the
directory server will be necessary and may impose some administration
overhead. If SSL client certificates are used, then an appropriate
infrastructure will be needed to support the certificate generation and
administration. This is usually done by separate certificate servers. Client
certificate deployment is beyond the scope of this book, but it ought to be
mentioned that LDAP supports storing client public keys and certificates in
the entries.

- Physical Design

Physical design involves building a network and server infrastructures to
support availability, scalability and manageability. Methods to do this in 
LDAP are partitioning and replication (replication is actually not
standardized in LDAP Version 3, but most vendors do have an implementation).
In this section, we concentrate on deployment issues regarding when
partitioning and/or replication is appropriate when trying to reach the goals
of availability, scalability and manageability, and what the trade-offs are.

--Availability

Availability for a directory service may not be an issue in cases where the
directory is not business-critical. However, if the use of the service becomes
mission-critical, the need to design a highly available system is required.
Designing a highly available system involves more than what is supported in
LDAP. The components from LDAP that are needed are partitioning and
replication. Since high availability involves eliminating single points of
failure or reducing their impact, it is necessary to have redundant hardware,
software and networks to spread the risk.

A simple approach to create a highly available directory service is to 
create a master and a slave directory server, each one on its own physical
machine.

By replicating the data, we have eliminated the single point of failure for 
both hardware and software failures. This solution with a master and one or
more slave servers normally provides for high availability for read functions
to the LDAP servers. Write requests can only be directed to the master server.
If high availability is required for write access, additional effort is 
necessary.

Neither read-only nor read/write replication is supported natively by the 
LDAP standards, but vendors may have implemented their own mechanisms.
Replication solutions can also be constructed using the export/import
facilities of LDAP servers or with additional, custom-designed software 
tools. A mechanism must be added to handle client redirection if one server
fails.

This can be done manually or semi-automatically by a DNS switchover, or
automatically with a load-balancing technique by using a router designed for
this. Such a router forwards client requests to one of the servers based on
configurable criteria. It is important that the router supports stateful
protocols; that is, subsequent requests from the same client need to be
forwarded to the same server. There are several products on the market from
different vendors to do this, such as IBM's eNetwork Dispatcher
(www.ics.raleigh.ibm.com/netdispatch/) or Cisco Systems' Local Director
(www.cisco.com).

There is also the issue of network bandwidth and its reliability to take 
into consideration. In some cases, it may be necessary to distribute a
replica into another LAN with slow network connections to the master.

This can also be done with any means of replicating an LDAP server
(remember that replication is not included in the LDAP standards, thus you
have to use vendor product support or your own methods). The primary
server for a particular client may be the directory server on the client's 
own LAN, and the secondary will then be the central master server, accessed
over the WAN.

If the method of spreading the risk is used to create high availability, it 
is possible to partition the directory tree and to distribute it to different 
locations, LANs, or departments.

As a side-effect, depending on how the directory tree is branched and 
distributed to these servers, each location, department or LAN administrator
could then easily manage their own part of the directory tree on a local
machine, if this is a requirement. If a single server failed in such a
configuration, then only a portion of the whole directory would be affected.

A combination of the two methods explained above could be used to create a
dynamic, distributed, highly available directory service.

-- Scalability

As more and more applications use and rely on a directory service, the need
to scale the directory for high load tolerance increases. Scaling up directory
servers is done much the same way, either by increasing availability or by
upgrading hardware performance. As is the case when increasing availability,
we have to rely on functions outside the LDAP standard as well as LDAP
replication and partitioning. The round-robin DNS or the load-balancing router
are good tools to scale an LDAP server site.

Scalability may be affected by network performance, therefore requiring local
directory servers in LANs.

-- Manageability

Manageability aspects involve almost all parts of a directory design. Here is
where trade-offs may have to be made regarding scalability, availability,
flexibility, and manageability. The level of scalability and availability are
both related to cost in hardware and software and, as a drag-along, cost of 
overall systems management.

One important question to ask in a directory design about manageability is
whether and how all information providers are able to furnish reliable, 
correct and consistent directory data to the LDAP service. If this cannot be 
assured, there will be a chance for errors and inconsistencies in the LDAP
directory data. If such problems are considered critical for the clients
using the LDAP service, tools must be provided that can detect and maybe even
correct these errors.

To create a high availability environment, it is necessary to replicate 
and/or partition the directory, as discussed in the previous sections.
Although not directly related to LDAP, it should be mentioned that adequate
systems management tools and skills must be available to run such a fairly
complex environment. In addition, one of the manageability concerns regarding
replication might be the need to ensure an ample level of consistency. A
master LDAP server might have been updated with new information while a
replica server still runs with the old, outdated information. The required 
level of consistency is largely dependent on the needs of the client
applications using the service. If there is a requirement for currency and
consistency among replicated servers, additional means must be provided to
ensure this.

Replication will also affect backup and disaster/recovery procedures.
Processes will be needed to handle recovery of master servers and how
synchronization of slaves will be handled. Since replication is outside the
current standard for LDAP, it is necessary to study the vendors'
implementation in order to find adequate solutions.

Partitioning the directory enables local servers to own their own data,
depending on schema and branching design. This increases flexibility when
maintaining data, but increases the complexity of referral handling. A clear
method of linking the name space together will have to be formulated to
ensure consistent referrals in the directory service name space such that the
logical name space is still a whole. Also, each local server may have to be
administered and maintained locally, requiring staff with operating system
and LDAP knowledge.

- The Future of LDAP

With LDAP Version 3, a solid foundation for a directory service infrastructure
for the Internet was built. As we have seen in previously, most vendor
implementations are based on this version or have most features of Version 3
incorporated. But there is still room for enhancements, for example in areas
of API support for other program languages, like Java. To define these
standards, members of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) work on
and submit draft proposals that eventually might become Request for
Comments (RFCs). The RFCs describe the idea and the implementation of
the major design and technologies for the new functions and features.

Although there is not a specific section in this book devoted to it, it should
be mentioned that the vendor products will of course be further developed and
enhanced, namely in areas such as improved functionality, manageability,
and performance. For example, client-side caching could be implemented to
improve performance remarkably, especially on multiuser client systems with
heavy directory access. Graphical management tools can be added, or
existing GUIs may be improved that allow easy configuration and contents
management.

As LDAP matures to a de facto standard, it will eventually replace proprietary
directory services in vendor products and other standardized middleware
solutions, such as the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). DCE
makes heavy use of a directory service and currently uses its own, specific
implementation, called Cell Directory Service (CDS).

email: strafe.of.apoc@usa.net

The Underground.  What exactly is the underground?  It is whatever those that
are not part of it see it as.  I am not a member of the underground.  I can
only see myself for what I truely am. I will not allow those who try, to push
me under. You can only be seen as a member of the underground by those who
consider themselves better, thats why they own the sun.  The symbolism is
heavy in a grouping name such as the underground.  Humans are surface
dwellers.  We live on land, our food comes from on the land, the things that
we are supposed to hold dear, are on land.  So why is it that we, the
intelligent, aware citizens of earth are denied these things. We are
symbolically forced under the soil, denied our lives and interaction with the
masses.  Why? We are not seen as worthy, not normal, we are non-conformists.
I can say WE,  WE are united, WE know what WE want.  WE know that information
should be distributed and that the rights that should be every mans, sadly are
not.  Our minds are not clouded with greed, sucsess is not our main goal.  WE
strive to make the world better.  So why are WE forced under. Because WE
accepted it.  WE allowed ourselves to be walked on. WE did not stand for what
WE belived.  Now is the time, many belive WE are small, weak because people
see the light and stray out of their caves.  WE are not weak.  WE are not the
underground, WE are the free ground.  Philosophy and thought flow through
creative rivers till they meat the dam.  The dam is us.  WE hold ourselves
back by fearing to do more.  We are afraid we might lose our precious image of
darkness, and a general love for destruction of lives. If you joined the
underground because you thought it would be cool to be a bad guy, then you are
not a member of the underground, you are a rock in the dam.  The dam that
holds those who strive for what is right, in the stagnant pool that is
indesision.

other objects. You might have noticed that Security Configuration Manager
(SCM), which Microsoft released in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4),
handles access control like Win2K does. The new NTFS access control model
takes a while to get used to, but it adds some important features. The
redesign changes access control in three areas. First, permissions are much
more granular, which means you can fine-tune user access. Second, if you

Currents: Always-on Internet Security
<http://www.currents.net/articles/1905,5,14,1,0501,00.html> - The two best
things about those fast Internet connections you get from cable, DSL, and
ISDN are that you don't have to dial a number to connect to the Internet,
and they are also easy to share over a network. That's also the worst thing
about them--the Internet's a two-way street, and when you've got always-on
access to the Net, the Net has the same access to your hard disk. And as for
networking... well, that presents its own set of problems, especially in the
telecommuter home office and the satellite corporate bureau.

CERT: Denial of Service Attacks using Nameservers
<http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2000-04.html> - We are receiving an
increasing number of reports of intruders using nameservers to execute
packet flooding denial of service attacks. The most common method we have
seen involves an intruder sending a large number of UDP-based DNS requests
to a nameserver using a spoofed source IP address. Any nameserver response
is sent back to the spoofed IP address as the destination. In this scenario,
the spoofed IP address represents the victim of the denial of service
attack. The nameserver is an intermediate party in the attack. The true
source of the attack is difficult for an intermediate or a victim site to
determine due to the use of spoofed source addresses

writes "Imagine an encrypted communications channel that immediately
notifies the parties if they are being bugged. The American Institute of
Physics site is running an article about exploiting what Einstein described
as the "spooky" action at a distance properties of quantum entangled
particles. The entanglement process can generate a completely random
sequence of 0s and 1s distributed exclusively to two users at remote
locations. Any eavesdropper's attempt to intercept this sequence will alter
the message in a detectable way and enabling the users to discard the
appropriate parts of the data. This random sequence of digits is then used
to scramble the message. This approach solves the problem of distributing a
shared key to both parties without it falling into the wrong hands. This

This is more likely when your actions come as a surprise or are viewed in a

you're doing. With all the sound and fury in media about evil hackers, it's
a good idea to consider how to protect yourself ahead of time.

a login program other than /bin/login. An unintended interaction with some
other piece of code in telnetd has the effect that the memory location
holding the name is overwritten with information obtained from the client
host. This bug can be abused by an attacker to bypass authentication
completely. However, in almost all cases, this will just cause telnetd to
not work at all, which makes it unlikely that this feature has been used
widely

**********************************************
Using a RSVP as aid in creating dynamic IP
filters at the access later in response to
basic downstream denial of service attack
(non spoofed Source IP/failed three way tcp
negotation). - LockDown
***********************************************

This is for beginners only, just some crazy idea's...sketched out after too
many beers again.

(If you can do this after a few beers... I hate to see what your like when 
your stoned... U solved the meaning of life yet? - Slider)

aka, Why firewalling should be in the hands of the end users, but filtering
at the ISP's end.

security filtering in the user's hands? Dangerous...only to the spread of
information.

Current System....

Router Access -----(56k,ISDN,T1,OC192)---->Router-----(LAN)
		  			   Customer Dungeon

One example of a simple 'skipt kiddie' denial of service attack.

Okay, script kiddies got minimal control of a 3 linux server's
on quite fast networks, he can write programs that open tcp/udp
connections (!).

So, he run's on the target machines

:Start
	open a port 80 on the target machine
	wait for 2 seconds
	kill processes

Spawn Start(*) for ever.

This could saturate the entire link capacity between the
access level and the customer premises.


Access Router-----(TCP OPEN 80 Packets)---------Customer Router
              (from 4 different IP address)

As the link is overloaded, no more new connections can be
serviced, and if the pressure from the denial is great,
it can impair performance and even cut current connections
due to packet discard and latency as the acess router becomes
overloaded. Making a ppp access router drop packets is easiy,
as the thing to remember is it might have enough horse power to
actualy forward all the ddos incomming packets, but if you
exceed access bandwidth (i.e T1 Speed), by say 4x , your going
to get exceptional packet loss due to bandwidth oversubscription..problem 
huh.

What Can I do to stop it?

Use a firewall at the access layer, if you like to keep everything under your
control (of course you do), then you want to run your own firewall, not rely
on some unseen force working away at the bottom of nuclear fallout shelters
contantly battling with the forces of hacker evil to keep your network secure.
(In real terms, Employed one guy to monitor the firewall, if the screen goes
green, don't do anything, if the screen goes red, write it down, and then
don't do anything, that's what they call instant security response!..;-),
anyway don't know if that's true ;-), but it's also damm expensive to lets
someone else mananage your ip security off site. Their firewall will have very
a very complex rule set, and it's doubtful you'll have access to what they are
actally blocking from you, they could be blocking half of aol by mistake...;-)
They will have 1000's of users running throught it, it's hard enought keeping
tab's on one firewall, not to mention reacting to a ddos sitation with many.


Q. So, why can't we just create dynamic filters , and block connection from
   the ddos ip address streams at the customer layer, using our 100000
   Firewall.??

A. if only it was that simple.(it's is..;-).

Routers are thick, dead thick, they don't understand the connections they have
running across them, they only understand packets, image a phone system that
forgot how many people were calling over it, it just knew it need to a get
stuff from A to B. no more billing that's for sure, you don't have that data!.

Okay, so we create a filter for the traffic at the customer premises with a
firewall. No Good..

Access Router-----(TCP OPEN 80 Packets)---------Customer Router
              (from 4 different IP address)     |
						|
						|
					Filtering Firewall

as you can see, the bandwidth killing illegal packets are still transmitted
before being dropped by the firewall, we've still sent the evil packets onto
the line, they did there evil masters bidding...eating bandwidth resources!!!

So, you call your ISP, and ask them to kindly filter incomming traffic from
x,y,z interfaces...they respond 'filtering what?'.. your in for a long night
;-). We're assuming the packets are not spoofed, that's a whole different
story, another txt...

There is no standard way of creating custom filters on the access level router
(i.e. out of adminstitive control). This potential problem makes ddos attacks
harder to design for firewalls, as the firewall has no control over what gets
sent to it from the access layer router, the access router just shoves
whatever it receves down the line, no matter. So a normal firewall can't help
fight such a bandwidth/resource attack.

We need control of the Access Routers *incomming* filters. we don't have the
access cause it's thier equipment, and you can't touch it...but to solve the
problem that's going to have to change. So we need a protcol to negiotate what
comes in and out without human intervention...

We are saved..RSVP!!! Resource Reservation , interesting stuff;-).

So, our networks look's like

Access Router---(TCP OPEN 80 FLOOD)-------Customer Router--me!
   (RSVP)      (from 4 different IP address)   (RSVP)

Okay, with rsvp we will know how many 'connections' are open across the access
router. We'll also know how much bandwidth each is using, what it peak burst
rate is, what it's latency is and a whole host of network related statistics.
This is the data that is missing at the heart of the internet, now we can tell
exactly what's going on at the access level!!

During an attack, the RSVP router at the customers site know's the following
info (somewhere deep within ios). We start to analyses connection patterns,
ratio of dropped tcp connections to ratio of good connections. packet rate,
bursting rate etc etc.

With this information, we can start to build up pictures of packet flow
between the access router and customer router. This data is usually hard to
gather, as it needs to be 'snooped' from the network using a third party
device or custom router. RSVP can give us this as standard.


Source Address	Destination	TCP Open		    Flow
				Attempts   TCPUnsuccessful   %

Mr DDOS#1	my subnet	1111313	   12131133	     80
Mr DDOS#2	my subnet	30000      15000	     40
Mr DDOS#3	my subnet	2123       2120              30
Mr DDOS#4	my subnet	1500       1400              20
DDOS Subnet	my subnet	1000000    200000000
Normal User	me!		12		0	    0.4

Quite high number of unsuccessful tcp connections, so, if we see a high number
of unsucessful connection attempts, and a high percentage of packets from this
source is choking the link bandwidth, we filter this by informing the access
level router via rsvp to degrade streams associated with the following Address

Mr DDOS#1
Mr DDOS#2
Mr DDOS#3
Mr DDOS#4
DDOS Subnet
Normal User

filter the incomming port for a set lengyh of time, (or allocate all traffic
from this ip as lowest priority, so it will get discarded and will not cause
bandwidth stavation, but could still lead to host overload on weak O/S IP
stacks).

If we drop for a little as 1 second , we can reduce the amount of bandwidth
being used by more than 50%. If we give this stream a lower priority, using
some clever IP queuing techniques, see cisco resources on RED , very cool.
We can avoid filtering, we just label potentail dangerous traffic at a low
priority.

with RSVP, we can actually just use it's knowlage of tcp connection states to
prevent bandwidth denial of service attacks. By controlling the access layer
queues, via analysing rsvp tcp transport statistics and marking suspious
traffic at a lower priroity than trusted traffic (which need not to be
distrupted), can over come simple resourece ddos attacks. DDOS attack that
involved the dreaded rotating source IP address attacks, which can actually
overload routers which have to keep track of layere 4 state information via
thier own tables. an rsvp ddos ( ;-)..

If such a rotating attack occurs, where source IP address are randomaly
received, creating source IP filter for this type of attack is not normally
possible without the use of complex AI firewalls.

Just giving the router simple qos commands , for example give prority to
connections that furfil a certain critera such as completion of the three way
tcp handshake, or withing packet received per second rates.

DDOS Defenses and qos need to be pushed out to the access layer, this is the
only point where such compex logic has time to be performed without pentalites
to packet lactency and switching performance. Running this in the core could
be dangerous for you network forwarding performance....

As for spoofed IP packets from other networks, that's hard to fix, but if the
ISP concrete proof their access layers too, then spoofing becomes a lot
harder to achive without being detected.

Q. So, B isp won't concrete there access layer, they told me to go fuck
   myself, they carry ISP' C traffic to me, but users on ISP B can forge
   packets comming from C. There also a load of legit users on ISP B we don't
   want to loose!

ISP      ISP      ISP
A---------B--------C

me!	spoofer	   Innocent User 'I'm not ddosing anybody am I!'
        I think
       I'm Innocent
       user on ISPC

A. Get a direct connection to ISP C (physical link or peer with them at a
   public/private peering point). Don't use B as a Inter AS for ISP C. You'll
   be able to spoof protect at the peering point or you own directed router to
   them.

Q. Does'nt that mean I have to run BGP-4 and get into all that BGP-4 mumbo
   jumbo....
A. Err, yes, but hey..it's not rocket science, then again it's not a walk in
   the park either.

B, Must concrete there access layer. Each access layer on every ISP on the way
must prevent packets being 'injected' that are spoofed(harmful). (difficult
task!) B must , but C. At the moment, preventing spoofing is difficult, as
most backbone links carry many many different network packets, as backbones
become mainly interconnected at selected peering points, anti spoofing
measures can be strengthend at these points only. The network core will be
generally clean from filtering due to speed restrictions in switching routers.

Access Layer   -- Needs spoofing protection/RSVP
Network Core   -- Clean, for raw speed.
Peering Points -- Needs spoofing protection/RSVP, can be problematic in
                  hyperfast switching network cores.

Peering Points
--------------

Another protocol must be developed if RSVP is not adpoted as 'the' internet
qos protocol.

RSVP will need a universal bandwidth broker, rather like the universal BGP-4
of the routing world. This is the only way of acheiving end to end packet qos
on between as's on the public internet.

Using spoofing protection at peering points improves routing performance too,
this is a strange side effect of filtering at peering points. another txt, if
I receive enough demand.

RSVP if egineered correctly can 'smooth' out access connections, by
controlling bandwidth usage of the link. we can avoid ddos bandwidth attacks
on the access to the customer link but not however in the network core.
anti-DDOS the network core is much harder to do, if you have limited
resources yourself. It's much easier to eat a E-1 (the speed 30ish 56k modem,
to the speed of a backbone line of oc-192 (10gig!).

By building rich features on top of rsvp,  in routers, and enhancing firewall
software to cooperate with the rsvp on behalf of a protected subnet, in my
opionion it's the only way to go on this subject. The next level is RSVP
acutally intergrated into the end o/s tcp/ip stack. This unifies the transport
layer, the IP layer , and backs it up with gurantee's, which the o/s know
about. (windows 2000 has rsvp Intergrated already!, not had resources to
check it out, anyone played with this yet?).


Q. It's seems like a lof of effort to upgrade the access later and customer
   to rsvp just to prevent hackers.

A. Improved security, better connections, more reliable...who are you
   kidding????

Q. I've got a 56k modem, what use is rsvp qos.

A. It's all about TDM....First there was TDM then Came Packet networks, which
   were cheap, but we still needed TDM, so we made packet think it was TDM,
   and before TDM could wake up...packet was TDM over packet. ;-). so , TDM
   did'nt die, but was transformed before your eye's and you did'nt see it did
   you ;-).


Q. Okay, that's the theory, where can I get this solution now..,

A. As far as I know, you can't do this directly, but if I ever get the chance
   to build a network like this, I'll let you know.

(oh I forgot, I've gotta wear a suit to build a network like this.....oh
 well!).

(Tell me about it, im attending the London2600 meet next month in a 700 
 pound Suit, cos I am doing a course and meeting a customer for lunch :[

Hope you enjoyed reading this insane document. There maybe mistakes and
concepts that you don't agree with, don't erase my hard disks from afar,
mail me..and discuss..

If you have any Ideas, or you've got an 'new' rsvp router I could play with,
drop me a line.

You feedback is important.!!, but not as much as donuts.

Hax0ring Bouncer's ! - Slider
**********************************************

By far the most taxing event of the nite, specially as some of you are like
under 18 and should be like home in bed sucking your mothers nipples or
something, But huh! what do i know I was'nt breast fed (although im making up
for lost time with g/f's) and incest wasnt at the top of my list...

Maybe caus my parents are like techno crazed acid house ravers that do that
white glove thing and have like whissles and shit.  Or maybe... caus i never
had parents and i lived under a bush for most of my childhood masturbating
over 1989 copys of Page 3 and generally mugging old ladys and shit to make a
living, actually that proberly aint it, but sure as hell I have to stop 
eating these fucking little tablet things my g/f has caus its making my
hormones go yeeeeeeeeeyhaahhhhhh...

Now, as a member of the pub/club scene, I knew how much i wanted to get out,
meet women and drink, and drink, and drink. But, because of my age (I was 17
then, but older now) I had problems getting in and drinking.

So i developed tatics :]~

Now you average Human has this many brain cells

.....

Your average Clubber/Pubber/Hax0r has this many

........................................

And you average Bouncer has this many



[ Results may be changed from orginal readings i.e the bouncer has been 
given a few more ]

Anyways, as you can see the bouncer has x no. of brain cells...

Now, the whole point of the exercise is to gain user status, run a local r00t
exploit. So anyways, heres the description from Bugtraq.

discussion:

Bouncerd, is a deamon that runs mainly on port 3654,  The daemon checks
numerous variables, supplied by the user to assertain if access is allowed or
denied.  There are many unchecked buffers in the program, some of which can
be exploited directly from any browser. Supplying an overlylong value for the
"age", "pissed" and "dresscode" variables, and possibly others, will
overwrite their respective buffers. In this manner, arbitrary code can be
executed on the remote target.

With the arbitrary code it is possible to spoof the variables in the bouncerd
daemon into believing you have full r00t access to the system and you will
recieve no problems trying to enter.
------------------------------------

So what you gotta do is know some small minor detail like your fake date of 
birth.

Now dress up like everyone else, i.e. the new craze in dressing in your town 
or city, then get a nice coat.  A good one would be thats quite large, making
you look bigger.

Then practice what you are going to say, a deeper voice, a stiff "evening".

Keep your head up, eyes looking at theres, and generally making them feel 
awkward.

If you are turned away then dont make a fuss say "cheers anyway mate, 
goodnight" and try the next pub along the road. Or if no-one is around and he
is small, give him a good shoeing :]
