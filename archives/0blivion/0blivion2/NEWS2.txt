<http://securityportal.com/topnews/ms00-018.html>  - IIS 4.0 supports

can be reserved. This would allow a malicious user to request an extremely
large buffer for a POST or PUT operation, but never actually send data,
thereby blocking memory on the server that had been allocated to the
session. If sufficient memory on the server were blocked in this fashion, it
could prevent the server from performing useful work. There is no capability
through this attack to create, modify or delete data on the server, nor is
there any capability to usurp administrative control of the server. If the
malicious user closed his session, the memory would be released and the
server's operation would return to normal. Otherwise, the machine could be
put back into normal service by stopping and restarting the service
