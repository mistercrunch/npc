- Interview with Slider

Wh00 Wh00

- Introduce yourself?

Im Slider, and im sorta a old skool and a bit of new skool rolled into one, I
enjoy using computers, and seeing what they can do, i also enjoy pushing back
the boundaries of life.

Most people say that "new" skool is full of skript kiddys, well i dis-agree, 
its full of people using new methods to do old things.  I also download
applications to see how they have been written and see if i can implement
their programming tekniqs into my own programs.

- What was the first computer you owned?

Was an Amiga 500, with 16meg of RAM (something like that), i got into the
warez scene with this, and copying games for a small price.  This did not last
long, due to the fact that PC's started to drop in price, so Amiga's sort of
went out the window. (Although Nynex uses his still)

- Why did you pick your handle?

Well, it actually came from my mates... It started at a house party with an 
ex-g/f and her getting rather horny/wet... and then my mates walking in.

- When did you get into the computer underground?

23rd September 1997, in a IT lab @ my school.  I was surfing for pr0n when i 
came across some website.  I did not fully join until October 1998 or so.

- Why did you get into the computer underground?

I wanted to share my experiences and my knowledge of computers and generally 
voice my views and give guidance.

- Describe the systems you are running at home?

A IAS box into my analogue phone line, connected to the IAS box is a Token
Ring 16/4 network, running into a Windows NT box, connected to the Windows NT
box is a AS/400 with built in Firewall, this protects my network, in case
anyone gets through my Windows security (custom changed), then the other side
of this i have a star based topology network with A box used for whatever (to
build test enviroments) a dedicated Risc laptop with AIX, and dedicated SuSe
box, and a Windows 2k 24/7 file server, i also am getting another box for
testing. Whats better than having your own boxes to recreate a server u want
to hack...

- What OS's are you currently running on your own system?

Windows NT 4.0 SP5, with Winux.  I also have multiple "cracked" shell accounts
all across the world.  I dont tend to use them, due to the fact that they 
could be easily found on the systems that they are on.

- What OS's do you use on a regualar basis?

OS/400, NT/TSE/2K, AIX, SuSE, Caldera, Redhat, some Solaris, and OS/390 when i
can get my hands on a shell.

- What would you suggest is the most secure "out of box" Operating system?

This is quite controversial.  I would have to say OS/400 and then *nix, and 
then Windows, but it is what you make it...  I have custom secured Windows
boxes, that are often more secure than most boxes.  If you understand what you
are trying to do, then you can do it.  It is best said that is best to get
inside the mind of the enemy, seeing as i am the enemy, it works quite well.

- What would you suggest is the best Operating system?

Again OS/400 alot more secure and easier to use and control, to learn more 
visit www.ibm.com/as400

- What do you think of Microsofts products ?

I know i am going to get flamed, generally quite good, although if they 
increased the stability of it and added a few extra features it would be very
good. And if they moved away from making it look better to making it more
secure.

- What groups have you ever belonged to?

Krash Mag, before then i worked by myself.

- Why did you leave/disband these groups?

It was not going where i wanted it to go, and they were moving towards
viruses, and there was taking of sides within the group and silly arguments.

- What do you think of the underground scene today?

Its going where it should be, but theres silly little things like fights and 
lack of information that causes problems.

- What do you think is needed or is lacking in the scene?

More sharing of information. It is not as developed as the US, due to lack 
of free net access and generally alot less ppl.

- What do you do at Oblivion?

Im the deputy editor, and also a writer.  I also shed my views and generally 
shoot the shit.

- Who do you look upto in the underground scene?

Generally my peers like Elias Levy, RFP, Lopht crew, Darkcyde and others.  I 
also look towards Abattis, Sadarar, Alex Delarge and Neon Bunny as friends and
colleagues in this funky electronic world.

- Would you call yourself a 'Hacker'?

In the old school sense of the word "yes" and in the new sense "yes" as 
well, I hack as part of my job, i.e manipulating code to find a solution.  I
also crack as a hobby, and a experience.  On servers that I find access to, i
generally tell them about it, and how i got in and stuff.  But, then 
sometimes i dont...

I crack illegally and legally, i.e. ppl ask me to check there server and 
stuff like that.

- What do you do with the systems once you gain root?

Well, i generally crack a system for information, and generally to gain 
applications and stuff, the majority of the stuff i crack online im sorry to
say is either FTP sites.  Another large percentage of system cracks is for
shell accounts, and for extra CPU to compile, or storage space.

- What would you consider to be your skills?

I would consider my skills to be mostly green screen terminal based, and 
Windows NT/TSE/2k based, I also have tried to expand onto the *nix scene.  I
try to keep a cool head, and share my knowledge and experiences.

- Any l33t gr33tz g01ng 0ut 2 n31?

Anyone that knows me, and the people i respect.

- Any fuqu's?

Nope.
