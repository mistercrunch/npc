TELNET

TELNET has a status of :  recommended.

It is described in RFC 854 TELNET Protocol Specifications and RFC 855 TELNET
Option Specifications.

The TELNET protocol provides a standardized interface, through which a program
on one host (the TELNET client) can access the resources of another host (the
TELNET server) as though the client were a local terminal connected to the
server. For example, a user on a workstation on a LAN may connect to a host
attached to the LAN as though the workstation were a terminal attached
directly to the host. Of course, TELNET can be used across WANs as well as
LANs.


TELNET Operation

TELNET protocol is based on three ideas:

1. The Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) concept. An NVT is an imaginary device
having a basic structure common to a wide range of real terminals. Each host
maps its own terminal characteristics to those of an NVT, and assumes that
every other host will do the same.

2. A symmetric view of terminals and processes.

3. Negotiation of terminal options. The principle of negotiated options is
used by the TELNET protocol, because many hosts wish to provide additional
services, beyond those available with the NVT. Various options may be
negotiated. Server and client use a set of conventions to establish the
operational characteristics of their TELNET connection via the
*DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T* mechanism.

The two hosts begin by verifying their mutual understanding. Once this initial
negotiation is complete, they are capable of working on the minimum level
implemented by the NVT. After this minimum understanding is achieved, they can
negotiate additional options to extend the capabilities of the NVT to reflect
more accurately the capabilities of the real hardware in use. Because of the
symmetric model used by TELNET, both the host and the client may propose
additional options to be used.


Network Virtual Terminal

The NVT has a printer (or display) and a keyboard. The keyboard produces
outgoing data, which is sent over the TELNET connection. The printer receives
the incoming data. The basic characteristics of an NVT, unless they are
modified by mutually agreed options are:

-  The data representation is 7-bit ASCII transmitted in 8-bit bytes.
-  The NVT is a half-duplex device operating in a line-buffered mode.
-  The NVT provides a local echo function.

All of these can be negotiated by the two hosts. For example, a local echo is
preferred because of the lower network load and superior performance but there
is an option for using a remote echo, although no host is required to use it.

An NVT printer has an unspecified carriage width and page length. It can
handle printable ASCII characters (ASCII code 32 to 126) and understands some
ASCII control characters.


TELNET Command Structure

The communication between client and server is handled with internal commands,
which are not accessible by users. All internal TELNET commands consist of 2
or 3-byte sequences, depending on the command type.

The Interpret As Command (IAC) character is followed by a command code. If
this command deals with option negotiation, the command will have a third byte
to show the code for the referenced option.


TELNET Basic Commands

The primary goal of the TELNET protocol is the provision of a standard
interface for hosts over a network. To allow the connection to start, the
TELNET protocol defines a standard representation for some functions.
