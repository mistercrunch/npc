Deputy Editors Rant...

Well we have finally got to issue 2, and have had some really good reviews,
and some good comments raised about the state of the mag, as whole.

We now reside on EFnet on #oblivionmag, this is because EFnet is better,
faster and generally more efficent.

Oblivion mag has made some good friends in the last month, and affiliated with
a few other groups, including Shadowvx, a underground Virus group, although i
unfortunatly, detest people that make these malicious programs, they do
provide invaluable codeing capabilities, and have generally alot of
programming experience.

There has been some concern that Oblivion Mag needs to get away from the
technical view on the black hat/white hat culture, and move towards anarchy.
Why?

Oblivion Mag I hope will stand out from the rest as a top class mag, that
attracts people from all sides of the community, i want it aimed at white
hat's intrests as well as black hats, not anarchy.  Although its nice, what
sort admin wants to know about blowing the fuck out of things (although fun),
and killing people ?

In future my texts will all be technical based, and not directed towards
anarchy, viruses will be covered in the context of what problems they cause
in the underlying structure of todays infra-structure.

Also this month i noticed that Krash mag has issued a statement that they
were going to put there mag on there website for reading... Funny that, the
month before we issued the same statement...

Also, it may be noted that I was part of Krash, i admit yes i was.  But, due
to fights, and taking of sides within the group, and the general downhill
decline of content, and general structure I left.  It also may be noted that
they are publishing more virus source code, I published my views to the
editor of the magazine, and they were ignored, completely.  If you want to
have every other article on viruses, turn the fucking magazine into a virus
magazine !

I also, left due to lack of articles that were worth reading, about technical
overviews, the most worth while read for technical texts is still darkcyde,
and of course Oblivion Mag.

Oblivion Mag is starting to get its own audience and its own place on the
leader board of UK ezines.

For the future I have a number of high level interviews lined up for next 
months edition, and hope people will appreciate my work towards creating and 
running these interviews.

You may of noticed that we have included a text/article on this months top
ten exploits !

Well, being a forgetful person, i forgot that Darkcyde had done something
similar in there first few issues, until it was dropped.  Now, when Zomba
read the mag (Wow, someone so eleet reads our mag!) and noticed this (fjear
zomba's remembering tekniq, far more advanced than mine) he told me, Darkcyde
had done the same.  I nearly died.  I then put the whole article on the line
and asked if Oblivion Mag could publish the same sort of thing...

Zomba you are the MAN !!!!

You can find the article, and future articles about exploits in this months
mag.

Let Oblivion Mag, not be accused.

Thanks to everybody that has given comments towards Oblivion Mag.

Also, I would like to congratulate Blocker on joining the official Oblivion
Mag team, and to Cyber0ptix, for getting Oblivion Mag off the ground.

I would also like to thank Phreakazoid, you know why...

And to Darkcyde, 809, Shadowvx, 2600-uk.

With you guys we may make Oblivion Mag the best.

Anyway, if anyone is about in Hants on the first Saturday of every month,
get your ass down to Southampton Bargate centre for Hants 2600, for more
details talk to Me, Abattis, or Sadarar.

Hants 2600, was formed due to the lack of enthuiasts in the general areas of
Hampshire, so a county wide meet was formed.  So more members could attend.

Hants 2600, invites all sorts of people to its meets, which are 12:00 - 12:20
outside the bargate, its at this strange time due to silly train times.  The
meets generally fold at about 4:00 - 5:00 in time for trains, or when the
general members get bored to shit and decide to go home :)

We discuss anything from what we are doing tonight, to matters within the
general community.

Theres also a chance normally at the end to show off your Quake 1/2/3 death
match skills...

Over the following months, i hope to cover as many subjects and technical
discoveries as possible within these rants or within actual texts.

Also, caus im bored, i have started to design a dance song remix, soon to be
published on an FTP site, soon as i can be bothered to finish the fucking
thing !

Oblivion mag is big, and its getting bigger.  Dont be left behind.
