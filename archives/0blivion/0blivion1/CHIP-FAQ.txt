Disclaimer:
You may copy and distribute this document as long as it remains unchanged. I
have written this for educational purposes so it *hopefully* reduces the
amount of questions being asked time and time again on usenet. I do not
participate in any illegal activities and have written this due to the
increasing demand of questions being asked by people searching for
information.

Introduction:
After all the questions being asked on usenet I have written this document
to answer some of the most common questions about 'chipped' phones. Since a
few people were commenting on the original FAQ and 'tco' added updates I
decided to try and cover all the aspects of 'chipped' phones.

1.
What is a chipped phone?

A chipped phone is a mobile phone that has been fitted with a chip that
resets the credit balance on phone everytime it is turned on.

2.
Can my <phone name> be chipped?

The only phones that can be chipped are C12's and Digas. These use the
BTCellnet network and use two different tariffs, "Pay & Go" and "U". There
are other exploits on different networks such as Vodafone and One to One but
the BTCellnet 'chipping' exploit has recieved much more attention.

3.
Will I need to top up my chipped C12/Diga?

YES! READ THE FUCKIN' MANUAL YOU GOT WITH THE PHONE! If you do not top up
your phone with £15 of credit every 60 days on 'Pay & Go', £10 every 90 days
with 'U', you will be disconnected from the network. That means you will be
unable to make any calls until you top up.

4.
How do I top up? What is this I have heard about the alarm?

To top up on the diga just buy your legitimate top up and activate it as if
you had a normal phone.
On the C12 you need to...

Turn the alarm on.
Turn the phone off and back on.
Make the top up by holding hotkey 3.
Wait for the "top up succesful message"
Make a short phone call.
Turn the alarm off and turn the phone off.
Turn the phone back on.

By turning the alarm on you turn the chip off.

5.
What are the chances of BT finding out it is 'chipped'?

As long as you top up your phone every few weeks you should have no problem
remaining connected to the network. However if you spend 40 hours on your
phone and yet never make a top up that will seem strange to the employers at
Cellnet. The trick is to make it seem like you are a legit customer.
However BTCellnet have been disconnecting phones at random so that means if
you have a chipped phone or not it could still be disconnected.

6.
What should I do if I have been disconnected?

(Turn the alarm on if you use a c12) Phone the customer care line and tell
them you have been disconnected. Pretend to be angry and frustrated at this
as a normal customer would be. They should then ask you for a number to
call you back on but pretend your mobile is your only phone at the moment
and you are calling from a payphone. Hopefully they will reconnect you and
say 'sorry'. This method WILL usualy work and has been done many times
succesfully.

7.
What will happen if I get caught?

In most cases your phone will be disconnected after a few months but by that
time you have proberly made hundereds of pounds worth of calls. However if
for some reason they track you down you may face problems with the
authorities. I have never heard of someone being in trouble with the
authorities for having a chipped phone but it could happen.

8.Where is the C12/diga hex code available free from?

The net cleaners have a copy of the hex code for the c12/diga and many other
mobiles on their website. You can download it free from...
www.t-n-c.co.uk
There are many other sites with the code available free for download.

9.
Where can I get a chipped phone from?

Email LordNeon@hotmail.com
There are also many people selling chipped mobiles all over the UK via the
internet, look at alt.2600, alt.ph.uk, etc. Otherwise you could ask a friend
or relative that knows a little about electronics to help you out.

10.
What is a reasonable price?

The phone costs between £40/£70 and the chip itself costs between £2/£15
depending on where your supplier gets it. That means in total the price of
the phone all togther will be at most £80/£85. A usual price is £120 but I
have seen prices as low as £90 and high as £175+.

11.
Which phone is better the C12 or Diga?

The C12 is the newer model and is much more slim. It is better than all the
other Prepay mobiles I have seen around at the moment. Try and get the C12
on the 'U' tariff. The diga will usualy cost £10 less than the C12.

12.
Does it matter what tarrif I use my chipped phone on?

You can use your chipped c12/diga on either 'Pay&Go' or 'U'. However I
would suggest 'U' as you are only required to top up every 90 days but on
Pay&Go you need to top up every 60 days. Pay&Go will sometimes be £10 less
than 'U'.

13.
What kind of SIM card do I need to replace on the C12/Diga?

None! You don't touch the SIM card. There are other rumours of being able to
get free calls on other networks other than BTCellnet by replacing the Sim
card.

14.
What are the different types of chip available for the C12/diga? What are
the differences in these chips?

There are no real differences in the different types of chips you can add to
the phone. Some different chips are called...
12C508
12C508a
12C509
These are called mod chips. Before you can fit the mod chip to the phone
you have to program the mod. This is why you hear so much about hex code as
this is what is used to program the chip. There are differnet variations of
hex code around written by different people. In order to program a mod you
need a pic writter and the hex code. If you don't have access to a pic
writter buy your chips preprogrammed. This will cost a few pounds extra in
most cases.

15.
Why do I lose the extra credit I top up my phone when I turn the phone back
on? How can I resolve this problem? Does this have anything to do with the
chip?

After you place a top up on your phone you will expect your balance to go
to £20 instead of £10. Howver many people lose the extra money they place in
their phone shortly after they top up as they do not follow the correct
procedure. You MUST make a short phone call to someone before re-enabling
the chip by turning the alarm off.

16.
How much should I use my 'chipped' phone without Cellnet catching me?

Treat your chipped phone as if it were a normal mobile. Just try to keep the
time you spend on it at a reasonable level.
