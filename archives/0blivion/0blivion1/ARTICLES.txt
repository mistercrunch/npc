Submitting Articles for Oblivion Underground Magazine
-----------------------------------------------------

Hi there everyone, as you may have noticed this magazine is trying to recieve
more articles from you the magazines readers.....

If you want to write an article for Oblivion Underground Magazine Issue 2 due
for release on the 15th of April 2000 then feel free to type up an article and
email it directly to me the editor Cyber0ptix at cyberoptix@email.com

Unfortunately at this time we are not in a position to reward anyone
financially for your contributions towards the magazine although you will
receive full credit for your article if it appears......

You can also submitt articles anonymousley if you want, just make sure that
when you email them, you include in the mail a note saying you want to remain
anonymous...

Feel free to include any greetz and shout outs that you want as the articles
will not be changed in anyway before publication except for formatting and
headers/footers added....

Thanx again to everyone who has already contributed their time and effort to
help me get this issue out on time and I hope we can work together to make
Oblivion Underground Magazine one of the greatest UK based E-Zines around..

Remember.......Email your articles to..
