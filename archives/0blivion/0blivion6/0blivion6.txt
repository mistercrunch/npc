Introduction To Issue 6 - Slider
**********************************************

Re.

Welcome to Issue 6, this is a very short issue im afraid due to myself being
away on holiday and having to start a new job, and Cyber moving house (still!)
and working and being a typical student.  At the moment we are trying to get
ideas in for articles, so we would appreciate any ideas for text files, no
matter how silly or indepth they might be that we can research and then write
about after gaining some experience in these subjects.

Many thanks to all of you who stuck in your points of view, and of course your
articles! And please will you continue sending them in, we appreciate points
of view and of course your articles. This way you can get your work published
to a wider audience.  Also, if you are thinking of writing a article yourself
then also contact us, we will help you as much as possible to write it.  We
are here to promote learning and sharing of information like the Internet
community should be, all we ask is that you publish the document or text in
Oblivion mag first, then distribute it to other mags if you wish.  This gives
us peace of mind knowing that we got something good out of it!

At the moment i am trying to organise as many things as possible to get this
issue out and even have put my love life (shock horror) to one side for this
issue! dedication or shat... shit what am i saying ??? this aint like me, but
what the hell the groupies come first innit :]

And remember we may not be covering stuff like 0-day hacking tekniq's, but
instead we are covering stuff that should be known. We are here to be an
instrument for learning.

Also we are looking for a host that may be able to supply us with an shell
acc. so that we may increase our amount of bots on our channel.  This is due
to take overs from unknown parties.  May i add this is extrememley stupid and
irritating for all of us. Oblivion is a place to share and absorb information
from many people and parties, we dont need ppl doing this kind of stubborn
and stupid activities.

Also, more members in the chan would be v. much appreciated so if anyone has
any free time just come and idle with us.  We are v. much acceptable to new
peeps and always happy to chat about anything under the sun.

My Rant - Cyber0ptix
**********************************************

Hi, and welcome to issue 6 of 0blivion.  Well who woulkd believe we would
still be around after half a year!  Well we are and still getting good
reviews and feedback although the articles have slowed down a lot ;o(  This
means that this issue may be quite a short one.  So come on and lets get
sending some articles in to make issue 7 the best ever.

So what has been happening this month?  Well looks like BT attempt at letting
the UK have high speed 'always on' net connections using ADSL is going to be
a big let down.  The have just changed the contention ratio of the line from
50:1 to a rediculous 80:1, this means that although you will have a maximum
speed of 512k upload this could be used by a maximum of 80 people at once
bringing it down to speeds the like of a 14,400 bps modem.  Also rumours
around the net make it out like it is going to be so port blocked that all
you will be able to do is browse the web and send email.  They arn't even
allowing ICQ to work.  Come on BT, get you finger out and give us what we
need.  The UK is so far behind in internet technology we will still be using
56k modems in 10 years time if they dont get it right.  Oh well looks like we
will just have to wait for them to open up the local loop and get some
competition in there and show them how its done.  But when the fuck is this
going to happen?



Also another crack at BT for their pathetic unmetered product SurfTime.  Well
it would of been good but they just had to gedt involved with the data side
of it and completely fuck it up.  Instead of just giving out free 0844
numbers that route through to the ISP's hardware they decided to make these
connect to the exchanges and then get routed through their data network to
free up the voice network for calls.  Great a faster conection!  Well you
would of thought so, but the number of hops it takes to get through to your
ISP's hardware is beyond a joke and puts ping rates to about 500.  I have
seen poeople having 15 hops till they even reach the ISP.  ISDN is
tempremental, and cos they have installed BT modems you get crap connection
speeds.

SurfTime was also down for 17 hours last month when a fibre cable split.  Oh
well its a routing network you would of thought, no need to worry.  Well BT
didn;t think about building b ackup routes into the network and decided to
leave it with a single point of failure, which resulted in no one being able
to connect.

Well I think that is enough slating of BT, I'll probably be getting sued by
them now. ;o)

Anyway so what else has been happening?  Lotus notes was broken wide open at
Defcon 8 last weekend when information was released concerning the encryption
method used to store passwords and how easy it was to crack them.

Another e-commerce site has been down this week.  www.wollies.co.uk as their
security was weak.  The site has been taken down for a 'major security
overhaul' which is expected to take 2 weeks.  Come on how long does it take
if you had of done it right in the first place.

Well that my little rant over for another month, and as I said lets get some
articles sent in from you the readers, it doesn;t matter how long they are,
or how technical as long as they are of a good standard and an interesting
read we will try and include them in the zine, just email them to me at
cyberoptix@0blivion.org.

Also happening next weekend is DNSCON 2.  Unfortunately I am unable to go due
to work, but if anyone that goes can write a review for next month issue we
would be very grateful.

Getting the best Connection - Cyber0ptix
**********************************************

Well this is just a little text that I have written to help you all get the
fastest connection to the net without any slowdown or connection problems.

This is all basic stuff but this is bound to help out some people who arn't
too sure on this.

As you all know getting a fast connection over the PSTN relies on many
variables to ensure that every thing is OK.  So I am going to outline a few
of the problems and how you can get round them.

1. Line Noise.

Most people tend to blame their ISP if they have a slow connection.  Well you
are connecting over a phone system which was not designed to give high speed
data transfer.  It may interest you to know that BT only gaurentees a data
connection upto 9600bps.  Well what is the point in that in todays world with
modem technology at 56k and the soon to be released V.92, which is only going
to be any good if BT totally fuck up ADSL.

If you find that you are having random disconnects or slow connection speeds
then it is time to get in touc hwith your telco.  First off fone the fault
department and ask them to check your line for noise.  Tell them your number
and the number that you are dialing,  your ISP's.  Ask them to run a full
check between the two numbers.  Also ask them to turn the gain up on your
line as this will get you a better connection.

2. DACS!

So you thought you'd get a dedicatedc line for the internet and leave your
other line so people can get in touch with you.  So you get in touch with BT
and as kthem to install it.  Thgey come round and fit everything and you go
to connect for the first time.  You click connect and what do you see?

'Connected at 28,800bps'

What the fuck?

Well it looks like BT have DACS'ed you.  This basically involves multiplexing
your existing line to give you the ability to have two lines on one by
splitting the bandwidth.  This is fine for voice lines but when you want to
use one of them for the internet it is a complete waste of time.

So what can you do?  Not much if you have already had it installed.  As I
said earlier they only gaurentee data connections upto 9600bps and are within
their right to do this to your line.  Try calling them and ask them to
replace it with a 'real' line so you can get the connection speed you want.
If they wont, refuse to pay and tell them to come and remove it.

Before you ask for a second line to be installed, tell them that you do not
want a DACS box as you need the line for the internet and tell them to
install a new line. This may be a problem as you exchange need free space to
add this free line, it also costs a lot more for BT to install the line so
they may refuse and only offer you the DACS box.  Do NOT bother as there is
no point.

3.  Netwkring Protocols.

Check through your Networking protocols and make sure you have the latest
updates installed.

IF you are running Windows goto Control Panel and click on Network.  This
will tell you what you have installed.  As a bare minimum all you want is the
following

Client for Microsoft Networks
Dial Up Adaptor
TCP/IP

You may have more installed for VPN? Support but this does not matter.  If
you are having problems with data transfer try removing TCP/IP, reboot, add
it back in and then reboot again.  This will reinstall the protocol stack and
should solve your problems.  Remove all unwanted protocols such as IPX/SPX
compatable and NETBEUI.

Another problem is with Windows 98 which installs with 'Microsoft Family
Logon' as default instead of Client for Microsoft Networks.  Remove this
imediately as it causes more problems than it solves.  Replace it with Client
for Microsoft Networks and reboot.

4.  Dial Up Networking.

First of, with Windows 95 make sure you have upgraded to DUN 1.3, this will
install the DUN with compatability for 56k modems.  Without this upgrade you
will not get a good connection.

Next check your settings.  My Computer > Dialup Networking, then right click
on the icon you connect with and select properties.  Make sure the number you
are dialling is correct for your modem type.  Some ISP's run different
numbers for different technologies.  IF in doubt phone Tech Support or look
on their website.

Next click 'Server Types'  Untick everything on this page except for the
following.

Use Software Compression
TCP/IP

Click OK and reboot your machine.  


5. Modem Drivers.

As with all harware your modem has drivers installed to make it work.  Make
sure these are uptodate by visiting your modem manufacturewrs website and
downloading the latest versions.  Also see if they have a flash upgrade to
update the 'Software' inside your modem.

And thats it, once you have made sure all this uis correct you should enjoy
the fastest connection for your modem/phone line quality.

Happy Surfing.

Application Programming Interfaces - Tango-Omega
**********************************************

Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow developers to write
applications that can make use of TCP/IP services. The following sections
provide an overview of the most common APIs for TCP/IP applications.

-- The Socket API

The socket interface is one of several application programming interfaces
(APIs) to the communication protocols. Designed to be a generic communication
programming interface, it was first introduced by the 4.2BSD UNIX system.

Although it has not been standardized, it has become a de facto industry
standard. The socket interface is differentiated by the services that are
provided to applications: stream sockets (connection-oriented), datagram
sockets (connectionless), and raw sockets (direct access to lower layer
protocols) services.

A variation of the BSD sockets interface is provided by the Winsock interface
developed by Microsoft and other vendors to support TCP/IP applications on
Windows operating systems. Winsock 2.0, the latest version, provides a more
generalized interface allowing applications to communicate with any available
transport layer protocol and underlying network services, including, but no
longer limited to, TCP/IP.

-- Basic Socket Calls

The following lists some basic socket interface calls. In the next section we
see an example scenario of using these socket interface calls.

* Initialize a socket.

    FORMAT:
          int sockfd = socket(int family, int type, int protocol)
    Where:

    -* family stands for addressing family. It can take on values such as
       AF_UNIX, AF_INET, AF_NS, AF_OS2 and AF_IUCV. Its purpose is to
       specify the method of addressing used by the socket.
    -* type stands for the type of socket interface to be used. It can take on
       values such as SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW, and SOCK_SEQPACKET.
    -* protocol can be UDP, TCP, IP or ICMP.
    -* sockfd is an integer (similar to a file descriptor) returned by the 
       socket call.

* Bind (register) a socket to a port address.

    FORMAT:
          int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr \localaddr, int addrlen)
    Where:

    -* sockfd is the same integer returned by the socket call.
    -* localaddr is the local address returned by the bind call.

Note that after the bind call, we now have values for the first three
parameters inside our 5-tuple association:

   {protocol, local-address, local-process, foreign-address, foreign-process}

* Indicate readiness to receive connections.

    FORMAT:
          int listen(int sockfd, int queue-size)
    Where:

    -* sockfd is the same integer returned by the socket call.
    -* queue-size indicates the number of connection requests that can be
       queued by the system while the local process has not yet issued the 
       accept call.

* Accept a connection.

    FORMAT:
        int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr \foreign-address, int addrlen)
    Where:

    -* sockfd is the same integer returned by the socket call.
    -* foreign-address is the address of the foreign (client) process returned
       by the accept call.

  Note: this accept call is issued by a server process rather than a client
  process. If there is a connection request waiting on the queue for this 
  socket connection, accept takes the first request on the queue and creates
  another socket with the same properties as sockfd; otherwise, accept will
  block the caller process until a connection request arrives.

* Request connection to the server.

     FORMAT:
       int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr \foreign-address, int addrlen)
     Where:

     -* sockfd is the same integer returned by the socket call.
     -* foreign-address is the address of the foreign (server) process
        returned by the connect call.

  Note that this call is issued by a client process rather than a server
  process.

* Send and/or receive data.

The read(), readv(sockfd, char *buffer int addrlen), recv(), readfrom(),
send(sockfd, msg, len, flags) and write() calls can be used to receive and 
send data in an established socket association (or connection).

Note that these calls are similar to the standard read and write file I/O 
system calls.

* Close a socket.

      FORMAT:
            int close(int sockfd)
      Where:

      -* sockfd is the same integer returned by the socket call.

-- An Example Scenario

As an example, consider the socket system calls for a connection-oriented 
protocol.

Consider the previous socket system calls in terms of specifying the 
elements of the association:

****************************************************************************
*	Protocol  	       * Local       Local   * Foreign    Foreign  *
*                              * Address  ,  Process * Address ,  Process  *
****************************************************************************
* connection-oriented server   * socket()  * bind() *   listen() accept()  *
****************************************************************************
* connection-oriented client   * connect() *         socket()              *
****************************************************************************
* connectionless server        * socket()  * bind() *      recvfrom()      *
****************************************************************************
* connectionless client        * socket()  * bind() *      sendto()        *
****************************************************************************

The above diagram shows Socket System Calls and Association

The socket interface is differentiated by the different services that are 
provided. Stream, datagram, and raw sockets each define a different service
available to applications.

* Stream socket interface (SOCK_STREAM): It defines a reliable
  connection-oriented service (over TCP for example). Data is sent without
  errors or duplication and is received in the same order as it is sent. 
  Flow control is built-in to avoid data overruns. No boundaries are imposed
  on the exchanged data, which is considered to be a stream of bytes. An
  example of an application that uses stream sockets is the File Transfer
  Program (FTP).

* Datagram socket interface (SOCK_DGRAM): It defines a connectionless
  service (over UDP for example). Datagrams are sent as independent packets.
  The service provides no guarantees; data can be lost or duplicated, and
  datagrams can arrive out of order. No disassembly and reassembly of 
  packets is performed. An example of an application that uses datagram
  sockets is the Network File System (NFS).

* Raw socket interface (SOCK_RAW): It allows direct access to lower layer
  protocols such as IP and ICMP. This interface is often used for testing 
  new protocol implementations. An example of an application that uses raw 
  sockets is the Ping command.

-- Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

Remote Procedure Call is a standard developed by Sun Microsystems and used 
by many vendors of UNIX systems.

RPC is an application programming interface (API) available for developing
distributed applications. It allows programs to call subroutines that are 
executed at a remote system. The caller program (called client) sends a call
message to the server process, and waits for a reply message. The call message
includes the procedure's parameters and the reply message contains the
procedure's results.

RPC also provides a standard way of encoding data in a portable fashion 
between different systems called External Data Representation (XDR).

-- RPC Concept

The concept of RPC is very similar to that of an application program issuing 
a procedure call:

* The caller process sends a call message and waits for the reply.
* On the server side, a process is dormant awaiting the arrival of call 
  messages.

When one arrives, the server process extracts the procedure parameters,
computes the results and sends them back in a reply message.

This is only a possible model, as the Sun RPC protocol doesn't put 
restrictions on the concurrency model. In the model above, the caller's
execution blocks until a reply message is received. Other models are
possible; for instance, the caller may continue processing while waiting for
a reply, or the server may dispatch a separate task for each incoming call so
that it remains free to receive other messages.

The remote procedure calls differ from local procedure calls in the following
ways:

* Use of global variables as the server has no access to the caller program's
  address space.
* Performance may be affected by the transmission times.
* User authentication may be necessary.
* Location of server must be known.

Transport:  The RPC protocol can be implemented on any transport protocol. 
In the case of TCP/IP, it can use either TCP or UDP as the transport vehicle.
The type of the  transport is a parameter of the RPCGEN command. In case UDP
is used, remember that this does not provide reliability, so it will be up to
the caller program itself to ensure this (using timeouts and retransmissions,
usually	implemented in RPC library routines). Note that even with TCP, the
caller program still needs a timeout routine to deal with exceptional
situations such as a server crash.

The call and reply message data is formatted to the XDR standard.

RPC Call Message:  The RPC call message consists of several fields:

* Program and procedure numbers
  Each call message contains three fields (unsigned integers): that uniquely
  identify the procedure to be executed:
* Remote program number
* Remote program version number
* Remote procedure number

The remote program number identifies a functional group of procedures, for
instance a file system, which would include individual procedures such as 
read and write. These individual procedures are identified by a unique
procedure number within the remote program. As the remote program evolves, a
version number is assigned to the different releases.

Each remote program is attached to an internet port. The number of this port
can be freely chosen, except for the reserved well-known-services port
numbers. It is evident that the caller will have to know the port number 
used by this remote program.

Assigned program numbers:

00000000 - 1FFFFFFF defined by Sun
20000000 - 3FFFFFFF defined by user
40000000 - 5FFFFFFF transient (temporary numbers)
60000000 - FFFFFFFF reserved

* Authentication fields

Two fields,  credentials and  verifier, are provided for the authentication 
of the caller to the service. It is up to the server to use this information
for user authentication. Also, each implementation is free to choose the
varieties of supported authentication protocols. Some authentication
protocols are:

-* Null authentication.

-* UNIX authentication. The callers of a remote procedure may identify
   themselves as they are identified on the UNIX system.

-* DES authentication. In addition to user ID, a timestamp field is sent to 
   the server. This timestamp is the current time, enciphered using a key
   known to the caller machine and server machine only (based on the  secret
   key and  public key concept of DES).

* Procedure parameters

Data (parameters) passed to the remote procedure.

RPC Reply Message:  Several replies exist, depending on the action taken:

-* SUCCESS: Procedure results are sent back to the client.
-* RPC_MISMATCH: Server is running another version of RPC than the caller.
-* AUTH_ERROR: Caller authentication failed.
-* PROG_MISMATCH: If program is unavailable or if the version asked for does
   not exist or if the procedure is unavailable.

For a detailed description of the call and reply messages, see RFC 1057  
RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification Version 2, which also
contains the type definitions (typedef) for the messages in XDR language.

Portmap or Portmapper:  The Portmap or Portmapper is a server application that
will map a program number and its version number to the Internet port number
used by the program. Portmap is assigned the reserved (well-known service) 
port number 111.

Portmap only knows about RPC programs on the host it runs on. In order for
Portmap to know about the RPC program, every RPC program should register 
itself with the local Portmapper when it starts up.

The RPC client (caller) has to ask the Portmap service on the remote host 
about the port used by the desired server program.

Normally, the calling application would contact Portmap on the destination 
host to obtain the correct port number for a particular remote program, and
then send the call message to this particular port. A variation exists when
the caller also sends the procedure data along to Portmap and then the remote
Portmap directly invokes the procedure.

RPCGEN:  RPCGEN is a tool that generates C code to implement an RPC
protocol. The input to RPCGEN is a file written in a language similar to C, 
known as the RPC language. Assuming that an input file named proto.x is used, 
RPCGEN produces the following output files:

* A header file called proto.h that contains common definitions of constants 
  and macros
* Client stub source file, protoc.c
* Server stub source file, protos.c
* XDR routines source file, protox.c

-- Windows Sockets Version 2 (Winsock V2.0)

Winsock V2.0 is a network programming interface. It is basically a version 
of Berkeley Sockets adapted for Microsoft Windows operating systems with more
functions and enhancements. The previous version of the Winsock API, Windows
Sockets V1.1, is widely implemented. Therefore, Winsock V2.0 retains 
backwards compatibility with Winsock V1.1 but provides many more functions.
One of the most significant aspects of Winsock V2.0 is that it provides a 
protocol-independent transport interface supporting various networking
capabilities. Besides, Winsock V2.0 also supports the coexistence of multiple
protocol stacks. The new functions of Winsock V2.0 can be summarized as
follows:

* Support for multiple protocols
* Protocol-independent name resolution
* Quality of Service
* Protocol-independent multicast and multipoint
* Overlapped I/O and event objects
  - Socket sharing
* Layered service providers

The Winsock V1.1 architecture permits only one Dynamic Link Library (DLL),
WINSOCK.DLL or WSOCK32.DLL, on a system at a time, which provides the
Winsock API with a way to communicate with an underlying transport protocol.

This approach restricts the use of different types of Winsock 
implementations in conjunction with Winsock V1.1. For systems that have more
than one network interface, this can become a hindrance. Winsock V2.0 provides
a better solution to this problem. The new Winsock V2.0 architecture allows
for simultaneous support of multiple protocol stacks, interfaces, and service
providers.

-- SNMP Distributed Programming Interface (SNMP DPI)

SNMP defines a protocol that permits operations on a collection of variables.
This set of variables (MIB) and a core set of variables have previously been
defined.

However, the design of the MIB makes provision for extension of this core set.

Unfortunately, conventional SNMP agent implementations provide no means for 
an end user to make new variables available. The SNMP DPI addresses this issue
by providing a light-weight mechanism that permits end users to dynamically 
add, delete, or replace management variables in the local MIB without
requiring recompilation of the SNMP agent. This is achieved by writing the
so-called subagent that communicates with the agent via the SNMP DPI. It is
described in RFC 1592.

The SNMP DPI allows a process to register the existence of a MIB variable with
the SNMP agent. When requests for the variable are received by the SNMP agent,
it will pass the query on to the process acting as a subagent. This subagent
then returns an appropriate answer to the SNMP agent. The SNMP agent
eventually packages an SNMP response packet and sends the answer back to the
remote network management station that initiated the request. None of the
remote network management stations have any knowledge that the SNMP agent
calls on other processes to obtain an answer.

Communication between the SNMP agent and its clients (subagents) takes place
over a stream connection. This is typically a TCP connection, but other
stream-oriented transport mechanisms can be used. (As an example, the VM
SNMP agent allows DPI connections over IUCV.)

The SNMP Agent DPI can:

* Create and delete subtrees in the MIB
* Create a register request packet for the subagent to inform the SNMP agent
* Create response packet for the subagent to answer the SNMP agent's request
* Create a TRAP request packet.

The following figure shows the flow between an SNMP agent and a subagent.

* The SNMP agent communicates with the SNMP manager via the SNMP
  protocol.

* The SNMP agent communicates with some statically linked-in instrumentation
  (potentially for the MIB II), which in turn talks to the TCP/IP layers and 
  kernel (operating system) in an implementation-dependent manner.

* An SNMP sub-agent, running as a separate process (potentially on another
  machine), can set up a connection with the agent. The sub-agent has an
  option to communicate with the SNMP agent through UDP or TCP sockets, or
  even through other mechanisms.

* Once the connection is established, the sub-agent issues a DPI OPEN and 
  one or more REGISTER requests to register one or more MIB subtrees with the
  SNMP agent.

* The SNMP agent responds to DPI OPEN and REGISTER requests with a
  RESPONSE packet, indicating success or failure.

* The SNMP agent will decode SNMP packets. If such a packet contains a Get
  or GetNext request for an object in a subtree registered by a sub-agent, it
  sends a corresponding DPI packet to the sub-agent. If the request is for a
  GetBulk, then the agent translates it into multiple DPI GETNEXT packets and
  sends those to the sub-agent. However, the sub-agent can request (in the
  REGISTER packet) that a GETBULK be passed to the sub-agent. If the
  request is for a Set, then the agent uses a 2-phase commit scheme and sends
  the sub-agent a sequence of SET/COMMIT, SET/UNDO or
  SET/COMMIT/UNDO DPI packets.

* The SNMP sub-agent sends responses back via a RESPONSE packet.

* The SNMP agent then encodes the reply into an SNMP packet and sends it
  back to the requesting SNMP manager.

* If the sub-agent wants to report an important state change, it sends a DPI
  TRAP packet to the SNMP agent which will encode it into an SNMP trap
  packet and send it to the manager(s).

* If the sub-agent wants to stop operations, it sends a DPI UNREGISTER and a
  DPI CLOSE packet to the agent. The agent sends a response to an
  UNREGISTER request.

* There is no RESPONSE to a CLOSE; the agent just closes the DPI connection.
  A CLOSE implies an UNREGISTER for all registrations that exist for the DPI
  connection being CLOSED.

* An agent can send DPI UNREGISTER (if a higher priority registration comes in
  or for other reasons) to the sub-agent. The sub-agent then responds with a
  DPI RESPONSE packet.

* An agent can also (for whatever reason) send a DPI CLOSE to indicate it is
  terminating the DPI connection.

* A sub-agent can send an ARE_YOU_THERE to verify that the connection is
  still open. If so, the agent sends a RESPONSE with no error, otherwise, it
  may send a RESPONSE with an error.

-- FTP API

The file transfer protocol (FTP) API is supplied as part of TCP/IP for OS/2. 
It allows applications to have a client interface for file transfer. 
Applications written to this interface can communicate with multiple FTP
servers at the same time.
It allows up to 256 simultaneous connections and enables third-party proxy 
transfers between pairs of FTP servers. Consecutive third-party transfers are
allowed between any sequence of pairs of FTP servers. An example of such an 
application is FTPPM.

The FTP API tracks the servers to which an application is currently 
connected.

When a new request for FTP service is requested, the API checks whether a
connection to the server exists and establishes one if it does not exist. If 
the server has dropped the connection since last use, the API re-establishes
it.

Note:  The FTP API is not re-entrant. In a multithreaded program, the access 
to the APIs must be serialized. For example, without serialization, the
program may fail if it has two threads running concurrently and each thread
has its own connection to a server.

-- CICS Socket Interface

Customer Information Control System (CICS) is a high-performance
transaction-processing system. It was developed by IBM and has product
implementations in MVS/ESA, MVS, VSE, OS/400, OS/2 and AIX/6000.

CICS is the most widely used Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system in
the marketplace today. It provides a rich set of CICS  command level APIs to
the application transaction programs for data communications (using SNA) and
database (using VSAM, IMS or DB2).

Given the need for interoperability among heterogeneous network protocols, 
there is a requirement to enhance the CICS data communications interface to 
include support for TCP/IP in addition to SNA. The  IBM Sockets Interface for
CICS is a first step towards addressing this requirement.

[ I am actually hoping to write a text on this next month, this is due to 
attending courses detailing this - Slider ]

-- IMS Socket Interface

The IMS socket interface is implemented in TCP/IP for OS/390 V2R5.
The IMS to TCP/IP sockets interface allows you to develop IMS message
processing programs that can conduct a conversation with peer programs in
other TCP/IP hosts. The applications can be either client or server
applications. The IMS to TCP/IP sockets interface includes socket interfaces
for IBM C/370, assembler language, COBOL, and PL/I languages to use datagram
(connectionless) and stream (connection-oriented) sockets. It also provides
ASCII-EBCDIC conversion routines, an ASSIST module that permits the use of
conventional IMS calls for TCP/IP communications, and a Listener function to
listen for and accept connection requests and start the appropriate IMS
transaction to service those requests.

-- Sockets Extended

The Sockets Extended information described here is related to the
implementation in MVS only.

Sockets Extended provides programmers writing in assembler language, COBOL,
or PL/I with an application program interface that may be used to conduct
peer-to-peer conversations with other hosts in the TCP/IP networks. You can
develop applications for TSO, batch, CICS, or IMS using this API. The 
applications may be designed to be reentrant and multithreaded depending upon
the application requirements. Typically server applications will be
multithreaded while client applications might not be.

-- REXX Sockets

REXX sockets allow you to develop REXX applications that communicate over a
TCP/IP network. Calls are provided to initialize sockets, exchange data via 
sockets, perform management activities, and close the sockets.

The REXX Socket APIs are implemented in TCP/IP for MVS and OS/2.

Thats about it for a v. basic text on how API's work.

**********************************************
Windows 2000 File System Encryption - Kermit23
**********************************************

Windows 2000, or more specifically NTFS 5.0 feature EFS, Encrypted File 
System. It's uses the code behind MS's CryptoAPI, which should allow for good
clean crypto fun, though appears to be essentially underdeveloped in the
first release of Windows 2000. I haven't had chance to take a look at the
brand spanking new SP1, yet, so this may have changed.

- Where in the world is EFS.

EFS is built into the kernel, and integrated with NTFS 5, which should make 
for speedy use, on my celery 333, 192 megs ram it took about 1-1½ minutes to 
encrypt a 3.8 meg directory, and there was no perceptable access time hit. One
of the strengths of EFS is also one of it's most annoying features. The EFS
driver is closest to the file system running on top (basically) of NTFS. It
communicates with the kernel IO manager, and the EFS service (part of the
security services natch) outside of the kernel. The EFS service deals with
all the key management duties (the system using public key encryption, see
below).

The ESF driver also communicates with NTFS thorough the EFS File System Run 
Time Library (FSRTL). This packages and implements all the NTFS calls needed,
guarenteeing that NTFS, and hence it's permission system, is used at all 
times, in addition to the protection used by EFS. In fact, NTFS callouts are
used exclusively for communication between the EFS driver and the FSRTL. All
the encryption keys are stored in the non paged pool, and hence not written
to disk.

This means that encrypted files can be messed about with in just about 
anyway and remain encrypted as all the move, copy and other calls and
captured and dealt with by EFS, as long as the volume they are being, for
example, moved to is also NTFS 5.0. This also works copying across networks,
though the file will not be exactly the same as on the original machine, as a
new key will be used on the new machine.

This is also a pretty hard to avoid weakness, as if the file is copied to a 
non NTFS 5 volume, it was be stored unencrypted, as the user never gets to
manipulate the encrypted version of the file. The same problem is 
experienced if a program makes a temp copy of a file on a non NTFS 5 volume.

I am fairly sure that in any procedure it is the EFS service that does the 
check of the certificate (of the public key), if it is invalid denying the
user the ability ot encrypt files. Decryption continues as long as the user
has a valid private key.

- Using EFS.

Either when the user is created or when EFS is first used (I am not sure 
about this), a key pair is generated and signed by the signing authority (if
one's about) or self signed if not.  The advanced button on the general tab
in the properties of an directory or file gives a nice little checkbox which
allows you to encrypt or decrypt files (the decrypt on a permenant basis
obviously, general use decryption being done automatically). There is also a
CLI program cipher which can do the same thing.

NB There was talk of disabling the file option in the EFS whitepaper, so 
some betas of win2k may not have it, if you are still using one.

- Encryption Technologies.

EFS falls down in a pretty significant way with the strength of the 
encryption. The basic method is 128 bit DESX, but there is no way to change
the strength or the algorithm, though this may appear in future version and
is supported by the CryptoAPI. The unfortunate thing however is that fact
that all the intl. beta's and possibly the intl. release versions of Windows
2000 were released with only 40 bit support (padded to 128 bit). This is
seriously rubbish, but hopefully should be improved with a service pack now
the crypto regulations in the US have been relaxed.

Coupled with this is RSA. The public key is used to encrypt the DES file key
(MS-speak: FEK, File Encryption Key), and a list of all the FEK's is stored 
in a file atribute called the Data Decryption Field (DDF, shockingly). The 
private part of the key has the potential to be stored anywhere including a
smart card (very cool), though is usually kept in the CryptoAPI's "software
based protected store".

The FEK is then also encrypted with a number (though not necessarily any, if 
you don't want to) of encryption keys from the recovery agent, from their
X509 v3 certificate which is stored in the EDRA (Encrypted Data Recovery
Agent). A list of these keys are stored in another file atribute the Data
Recovery Field (DRF). The private portions of these keys (incidentally) are
supposed to be stored ina safe place as they are anticipated to be rarely
used.

If files are copied or moved, the temporary file is also encrypted while
attributes are transferred.

- Data Recovery

It is necessary to have a Data Recovery policy set up as a group policy as 
EFS will not encrypt anything without it. The policy is simply any number (or 
none) X509 certificates with a File Recovery key usage. Since these are
machine wide, the lowest level of policy is per computer. The administrator
is a recovery agent (holder of a recovery private key) by default. For a #
policy defined over a group of computers, if the policy is 0 keys, EFS cannot
be used, however if there is no policy, EFS can be used on individual
computers if set up with policies on each machine. If a recovery agents
certificate becomes invalid no further files can be encrypted,  though
decryption continues as normal.

- Weakness.

As I mentioned earlier, there is a problem with copying to a non NTFS 5 
volume. Interestingly the white paper mentions that while cut and paste will
retain file encryption drag and drop will not. Though this may have been true
in the beta stages, it has definitely been fixed on the release, and files
will remain encrypted. However, knowing Microsoft it may be worth checking
various releases in case the problem was "missed".

System files cannot be encrypted, and EFS will refuse to do so. The reason 
for this is that the private key is not loaded until log in, and therefore 
cannot be used to decrypt files which would probably be esential for boot.
This applies to any file marked as a system file.

On the default set up the private key is loaded automatically, so the 
encryption is still down to a password, which is obviously a lot weaker than
the random keys (depending on the randomness of the generator, though this is
almost certainly still true). However, the private key does not have to be
stored in this fashion, though I would suspect that in most cases, and almost
all home use situations, the key will be stored in the default software cache.
I do not know how secure the software cache is, as this could be another
vunerability.

Similar to this is the way EFS protects against crashes and disk full 
errors, by writing a plaintext version of the file to the disk before
encryption, then deleting it once the write is confirmed. A crash or software
interruption at the right time could leave a plaintext version of the file
open to be grabbed by traditional techniques for avoiding NTFS user
attributes.

In the specifications, there is potential for encrypted files to be shared
between various sets of users. This has not been implemented for the release
version of Win2k, though has been promised for later version. The main 
reason for this is another weakness in the system, the fact that many "legacy"
(ie not released tomorrow) applications do not support EFS in certain key
features. This means that EFS and the CryptoAPI is not being used to it's
full potential. Even when more EFS aware application exist, there may, and
almost certainly will, be potential for penetration of the encryption by
using software that does not take account of the encryption.

While the CryptoAPI  in itself is ready to be used, other key features like 
back up and recovery are not finalised, or at least in any easily accessable
specification. This means programmers are less likely to implement various
features, and hence increase the time untill EFS can be used fully, and the
chances of finding some way of breaking it via the old implementation.

Finally, the Indexing Service index's the contents of a file for faster
searching. Though this can be tuned with relation to what should be indexed, 
or disabled on a per file basis, in many cases I suspect this will not be
used, leaving potentially valuable information in an easily accessable place.

Incidentally, there was a NT/Bugtraq post recently regarding encrypting the
autoexec.bat to cause the system not to hang when it tried to read it. This
would require access to the file, and if you have that access the same trick
could be applied to several other system files. The weakness comes from the 
fact that the file is writable by Power Users, while the other system files
are admin and SYSTEM only. There are several ways of avoiding this problem, 
including setting system on autoexec.bat, and ignoring autoexec completely on
boot

(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
 \ParseAutoexec= 0),

but this problem should really be dealt with by having a properly configured
EFS policy, and users with properly set up access restrictions.

**********************************************
The Andrew File System (AFS) - Slider
**********************************************

This is a small short text on AFS and a v. v. brief overview of its use.

The Andrew File System (AFS) is a distributed file system used in non-DCE
environments. DCE DFS was based upon AFS, and the two file systems are
similar in architecture.

The latest version (AFS 3) has the following attributes:

* Single logical shared namespace

Every AFS user shares the same uniform name space. File names are
independent of both the user's and the file's physical locations. Groups
of client and server machines are known as cells.

* Client caching

Data is cached on client machines to reduce subsequent data requests
directed at file servers, which reduces network and server loads.
Servers keep track of client caches through callbacks, guaranteeing
cache consistency without constant queries to the server to see if the
file has changed.

RPCs AFS uses its remote procedure call (RPC) reads and writes for efficient
data transfer across the network.

Security Kerberos-based authentication requires that users prove their 
identities before accessing network services. Once authenticated, AFS access
control lists (ACLs) give individual users or groups of users varying
levels of authority to perform operations on the files in a directory.

-- Replication

Replication techniques are used for file system reliability. Multiple
copies of applications and data may be replicated on multiple file
servers within a cell. When accessing this information, a client will
choose among the available servers. Replication also reduces the load
on any particular server by placing frequently accessed information on
multiple servers.

-- Management Utilities

Backup, reconfiguration and routine maintenance are all done without
any system down time, files remain available to users during these
operations. This is done by creating online clones of volumes (subsets
of related files).

AFS commands are RPC-based. Administrative commands can be
issued by any authenticated administrator from any client workstation.
System databases track file locations, authentication information and
access control lists. These databases are replicated on multiple
servers, and are dynamically updated as information changes.

Multiprotocol Transport Network (MPTN) - Slider
**********************************************

Multiprotocol transport networking (MPTN), developed by IBM, is an open
architecture for:

* Mixed-protocol networking: running applications associated with one 
  network protocol over different network protocols
* Network concatenation: connection matching applications across networks of
  different protocols through gateways

- Requirements for Mixed-Protocol Networking

With the growth of networking in general and local area networks in
particular, many large customer networks have become confederations of
individual networks running different networking protocols. This heterogeneity
has arisen for a number of reasons. Some of these include:

* Shift of customer interest away from selecting a particular networking
  architecture in favor of finding solutions to business problems, regardless
  of the specific network protocol required
* Inter-enterprise information exchange requirement, for example, direct
  manufacturing, order placement, or billing systems
* Company mergers requiring interconnection

- MPTN Architecture

Networking protocols generally provide three types of functions:

* Transport
* Naming and addressing
* Higher level functions

Transport functions are those that provide the basic facility for two partners
to communicate, either through connections or in a connectionless manner 
through datagrams. Naming and addressing conventions define how entities are
known and how they are to be found. The higher level functions include
allocation of the connections to users and control of their use. Not all
networking protocols support higher level functions. SNA and OSI do; TCP/IP
and NetBIOS do not.

MPTN separates transport functions from higher level functions and from the
address formats as seen by the users of the protocol. Its goal is to allow 
any higher level protocol using the corresponding address structure to run
over any transport function. The division of functions between transport and
higher level was chosen because the transport level is the highest level at
which there are common functions that can be reasonably mapped across
protocols. At other levels the number of services is either too large or too
small to provide a practical division.

- MPTN Methodology

MPTN architecture solves the above requirements by defining a new canonical
interface to a set of transport services that concatenate connections across 
multiple networking protocols. When an application is written for a particular
transport service, it may be written so that it makes assumptions about the
particular transport service. Thus it may appear to be transport-specific in
the services that it uses. For example, applications written to the NetBEUI
interface may request a message be broadcast. In environments where a
particular service is not natively supported over the underlying transport
network, MPTN provides compensation. In essence though, MPTN frees up
applications so that they are able to operate over different transport
networks.

Another way of thinking about this is that (in the OSI model) functions from 
the session layer up are users of transport services or transport users. These 
services are in turn provided by functions from the transport layer down. MPTN 
defines a boundary interface, called the transport-layer protocol boundary
(TLPB), which clearly delineates this distinction between transport user and
transport provider.

- MPTN Major Components

MPTN functions appear in four types of nodes:

* MPTN Access Node

An MPTN access node contains the transport-layer protocol boundary (TLPB),
which provides a semantic interface so that higher level protocols or 
application interfaces written for a particular transport protocol can be
transported over another protocol with no apparent change. Such a node can
run application programs independent of the underlying transport network and
can run application programs on different underlying transport networks.

The applications in the MPTN access node are generally written to an 
existing application programming interface (API). The API uses the functions
of the native communications protocol. When transport-level MPTN functions
are accessed, the API will be converted to access these functions instead of
the native communication protocol, while keeping the same interface to the
application program. For example, the NetBEUI application interface is written
to use the NetBIOS communications protocol. To use another protocol stack
below the transport layer, the NetBEUI API must be made to invoke the MPTN
functions. After this is done, all programs using NetBEUI on this MPTN access
node can communicate via, for example, SNA, TCP/IP, OSI and other
protocols, with another NetBEUI application within the MPTN network. All this
is possible without the original application program requiring any change.

* MPTN Address Mapping Server Node

An address mapping server node is an MPTN node with a special function that
provides a general address mapping service to the address mapping client
component of other MPTN nodes, access or gateway, connected to the same
transport provider network.

* MPTN Multicast Server Node
A multicast server node is an MPTN node with a special function, the multicast
server, which manages multicast and broadcast distribution of datagrams in
networks that do not provide the service as a natural consequence of their
design. For example, a NetBIOS transport network is designed to support
multicast distribution of datagrams while an SNA network is not. The multicast
server operates in cooperation with the address mapping server to provide a
multicast service where this capability does not exist within the services 
offered by the transport network.

* MPTN Gateway Node

An MPTN gateway connects two transport networks to provide an end-to-end
service over both of them for one or more transport user protocols. There 
are two types of gateways, nonnative-to-nonnative, with respect to the
supported transport user protocol, and native-to-nonnative, with respect to
the supported transport user protocol.

In the case of nonnative-to-native one of the transport providers connected 
to the gateway node is native to the transport user. This type of gateway 
allows access to an end node that has no MPTN function. When one side is
native, the MPTN protocol (of the nonnative side) terminates in the gateway.

NMAPNT FROM EEYE DIGITAL SECURITY
"nmap has various options to perform stealth scans, ping scans, UDP
scans, as well as a whole handful of other scan types. nmap also has
the ability to remotely fingerprint an IP address. Basically what that
means is by sending various queries to a remote IP address, and reading
the responses, nmap can determine if the remote IP address is running
a certain operating system or maybe it is a router or network printer.
Infact, nmap's datebase of fingerprints has over 500 unique finger prints
in it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCEL 2000 VULNERABILITY - EXECUTING PROGRAMS
Excel 2000/Windows 98 (suppose other versions are also vulnerable, have not
tested) allows executing programs when opening an Excel Workbook (.xls 
file). This may be also be exploited thru IE or Outlook. This may lead to
taking full control over user's computer.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357077,83705,.shtml


APACHE::ASP HOLE FIXED
Apache::ASP  had a security hole in its ./site/eg/source.asp distribution
examples file, allowing a malicious hacker to potentially write to files in 
the directory local to the source.asp example script.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357248,90975,.shtml


BIG BROTHER VULNERABILITY
The problem exists in the code where $HOSTSVC does not do authenticity
checking for its assigned variable. All files could be snatched just with a
browser.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963357356,65475,.shtml


NETSCAPE ADMINISTRATION SERVER PASSWORD DISCLOSURE
The administration server is installed when you first install SuiteSpot 
server.
For remote logon, it authenticates by validating the password prompt input
with the administration server password file. This password file is kept in
a local directory within the SuiteSpot server.

FEARTECH FTP BROWSER PROBLEM
FTP Browser allows you to display a html enhanced directory listing, which
is great for managing your ftp files. FTP Browser can also be used for
downloading password files.

"ABSENT DIRECTORY BROWSER ARGUMENT" PROBLEM PATCHED
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates two security vulnerabilities
in Microsoft Internet Information Server. In sum, the vulnerabilities could
allow a malicious user to stop the web server from providing useful service,
or to extract certain types of information from it.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963664473,69872,.shtml


"THE IE SCRIPT" VULNERABILITY PATCHED
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability
in Microsoft Office 2000 (Excel and PowerPoint) and in PowerPoint 97.
Microsoft has also documented a workaround that prevents the use of
Microsoft Access to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer. A patch
for the latter vulnerability will be available soon and we will have an
update to this bulletin.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/963664619,71371,.shtml


[MANDRAKE] CVSWEB UPDATE
Cvsweb contains a hole that provides attackers who have write access
to a cvs repository with shell access. Thus, attackers who have write
access to a cvs repository but not shell access can obtain a shell. In
addition, anyone with write access to a cvs repository that is viewable
with cvsweb can get access to whatever user the cvsweb cgi script
runs as (typically nobody or www-data, etc.). This update closes all
of these possibly exploited pipe-opens.

WE'RE STILL GETTING SECURITY WRONG
Worries about security, and justified ones at that, could still stop the
eCommerce bandwagon in its tracks, it seems. The recent revelation of a
security loophole in MS Outlook has been followed by a report from IDC
asserting that corporate Europe is still adopting the wrong approach to
strengthening the security of its systems.

EVALUATION TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STANDARD
The international standard serves as a framework for establishing system
reliability by a product's functions, quality, operation and management. More
specifically, the standard prescribes requirements for the functioning and
quality of the security component that systems must meet to prevent intrusion
and unauthorized access.

BRITISH VERSION OF CARNIVORE IS NOW LAW
The British government approved the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP)
that allows British law-enforcement agencies to force ISPs to hand over 'Net
traffic logs and encrypted e-mail messages, along with the decryption keys
needed to read their content. ISPs will have to set up secure channels to the
government's monitoring center and to install "black boxes" that will do the
tracking if the government issues a notice and has a warrant asking the ISP
to do so.

DEFCON
Defcon has always been an event known as much for its intensive technical
content - talks on "advanced buffer overflow techniques" are de rigueur - as
its social opportunities, but this year it seems to have become more party 
than conference. Call it the new American geek holiday.

Security issues
---------------

All vulnerabilities are located at:
http://net-security.org/text/bugs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VULNERABILITY IN NETSCAPE BROWSERS
This advisory explains a vulnerability in Netscape browsers present since at
least version 3.0 and up to Netscape 4.73 and Mozilla M15. The vulnerability
is fixed in Netscape 4.74 and Mozilla M16.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964528232,40698,.shtml


IBM WEBSPHERE VULNERABILITY
A show code vulnerability exists with IBM's Websphere allowing an attacker
to view the source code of any file within the web document root of the
web server.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964528397,78068,.shtml


ANALOGX PROXY DOS
AnalogX Proxy is a simple but effective proxy server that has the ability
to proxy requests for the following services: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4,
SOCKS4a, SOCKS5, NNTP, POP3, SMTP, FTP. Using commands of an
appropriate length, many of the services exhibit unchecked buffers causing
the proxy server to crash with an invalid page fault thus creating a denial
of service. Normally this would only be a concern for users on the LAN side
of the proxy, but by default Proxy is configured to bind to all interfaces 
on the host and so this would be exploitable remotely from over the Internet.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964577654,52746,.shtml


PATCH FOR "NETBIOS NAME SERVER PROTOCOL SPOOFING"
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in
a protocol implemented in Microsoft  Windows systems. It could be used
to cause a machine to refuse to respond to requests for service.
Link: http://www.net-security.org/text/bugs/964789771,23452,.shtml


BEA'S WEBLOGIC SHOW CODE VULNERABILITY
Two show code vulnerabilities exist with BEA's WebLogic 5.1.0 allowing
an attacker to view the source code of any file within the web document
root of the web server. Depending on web application and directory
structure attacker can access and view unauthorized files.

BROWN ORIFICE SECURITY HOLE
From Dan Brumleve homepage - "I've discovered a pair of new capbilities in
Java, one residing in the Java core and the other in Netscape's Java
distribution.
The first (exploited in BOServerSocket and BOSocket) allows Java to open a
server which can be accessed by arbitrary clients. The second 
(BOURLConnection
and BOURLInputStream) allows Java to access arbitrary URLs, including local
files.
As a demonstration, I've written Brown Orifice HTTPD for Netscape 
Communicator.
BOHTTPD is a browser-resident web server and file-sharing tool that 
demonstrates
these two problems in Netscape Communicator. BOHTTPD will serve files from a
