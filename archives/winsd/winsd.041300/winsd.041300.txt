April 12, 2000 - Vanja Hrustic reported a problem with IIS 4.0 and 5.0 
that could allow minor temporary denial of service attacks to be launched
against its Web services. By sending IIS a specially coded URL that 
contains an excessive number of escape characters, the service is caused
to perform more work than necessary, which can temporarily reduce 
available processor cycles. 
   The Microsoft has released a patches for IIS as well as a FAQ. An 
associated Support Online was not avialable at the time of this writing.
