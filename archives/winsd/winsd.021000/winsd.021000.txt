1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

Distributed computing is a powerful tool. And although distributed
computing isn't new in the mainframe world, it is new in the PC arena
when it comes to low-end applications. One of the more popular means of
distributed processing is a methodology where individual PCs work
together to process data from a centralized database. This approach
spreads the processing load over numerous machines instead of one
machine with several CPUs. The methodology quickens the overall
processing time because no one machine or CPU has to process all the
data.
   Distributed.net helped popularize this technique on PCs by
developing software to crack encryption keys. Distributed.net hosts
various encryption-cracking contests, such as the current RC5 challenge
(see http://www.distributed.net for details). In a nutshell, the
company's key-cracking software can run on any number of individual
PCs; the software pulls a data set from a central database, processes
that data on the local PC, and sends the results back to the central
database-processing center.
   Black hat computer users have taken an interest in distributed
processing. Why? Distributed processing lets these black hats take down
a giant network with relative ease. They can muster the bandwidth and
processing resources of numerous networks to launch an attack against
another network or machine. In most instances, the attack quickly
overpowers the network or machine, knocking the network or machine out
of service because it can't handle the overwhelming processor and
bandwidth loads.
   Without distributed processing, denying service to a remote network
would be incredibly tough in most cases. You'd either have to know of a
software bug that eats all available CPU cycles on the target machine,
or you'd have to have more bandwidth and processing power than the
target network. But with distributed denial of service (DoS) attack
techniques, those factors have become moot.
   When I turned on the news this morning, I saw a headline story that
informed me Yahoo's site was down because of a massive DoS attack. I
was amazed that a DoS attack made national headline news. I was even
more amazed that people think that a DoS attack is news in the first
place.
   DoS attacks are as old as computers. The only thing new about the
attack against Yahoo is that the attack successfully took down Yahoo's
network, which has mammoth amounts of bandwidth and processing power.
At the height of the attack, Yahoo received more than 1GBps of traffic.
That's a huge amount of traffic by any standard. In all probability,
the attack was a distributed attack because of the amount of bandwidth
involved.
   So, how do you prevent this type of distributed attack? In most
cases, it's incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to defend against
distributed DoS attacks. Today's hardware and software are not equipped
to fend off such attacks. Although some firewall systems and back-end
services can prevent a few types of well-known DoS attacks, they have
not proven they can stand up against even a lightweight distributed
attack.
   The problem appears to be manifold. New developments must address
all aspects of networking--from the network border hardware to the
back-end applications--to prevent outages before we can fend off such
attacks. Servers need faster processors in greater numbers,
applications need better user-session filtering, and network hardware
needs faster CPUs and improvements to the software code base.
   Until these developments happen, networks are easy targets. But even
with improved hardware and software, DoS attacks will still boil down
to a war of bandwidth, where the person with the most bandwidth almost
always wins. And, with distributed processing attack methods, pipe size
has no upper limit for the intruder.
   I don't see a definitive solution for preventing distributed DoS
attacks in our near future. I do see that cyber-terrorism has, in fact,
arrived, and it's riding on the coattails of distributed processing.
Until next time, have a great week.

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* RDISK RACE CONDITION: UPDATE
As you know, Microsoft recently released a patch for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition (TSE) because of a problem with the RDISK
utility. RDISK helps users create an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) to
record machine state information as a contingency against system
failure.
   According to Microsoft's bulletin, during execution, RDISK creates a
temporary file containing an enumeration of the Registry. The ACLs on
the file allow global read permission, and as a result, a malicious
user who knows that the administrator is running RDISK can open the
file and read the Registry information during its creation. RDISK
erases the file after completion, so under normal conditions no lasting
vulnerability exists.
   Microsoft rereleased its bulletin because the utility is part of all
versions of Windows NT 4.0, and the vulnerability exists on each NT 4.0
platform. Patches are now available for all affected versions.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/rdisk1.htm

* BYPASS SURFCONTROL URL BLOCKING
surfControl Scout software blocks access to specified URLs. However, by
appending a period to the end of a URL, a malicious user can still
access a blocked URL, thereby bypassing the rules defined in the
surfScout application. For example, if an administrator used
surfControl Scout to block the site http://www.xyzzy.com, then
surfControl Scout will allow access to http://www.xyzzy.com.
   A patch is now available for surfControl that upgrades versions
2.1.6.x to version 2.6.1.7. In addition, a complete version 2.6.1.7
package is available for download.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/surfcntrl1.htm

* WWWTHREADS ELEVATES PRIVILEGES
WWWThreads is a Perl-based message-forum software that runs against a
SQL server back end, such as Microsoft SQL Server or mySQL. According
to a user identified as rain.forrest.puppy, an intruder can elevate a
message-board user's privileges to board Administrator within the
message-forum software. (Note: this is not the same as Administrator
access on Windows NT.) The vendor, WCSoft, has released an updated
version that corrects the vulnerability.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/wwwt1.htm

* WEB SERVER SCRIPTING ISSUES
The CERT Coordination Center published an advisory warning users of
potentially malicious Web-based scripts that can instigate a man-in-
the-middle attack, session-recording, desktop and local LAN
manipulation, and other unwanted actions. (The CERT Coordination Center
is part of the Survivable Systems Initiative at the Software
Engineering Institute, a federally funded research and development
center at Carnegie Mellon University.) CERT jointly published an
advisory with the Department of Defense (DoD)-CERT, the DoD Joint Task
Force for Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND), the Federal Computer
Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC), and the National Infrastructure
Protection Center (NIPC).
   According to the advisory, "A Web site may inadvertently include
malicious HTML tags or script in a dynamically generated page based on
invalidated input from untrustworthy sources. This can be a problem
when a Web server does not adequately ensure that generated pages are
properly encoded to prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when
input is not validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented
to the user."
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/webapps1.htm

* MICROSOFT JAVA EXPOSES FILES
Several developers in Japan jointly discovered and reported a security
problem with Microsoft's Java implementation. The problem lets an
intruder who knows the complete path to a file read that file without
the user's permission. The problem affects Internet Explorer (IE) 4.x
and 5.x users. Microsoft is aware of the problem but has issued no
response at the time of this writing.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/java3.htm

* WINDOWS NT RECYCLE BIN GOES UNCHECKED
Arne Vidstrom and Nubuo Miwa discovered a problem with Windows NT's
Recycle Bin that might let a malicious user manipulate any contained
files without the file owner's knowledge. The problem exists because of
the permission settings on the Recycle Bin directory. Microsoft issued
a patch, FAQ, and Support Online article Q248339 regarding the matter.

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: WINDOWS NT 4.0 IS C2 COMPLIANT--WINDOWS 2000 COMPLIANCE STILL 2
YEARS OUT
Windows NT 4.0 recently received its C2-level security compliance
certification; however, Service Pack 6 (SP6) and all the latest service
packs must be installed to meet that rating. Companies that need C2-
level security compliance in their environments won't be able to use
Microsoft's Windows 2000 (Win2K) until at least 2002, which is how long
it will take for the new OS to pass the required tests.
   The US government dictates C2-level security specifications under
its Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, and to date, NT 4.0
and 3.5 are Microsoft's only OSs that qualify.
   Win2K does, however, meet the federal government's FIPS 140-1
specification for encryption technology. Win2K meets FIPS 140-1 because
it relies on Microsoft's CryptoAPI, which Microsoft developed and
released on platforms prior to Win2K.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=209&TB=news

* NEWS: FBI AND CERT WARN AGAINST WEB-BASED SCRIPTING
The FBI and several software manufacturers are warning users of
potential risks involved with seemingly harmless Web site surfing. CERT
released an advisory on Tuesday to help make people aware of readily
exploitable cross-site scripting risks.
   Although some security aficionados point out that problems of this
nature have been known for some time, the problems remain widespread
mostly due to vendor product development cycles that don't address
issues that CERT cites in its advisory.

5. ========== NEW AND IMPROVED ==========
(contributed by Judy Drennen, products@win2000mag.com)

* IBM PCs GUARD CRITICAL DATA WITH WINDOWS 2000 SECURITY
IBM announced that new PCs--IBM PC 300PL, IBM IntelliStation E Pro, and
the IBM IntelliStation M Pro--will come preloaded with Windows 2000
(Win2K) and the industry's first embedded security chip. IBM is working

* TIP: ADJUST EVENT LOG SETTINGS REMOTELY
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

A reader wrote to ask how to remotely manipulate Registry keys.
Specifically, the person wanted to adjust the keys that govern Event
Log size and the keys that govern whether log entries are overwritten
when the log becomes full.
   You can adjust the log setting parameters for a remote machine using
Event Viewer if you have proper access to that remote machine. But
using Event Viewer to adjust parameters on numerous machines can be
time-consuming, so using an automation tool might be a better solution.
To use an automation tool, you must know what keys to adjust and values
to set.
   You can remotely manipulate any Registry key's setting provided you
meet two criteria: You must have some type of remote Registry access to
the machine you want to manipulate and you must know which Registry
keys you wish to adjust.
   Step one in hacking most any setting in the Registry is to determine
where the appropriate Registry keys are located. To learn this
information, use a tool such as System Internals' RegMon. RegMon
watches all Registry access and reports its findings in an easy-to-read
display. I can fire up RegMon, open and use the Event Viewer to set the
Log Settings parameters (under Log, Log Settings from the pull-down
menus), and refer back to RegMon to see which keys you adjusted.
   In this case, a quick review of RegMon revealed the Registry keys
that pertain to the Event Log settings are held in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog.
Under the EventLog tree you'll find the three entries that pertain to
each Event Log type: Application, System, and Security. Under each of
those keys you'll find two values, MaxSize and Retention, that regulate
log size and how the log is overwritten, respectively.
   To determine what values to set for these items, you need to conduct
trials using Windows NT's built-in Event Viewer to change the Log
Settings on your desktop. The trials reveal how NT records your
selected parameters in the Registry.
   For example, you'll notice when you use Event Viewer to set the Log
Settings to "Overwrite Events Older than 7 Days" with a log size of
2048KB, that the MaxSize value in the Registry will be 200000, and the
Retention value will be 0x93a80.
   After you establish the proper values, you can use those values to
automate the remote adjustment of Event Log's Registry entries on any
machine that requires such action.

7. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support).

January 28, 2000 08:31 AM
Move People with DHCP
I need to move a large group of people (about 500) to a new subnet that
has different IP addresses. We use NT DHCP to provide IP address for
users. I can release IPs for each Win98 and Win NT workstation manually
before it shuts down, but with 500 users it is going to take a long
time. Is there a way to let me force users to release when they shut
down their PCs automatically? I don't want to change lease duration
time in DHCP server because other users will stay there.
Thank you in advance.
