1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

Every day, intruders break into and deface Web sites. The methods these
crackers use are incredibly numerous. In most cases, someone failed to
establish adequate security controls, and an intruder was able to
penetrate the network. That assumption might seem obvious, but
malicious users can use methods to subvert a normally functioning
system without actually penetrating that system's security.
   One recent example is RSA Security. Intruders allegedly defaced the
company's Web site this past weekend. After reading the initial news
reports regarding the defacement, I was slightly startled. After all,
RSA Security is a big name in the security industry and should be able
to keep its networks reasonably secure. I wondered whether the report
was true. Did someone really deface the RSA Security Web site?
   As it turns out, the answer is yes and no. To me, a Web site
defacement means someone broke into a network, gained access to
relevant file systems, and modified the HTML for the site's home page.
The alleged defacement of RSA Security's Web site did not follow that
scenario. No one broke into RSA Security's network, no one penetrated
its security, and no one modified any of its Web server files. No one
actually cracked RSA Security's site at all.
   If no one defaced the site, what did happen? The answer is very old
and very simple: DNS hijacking. At least two forms of DNS hijacking can
occur on the Internet. One hijack attack involves spoofing DNS records,
and the other method involves taking over InterNIC database records.
   From the information available at the time of this writing, it
appears that intruders used the former method to spoof, not deface, RSA
Security's Web site. I use the word spoof because that's exactly how
the attack works: Someone creates a fake Web page and then redirects
traffic to that fake page by manipulating various DNS records. When
unsuspecting users see the spoofed Web page, they assume an intruder
cracked the real Web site. In reality, the site was not cracked at all.
   In the case of RSA Security's Web site hijack, someone diverted
traffic to a fake Web page after gaining access to an upstream DNS
server out of RSA Security's direct control. The intruder accessed the
DNS server and temporarily modified its DNS records so those queries
destined for RSA Security's Web site would divert to the fake RSA
Security Web site. It's that simple. People thought they had landed on
the real RSA Security site when, in fact, they simply landed on a
spoofed site at another IP address.
   If you understand basic DNS architecture, you can understand how
this attack could happen to any domain on the Internet. DNS record
spoofing is a trivial way to spoof a real Web site crack. And to make
matters worse for the hijacked site, the hijacking misleads people into
thinking intruders cracked the Web site at Company A, when intruders
actually cracked the DNS server at Company B. Company B usually goes
unmentioned in the flurry of press reports regarding the attack. If I
knew who Company B was in the RSA Security case, I'd report that
information to you, but I’ve been unable to obtain that company's name.
   The problem with these types of hijacking attacks is that in most
cases, administrators control only their DNS records. You can’t defend
against this type of Web site attack because you have little, if any,
control over upstream DNS records. All you can do is monitor your site
using third-party Web page integrity-checker tools and take action the
instant you suspect a traffic diversion.
   Defending against the second DNS hijack type is easy because of the
attack’s nature. In a nutshell, a malicious user can perform this type
of DNS hijack by creating fake mail accounts, spoofing valid mail
accounts, and flooding the inbox of the technical and administrative
contacts listed for a given domain. This attack is successful only if
you don't use authentication for your InterNIC records, or if you
disregard the flood of email you receive from an intruder that uses
this method of attack. In most cases, the flood of email looks like a
slew of InterNIC confirmation messages. The attack relies on the hope
that less-experienced administrators will mistake these messages for
some kind of mail error and simply delete them all instead of examining
each one.
   To protect your system against this second type of domain hijack,
modify your InterNIC domain records so that they require some level of
authentication before anyone can make changes. To learn how to add an
authentication requirement to your InterNIC records, review the tip in
the Security Toolkit section of this newsletter.

Until next time, have a great week!

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* TIMBUKTU PRO DENIAL OF SERVICE
Laurent Levier discovered a denial of service (DoS) condition in
Netopia's Timbuktu Pro software. By performing a specific series of
connections and disconnections, an intruder can cause the
authentication protocol to misbehave, thereby causing the software to
hang. Netopia is aware of the problem and is working on a fix.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/timbuk1.htm

* SNMP TRAP WATCHER DENIAL OF SERVICE
Paul Timmons reported that by sending a trap string of more than 306
characters to the SNMP Trap Watcher 1.16 monitoring system, an intruder
can crash the software. BTT Software has released an updated version of
the software that is not vulnerable to this attack.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/trap1.htm

* INTERNET ANYWHERE DENIAL OF SERVICE
Nubuo Miwa reported two problems with True North Software's Internet
Anywhere 3.1.3 mail server. By sending a specific string of characters
as the parameter of the RETR POP3 command, an intruder can crash the
server. In addition, if an intruder opens 3000 or more connections on
the SMTP port, the server will respond with an error reporting too many
connects. By establishing a second large set of connections (800 or
more) immediately after the first 3000 connections, the intruder can
crash the service. True North is working on a fix as of this writing.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/ia1.htm

* FIREWALL-1 ALLOWS UNAUTHORIZED TCP CONNECTIONS
John McDonald and Thomas Lopatic reported a problem with Checkpoint
Technologies' Firewall-1 software. According to the report, using
particular techniques, an intruder can trick the firewall into opening
TCP ports to an FTP server behind the firewall. Checkpoint is working
on a fix for the problem.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/fw1-1.htm

* MYSQL ALLOWS PASSWORD BYPASS
Robert van der Meulen/Emphyrio and Willem Pinckaers discovered a
vulnerability in MySQL Server that lets a remote user bypass password
checking. The problem is the result of faulty string checking. You can
download a patch at the following URL.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/mysql1.htm

* NOVELL GROUPWISE DENIAL OF SERVICE
Adam Gray discovered that by sending a specific URL to the Web Access
interface of a Novell GroupWise 5.5 server, a malicious user can crash
the server. Novell is aware of the problem and has issued a patch.
GroupWise users should install Service Pack 1 (SP1) for the GroupWise
Enhancement Pack, which is available from Novell's technical support.

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: RSA SECURITY SITE RANSACKED
Even top security firms occasionally fall prey to network intruders. A
recent case is RSA Security, whose Web site was hijacked on Saturday.
Intruders didn't change the home page, but instead diverted traffic to
a spoofed lookalike site. The give away that the site was spoofed was
the suffix added to the company's slogan: "The most trusted name in E-
commerce security has been owned." Intruders routinely use the term
"owned" to mean that they’ve broken into a site and might have left
backdoors. For a link to a copy of the spoofed RSA Security home page,
visit the URL below.

* NEWS: MICROSOFT OUTLINES NEW WINDOWS 2000 SECURITY STRATEGY
On January 18, Brian Valentine, Microsoft’s senior vice president in
charge of Windows 2000 (Win2K) and Windows 98, outlined Microsoft’s new
Win2K security strategy in an address at the RSA 2000 security
conference. Valentine announced that Win2K will ship worldwide with
128-bit encryption. He explained that Microsoft sees Win2K as a chance
to respond to the security crisis that the rise of the Internet has
created. Read the rest of C. Thi Nguyen's Web exclusive story for
Windows 2000 Magazine on our Web site.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=212&TB=news

* NEWS: WHY DENY READ ACCESS TO EXECUTABLE CONTENT?
Reader Jerry Walsh recently posted some interesting comments to the
Win2KSecAdvice mailing list. Walsh points out the need to secure Web
directories against unwanted actions. Case in point: ASP processing.
Many developers code their programs in pieces and place those pieces in
separate files for later inclusion in applications. This approach is a
fantastic way to make code portable and to avoid developing other
applications in the future. A programmer only needs to code an include
statement to use the portable code base.
   The concern is not the code or its processing, but how the server
stores the code. Read the rest of this Web exclusive for NTSecurity.net
on our Web site.

* TIP: PROTECT YOUR INTERNIC DNS RECORDS
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

Most people know that you can register a domain name by sending a form
to a domain name registrar such as Network Solutions. As you also know,
Network Solutions operates the InterNIC, which maintains the root DNS
server entries for several top-level domains such as the ever-popular
.com addresses. But did you know you can secure your domain's InterNIC
database records so that the system authenticates changes before
InterNIC acts on them?
   To add authentication to your InterNIC database records, fill out a
domain name change request form, which is available at the first URL
listed below. Pay attention to fields 0b and 0c because they're the
fields that enable authentication. You can select one of three
authentication schemes currently supported by Network Solutions: Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP), CRYPT-PW, or MAIL-FROM, in descending order of
security strength. The Web page located at the second URL below
explains these options in detail. Be sure to review the details
carefully before you add authentication to your InterNIC records.
   Although no security system is 100 percent secure, I highly
recommend that you use PGP as your authentication system for your
InterNIC domain records. PGP authentication will drastically reduce the
chances of an intruder hijacking your domain records.

* FEATURE: AVOIDING DATABASE SECURITY PROBLEMS
Imagine that you must guard the Hope Diamond. You wouldn't place the
diamond in the world’s most impregnable safe, then leave the lock’s
combination on a yellow sticky note on the safe’s door, would you?
That's essentially what happens when you become obsessed with one part
of the e-commerce security puzzle, but ignore the security of key
ingredients such as the database. Read the rest of Brian Moran's Web

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support).

February 07, 2000, 06:22 A.M.
Help with Mapping Drives

I am having a problem with our network. I work for a company that uses
mostly UNIX, and we have an NT 4.0 machine we use for logins and to
store files. We are looking at giving every PC a mapped H drive. The
only problem is we can only map it to the /users dir. So when anyone
goes to their H drive, they see everyone's dir. They don't have access
to them, but it makes it harder (or more confusing) for them to find
their folder. I know that I can make each person's folder a share that
only they have access to, but I was wondering if you can hide the
folders that someone does not have access to. Keep in mind our network
has Windows 9x for clients. Thanks for your help in advance.
