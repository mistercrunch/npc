1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

The security world has been rather quiet over the past week. One
significant event that did occur was that Microsoft released its first
Windows 2000 (Win2K) security hotfix. The hotfix corrects a problem
with the Win2K Indexing Service and Windows NT 4.0 Index Server.
   Although some readers might wince at the fact that Microsoft has
already released a security hotfix for a brand-new OS--an OS not even
on store shelves yet--there is no cause for alarm. We can expect to see
bugs in Win2K are to be expected, especially security bugs, because
hackers spend more time banging away against security subsystems than
they do against other system components.
   I've noticed that some technologists have hammered Microsoft over
the past week because a security patch actually beat the new OS to
market. I think those people are being shortsighted. Expecting a
perfect set of code from day one is incredibly unrealistic.
   I appreciate the fact that a security patch is already available for
Win2K. I'd rather have a patch than a hole in my OS, and the sooner I
get that patch the better. Most of you realize that bug-free software
is unlikely, and Win2K is no exception. Odds dictate that other
security risks are present in the Win2K code, so the question is,
"Where are the risks and how soon can we find them?"
   Obviously, no blanket answer exists for that question. We can expect
hackers and crackers alike to try most of the commonly known Windows-
related exploits against the new OS and any services running on the new
platform. The Indexing Service risk is a good example; similar path
revelation problems have appeared in the past, and I'd be willing to
speculate that at least one or two other security bugs have carried
over from older NT 4.0-based code as well. Only time will tell.
   On another note, starting this week, we launch the first of several
new columns scheduled on the NTSecurity.net Web site. The first column,
The Ultimate Security Toolkit, is a biweekly column by Steve Manzuik.
Every other week, Steve will review a new security product. Steve
offers his professional, from-the-trenches opinion about each tool and
his personal recommendation to help you make buying decisions. This
week, Steve reviews eEye's Retina security scanner, so be sure to check
it out. Until next time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* OUTLOOK EXPRESS OBJECT ACCESS
Georgio Guninski reported a problem with Outlook Express that could let
an intruder open and read email messages without a user's permission.
Microsoft is aware of the problem but has issued no response at the
time of this writing.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/outlook3.htm

* FIREWALL-1 ALLOWS SCRIPT RULE CIRCUMVENTION
Arne Vidstrom discovered a problem with the Firewall-1 script filtering
rules that might let unwanted scripts execute on the desktop. According
to Vidstrom's report, an intruder can circumvent the Strip Script Tags
feature by adding an extra less than sign (<) to the <SCRIPT> tag
syntax. Checkpoint is aware of the problem but has issued no response
to date.

* INDEX SERVER EXPOSES FILE SYSTEM
David Litchfield discovered two problems with Microsoft's Index Server
and Indexing Service technology. According to the report, the first
problem is that webhits.dll does not properly restrict file access, and
thus it is possible to navigate outside of virtual directories.
   The second problem involves error messages that nonexistent .idq
files appear to display. When a user requests such a file from Windows
2000 Web Services (formerly Microsoft Internet Information Server 5.0),
the server might reveal virtual directory path information, thereby
exposing a portion of file system structure to a potential intruder.

* SECURITY POLL: DO YOU THINK ONLINE CREDIT CARD-BASED PURCHASING IS
SAFE YET?
How safe do you think online credit card-based purchasing is? Come to
the Web site and let us know your thoughts.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: VISA ADMITS ITS SITES WERE HACKED
Does it matter how secure your e-commerce solution is when a credit
card company can't keep crackers out of its networks? Visa
International recently admitted that crackers penetrated its systems in
July 1999 and stole information. The crackers later contacted Visa by
email and telephone in attempts to extort money from the firm. Visa
subsequently contacted Scotland Yard and the FBI, which are
investigating the matter. Visa claims to have long since secured the
breached systems.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=204&TB=news

* NEWS: SECURITY HOLES BITE ONLINE BANK
Online bank X.COM received quite a "wake-up call" recently when users
discovered that while establishing a new account, anyone could transfer
money into an X.COM account from any other bank account in the United
States due to nonexistent security controls on wire transfer
mechanisms. X.COM corrected the problems when other banks complained to
the online bank about fraud attempts against customer accounts.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=206&TB=news

* FEATURE: KERBEROS 5 IN WINDOWS 2000
Windows 2000 (Win2K) offers many security improvements over Windows NT.
Probably the biggest advance has been in the OS's primary
authentication protocol. NT LAN Manager (NTLM) has been the primary
authentication protocol for all versions of NT. Win2K supports NTLM and
Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) authentication
protocols. But Win2K's primary authentication protocol is Kerberos 5,
which takes its name from Cerberus, Greek mythology’s three-headed dog
that guarded the gates of Hades. Zubair Ahmad takes a closer look at
Kerberos 5 and how Kerberos security works in Win2K.

* HOW-TO: CREATING A SPECIAL TSE LOGON SCRIPT
On our Windows NT network, we have two Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition (TSE) servers with MetaFrame that we have set up as member
servers. We want to use Application Security (APPSEC) to limit the
applications that users can run. When we run APPSEC, the TSE servers
don't appear to run the NT logon scripts.
   How can I make the logon script run with APPSEC activated? David
Carroll answers that question and more in this Web Exclusive article.

* TIP: UNMAP UNUSED FILE EXTENSIONS IN IIS
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

Internet Information Server (IIS) lets you map various file extensions
to various application services. For instance, you can map .pl
extensions to a PERL interpreter or .cfm extensions to a Cold Fusion
engine.
   When you load a fresh copy of IIS, the software installs several
mappings by default. Many of these mappings go unused unless you also
implement the specialized services that use those mappings. For
example, .idq files define query parameters for an Index Server search.
However, if you aren't using Index Server, or don't use .idq files in
conjunction with your Index Server installation, then there's no reason
to leave the .idq file mapping in place.
   You will want to remove all unused file mappings. Even if you think
you'll need a particular mapping later, remove it until you actually
need it. Removing the unused mappings minimizes your overall Web site
risk. The Index Server risk reported in this issue of Security UPDATE
is a perfect example of why you need to remove these mappings--an
intruder can exploit the mappings to circumvent system security in
certain instances. The problem is that we won't know what those
instances are until the intruder discovers them.
   What mappings can you remove from IIS? Any mapping that a site
hosted on the Web server is not using. Use a site analysis tool such as
Site Server Express or FrontPage to inventory your Web site. A site
inventory will help determine which file extensions you need and then
you can easily remove any unused mappings. Please note that before you
remove any file extension mappings, be sure to record their parameters
in case you need to redefine them at a later time.
   The file extension mappings occur in different places in each
version of IIS, so consult IIS's online Help system to determine the
location of the actual configuration dialog box.

8. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support).

January 27, 2000, 09:59 P.M.
Local Proxy Server Blocking Site Access
I am using an NT 4 based network with IE5 and connect to the Internet
through a local proxy server running MS Proxy on our network. When I
bypass the local proxy server, I can access this particular site that
requires an authorized username and password. When I go through the
proxy server, access is denied. Any suggestions as to what I need to
do?
