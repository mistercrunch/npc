1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

When it comes to free stuff, I'm just like Andy Rooney: I find that, in
most cases, free stuff simply costs too much, so I usually shy away
from free offers. But once in a blue moon, people actually do give
something away without asking for anything in return, and today is one
of those times.
   29th Street Press, Windows NT Magazine, and NTSecurity.NET are
pleased to announced that our book "Internet Security with Windows NT"
is now available on the Web in its entirety, absolutely free, with no
strings attached.
   "Internet Security with Windows NT" covers NT security as it
pertains to TCP/IP-based networks and is largely geared for novice or
moderately knowledgeable administrators. The book is a collective
effort by some notable names in the security industry, including
myself, Bill Hamilton, Marcus Ranum, Peter Carden, Andy Baron, and
several others. The book covers a wide array of security information
that leaves the reader with a solid security foundation to build
additional knowledge upon.
   Why did we put the book online for free? Because Windows NT Magazine
wants to provide IT professionals with even more high quality and
timely online technical content. Ultimately, we feel that living, Web-
based books are the best way to provide the most up-to-date material on
technical subject matters. And because our goal is to provide the
quality technical material you need to get your job done better, the
release of "Internet Security with Windows NT" on the Web is the next
step toward that goal.
   Although the online version of the book is the same as the original
print version, we'll continue to update the content of the book with
the latest relevant material. We also have hardcopy versions of the
book available for those of you that want a professionally printed and
bound version.
   We hope you enjoy using the online book, which you can find at
http://www.ntsecurity.net/book. Please let me know what you think of
our effort, and drop me a line with any suggestions you have for
improving the book's content or the Web site in general. Until next
time, have a great week!

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* INTERNET EXPLORER ALLOWS CIRCUMVENTION OF DOMAIN SECURITY
Georgio Guninski discovered a problem with Internet Explorer (IE) 5.01
and other IE versions that might expose an entire domain. The problem
might allow unauthorized file access, window spoofing, and other
unwanted activity.
   Microsoft is aware of the problem but has not yet responded. For
complete details, including example code that demonstrates the problem,
visit the URL below.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/ie59.htm

* IMAIL IMONITOR SUBJECT TO DENIAL OF SERVICE
UssrLabs discovered a denial of service (DoS) condition in IPSwitch's
IMail IMonitor Server 5.08 for Windows NT. The problem might also
affect other versions of the software.
   Within Imonitor, a CGI script called status.cgi determines whether
the server services are running. By executing the script many times in
a short time period, IMonitor will crash, citing an Invalid Memory
Address error. IPSwitch is aware of the problem but has not responded
at the time of this writing.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/imonitor.htm

* MCIS IMAP BUFFER OVERFLOW CONDITION
Tristan Goode discovered a buffer overflow condition in Microsoft
Commercial Internet System's (MCIS's) Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP) service. If a malformed request that contains random data passes
to the IMAP service, that request might cause any of several associated
services to crash, including the SMTP and LDAP services. In addition,
an intruder can use specific malformed data to cause arbitrary code to
execute on the server.
   Microsoft has released a fix for Intel and Alpha. For more
information, see Microsoft Support Online article Q246731.

7. ========== SECURITY TOOLKIT ==========

* BOOK HIGHLIGHT: BIG BOOK OF IPSEC RFCS: INTERNET SECURITY
ARCHITECTURE
By Pete Loshin
Online Price: $34.95
Softcover; 560 pages
Published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, November 1999

The security architecture for the Internet protocol, IP Security
(IPSec), is already defining the way organizations and individuals
secure their networks. An entire body of work, the Requests for
Comments (RFCs), describes IPSec. This book compiles and organizes
these important documents in one printed volume and adds a glossary and
extensive index that makes the RFCs easy to locate. You no longer have
to wade through countless RFCs trying to find the answer to your IPSec
question-the book compiles all the solutions in one location.

* TIP: INSPECT THOSE ISAPI DLLS
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

Many of you operate Internet Information Server (IIS) -based Web sites
and must let third-party Internet Server Application Programming
Interface (ISAPI) DLLs execute on the Web server. But did you know an
ISAPI DLL can easily take over your server? It's possible for an ISAPI
DLL to elevate its privileges to the level of the built-in and all-
powerful SYSTEM account by calling an API function called
RevertToSelf(). ISAPI DLLs rarely need to perform that type of
privilege elevation so it's best to ensure that no third-party DLLs do
so.
   To guard against that type of action, you must inspect each ISAPI
DLL using an analysis tool capable of dumping out any included function
calls. For example, a program called Dumpbin.exe ships with many
Microsoft development platforms, and you can use it for this type of
DLL inspection. To use Dumpbin to look for RevertToSelf() calls, use
the following command line syntax:
   dumpbin /imports FILENAME.DLL | find "RevertToSelf"

Replace FILENAME.DLL with the name of the DLL you wish to inspect on
your system. Also, be advised that functions might be called through
the LoadLibrary() function and therefore, you should inspect each DLL
for the nature of that function call too.

8. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS NT MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows
NT Magazine online forums (http://www.winntmag.com/support).

January 07, 2000, 02:30 P.M.
Stronger Passwords with Passfilt.dll

Has anyone used the passfilt.dll to enable strong password
functionality in a Windows NT domain? I have read the technet article
Q1611990 that explains this. I understand all this just fine. I am just
looking for people who have used it that can let me know if there are
any bumps, or does it work as advertised?
