1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

Piracy is a big concern for a lot of development companies. The amount 
of money reportedly lost each year at the hands of pirates is 
staggering. Naturally, developers take the matter seriously and guard 
the security of their code-based assets as fiercely as they can. 
   One progressive way to guard software assets is to place the code 
into the public domain under some form of open-source licensing scheme. 
Thus, piracy becomes a moot point, and development takes more of a 
front seat to profits.
   However, many firms develop code that could not feasibly be 
protected under an open-source scheme. Instead, their products' 
protection must rely on honesty or secrecy. Take, for example, the DVD-
based Content Scrambling System (CSS) software technology, which relies 
on secrecy for protection. Developers use CSS to encrypt DVD-based 
media so that only DVD players can decrypt and play that media. This 
approach minimizes unauthorized duplication. But in November 1999, 
someone posted a program called DeCSS that can decrypt media that is 
copy protected with CSS. 
   The release of DeCSS has caused quite a ruckus in the computer 
industry as well as in the motion picture industry. Naturally, 
Hollywood wants to protect its movies from unauthorized duplication and 
is going to extremes to do so. In late December 1999, the DVD Copy 
Protection Association filed a lawsuit in California suing Web site 
operators who had posted copies of the DeCSS program. The association 
also sued Web site operators who merely posted links to sites that had 
the program online for download. The courts handed down an injunction 
prohibiting US sites from posting the code. 
   But hackers and supporters have struck back hard. Attorneys for the 
defendants wanted the CSS code submitted as evidence in the case, which 
would make the code a matter of public record because civil lawsuits 
are public information. In addition, hackers from Australia will soon 
air the source code on Australian television. Australian law does not 
prohibit such action.
   I think Hollywood has the right to sue the developers of DeCSS and 
people who distribute the program, but I also think the developers of 
DeCSS have the right to tell the world what they discovered. After all, 
the developers of DeCSS weren't the people who said the CSS technology 
was secure--they only proved that it wasn't. 
   That statement leads me to an interesting thought: What about the 
people who developed and promoted CSS as a secure technology in the 
first place? Aren't they to blame, too? If a company claims its 
technology is secure, but it turns out that the product is not, could 
the company be sued for fraud? 
   The case raises so many questions that it likely will set more than 
one precedent for the computer industry and the Internet. I think those 
precedents will include new legal views on antipiracy and reverse 
engineering, which could dramatically impact the way security-related 
problems are discovered and reported in the future. If you're a 
developer or a company that sells security-related solutions (whether 
software, hardware, or services), be sure to keep an eye on the DeCSS 
case. It might change the way you do business. 
   Before I sign off this week, I want to inform you all that the 
NTSecurity.net Web site may be offline until Friday morning. We have 
encountered some unexpected difficulties while moving the site from one 
data center to another. Thanks for your patience while we work to 
quickly bring the site back online. Until next time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* ORACLE WEB LISTENER MAY RUN ARBITRARY COMMANDS
Oracle Application Server ships with a component called Oracle Web 
Listener. Cerebus Information Security reported a problem with the 
component that could let an intruder run arbitrary commands on the 
server. 
http://listserv.ntsecurity.net/scripts/wa-ntsecurity.exe?A2=ind0003b&L=win2ksecadvice&F=&S=&P=4178

* MICROSOFT MEDIA LICENSE MANAGER DENIAL OF SERVICE
According to Microsoft's documentation, Windows Media License Manager 
is part of a technology set that enables distribution of copyrighted 
digital media. When Media Player opens a protected medium, it contacts 
the media provider to receive a license key. A malformed license key 
request can cause the License Manager to halt.
   For details, see Microsoft Support Online article Q257200 
(http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q257/2/00.ASP?LNG=ENG&SA=ALLKB&FR=0).

* INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER CHUNKED ENCODING POST
Internet Information Server (IIS) supports chunked encoding transfers 
for PUT and POST operations; however, the server does not limit the 
amount of memory that can be requested for such a transfer during a 
given user session. Therefore an attacker can request large amounts of 
memory from the server and cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack for 
the duration of that user's session. According to Microsoft's report, 
when the attacker closes the Web browser, IIS resumes normal operation. 
For more information, see Microsoft Support Online article Q252693 
(http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q252/6/93.asp?LNG=ENG&SA=ALLKB&FR=0).

7. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows 
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support). 

March 17, 2000, 07:09 A.M. 
PST Files as Offline Folders 
When selecting my network-based PST Folders as Offline Folders, I get a 
synchronization error and it fails. The rest of the folders can be set 
as offline. I have already shut down Outlook and checked that there are 
no file locks or anything. I did successfully select them in RC2, but 
since upgrading, I can't do it. Anyone know if there is a fix or is 
this a "feature?"
