November 29, 1999 - Security UPDATE Alert - Arne Vidstrom and Svante
Sannmark have discovered a serious problem on Windows NT systems that
have IE 5.0 installed. Because of changes to the Task Scheduler by an
IE 5.0 installation process, the service is vulnerable to an attack
that can lead to elevated user privileges under certain conditions.

Microsoft is aware of the problem and has released a new version of
Internet Explorer (5.1) along with a FAQ and Support Online article
that detail the issues.

Microsoft also reported a vulnerability in its Windows 9x operating
systems caused by a legacy mechanism for caching network security
credentials. The vulnerability could allow a user's plaintext network
password to be retrieved from the cache.

And, continuing their marathon of buffer overflow discoveries,
USSRLabs has discovered such conditions in three more NT-based
application services. Deerfield's WorldClient Server 2.0.0.0,
BisonWare FTP Server, and Symantec's Mail-Gear were all discovered to
be vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and possibly arbitrary
code execution due to buffer overflows in the software.
