1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

I've read a startling headline topic twice in the past 10 days: High-
profile Web sites are moving to obtain hacker insurance. That topic is
startling because I see it as a huge obstacle in the push toward
popularizing e-commerce. When you think about it, don't intruders
actually control these hacker insurance policies outright?
   Let me clarify. I'm only using the term "hacker" because that's what
confused members of the media mistakenly call crackers and other types
of network intruders. Hackers are good guys, and the crackers, Denial
of Service (DoS) launchers, and other malicious intruders are the bad
guys.
   So what is this so-called hacker insurance? First, look at how the
insurance system works: In case of a loss, the insurance company pays a
sum of money to the insured suffering the loss. So hacker insurance
pays for losses suffered due to a hacking incident. In most cases, the
more you pay for insurance, the better coverage you receive. At the top
end of the insurance spectrum, the sum paid for a loss usually equals
the amount lost.
   Insurance costs depend on the risks involved. In other words, the
greater the risk the higher the cost of insurance. So who ultimately
controls the risks (and thus the insurance premium costs) from
distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks? The intruders! Intruders control at
least 90 percent of the risk involved with running an online e-commerce
site because DDoS attacks are largely indefensible at this point in
time.
   Think about that situation for a moment. Insurance rates factor into
the cost of doing business, and companies pass these costs to the
consumer in the price of a given item or service. Right now, companies
such as Amazon.com enjoy great success because of their competitive
pricing and ease of shopping. However, with intruders controlling
insurance rates indirectly, how long can Amazon.com's success last?
Will intrusions drive up the cost of books and other products at
Amazon.com? You bet they will. You can also bet that the same thing
will happen in every other sector of e-commerce--and it doesn't stop
there.
   Imagine that the Internet has become a new front for new kinds of
wars. In these wars, new e-commerce companies destroy local storefront
economies by out-pricing them with lower overhead and better buying
power. In time, mom-and-pop shops close, defeated by the new e-commerce
giants. Meanwhile, their children, who are now suffering from a poorer
family life and lackluster future because of a closed family business,
retaliate by launching DDoS attacks against the e-commerce giants who
forced their parents out of business. As a result, hacker insurance
rates soar, which causes e-commerce-based product and service prices to
rise.
   Far-fetched? Think again. This scenario is happening right now in
global politics, lower and higher education, and e-commerce markets.
The Internet is quickly becoming a new type of pseudo war zone where
people can launch an attack from anywhere they can get a dial tone.
Start a makeshift war without leaving the house--that's power. That
power will be available to anyone that can pay for a dial-up account
until enough disrespect is shown to force stronger controls. We're
headed in that direction at lightening speed.
   If intruders continue to turn the Internet into a war zone by
attacking networks, we'll all suffer the consequences. Intruders are
taking us directly into strict, heavy-handed controlled access to the
Internet.
   To the instigators of DDoS attacks and Web page defacements, I say,
"Think about the big picture before you act so selfishly. What's more
important? Your 15 seconds of fame or everyone's shared freedom in the
online world?"
   And to the new giants of e-commerce I say, "Spend your money on
serious technology improvements, not empty insurance policies that feed
inflation and slow the acceptance of e-commerce." The online world has
enough bandages in place already. Don't waste time endlessly guarding
against risks--work to eliminate the risks permanently. The best use of
your money is to give it to those who can create the necessary changes.
Until next time, have a great week.

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER 4.0 DENIAL OF SERVICE
Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 is subject to Denial of Service
(DoS) attacks when used in conjunction with Microsoft's IIS companion
SMTP mail server. An intruder can cause a DoS condition against IIS by
manipulating filenames within the SMTP service's directory structure.
By creating a filename more than 85 characters in length within the
\mailroot\pickup directory, the intruder can cause the mail server to
generate an error and crash the INETINFO service, which supports IIS.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/iis4-4.htm

* WINDOWS AUTORUN.INF VULNERABILITY
Eric Stevens reported an interesting discovery regarding autorun.inf
files on Windows platforms. Autorun.inf files automatically launch a
program when you insert the program's CD-ROM into the drive. However,
Stevens discovered that you can place autorun.inf files on any system
drive, not just CD-ROM drives, where someone could launch the file
under certain circumstances.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/autorun1.htm

* SITE SERVER COMMERCE USER INPUT UNVALIDATED
Microsoft Site Server Commerce 3.0 has a problem with the sample
Volcano Coffee site and the sample custom site that the Site Builder
Wizard creates. The sample sites ship with code that doesn't check user
input before acting upon that input. This oversight could let an
intruder inject SQL code into a remote system running the sample sites.
Microsoft issued a patch for the problem. Any application code that
developers based on the sample sites might also contain the security
risk. Examine those applications to ensure that they verify all user
input for accuracy before further processing by the system.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/site-server3.htm

* MICROSOFT JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE EXPOSES USER FILES
Microsoft reported a problem with its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that
ships with Internet Explorer (IE) 4.x and 5.x, and several other
Microsoft packages. According to the report, the version of the
Microsoft VM that ships with IE contains a security vulnerability that
could let a Java applet operate outside the bounds set by the sandbox.
A malicious user could write a Java applet that could read--but not
change, delete, or add--files from the computer of a person who visits
the user's site, or read Web content from inside an intranet if a
computer from within that intranet visits the malicious site.
   Microsoft issued an FAQ and a patched version for the 2000, 3100,
and 3200 build series of its JVM. Use the JVIEW command-line utility
(installed when you install the JVM) to determine which JVM version you
have on your system.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/ie511.htm

* WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL EXPOSES SYSTEM DURING INSTALLATION
According to Stephane Aubert, during the installation of Windows 2000
Professional (Win2K Pro), a user can access the ADMIN$ share via the
Administrator user account without providing a password for that
account. The ADMIN$ share is mapped by default onto the main Windows
root directory.
   Aubert said that the user had defined an Administrator password
during the installation process; however, the password did not take
affect until after the system rebooted. During the interim, a person
could connect to resources using the Administrator account and a blank
password.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/win2kpro2.htm

* INTERNET EXPLORER EXPOSES USER FILES
When a Web server navigates a window from one domain into another one,
the Internet Explorer (IE) security model checks the server's
permissions on the new page. However, a Web server could open a browser
window to a client-side local file and then navigate the window to a
page in the Web site's domain in such a way that the data in the
client-side local file is accessible to the new window.

* NEWS: ZOMBIE ZAPPER HELPS SHUT DOWN DDOS ATTACKS
BindView's Razor team has created a new tool called Zombie Zapper that
helps administrators fend off Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks launched by the trin00, tfn, and Stacheldraht DDoS software.
The software is freely available on the BindView Razor Web site.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=215&TB=news

* NEWS: HOW TO DEFEND AGAINST DDOS ATTACKS
On March 20, 2000, Internet Security Systems (ISS) will host an
intensive full-day workshop called "Securing e-Business: Focus on
Denial of Service." The workshop is in conjunction with ISS Connect
2000, the company's annual international user conference and
information security summit. Speakers include Senator Sam Nunn; Howard
Schmidt, the head of security for Microsoft; ISS President and Chief
Executive Officer, Tom Noonan; and ISS Founder and Chief Technology
Officer, Christopher Klaus.

* REVIEW: NOVELL FIREWALL FOR NT
James R. Borck reviewed the Novell Firewall for NT and found that it's
a good solution for small- to medium-size networks. According to
Borck's report for InfoWorld, the product includes an affordable
pricing structure; easy, centralized administration; integration for
directory services; and a good traffic management utility.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/reviews.asp?IDF=117&TB=r

* REVIEW: SURFINSHIELD CENSORS HOSTILE CODE
In her review for InfoWorld, Ana Orubeondo takes a close look at
SurfinShield, a product that claims to defend against Web attacks by
censoring Web-based application code. According to Orubeondo, the
product sports proactive monitoring and helps plug security holes in
some instant messaging programs such as ICQ. The product is easy to
use, but setting up its security policies is time-consuming, and the
product requires frequent fine-tuning by a security administrator.

scans it first. The cooperation between the antivirus software and the
firewall is based on the Content Vectoring Protocol (CVP). Most
firewalls are CVP-compliant and provide a faster, more robust way of
transferring data between the firewall and F-Secure Anti-Virus for
Firewalls. From one console, an administrator can set security
policies, send software updates and receive alerts, and support all
workstations and servers. The product is priced at $24.80 per user for
a 100-user license. For more information, go to the F-Secure Web site.

* TIP: MOVE FILES AND RETAIN PERMISSIONS AND ATTRIBUTES
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

A reader recently asked how to use a batch file to automate the
movement of files but still retain the files' security permission and
audit settings. Windows' built-in XCOPY and MOVE commands are fantastic
tools; however, neither will retain security attributes while
processing files. Windows doesn't ship with any tools for this task, so
you must obtain a third-party tool. One such tool is SCOPY from the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit.
   SCOPY works similar to the COPY command, with the added benefit of
two command-line switches that let users specify whether to copy a
file's security permissions and audit settings. The /o switch instructs
the tool to copy owner security information, and the /a switch copies
the audit information.
