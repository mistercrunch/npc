1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are still making their way 
into the news, although not because someone launched another massive 
attack. The residual DDoS news centers on catching the perpetrators and 
developing remedies to prevent future attacks.
   I've learned about several avenues being explored to help prevent DDoS 
attacks. Vendors have created new product-related aids and announced 
alliances designed to share information to stop attacks, and Congress is 
pushing the Internet Security Act of 2000.
   Many companies have added detection code to their products that detect 
DDoS client software used in coordinated DDoS attacks. Other vendors have 
added detection to border protection software that can help determine 
whether a system on your network is flooding an external network on usually 
available ports. At least one company has announced a new chip that can 
filter packets at 100 times the speed of current packet filters.
   Numerous Internet access providers and upstream communication carriers 
have teamed up to share information as quickly as possible in the event of 
a DDoS attack against one of their networks. The cooperative efforts will 
help curb any shenanigans that crop up in the future because information 
gathered from routers and other network devices can reveal the origin of 
traffic, and the companies can shut down or block those end points to 
systematically eliminate an attack.
   Organizations will eventually push for new laws to help law enforcement 
deal with DDoS attacks. That's exactly what Congress is trying to do with 
the Internet Security Act of 2000 
(http://www.ntsecurity.net/security/bill-s2430.asp). The bill consists 
mostly of a long list of amendments to existing laws, including forfeiture 
laws for computer equipment used to commit a crime; provisions for pen 
registers and trap and trace devices; provisions for PC users to authorize 
wire taps when their machines are infiltrated or used to stage attacks 
(which, as written, can bypass court approval); and so on.
   These efforts are admirable, but are they enough? If we analyze the 
efforts, we learn that vendors are trying to solve the problem through 
better traffic management and cooperative information sharing, and law 
makers look not to solve the problem outright, but only to ensure they can 
identify a perpetrator after the fact. So the answer seems clear: Those 
efforts are not enough on the lawmaking side.
   In many respects, the Internet is no different than the street, so logic 
dictates that we try to apply the same rules as best we can without making 
any redundant efforts. On US streets, people travel freely until they raise 
the suspicion of law enforcement. And whether you've done something that is 
merely suspicious or blatantly obvious, you'll most likely have to identify 
yourself to law enforcement officials--usually with a driver's license, 
state ID card, or passport.
   Why can't we treat the Internet the same way? If I must have license 
plates on my car in case of a crime, accident, or other need to identify me 
as the owner, why shouldn't I have the same type of ID on my network 
packets so that if it becomes necessary, law enforcement officials can 
identify those packets as having come from my system?
   At this point, I see no other way to maintain a reasonable level of user 
privacy while providing a means to more readily identify perpetrators. If 
people are willing to drive around with license plates on their car, then 
they probably won't be upset about a similar tag on their network packets.
   What do you think? Are address licenses inevitable for the Internet? Is 
there a better way? Stop by our home page and post your comments to this 
editorial (http://www.ntsecurity.net), or send me email if you prefer. 
Until next time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* FRONTPAGE 2000 EXPOSES WIN2K ACCOUNTS
When a valid FrontPage user connects to a remote Web server using a 
FrontPage client, that user can obtain a list of account names. This 
security risk first appeared under Windows NT 4.0, IIS 4.0, and FrontPage 
98; Microsoft apparently carried it over to the new platform unchecked. The 
workaround information for the NT 4.0 platform does not work on Windows 
2000 platforms.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/fp2000-1.htm

* BUFFER OVERFLOW IN CMD.EXE
Cmd.exe, the command processor for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0, has an 
unchecked buffer in the code that handles environment strings. If a server 
provides batch or other script files, a user can potentially provide 
arguments that create an extremely large environment string, which 
overflows the buffer. This overflow can cause the process to fail, which 
presents a dialog box on the console screen. The memory allocated to the 
process won't be available again until that dialog box is cleared.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/cmd-exe-dos1.htm

* ACTIVE DIRECTORY MIXED OBJECT ACCESS
Active Directory (AD) contains a bug that under specific conditions lets a 
user change information in the AD that should not be changeable. This can 
occur only if the changes are combined in a particular way with other 
changes that involve attributes the user does have permission to modify.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/win2000-4.htm

* CISCO IOS SUBJECT TO DENIAL OF SERVICE
Some security scanners test for two particular security vulnerabilities 
associated with several UNIX-based platforms, and when those tests are run 
against certain Cisco hardware and software, a Denial of Service (DoS) 
attack against the device can occur.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/cisco3.htm

* REAL SERVER DENIAL OF SERVICE
By sending the Real Server 471 bytes of malformed data on port 7070, a user 
can crash the service. USSRLabs published an executable program along with 
source code that can test for this vulnerability. Real Networks has been 
informed of this problem but has not responded.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/realserver2.htm

* NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR EXPOSES LOCAL FILES
Netscape Communicator 4.x lets a Web site read HTML files on a user's hard 
disk, including the user's bookmarks file and browser cache files. The 
exploit works by setting a cookie whose value contains JavaScript code.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/netscape2.htm

* BUFFER OVERFLOW AND PATH EXPOSURE IN HTIMAGE
HTimage is a CERN-compatible image map dispatcher that ships with FrontPage 
98. The utility exposes path information and contains a buffer overflow 
condition that might let code execute on the server.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/fp2.htm

* INTERNET EXPLORER 5.01 ALLOWS CROSS-FRAME NAVIGATION
Internet Explorer (IE) 5.01 lets an intruder circumvent its cross-frame 
security policy by accessing the Domain Object Model (DOM) of documents 
using Java or JavaScript. The problem exposes the entire DOM of the target 
document and opens additional security risks. The problem allows reading 
local files, reading files from any host, window spoofing, and retrieving 
cookies.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/ie516.htm

* NETWARE 5.1 REMOTE ADMINISTRATION OVERFLOW
The Remote Administration service contains a buffer overflow condition that 
lets an attacker launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the system 
or inject code into the OS for execution. Because of improper connection 
clean up, it's possible to saturate such a system with connections so that 
the system will stop responding on the network.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/netware2.htm

* PANDA SECURITY 3.0 CAN BE BYPASSED
Panda Security 3.0 is vulnerable to indirect Registry key modifications, 
which let any logged-on user manipulate Panda Security. A lack of system 
integrity checks lets a user uninstall the entire software package.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/pandasec1.htm

* TIP: CONVERT TO NTFS DURING UNATTENDED INSTALLATION
(contributed by http://www.jsiinc.com)

FAT file systems offer little security, so it's wise to format your drives 
to use the NTFS file system, where you can control access to files and 
directories on a per-user basis. Although formatting a drive to NTFS is 
straightforward, performing that conversion during an unattended 
installation of Windows NT might not be straightforward for you.
   To convert a FAT file system to NTFS during an unattended installation, 
copy the I386 or Alpha directory from the installation CD-ROM onto your 
hard disk. The following instructions assume you copied the I386 from the 
CD-ROM to the I386 directory on your hard disk.
   Expand the file I386\INITIAL.IN_ to I386\INITIAL.INF. Rename the 
I386\INITIAL.IN_ to I386\INITIAL.BK_. Edit the SetAcls section of the 
I386\INITIAL.INF file, changing the line "set Convert_Winnt = $($1)" to 
"set Convert_Winnt = YES." Save the file and run the unattended 
installation; the installation process will convert the file system to 
NTFS.

* WRITING SECURE CODE: AVOID BUFFER OVERRUNS WITH STRING SAFETY
In his latest column, David LeBlanc says that although you can find several 
explanations of buffer overruns on the Web, most tend to be very technical 
and are often designed to show how to exploit a particular application. In 
his current column, LeBlanc demonstrates the overrun problem with an 
example program that you can step through to see how the overrun occurs.

8. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows 
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support). 

April 18, 2000, 12:54 P.M. 
Service Pack Release 
Just curious if anyone has heard when the first service pack is due out for 
Windows 2000 (Server or Professional). It seems that there are a number of 
applications that will not be released with Win2K compatibility until after 
the service pack is out. I heard a great deal about this right after Win2K 
was launched and not much since. Thanks for your help.

* WIN2KSECADVICE MAILING LIST
Each week we offer a quick recap of some of the highlights from the
Win2KSecAdvice mailing list. The following thread is in the spotlight
this week:

HotMail Security Hole: Inject JavaScript into Email
Several months ago in my Advisory #3 for 2000, I alerted everyone about a 
Hotmail bug with the "@import url (javascript:...)" functionality. That bug 
was fixed, but now I found a similar bug in HotMail that allows the 
injection and execution of JavaScript code into a user's email.

* HOWTO MAILING LIST
Each week we offer a quick recap of some of the highlights from the
HowTo for Security mailing list. The following threads are in the
spotlight this week:

Free Internet Access, a Security Risk?
I thought I'd throw this one out to everyone because I would like to get 
some opinions. What kind of security risks, if any, do the free Internet 
access services pose? Are there any cracks in security with companies such 
as Blue Light, Free-I, NetZero, or Free-DSL?
http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/L.asp?A2=IND0004C&L=HOWTO&P=2716

Managing NT Permissions
There is an NT user right "bypass traverse checking," which, if I remember 
right, is given by default to the Everyone group and allows the Everyone 
group to browse through directory listings even when they have no access 
rights.
