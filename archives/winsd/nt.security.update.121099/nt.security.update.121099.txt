December 10, 1999 - Security UPDATE Alert - Two new security risks
were reported recently. In addition, an advisory has been released
warning users about proper configuration to avoid an SQL Server 7.0
SA password compromise.

USSRLABS reported a denial of service (DoS) condition within GoodTech's
Telnet Server v.2.2.1. The DoS is caused by an unchecked buffer in
the login sequence. GoodTech is aware of the problem, however no
vendor response is know at this time.

.rain.forrest.puppy. reported a DoS condition in Windows NT Server 4.0.
The problem can lead to a crashed Service Manager and break functionality
of named pipes. Microsoft issued a patch, FAQ, and Support Online
article regarding this matter.

Kevork Belian pointed out how easy it is to change an SA password on
SQL Server 7.0. The situation exists largely due to improper security
permission settings on SQL's files.
