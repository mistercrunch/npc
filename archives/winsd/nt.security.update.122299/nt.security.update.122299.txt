1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

I'm glad I'm not the only one that has to learn a few lessons the hard
way. Microsoft learned another solid lesson last week when someone
discovered that its Syskey technology has a serious security weakness.
As you might know, Syskey helps protect the SAM database on Windows NT
systems by introducing strong encryption to that area of the Registry.
The weakness in Syskey resides in the fact that Microsoft is reusing
the RC4 key associated with Syskey encryption, which seriously weakens
the technology.
   The risk in Syskey is very significant, and it's not the first time
something of this nature has occurred. Last year, L0pht and Counterpane
Systems released a white paper detailing numerous security shortcomings
in Microsoft's PPTP implementation. One of those shortcomings was the
fact that Microsoft Point to Point Encryption (MPPE) reused RC4
keystreams--just like the Syskey technology.
   Maybe I'm being an idealist, but I'd have assumed that after the
release of the L0pht and Counterpane PPTP white paper, Microsoft would
have scoured its encryption code looking for similar security-risk
occurrences. But apparently that didn't happen, and here we are again,
attending class at the school of hard knocks for NT 4.0.
   Windows 2000 (Win2K) is just around the corner. Win2K is supposed to
be more secure than NT 4.0, and the OS certainly contains more
encryption technology than NT 4.0. I can only wonder whether the Win2K
developers are paying attention to the encryption follies uncovered in
NT 4.0? Until next time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, http://www.ntsecurity.net)

* SYSKEY KEYSTREAM REUSE
Syskey is a utility that strongly encrypts the hashed password
information in the SAM database to protect it against offline password-
cracking attacks. Syskey technology first appeared in NT Server 4.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4).
   The technology is vulnerable to attack because Syskey reuses the RC4
keystream. According to Microsoft's report, "The vulnerability allows a
particular crypt analytic attack to be effective against Syskey,
significantly reducing the strength of the protection it offers."
Microsoft has released patches that correct this risk.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/syskey.htm
   http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=16798
   http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=16799

* LSA DENIAL OF SERVICE
Network Associates (NAI) discovered a problem with Windows NT's Logon
Security Authority (LSA) that can lead to a denial of service (DoS)
attack against the system. According to NAI's report, the misuse of a
particular API call will lead to an application error, thereby crashing
the LSA. With the LSA unavailable, no authentication takes place.
Microsoft has released patches for Intel and Alpha that correct this
problem.

* SECURITY POLL: WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL OF SECURITY EXPERTISE?
We've just launched a brand new survey designed to help us understand
your current level of security knowledge. The survey results will help
us better shape the content of our security-related material, including
information in this newsletter. So please stop by and take the one-
question survey located right on the home page.

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: PGP ALLOWED FOR EXPORT
Network Associates (NAI) announced that the US government has granted
the company a full license to export its PGP encryption software. The
license, effective immediately, lets NAI export its full-strength PGP
encryption software to virtually all countries worldwide that are not
on the government's restricted list. Countries on that list include
Cuba, Iraq, and others.

* FEATURE: HOW SECURE IS YOUR EXCHANGE SERVER?
In his recent Web Exclusive article, Jerry Cochran reminds us of
several security risks associated with Exchange Server. Several items
are held out for consideration, including Outlook Web Access (OWA). Be
sure to stop by for a quick review of common Exchange Server gotchas!

5. ========== NEW AND IMPROVED ==========
(contributed by Carolyn Mascarenas, products@winntmag.com)

* PIRACY INTERVENTION
New Wave Software announced Software Piracy Intervention (SPI),
software that adds a protective layer to software products to prevent
piracy and to track those that attempt it. When you install a protected
product, the SPI archive goes through a series of validation checks. If
any check fails, the product won’t install and the user’s IP
information is recorded so that the software developer can track and
prosecute the user. The Lock Point feature locks the product to the
first computer that it successfully installs on. The Uninstaller
feature lets the user move an SPI-protected product to another
computer. The built-in e-commerce feature lets an online customer
purchase your product without the use of shopping cart software. Once a
customer purchases your software product online, the SPI-protected
product installs on their system and is ready to run.
   SPI runs on Windows 2000 (Win2K), Windows NT, Windows 9x, Mac, and
PowerMac. For pricing, contact New Wave Software, 800-920-9283.
   http://www.nwspi.com

* FIREWALL WITH MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES
Network-1 Security Solutions announced CyberwallPLUS 5.2 and
CyberwallPLUS Central 1.0, a suite of embedded firewalls with
management capabilities and enhanced intrusion detection and
protection. This suite provides network security policies across
numerous server-based firewalls. The suite also provides tools for
remote management, enhanced logging and reporting, and increased
intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. Application Service
Providers (ASPs) and e-businesses can use the central management
capability to deploy Web or other types of server farms that require
the maintenance efficiencies, increased security, and scalability.
   CyberwallPLUS 5.2 and CyberwallPLUS Central 1.0 run on Windows NT
and Windows 98. Pricing starts at $995. Contact Network-1 Security
Solutions, 800-638-9751.

* TIP: STRESS TEST YOUR SERVERS WITH BLAST!
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, http://www.ntsecurity.net)

Few things are more unsettling than to learn that a piece of your
favorite software has a nasty denial of service (DoS) condition in it.
We generally find out about these problems from either vendors or
hackers who find those bugs or through the direct experience of having
a service attacked. Most of us prefer the former means of discovery, as
opposed to the latter.
   Although you can certainly monitor various online information
sources waiting for new DoS risk information to pop up, a more
proactive way exists to find problems in the software you use in-house.
That way is to attack the services yourself.
   Testing services for various DoS conditions is not an easy chore
without a serious tool to assist in that work. One such tool is NT
Objectives' Blast. Blast is a new stress-testing tool designed
specifically to break a given service. In most cases, when a service
breaks because of Blast-based testing, that service has a buffer
overflow condition that leads to a DoS.
   The benefits of testing your software for DoS conditions are many,
including possibly finding service problems before they become serious
security issues. If you're interested in this type of testing, be sure
to check out Blast. And while you're at NT Objectives' Web site, be
sure to check out the PowerPoint presentation, "Taking Out an NT
Server," which discusses another new tool called NTOMax that NT
Objectives plans to release this week.
