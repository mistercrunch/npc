1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

I haven't bought much over the Internet, and until current trends
improve, I probably won't buy much in the future. Consumer-based e-
commerce isn't safe yet. Sure, you can probably trust a handful of
vendors with electronic transactions, but you're still accepting a huge
risk because no standard exists for gauging information security
compliance for e-commerce. You have to accept the vendor's word when it
alleges that its systems are secure, and in most cases the vendor's
word about security is backed up with nothing.
  Case in point: Last week, hackers found that several large e-commerce
sites, including CD Universe, contained major security risks that
exposed customer information, including credit card numbers. The
intruders probed some sites and pointed them out. In other cases,
intruders actually cracked the sites and stole credit card data and
then held the data for ransom. So who's watching who? The black hats
are apparently watching everyone and everything that comes into view,
but where are the white hats to keep the black hats at bay?
   Every time I hear about intruders cracking an e-commerce site, I get
colder toward making online purchases. The last thing we need is our
credit card numbers in the hands of a system cracker. So how can we
help prevent credit card theft without giving up on e-commerce? The
answer is, we can't. For now, if we use e-commerce, we must accept the
risk because we don't know which sites to trust and which ones to shy
away from.
   We need a method to determine which e-commerce sites are secure and
which sites remain in question. How else can we learn to trust e-
commerce with a given vendor? Perhaps we need an international
standards body to develop a system of testing and rating a site's e-
commerce security. If a Web site passes the required examinations, it
could display a seal of approval.
   I remember hearing talk about forming a security standards
organization, but I never heard whether it came to pass. Based on last
week's discoveries regarding lax security on various e-commerce sites,
I'd have to guess that either no such body exists or it's being ignored
by e-commerce site developers.
   If you're aware of any such organization or standards for e-commerce
security, please share with me what you know. Until next time, have a
great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* LOCAL PROCEDURE CALL ELEVATES PRIVILEGES
Bindview discovered a serious security problem within Windows NT 4.0.
Because of a flaw in the API call NtImpersonateClientOfPort, any local
system user can impersonate any other user on the machine, including
the LocalSystem account. The problem affects all NT 4.0 systems up to
and including Service Pack 6a (SP6a). Bindview tested its exploit on
Windows 2000 (Win2K) Release Candidate 2 (RC2) and found that the
system was not vulnerable. Microsoft is aware of the problem and has
released an FAQ, Support Online article Q247869, and hotfixes for Intel
and Alpha platforms.

* SUPER MAIL DENIAL OF SERVICE CONDITION
UssrLabs discovered a memory leak that might lead to a denial of
service (DoS) condition because of the way the service handles client
data. According to UssrLabs, the software appears to store all client
data in memory during a session and might not properly handle memory
allocation and deallocation during a session. The vendor, Nosque
Workshop, is aware of the problem but has not yet responded.

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: IIS CERTIFICATES CAN CRASH NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR
A bug in Internet Information Server (IIS) can cause Netscape
Communicator 4.7 browsers to crash while negotiating encryption using
digital certificates. The problem affects both Macintosh and Windows
versions of Netscape Communicator.
   By default, international versions of Netscape Communicator 4.7
accept 56-bit digital certificates, but IIS 4.0 does not correctly
support 56-bit certificates. Therefore, when Netscape Communicator
tries to negotiate the use of stronger 128-bit encryption, the browser
crashes.

* NEWS: E-LOCK TECHNOLOGIES INTRODUCES ASSURED OFFICE
Microsoft Office is the most popular office suite in use today. E-Lock
Technologies' Assured Office enhances the value of Office by adding
public key infrastructure (PKI)-based digital security to make Office a
comprehensive e-business solution. The seamless integration of Assured
Office digital signing and encryption features within Office enables

* REVIEW: LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES' NEWLY EXPANDED VPN LINE
In his review for InternetWeek, Salvatore Salamone covers Lucent
Technologies' newly expanded hardware-based VPN product line. According
to the review, "The new Secure VPN line offers a price/performance
range from less than $1000 for a VPN-enabled Pipeline router that can
handle 50 IP Security tunnels to about $45,000 for an Access Point
router designed to handle up to 4000 IPSec tunnels and a high-speed
interface such as OC-3 (155 Mbps)."

* TIP: BEFORE YOU SAY "IT'S SAFE"
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

With so many blatant security risks appearing on large e-commerce sites
lately, I think it's prudent to remind you of a basic security tip that
most diligent administrators practice. That practice is called double-
checking your system security.
   After you've built and configured a system (including any custom
application code), have at least one other party inspect that system
for security shortcomings before you declare the system safe for daily
use, especially if third parties have developed applications for your
system. Although you should inspect any systems yourself, both manually
and programmatically using the security scanners of your choice, don't
assume your checks are sufficient. To be safe, consider using a third
party to check your system.

8. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS NT MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows
NT Magazine online forums (http://www.winntmag.com/support).

January 14, 2000, 08:34 A.M.
BDC or Standard Server?
I just took a new job and the company has four Windows NT servers. I
know which one the PDC is. Where do I look to see if the others were
installed as BDCs or standard servers? Do you have to set up
replication for a BDC to copy the SAM?
