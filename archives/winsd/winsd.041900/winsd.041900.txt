1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

For a brief moment last week, it appeared as though someone had discovered 
a genuine back door in a Microsoft Web product. As it turns out, the 
product has no back door, but it does have some interesting code and a 
nasty buffer overflow condition.
   The story broke last Thursday night when a researcher informed Microsoft 
that he thought a particular component that ships with various Web 
platforms had a back door. Apparently, someone found a suspicious string of 
words inside a file (dvwssr.dll, part of Visual InterDev 1.0), thought that 
it might represent telltale signs of a back door, and tipped off the 
researcher. The hacker investigated the code and reported his findings to 
Microsoft. The string inside the DLL clearly read, "Netscape engineers are 
weenies!" and after some investigation, the researcher learned that the 
string obscured a URL-based file request sent to the DLL in question.
   According to Microsoft, barely an hour after it received the initial bug 
report, a reporter from the Wall Street Journal called to ask for a denial 
or confirmation of the alleged back door. By Friday afternoon, Microsoft 
had openly confirmed that a bug did exist in the DLL file. In Security 
Bulletin MS00-025 (released Friday), the company said that the DLL in 
question might let a Web author access certain files of other Web sites on 
the same server, if the relevant server files had incorrect permission 
settings.
   As it turns out, the embedded phrase is not a true back door, only a key 
string used to obscure part of a URL. Someone with knowledge of the 
obscuring routine still needs specific file access permission to exploit 
the routine. No risk exists until an administrator sets file access 
permissions in a particular way. But that isn't the end of the story.
   Researchers began looking for other problems with the dvwssr.dll file 
and quickly found them. By late Friday afternoon, a message was circulating 
on various mailing lists that stated a buffer overflow condition exists in 
the dvwssr.dll file. Apparently, an attacker can launch a Denial of Service 
(DoS) attack against the server by sending the DLL a URL parameter string 
of 5000 characters. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the buffer 
overflow can let an attacker run code on a remote system.
   After news of the overflow condition reached Microsoft, the company 
revised its original security bulletin with the new risk details. In 
addition, the company recommended that because Visual InterDev 1.0 is so 
old and probably not widely used, administrators should delete the 
dvwssr.dll file from servers to eliminate associated risks.
   The entire scenario flushed out arguments for and against two old sore 
spots in the security community: full and immediate vulnerability 
information disclosure, and the potential benefits of open source projects 
when it comes to secure coding practices. As soon as this story hit the 
news outlets Friday morning, the debates began on several public forums.
   People cried foul because they felt the initial vulnerability report was 
misleading and confusing. They used the incident to claim that full and 
immediate vulnerability disclosure is detrimental. Yet proponents said that 
without such disclosure, researchers wouldn't have found the buffer 
overflow condition in the first place. I think both sides have valid 
arguments. Sometimes a risk needs to be held in confidence for a period of 
time for a good reason; in other incidents, the best course is to release 
full risk information immediately. Both approaches depend on the 
circumstances involved, so no static rule applies across the board.
   On the open source issue, supporters believe that making source code 
available for review reduces the number of security risks in that code 
because more eyes will find more problems. But is this really true?
   Elias Levy, CTO, SecurityFocus, pointed out in a recent commentary about 
open source projects that there is no guarantee that people will review 
open source code from a security perspective. Nor is there any guarantee 
that people will report any security problems they find. Keep in mind that 
black hats review code to exploit bugs, not report them. The bottom line is 
that peer review of source code is only as valuable as the skill set and 
morals of the peer performing the review.
   The real priority with developing solid code is to educate developers 
about the finer points of secure programming so that they avoid common 
programming pitfalls, such as buffer overflows. This approach stops basic 
security problems before they originate instead of depending on peer review 
to discover them. Providing developers with better knowledge and improved 
tool sets will quickly decrease the number of security-related problems we 
encounter, which means that everyone can enjoy a safer network. Until next 
time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* BUFFER OVERFLOW CONDITION IN MICROSOFT WEB COMPONENT
Core SDI reported a buffer overflow condition in a component of Microsoft's 
Visual InterDev 1.0. The component, dvwssr.dll, provides support for Visual 
InterDev's Link View feature. Because of an unchecked buffer, an intruder 
can crash the Microsoft IIS Web service or cause arbitrary code to execute 
on the server by sending the component an abnormally long URL. The problem 
affects any IIS system that has the Windows NT 4.0 Option Kit installed, 
Windows 9x Personal Web Servers, and any system with FrontPage 98 Server 
Extensions installed.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/iis4-9.htm

* REGISTRY PERMISSIONS COULD EXPOSE CRYPTOGRAHPIC KEYS
Sergio Tabanelli discovered that loose permissions on a particular Registry 
key let a user compromise the cryptographic keys of other users on the same 
system. The Registry key is used to indicate an external DLL-based driver 
definition for a hardware-based encryption accelerator. The drivers have 
access to cryptographic keys stored on the system, and an intruder could 
develop a Trojan driver because the Registry key is not protected against 
manipulation by regular users. The problem affects all editions of Windows 
NT 4.0. Microsoft has issued a patch for Intel and Alpha, as well as 
Support Online article Q259496.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/reg1.htm

* EXCESSIVE ESCAPE CHARACTERS CAN SLOW IIS
Vanja Hrustic reported a problem with IIS where an intruder can use a 
malformed URL that contains a large number of escape characters to increase 
Web service overhead. When parsing a URL with an excessive number of escape 
character sequences, IIS consumes most all of the available CPU cycles on 
the server. Microsoft has released a patch for IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 as well 
as Support Online article Q254142.

   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/2c.asp?f=/news.asp?IDF=119&TB=news

* NEWS: SOFTWARE PIRATES THRIVE ON AUCTION SITES
The Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) recently conducted a 
survey to determine how much software sold at online auction sites was 
pirated. A review of sale items at auction sites on Amazon.com, eBay, 
Yahoo, and Excite@Home between March 31 and April 3 determined that 91 
percent of the packages were not legal to sell. The figure represents a 31 
percent increase over the previous survey conducted in August 1999.

* TIP: HOW TO RESTORE DEFAULT FILE PERMISSION SETTINGS
(contributed by http://www.ntfaq.com)

A user wants to know how to restore the default security settings for files 
and directories. Restoring security settings is easy if you have a copy of 
the Windows NT Resource Kit. The Resource Kit contains a file called 
fixacls.exe that will reset file and directory permissions based on the 
definitions in the perms.inf file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\INF\ directory.

* WINDOWS 2000 SECURITY: ADVANCES IN ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY
In his latest Web exclusive column, Randy Franklin Smith points out that 
one of the worst problems with Windows NT security turns out to be one of 
the best enhancements in Windows 2000. The enhancement involves how Win2K 
handles administrative authority. When you understand how NT handles 
administrative authority and the changes Microsoft made in Win2K, you'll 
begin to see the opportunities you have for improving security in your 
network. Be sure to read Smith's new column on our Web site.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/win2ksec.asp

* WRITING SECURE CODE: AVOID BUFFER OVERRUNS WITH STRING SAFETY
In his latest column, David LeBlanc says that string handling is one of the 
most error-prone aspects of C and C++ programming. String-handling errors 
account for most of the buffer overruns that result in security problems. 
LeBlanc has lots of good advice for developers who want to avoid pitfalls 
in writing Win32-based code. Be sure to stop by and read LeBlanc's latest 
column.

* WIN2KSECADVICE MAILING LIST
Each week we offer a quick recap of some of the highlights from the
Win2KSecAdvice mailing list. The following thread is in the spotlight this 
week:

Dvwssr.dll Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in IIS Web Servers
We've been playing a little more, trying to exploit this buffer overflow, 
and because we don't have InterDev installed on our system, we copied the 
.dll to the /msadc directory. With this configuration, we have been able to 
make the code jump to our buffer. Under these circumstances, the actual 
buffer overflow will allow us to execute arbitrary code in the target 
machine.

* HOWTO MAILING LIST
Each week we offer a quick recap of some of the highlights from the
HowTo for Security mailing list. The following threads are in the
spotlight this week:

1. How to Wipe Disks
I work for a government agency that is about to get rid of a bunch of old 
PCs. We now have a new security policy stating that the content of the 
disks has to be wiped out before the PCs leave the agency. Does anybody 
know a good utility that could do this job?
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/L.asp?A2=IND0004B&L=HOWTO&P=3133

2. Single Sign-on
I have a hybrid network (Windows NT with some Novell and HP-UX), and I was 
wondering if anyone is familiar with a way (or third-party product) to 
synchronize a password change across all platforms? I'm concerned only 
about OS-level passwords and unconcerned with the application level.
