1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

Do you use Ethernet switches to help protect network traffic from 
prying eyes? For a long time, switches have been a tactic against 
snoops. A switched network separates traffic so that a user on one 
segment can't easily sniff traffic on another segment. To sniff traffic 
on a switched network, a user must either place a sniffer on the actual 
target segment or get machines on the target segment to send traffic 
through your network segment or your system. Instructing a remote 
machine to forward packets your way used to be difficult; you had to 
somehow change the remote host's gateway. Not an easy task, unless you 
have a copy of arpredirect. 
   Arpredirect is an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning tool. 
The tool can instruct a remote system to change its gateway address by 
sending the host the appropriate ARP packets. For example, an intruder 
can use arpredirect to instruct a remote host to forward all packets to 
the intruder's IP address. The intruder can analyze or save the 
packets, then forward them to their final destination without the 
remote user's knowledge. 
   Dug Song originally developed the arpredirect tool in December 1999. 
The tool is part of his dsniff package, which is available at Song's 
Web site (http://naughty.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff). I had forgotten 
about arpredirect until I recently read an article by Stuart McClure 
and Joel Shambray in a competing publication. The two men point out 
that we need to be aware of arpredirect and the entire dsniff package 
because it can be dangerous in the wrong hands. 
   In a nutshell, dsniff is the Swiss army knife of privacy invasion. 
The package ships with a handful of powerful tools, including urlsnarf, 
webspy, mailsnarf, and the dsniff tool. Urlsnarf grabs every URL that 
passes across the wire and stores it for later examination. Webspy can 
grab URLs off the wire and open the URL in your local browser window so 
you can follow along and view what a remote user is seeing on his or 
her Web browser. Mailsnarf is just as nasty as webspy--it can sniff 
SMTP-related packets off the wire and reassemble entire email messages 
into a common format that popular mail clients can read. The dsniff 
tool is one of the most powerful password grabbers I've seen. It can 
snag passwords off the wire from many different protocols, including 
FTP, Telnet, Web, POP3, IMAP, LDAP, Citrix ICA, pcAnywhere, SMB, Oracle 
SQL*Net, and numerous others.
   Even though the tools found in the dsniff package are written for 
UNIX platforms, you still need to be aware that these tools exist 
because they could be used against your Windows-based networks. Song's 
package is incredibly powerful, whether used with good or bad intent. 
The tools point out a well-known problem with networks in general: 
malicious users can easily sniff clear text from packets to glean 
sensitive data. Although blocking ARP redirects and monitoring ARP 
traffic and tables can help protect against tools like arpredirect, 
those tactics are certainly not cure-alls. They help prevent packets 
from becoming misdirected, but most data still travels in clear text 
over your networks, which means localized intruders can glean sensitive 
data with packet-sniffing tools. To better protect your data, you must 
encrypt it at some level before sending it out on the wire, and you 
must use sniffer-detecting tools to help stop the snoops.
   The decision about which tactics to use for data protection depends 
on your data and your organization, so I can't give you much more 
advice on the matter. Just be aware that ARP poisoning and data 
sniffing are real problems that you need to guard against. Until next 
time, have a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* WINDOWS COMPUTER BROWSER DENIAL OF SERVICE
Under the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, every domain on 
a Windows subnet has a Master Browser and can also have one or more 
backup browsers. A malicious user can deny service on network browsers 
by sending those systems a ResetBrowser command (called a frame) 
because you can't configure a browser to ignore ResetBrowser frames. 
Microsoft has issued a patch for the problem.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/win2k-4.htm

* MASTER BROWSER DENIAL OF SERVICE
A user can send a large number of bogus HostAnnouncement frames 
(commands) to a Master Browser, where the subsequent replication 
traffic between the Master Browser and any backup browsers can consume 
a large amount of network bandwidth and cause other problems as well. 
Microsoft has issued a patch for the problem.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/winnt4-5.htm

* WEBSHIELD SMTP BUFFER OVERFLOW CONDITION
By telneting to a machine that runs the WebShield SMTP management 
agent, a person can access current server configuration information. In 
addition, an unchecked buffer exists that can let code pass to the 
service for execution. If a user sends 208 bytes or more with one of 
the configuration parameters, the service crashes, overwriting the 
stack. NAI is aware of the problem; however, no fix is available yet. 
In the meantime, run the WebShield SMTP service under a restricted 
account or disable the service.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/webshield1.htm

* BUFFER OVERFLOWS IN PDGSOFT SHOPPING CART
PDGSoft's shopping cart ships with two executables that contain 
unchecked buffers that let an intruder inject code for execution on the 
server. The two executables are redirect.exe and changepw.exe and are 
accessible via the Web. PDGSoft has issued patches for all versions of 
the shopping cart software.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/load.asp?iD=/security/pdgsoft1.htm

* MAILSITE BUFFER OVERFLOW
Rockcliffe Mailsite lets remote users access POP3 accounts to read 
email via the Web. The service, which listens on port 90, contains a 
buffer overflow condition that lets an attacker execute arbitrary code 
on the server. Rockcliffe has released a patch to correct the problem.

4. ========== SECURITY ROUNDUP ==========

* NEWS: BEWARE OF KILLER RESUMES
A new worm based on the Melissa strain is circulating the Internet. The 
worm spreads in files attached to email messages with the subject 
"Resume--Janet Simons." According to Symantec, the attachment is a Word 
97 document that arrives with any of several file names, including 
explorer.doc, resume.doc, resume1.doc, and normal.doc. The file 
contains a destructive macro virus that deletes files on the system and 
spreads the worm via email.

* NEWS: MICROSOFT DELAYS OUTLOOK SECURITY UPDATE
Microsoft delayed the release of its Outlook 2000 and Outlook 98 
Security Update so it can add new functionality that lets 
administrators better control the update's new features. Administrators 
can make different configurations available depending on a user's 
profile. For example, administrators can define which file types a user 
can receive, execute, or save to disk. In addition, customizable 
dialogs warn the user when access attempts are made against the address 
book. Microsoft has not stated when the update will be available, but 
speculators estimate that it will be available this week.

* TIP: MICROSOFT'S ONLINE SECURITY PAPERS
(contributed by mark@ntsecurity.net)

Many people still aren't familiar with Windows 2000-related security. 
To help get up to speed, Microsoft has made lots of information 
available online. For example, in one streaming media presentation, 
Microsoft's Darol Timberlake discusses various Win2K security 
enhancements, such as Kerberos, the new Encrypting File System (EFS), 
the IP Security (IPSec) protocol, group policies, and security 
templates. You can find Timberlake's presentation at the first URL 
listed below. 
   In addition, Microsoft's Web site has dozens of papers that give 
users in-depth information and deployment procedures for Windows 2000 
Security Services, including security management using the Microsoft 
Security Configuration Tool Set and support for IPSec, EFS, public key 
infrastructure (PKI), smart cards, and Kerberos. You can find this 
supplemental reading at the second URL listed below.

* WINDOWS 2000 SECURITY: CREATING A CUSTOM PASSWORD-RESET MMC
In a previous column, Randy Franklin Smith explained how to give your 
Help desk staff the authority to handle forgotten passwords without 
giving them sweeping administrative privileges. But what if your 
company wants to delegate password-reset authority or a similar task to 
users other than the Help desk staff? By creating a custom Microsoft 
Management Console (MMC), you can provide designated users with a 
simplified, streamlined interface for quickly handling these password 
resets. In his latest column, Randy outlines how to create such a 
customized MMC.

7. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows 
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support). 

May 25, 2000, 09:02 A.M. 
User Passwords 
In our NT domain with a PDC and BDC, when Windows 98 workstations 
attempt to change their domain passwords, they get an error: "Unable to 
change the password for the following reason: Access has been denied." 
In User Manager, we have allowed users to change their passwords. We 
are on SP6a. Any thoughts?

spotlight this week.

1. Using a Logon Script to Update Virus Signature Files
I am trying to use a logon script that will update our virus signature 
files on each computer. I downloaded the update from Norton and would 
like to run this update when a user logs on, but I do not want it to 
prompt the user at all. Does anyone know a switch that I can use to 
disable the prompts? Or am I going about this all wrong?
http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/l.asp?A2=IND0005d&L=HOWTO&P=3417
