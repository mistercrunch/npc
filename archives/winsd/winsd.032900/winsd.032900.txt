1. ========== IN FOCUS ==========

Hello everyone,

A focal point for any network security administrator is the network 
perimeter. Companies spend a lot of time guarding against traffic that 
might enter their networks and not enough time guarding against traffic 
that might leave their networks.
   Typically, a company establishes a perimeter defense by blocking all 
inbound traffic, then letting only specific traffic types reach specific 
internal systems. To ease management headaches down the road, the company 
defines traffic rules that let any and all outbound traffic leave the 
network. After all, allowing all outbound traffic means no future rule 
definitions will be required to meet future needs. This approach also means 
the cost of managing perimeter security will be lower because no one will 
need to define new outbound rules. But think about that action for a 
moment. Are the savings really worth the risk in today's world?
   If there were only one reason that clearly points out the need to lock 
down outbound traffic as securely as you lock down inbound traffic, then 
that reason is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Without an 
open port to move traffic out of, your network is far less likely to become 
a participant in such an attack.
   But DDoS attacks are not the only reason to restrict outbound traffic. 
Consider the risks of uncontrolled email or file transfers that might let 
someone inside your network move proprietary information offsite without 
proper consent. Do you have policies regarding email use? Do you screen 
outbound email for improper content? Do you block outbound FTP and other 
forms of file transfer? And what about improper Web or other multimedia 
use? Do you guard against those actions with security policies and 
software-based controls? Doing so might help reduce the chance of potential 
lawsuits against your company, which could include charges of defamation, 
sexual harassment, slander, and more. Without controls, you have to trust 
that an employee won't take an inappropriate action at an inappropriate 
time. Can you afford that risk?
   The bottom line is that you must protect against unwanted outbound 
traffic as fiercely as you protect against unwanted inbound traffic. 
Consider adding various content filters to your overall security arsenal. 
Content filtering tools can screen and prevent the movement of both inbound 
and outbound traffic over a variety of protocols, including Web, SMTP, 
POP3, and more. By using such technology you can significantly reduce a 
huge portion of the risk associated with general Internet connectivity.
   Before I sign off this week, I'd like to announce two new columnists for 
Windows 2000 Magazine's NTSecurity.net Web site. I'm pleased to inform you 
that Randy Franklin Smith and David LeBlanc have joined our Web team as 
regular columnists to bring you their hands-on experience gathered directly 
from the trenches.
   Randy looks at Win2K Security from the ground up to cover all the new 
bells, whistles, and techniques. David looks under the hood of writing 
secure Win32 code for Win2K and Windows NT platforms. If you're new to 
Win2K security administration or a code slinger looking to improve your 
application development for Win2K or NT, be sure to read the new 
columns--they're linked in the Toolkit section below. Until next time, have 
a great week.

Sincerely,
Mark Joseph Edwards, News Editor

2. ========== SECURITY RISKS =========
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

* MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000 EXPOSES HIDDEN DRIVES
The original release of Microsoft's Office 2000 contains a bug that lets a 
user see hidden drives, even when those drives are hidden through the "Hide 
these specified drives in My Computer" group policy setting. According to 
Microsoft Support Online article Q249949, the problem occurs when the My 
Documents folder is located on a restricted drive.
   Microsoft corrected the problem with the release of Microsoft Office 
2000 Service Release 1 (SR-1), which you can download from the company's 
Web site, as explained in Support Online Article Q245025.

* SECURITY POLL: SHOULD COMPANIES BE ABLE TO SUE HACKERS FOR REVERSE 
ENGINEERING?
As we've mentioned in the past, information security is setting several new 
legal precedents because of the actions of hackers. Some people agree that 
hackers act as a loosely knit, rogue consumer protection agency by testing 
the strength of various security solutions and openly reporting what they 
find.
   Is it OK for companies to sue hackers who test the strength of their 
security products and solutions when those hackers expose their findings? 
Let us know what you think. Cast your vote on our home page today.

* TIP: PROTECT AGAINST UNWANTED DISK ACCESS
(contributed by Mark Joseph Edwards, mark@ntsecurity.net)

I can't begin to count the number of file system-related security holes 
that never became a problem on my systems. For example, older versions of 
IIS were known to expose sensitive information through the use of a URL 
that ended in a period or a "::$DATA" suffix. In addition, this week we 
cover a problem with Microsoft Office 2000 that exposes hidden drives to 
users who shouldn't be exposed to such resources. None of these problems 
affects an adequately protected Windows NT computer system.
   So how do you introduce adequate protection? By assuming the worst-case 
scenario and setting permissions accordingly. For example, you can 
certainly hide a drive from users, but you already know that obscurity 
offers very little security. Therefore, you must establish strict access 
permissions for the hidden drive to ensure only authorized users can access 
the data in the event that the drive is discovered.
   You can apply similar logic to IIS and other Web server platforms that 
support the use of embedded code for server-side processing, such as 
Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology on IIS. ASP lets 
developers embed application code for specialized server-side processing, 
such as performing database queries against a SQL Server. You probably 
don't want users viewing your SQL query code because it might contain 
sensitive user credentials for connecting to a given SQL Server.
   To protect your Web code, put the code in a directory that disallows 
Read permission to Web site users. The Read permission settings block IIS 
from sending the unprocessed code to users, which prevents unwanted eyes 
from seeing that code. By doing so, you can prevent the IIS risks I 
mentioned previously and simultaneously guard against any future similar 
vulnerabilities.
   Be sure to inspect your file systems carefully to ensure you've set the 
strictest possible permissions. And remember to work from a worst-case 
scenario viewpoint when deciding which permissions to apply to disk drives, 
whether or not those drives are hidden.

* HOWTO: WINDOWS 2000 GROUP POLICIES
You've read Randy Franklin Smith's security-related articles in Windows 
2000 Magazine. Now you'll find even more of Randy's expert opinion and 
hands-on advice at NTSecurity.net. In his new biweekly column, Randy covers 
Win2K security from the ground up.
   As you know, Win2K has numerous new security features and an entirely 
new way of handling overall security architecture through Active Directory 
(AD). In his first column, Randy covers the basics of Group Policy under 
Win2K and discusses differences from Windows NT 4.0 policies.
   http://www.ntsecurity.net/go/win2ksec.asp

* HOWTO: GOOD PROGRAMMING AND THE RULES FOR WRITING SECURE CODE
Windows 2000 Magazine welcomes David LeBlanc to our team! As you know, 
David is a senior technologist at Microsoft, working with information 
security. In his new biweekly column, David looks under the hood of Win32 
application development to cover issues and concerns centered on writing 
secure code.
   In his first installment, David focuses on writing secure code using C 
and C++. Microsoft used C and C++ to develop Windows 2000 (Win2K) and 
Windows NT, and developers can most easily access the OSs' security 
features using these languages. Be sure to stop by and read David's first 
column.

8. ========== HOT THREADS ==========

* WINDOWS 2000 MAGAZINE ONLINE FORUMS

The following text is from a recent threaded discussion on the Windows 
2000 Magazine online forums (http://www.win2000mag.com/support). 

March 21, 2000, 01:38 P.M. 
Adding Permissions 
Is there a way to just blindly add a user/group to the permissions of 
subfolders without disrupting the current permission setup? For example, 
can I add Domain Admins to a group of user folders without changing the 
current setup of permissions and without disrupting the users of those 
folders? I do not want to remove any permissions, just add one.
