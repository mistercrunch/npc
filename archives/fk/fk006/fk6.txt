:: The Operating System maintains a table of segment names and their true   ::

:: Let's look a bit at this last point. Because everything goes through the ::

:: segment of another user's memory if deemed necessary, but still not be   ::
:: able to touch anything else of theirs. There is a much greater potential ::
