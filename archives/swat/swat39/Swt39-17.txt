Well, i guess that SWATs changed once again! well now
the magazine comes out "article by article" as well as
the nicely release in a zip at the end of each month,
also we'll be putting out more than just txt files!

well kinda. Anything that we release will be done via
the magazine, i.e it will be advertised and made
avalible from these pages, but depending on what we
intend to release, will depend on what comes out. 

I.E heres a few situations for you:

1) I code a program and want you to all try it out.

Ok if this happens then i'll pop the program on the
swateam.org site, but a little bullitin on the page
and pop a review of it as well as a link to the
proggy from the mag.

2) We get our grubby hands on a copy of Office XP
   and Whister Adv. Server, we strip all protection
   and pack it up.

Ok what now? we can't post it here will 0-day ddlz
from our server, well we have one or two options, first
we could choose to just announce that on KribNET, and
you can access files from there, if that happens then we
WON'T be posting anything in the mag. IF on the other
hand we decide that we might be extra nice for you all,
we might upload the warez to an FTP server and fill it
up with even more 0-day stuff and keep it working for
about a week or so before we let it die (FTP will be
leech of course :) )
But as far as warez goes, 99% of it will be kept out
of the mag, unless we feel a sudden urge to present you
all with a "unique to swat FTP server" at which point
we'll just post an advert for it in here and pass it out
on the mailing list. 

Basically. SWAT is going to be bringing a lot more info
and a lot more of, well, everything really. As readers
of the 'zine you'll be kept upto date on everything
and be told whats going on, also you will find more
us posting adverts for things as single articles
(don't worry, we don't mean spam like adverts, we mean
something like a public FTP we set up for you or such
like). 

Writers are also been hunted at the moment, if you want
to become part of the teams writers, then get in touch,
those of you who have done so all ready, please remember
that you actually need to send in work or such like
before your going to be considered.

What are we looking for in writers?

well can you cover any of the following:

(1) hacking
(2) Phreaking
(3) anarchy (theorys, views, etc)
(4) pyrotechnics (thats the stuff that goes bang)
(5) Humourous stuff
(6) cracking
(7) Anything cool thats not listed here
(8) Something unique


Basically, you don't have to be 100% hardcore underground
bod, it helps, but its not needed. As long as you can write
something that people are gonna enjoy, then its fine with us.
