So... your wanting to apply to join us? you've gone
over our application form and your just about to fill
it in and take a stab at becomming a fully fledged
member of SWAT. Of course we have many positions open
within the group, and somehow, we need them filling,
so, here's my list of jobs, and what they entale!

Couriers
~~~~~~~~

Actually, the job is more courier / scavenger with
things. This is mainly warez related and requires
little more than sitting on your arse all day with
mIRC and FlashFXP open. All you'll have to do is
locate warez, then somehow get those warez onto FTP
sites, how you do that is entirely up to you, whether
you choose to download then upload, or just FXP it
over to the drop site, as long as it gets to its
target by its deadline thats all we care about.

Since there will be a few of you, then jobs won't be
too stressful. Couriers will be working closely with
the KribNET side of things, BUT a lot of there work
will be related to other things such as getting our
own programs circulated down different channels. 

Since all of the FTPs will be either hi-jacked or
private you don't have to stress too much over things,
you will however have to find your own FTPs to hi-jack
and upload to (unless they are private), BUT - incase
that sounds too hard - its a fully automated procedure
carried out by running a simple program when your
online.

Pros : Well you'll get all of the latest 0-day warez
       as well as having access to all of the drop
       sites, giving you access to everything you could
       possibly want.

Cons : Might seem a little tedious and time consuming,
       unless you have a fast connection then you will
       be stuck at FXPing warez most of the time or
       ensuring smaller coded programs get out there.


Advertiser
~~~~~~~~~~

Laid back job, time spent surfing the net, chatting on
IRC or just about anything else that you probably do
anyway! All that needs doing is advertising the site,
nothing more, nothing less. E-mail webmasters asking
for link exchanges, do a bit of name dropping on IRC
or anything else really. As long as people get to the
site, then we're happy. Posting to a few newsgroups will
also be required.

Pros : You get to meet lots of interesting people and not
       actually do that much work.

Cons : Some targets might have strict deadlines, other than
       that, things are easy. Oh, and you'll have to ass-lick
       webmasters of other sites.


Advertising Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importand sounding? well just imagine what the advertisers
job is, then add a few other things to it like getting the
site listed on top lists, in banner exchange programs etc
etc. Then thats your job! 

Pros : Same as Advertisers really

Cons : More work than advertiser.


Hacker
~~~~~~

Nice job involving the 0wnership of NT boxes, spend life
cracking into servers, lobbing an FTP daemon on there as
well as a few backdoors, rooting out vital information
about the company(ies) and there users. make off with
anything and everything thats useful. 

Why NT? well if you can do *nix boxes, then the positions
open for you.

Pros : Well you should be able t answer that

Cons : Unless you already know what your doing don't apply
       for this post as you won't get it.


General Writer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Becomming a back bone of the group, yup, text files are
what this group churns out mostly, and keeping the mag in
top condition and full up with text is what your job
entails! Write about anything relevent to the magazine,
pick a topic, then write about it. You don't have to
specialise with a single thing, as long as you can produce
your own work, then its fine by us. Work required is atleast
THREE articles a month, just type them up, then e-mail them
to either myself or Phreak.

Pros : If you like to write and get your work out, then this
       is THE easiest way. Just type up txt's and send them in.

Cons : As any person who writes a lot of files knows, you can
       run out of ideas from time to time, but everyone gets
       over that.

Coder
~~~~~

Well sometimes we need custom programs creating, if you can
take a list of specifications and a few well asked questions,
then come up with a program to meet the requirements within
a reasonable length of time, then this jobs for you :) let
the world know how good of a coder you are!

Pros : Your programs will get circulated well, and advertised
       a lot. Oh yeah, and you can use and abuse as many of
       us as beta testers as you want!

Cons : You need to produce the documentaion as well as a fully
       working program (to the specifications) by the date that
       your set.


Graphics
~~~~~~~~

If your a wizard on Photoshop or any other elite graphic
package and your capable of making the most visually stunning
graphics and you want as many people to see your work as
possible, then i guess this is your chance :) 
Your job will be making graphics for programs, the website,
banners, etc etc. just about anything really. 90% of the time
you'll be free to create such things how you want to, in your
style, using whatever means you wish.

Pros : More or less anything that you create for us will be
       seen by a hell of a lot of people.

Cons : Need to prduce graphics by a date thats set.


NOTE: We're also on the lookout for ASCII artists as well!
