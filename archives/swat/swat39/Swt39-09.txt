Okay kids... Now its time to grow your own, and believe you me I AM the 

man to ask if you have any questions after reading this please be free 
to e-mail me directly and i will help you out. Lets begin.

1.) You will first need to obtain seeds. Get them from your friends, 
tell them 
    to save the seeds they get in their weed. If not maybe a dealer will 
sell 
    you some.

2.) Next you need to germinate the seeds, this is the easy part. Just 
take 
    the seeds and place them in a piece of paper towel that has been 
soaked 
    in water. *NOTE some seeds may germinate in 24 hours, others may 
take
    a few days. (The seeds are germinated when they start to sprout.)

3.) Plant the sprouts.  As soon as a seed cracks open and begins to 
sprout, 
    place it on some moist soil and sprinkle a little soil over the top 
of it.  

4.) Supply the plants with light. Flourescent lights are the best.  
    Hang the lights with two inches of the soil and after the  plants 
appear 
    above the ground,  continue to keep the lights with two inches of 
the plants.
    It is as easy as that. If  you  follow  those four steps you  will  
grow 
    some weed. You dont have to grow inside, if you can't (due to 
parents)
    then they can be grown outside. Just build a small green house, make 
sure
    they get a lot of sun light! and don't drown from rain.
    To ensure prime quality and the highest yield in the shortest time 
period,
    however, a few  details are necessary.

Soil  

  Your prime concern,  after choosing high quality  seeds,  is the 
soil.
  Use the best soil you can get.  Scrimping on the soil doesn't  pay 
off
  in the long run.   If you use unsterilized  soil you will almost 
certainly
  find parasites in it, probably after it is too late to transplant 
your
  marijuana.  You can find excellent soil for sale at your local plant 
shop
  or  nursery,  K-Mart,  Wal Mart, and even some grocery stores.  The 
soil you 
  use should have these properties for the best possible results:  

1.   It should drain well.   That is, it should have some sand in it and 
also 
     some sponge rock or pearlite. 
2.   The  ph should be between 6.5 and 7.5 since  marijuana  does not do 
well
     in acidic soil.  High acidity in soil encourages the plant to be 
predominantly
     male, an undesirable trait. 
3.   The  soil should also contain humus for  retaining  moisture and 
nutrients.

*Remember LIGHT is essential, you can add fertilizer if you wish, but 
too much can
in turn cause your soil to become acidic.

- A good plcae to grow plants is in a closet, paint the floor black (or 
a black rug) 
and paint the walls white, this will insure that light is distributed to 
the plant 
in a better way. And have a light in the roof. Use a fairly high watt. 
*NOTE this 
may cause a bad odor, or good to some, so be carful cause landlords, 
parents, and 
cops may find out and you will be fucked.


This is a simple guide for beginners, and i will send you a very 
detailed one
upon request.

Happy growing !!
