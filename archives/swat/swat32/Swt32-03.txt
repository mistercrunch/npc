 Yeh, OK, i got arrested, and for what... Grand theft, Arsen, no "the
theft of various dessicant silica gell packs and a BT linemans handset".
 Ive managed to turn this article into a few parts to make it so that
it isnt such a big read!

 This is what happened... Me (Goblinz), F_S, Monkey and Foggy were all
in a pub and were deciding what to do,, we all ended up going back to
F_S's house, his parents were coming back in the morning and he decided
he couldnt trust us not to trash his house, so we all decided to go
Beige boxing, Monkey had passed his driving test earlier that day, so
we now had added mobility. 
 After grabbing the beige box, a hex wrench (13mm) and some of those
fold up plyers, and the dictaphone, (watch out for the sound philes
soon!!!!) we set off to find a secluded area.
 We mangaed to get into the box and fairly well set up, removing gell
packs into the car  when a taxi went past,,,  so we all jumped ionto
the car and drove off for 1/2 an hour, then came back, this turned out
to be a mistake!!! We saw another car go by and dived back into our
car... And then a white tranny van.. OH SHIT.
F_S jumped out and pretended to take a piss on the cab box but the
police orificers stopped to come and say hi. Monkey behaved like a good
upstanding citizen and opened his window.. "Can i help you oficers". The
police cuntables said they had a report about suspicious characters
playing with a cab box, and went over to inspect the box... it was wide
open with wires exposed. They then went about their business and asked
us one by one to get outa the car and to be questioned,, Monkey came up
with the wonderful reasoning of, "I hope you guys havent been putting
any shit in my car" (as if he hadnt noticed!) Any way we decided that
we'd say that we just found everything near the open box. Whilst F_S was
been questioned i manged to hide my two hunting knives down  the back of
the seat... My turn, they just asked for my name and adress, i thought
iut best to give proper details!
 ANyway after they had got our details and another van and a people
carriuer arrived they said something about ther theft on the highways act
[enter a random number here] and that they could search the car aswell
as uds for tools cos the box had been tampered with, they found the beige
box and the gell packs. They asked who had taken the packs, they had my
prints all over them so i 0wned up. "What =, are you an engineer or
something?", "well i am doing an engineering course officer", "Im placing
you under arrest for suspission of theft" (oh shit! =)
 He then asked for me to empty my pockets and searched my bag.. Well he
got mne to empty my pockets into his hands and then walked off round the
corner, im sure im £10 short now. then the bag, well he searched it and
missed tha pir8 cds and the firebomb/shrapnel bombs in the pocket. aswell
as 2 hunting knives in the care nad beige box plans on the shelf...

  "i'm not gonna take you in now, but i'll come and collect you from your
house in the morning",
 "Well cant you take me in now?",
 "ok then"
"You gonna put handcuffs on me???"   ;P
"No, not if you dont struggle"
 HE then grabbed my arm and twised it in a funny way and held it there,
 shit that hurt.
any way in the police van, witht he rest of the lads in their car behind me.,
i was quite comftable,, untilk they started drivingf!!!
 That bastard police man was doing at least 70 up a country road, round a
round about twice and then back in the oposite direction to that station,
my face was been bounced off the cage wall.. The rest of trhe lads varifeied
the spped.
  Anyway, 1.30 AM at the station, the orificers opened up the door and said,
"we're gonna do u a favour!" and left me there for 10 mimnutes, the rest of
the gus arrived so i started shouting "hello, let me out, anyone there",
kinda thing... I didnt realise that noone can see you through the tinted
glass, so i was ignored.. nayway the cuntables returned and the lads went
back to the car, they gave me two choices.. "he arrests us all takes prints
and it goes through the courts or i admit to everything and just get a formal
warning.."  so, i did the latter.
 In his own words, he then un-arrested me and asked me for my adress and
name.. "but ive already given it to that othe cop!"  "just give it to me"
 (OOOHHHHHHH ERRRRRR0) So i spelt out every word of my adress leeter for
letter. ANt then got released with no makr on my record.
   So we returned home and went online to brag on irc,, big time!!!





 Anyway... these thoughts always come after the event, but foggy said afterwards
that we should have told them we work for Cable and Wireless
