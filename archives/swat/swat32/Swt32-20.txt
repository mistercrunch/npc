Hi Y'all,

This is my first article, so it's likely to be shit
compared to some other stuff.
First off I am part of a VERY small Anarchist group
called the
'Disciples of Destruction' which me and two friends
set up. It consists of Arcane Warrior (me), Sacred
Assassin and Mongross. We generally go around setting
fire to shit loads of things and then watching the
fire crews and cops put it out at 3:25am. We are not
looking for members, purely cos we think 3 is enough,
but when we plan a bank job or something that needs a
lot of people, the extra person could be handy. IF you
live in the immediate area of Gosport or Portsmouth
(that’s the south of England for all you budding
geographers), AND like burning stuff and ruining other
peoples lives, then e-mail me @ the address at the
end.

Right, enough of the crap.

Winsuite
^^^^^^^^
This is a Windows 9x security program made by Dacoll
that is mostly popular with skoolz. The basic
description is that it looks the same as a normal
Windows desktop but without:
My Computer,
Network Neighbourhood,
My Documents,
Recycle Bin.

Also on the 'Start' menu it has only:

Shutdown - which includes the log off option,
Minimise Window – When you click in the minimise
button at the top-right of a program it falls ‘behind’
the desktop.

So you're probably wondering what is actually on the
desktop. It only has shortcuts to the programs the
Administrator has selected, a large logo in the
top-right corner (ours is the crappy school logo which
I changed to the ‘Anarchist A’ a few times), a bar
next to the start button that says 'Main Menu', and
the name of the skool or whatever company it is. The
user can only open the apps that are on the desktop,
any other program that opens, like an ad window on
some web sites, is immediately closed by WinWiper.

WinWiper is the part of the program that controls all
the applications.
When a program is executed is checks it against a
pre-defined list.
If it's legal it keeps it open if not it closes. The
main reasons for having
WinWiper enabled is to stop kids or adults playing
games or downloading.

How to get around Winsuite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At my skool, I won't mention the name because there is
bound to be someone from here who is reading this and
can identify me. We have used this program in the main
IT lab room since Sept 1999 and from then on I have
tried different ways to get around it.

The security is actually pretty minimal. You can
access anything using Internet Explorer -except the
folders that are protected. Even the protected ones
are accessible, you only have to log on as that person
since you can't password it your log on.

Now, the problem on WinWiper.
I mentioned earlier that next to the 'Start' button
there is a bar saying
'Main Menu'. When you left click on this a very small
white text block appears in the top-left corner. This
is called the 'backdoor entry' although it isn't. The
password is typed into this but rather than just using
a cracker every time you press a wrong key an 'About
WinSuite' appears centre-screen. This makes it VERY
easy to get the password. I already know all the
passwords cos the Admin tells me. I bring him loads of
software and he gives my loads of passwords and
control!
Once you have the password cracked a message box
appears and then about
8 text boxes appear which are all the .ini's and some
.bat's. You CAN fuck around this way although it WILL
fuck up YOUR machine.
I've tried to stop WinSuite from loading by removing
from the registry, because
I think it re-writes them when you shut it down.
If you close all the text boxes and then download
something it works! WinWiper is closed when you bring
up the boxes. I don't know why but my guess is that in
order to allow the boxes to come up it has to halt
WinWiper. If my theory is right then the programmers
should have just put the app names in the Wiper list.

Now you can download and play games, but you still
can't access 'Control Panel' and some other stuff. The
way to do it is this:

Shutdown the server
Restart you terminal with the server off.

This way it boots straight into windows because
WinSuite is shared from the server.
The way I did it was Back Orificed the Server and then
restarted mine. I've tried to just pull out the
network cable and reboot but on our network at skool
it fucks up, it might work on other networks though
because they are set-up differently.
If all goes well you are in Windows 95/98 and able to
fuck up other people's machines. I do recommend you
get Back Orifice though because you can have SOOOO
much fun. I am taking GCSE IT, and all the other dumb
pupils have their coursework they've been working on
for 2 hours on their screen. The best thing is watch
their faces when is disappears!

That's all you need to know about WinSuite.

Shouts to Richard, Sacred, Mongross and thx to the
SWATeam for inspiring me.
