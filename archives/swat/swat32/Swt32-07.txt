Well this month i have been getting up to numerous evil things that
have resulted in me getting my hands on "sensitive data", well ok not
sensative as such, just shit that i don't want other ppl to get there
hands on. 

So after seaching the net for some k-rad wiping utils and concluding
that PGP is the BEST out there but isn't fully suited to my needs i
came up with a not-so-high-tech way to take out all of my data (well
the sensitive stuff).  Basically my little method consists of simple
batch files and DOS utilities, true, its not a sure fire method to
cover your tracks, but its better than nothing.

Well first off lets see how you can store your data, well my personal
favorite is PGPDisk.

Ok PGP disk is good, but lets face it, if you wanna nuke data then
keeping it (encrypted or otherwise) is kinda pointless. So how shall
we kill that oh-so-precious data? simple, Batch files and simple
utilities.

Batch files are nice, not secure and if you have the time to execute
one (i.e clicking on it) then u would have time to use some other
more secure method, but this is purely designed for speed and 99% of
the time all it does is corrupt data.

Ok you will need:

Batch programming skills equivalent to that of an ant
A simple DOS wiping utility ( i recommend Nowhere Utilities 2.0 -
 search for it)
The ability to press 3 keys at once :o)

Ok i'm assuming that you are killing a PGP disk, note that this can
take time, infact most of the time other wipe methods are quicker
since you will most likely not have much time at all to do stuff.
E.G with this method on a PGP disk volume of 500mb it took over
5 minutes (actually i stopped it after 5 minutes because i was board)
So whats my point? you aren't going to have very long at all to wipe
stuff, and if you have five minutes ou could probably Fdisk your
system and commence a Linux distro installation :op

Ok what you need to do is copy wipe.exe from nowhere utils to your
c:\windows or c:\winnt\system32 directory.

Now make a batch file in the same dir as your PGP volume. The batch
file should have the simple line:

wipe pgpdsk.pgd

(replace pgpdsk.pgd
with the name of your pgp disk volume).

Now create a shortcut on the desktop to the batch file, set it up with a
shortcut key like "Ctrl-Alt-K" also set up an unmount hotkey for PGP Disk,
this allows u to unmount the drive and begin a wipe out in a manner of
seconds. If the wipe out runs for a few seconds and is stopped the PGP
disk becomes unuseable in the sense that it needs formatting again before
it can be used (it registers as unformatted).

Not 100% safe, but better than nothing.

Ok, so what about if you don't have PGP disk? fast encryption is a good
bet, the cipher.com program that comes with Nowhere utilities is crap for
this because it can't recuse directories, so if all your files are in one
directory then its fine, just run "cipher 0.454658746454561 *.*" or
something like that before u wipe them.

So your batch file would read:

cipher 0.56465456161 *.*
wipe *.*
wipe batch.bat

and have the usual shortcut and hotkeys on the desktop.

If you don't have PGP disk and you have to recurse directories, then that can
prove to be a little more difficult. For this we will use RAR for DOS
(www.rarsoft.com) and PKzip (www.pkware.com) Dump rar.exe and pkzip.exe into
your windows directory and use this batch file (or something similar):

deltree /y c:\Dir\
rar a -r -m0 c:\b00m.rar c:\progra~1\*.exe
copy c:\b00m.rar c:\g00n.rar
pkzip fuck.zip c:\*.rar
cd \
cipher 0.121464546 fuck.zip
del g00n.rar
del b00m.rar
wipe fuck.zip

Ok what does this do? simple, wipe out the directory with the files using 
Deltree (those with windows 2k and possible WinNT will need to get there
hands on deltree.exe - my ver of win2k doesn't have it, so i dunno about the
rest of you). Then it compresses all of the exe files in your program files
directory (or any files u want), these are then copied in your root directory
as g00n.rar (as well as b00m.rar), they are then zipped down, ciphered, then
deleted. Ok so it take fucking ages, but it overwrites a lot of the hard
drive. Wheter or not it will be of much use is another matter, but its
worth a try.

You *could* try:

deltree /y c:\<dodgy dir>
defrag c:

that *might* work as long as the files where not at the end of the disk.

But all in all, if you have the chance, PGP Wipe the files then wipe free
space on your disk (ATLEAST 3 times), if your really paranoid, format, remove,
burn, beat with a sledge hammer, submerge in boiling chip fat for an hour then
finally microwave the product until the microwave expodes. Dispose of the
remaining bits in hydrochloric acid.
