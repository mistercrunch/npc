 The first thing you should do is scout around in the daylight for a
suitable cab box... A suitable box is one which....

  Is in a secluded position
  Not in a residential area, i dont like ripping off innocent ppl,
  better to go for the capitalists
  One without a propper lock on it
  The old fibre glass style ones with simple screws on are best
  alternatively has metal hinged door with a central screw style lock

 right now to make the box....
GEt a phone that isnt too large and has a facility to switch between pulse
and tone dialing, this is not neccesayry as most lines are now tone ones.
Now remove the phone jack and crimp or solder crock clips to the red and
white wire. Incidently the best device i have found for this is is a
device which can be bought from the bt shop. This is a small box with
rubber buttons and a jack foor head phones and microphone, a miniture
phone.

 Tools you will need...
 
 13mm hex wrench/gas shut off key (triangular one)
 Pliers
 Fag lighter
 Torch

 Now go to your cab box, at night and use the plyers or other tools to turn
each bolt in turn (the triangular ones) about 1/2 an inch , until it loosens
, then twist it a bit more with your fingers. You may only need to do the
bolts on one half, anyway you know the bolt is un done,m cos when you pull
that corner it comes free, take off the door,, a bit of metal should fall
otu from the bottom. If the box is one with a central lock, just undo that
and pull the door... hard,,,, it may be rusted.

Now remove the white bags,, these are the things i got done for pinching!!!!
You should now see lotsa wires, all in pairs,, pick one at random...
 Pull it away from the rest and un twist the pair.. n ow use a match to burn
the two coatings. Strip the singed coating from the wire......   One thing,
there is quite a voltage in these boxes and it will tingle, less than an
electric fence so it is bearable. Attach the wires to the crock clips and
dial away!!! if on the off chance it doesnt work, then reverse the wires.
Modems on laptops can also be hooked up this way, for anonymous hacking. 
 After you have done what you need to do, get out of there, i wouldnt
bother putting the cover back on, unless you want to return to the box,,
use your common sense to work out how to re-attach it.  
 One thing that might be worth considering if you intend to use this
box for a while is to drill a hole in the side and install a jack.. this
should only be used with 0800 hundred access as to not show up repetively
on the bill and be traced.. i suppose if it is near shrubbery or
something you could extend the wire so you cant be seen.

 Another thing to do, if you want to be cheeky is to aquire one of those
stripy repair tents that enginners use and then erect it in a public place,,
oooh errr, and repair the cab box
