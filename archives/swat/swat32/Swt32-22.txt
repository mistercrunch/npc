Just to piss off Geddon:

WE THREW YOU IN THE SEA! Buhahahahahaha, everyone laughed at you, you
where made to look a (really big) prat!!!!! Everyone who we spoke to
supported our actions!

heh, sorry everyone else, i just heard rumours about what *might*
happen if SWAT makes a big deal out of what happened, so if anyone who
was at DNS CON has any photos of the event (Geddon getting wet that is)
please send them in and i'll create a little shrine to the event on the
web site <lol>.
