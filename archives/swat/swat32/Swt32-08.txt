  Yes we were there, swat were  present, well F_S and me were anyway..
I decided we were going on the wednesday beforehand, even if i had to
lend f_s the cash.  this isnt a complete article, because too much
happened to include and i ha vent the time to get it all in for ths
month.
 I turned up with 3 bags and a monitor tand f_s had one bag, my back
was fuckin well broken.
anyway, sound files of the trip will be available soon and recordings
of the event should be available from <*COUGH*> the AS site <*COUGH*>. 
 After spending half an hour trying to find the guest house which was
advertised as the new haven on dnscon.org we found it was NEWHEATH..
we were not impressesed. The owners seemed a little strange, ie spaced
out, the female may or not have been female, and we decided they must
be squatters or something!
 The owners went and got the rest of the nerds from their rooms for
us, i cant remember their handles, but they have a site which i'm sure
F_S will fill you in on. So with a bottle of whisky in my hand we hit
the clubs. We started out in a pub and all agreed the music was too
loud, to hear our selves talk, so after 1/2 or so we left to decide on
a plan of action. The choice of whether to down the whisky and then go
into a club, or vice versa, was difficult, and in the mean time one of
the lads, Danni, stormed off in a huff because we were no fun, and
maybe the geek lifestyle isnt what he wants, as he said in his letter,
i'll see if i can get a scan opf it,,, he came all the way from bradford
to blackpool and payed for the event, to go home within 3 hours.l
 So we hit soem clubs and talked, i actually found someone else who
knows the programmers joke...
"Why do programmers get Halloween and Christmas mixed up?,,,, Because
DEC 25 = OCT 21"
 Anyway, one of the clubs seemed to have some very fine young ladies,
who seemed very friendly towards each other, so thats where we went...
FINNS night club,,, 1/2 an hour later when we saw the bloke in a yellow
shirt and  adaisy behind his ear we discovered it was a gay club, formed
a tight circle, facing outwards and edged outa the door... The next club
was great,, there was this bird in  hot pants and no undies and a boob
tube, John (i think it was) wmangaed to ge ta pic on his digital camera,,
it will be posted as soon as i get it :) And that was that for that night
we were in bed for 5.30 after talking computers in one of the rooms and
fiddlingt with my test bed..  Some bloke callled dodger walkjed in and
said he didnt want to hear anymore sabout exploits nad shit thru the wall,
but he was joking. I also managed to get a lynch mob who wanted to say hi
to geddon on that night, but he wasnt in
 Next day, we hit the confernece, and listened for a while, AS was running
their network again, and of course it didnt work again, but they fixed it
eventually, suprise, suprise, the AS team won the hack the flag (conspiracy,
methinks, that and the fact only 2 teams entered). We defaced a few As
posters and then met geddon, we managed to get a pic ofd us stranglling each
other before he ran away,,, and we wanted to do was talk, but man his hair
and skin is greasy.. We went out and got somew bb guns to fuck around with
and then went back to see some mo0re talks. We returned fo alex delarges
talk,, god, i thought he was about 15, but he's actually 21,, he wasnt
been that social, but i wasd told that was because he treatyed it like a
serious event and is the light of the party at the bristol 2600 meets.


 
 So on to the sand castle building, BWAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAA
After defacing the beech, i think F_S posted the pics, we thought  that seen
as 'Geddon sdaid he would blow us outa the water, then we would put him in
it, so me and F_S grabbed him, and were soon being helped out by others,
including some AS pixies, who i found out later, dont actually like him that
much. Pictures are on the site, including a splash screen :).. and will be
on our T-shirts next year! he went away, and it looked like he was crying. 
At some point we found ourselves in dixons, where several pcs accidently got
set to format on next boot up/.

 Next we wnet to the confernece hotels nightclub for the hackers jeapordy,
and lost,, 8the question was... "name the matrix character with the rabbit
tattoo"... of course we knew that.
 We did get a book for dunking geddon tho! I actually managed to shoot him
on the way out, he kinda yelped a bit!!!!
 We were going to go beige boxing, but alex borrowed our bod with the box,
so that was out.. we did go to his room for a chat tho, and crawled about
in the loft of the hotel, as well as gettin dna to soak to corridor with the
fire extinguisher! we left in good time to go pinch lots of signs and shit from
hotels and public toilets, this is my new hobby.. the toilet office atendent
wasnt at his post and we magaed to un bolt a huge fuck-off counter device, it
looks expensive, ie, it has a 12v, 12A battery in it, about £70 worth, lol, we
are tryin to clock it to 31337,.
 we decided not to go to sleep that night, so it didnt bother us that much
when alex's m8 thought hed tell us that alex had been arrested,,, very
funny guys.. anyway we did see a ufo and som starnge bird came up to me,
shoved her chest out to sremm, "ive got a nipple on, i have hard nipples",
well what can i say, they just can t resist me!!!
 Ater buying a vibe for F_S bird, that did look dodgy, 5 lads buying a
vibrator, and smoking plenty of ganj, we went back to the hotel for an hours
sleep...
  

  So we had a great time, and got to humiliate and shoot 'Geddon,, next year
we are hoping for more of a swat presense,, and to get 'Geddon again!!! See
you all there.


 Oh yes we got  RNAs lamah diary aswelll, lol,    pix wilkl be posted
