Hi again, This is now my second text file written for
Swat Magazine and probably will interest more people
than the last one.

Today boys and girls you will need:
A plastic staple gun,
A hacksaw,
A very small copper tube (Under 10mm),
A Jubilee band,
Nails that will fit the copper tube.

OK. Take the staple gun, it is better to be plastic
but if you can’t get one steal a metal one. Take the
gun apart and put the two empty halves together. Now
you should have a plastic shell of a staple gun. Put
this into a vice and cut about 5mm off the bottom. Now
put all the stuff back inside without the long tray
that holds the staples. The piece of metal that pokes
the staple as you normally use it, should be sticking
out about 5mm – 10mm out depending on how much you cut
off. The more, the better.

When it is like this you can use it to hurt people’s
hands and fingers but I find windows are better. It
WILL break any single pane sheet of glass, although
not double-glazing as this stuff is even hammer-proof.
Just put it against a window and pull the trigger
lever. If it don’t break it after one or two shots
don’t worry it will eventually shatter. So far I have
found if it takes about 5 hit to break it will shatter
as apose if if breaks on the first it will just break.

IF however you want this too hurt people, like pedo’s,
you need the copper tube.
Take the tube, it should be between 15cm and 10cm and
about 5mm wide. Mark a third of it’s length and cut it
to the middle. Then put it in the vice and cut across
down to the first cut. It should look something like
this.

Make a slight cut either side of the tube where you
have just cut it to and hammer it out till it’s flat.
Don’t make the cuts too near the middle because this
will weaken it and it make break off meaning you have
to repeat this again.
Put the flattened edge on top of the gun parallel to
where the poky thing sticks out and put the Jubilee
band through the hole in the handle and over the tube,
and tighten it up. You can’t put a couple of screws
through it because all you will do is screw the blade
in place. Now when you fire this the blade will hit
the tube so cut a slit just enough so the blade won’t
hit the tube and tighten the Jubilee as tight as you
can get it. To fire, put a nail or screw or anything
in the end, aim, and fire!
You will notice you can’t run around with this loaded
cos the ammo will fall out so wrap a small length of
tissue paper around the head of the nail and push down
with a pencil or something.

As before, any questions, comment or suggestions mail
me at:

I do not endorse the shooting of innocent people or
animals with this, but pedo’s are guilty from the day
they’re born so go get em’ you trigger happy
anarchists!
