Hi again.....

Remember how i told ya to make those 'cap bombs' last month, well,
this time, we will be making a 'Cap bomb cannon'!
All this is, is a metal, or plastic tube, about a foot and a half
long, with a
'cap bomb' wedged in the end :)

Ingredients-
^^^^^^^^^^^
1x Cap Bomb (you will need to modify it into a shape like a cigar, and
use about
6 rolls of caps)
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^--Important

1x Metal/Plastic tube (about 1 1/2 feet long, and about 1 inch across)

1x 2 litre bottle cap (or means of plugging the end of the tube)

1x fuse (or means of igniting the cap bomb)

1x ammo (this could be nails, screws, bbs, air gun pellets, small screwdriver,
you name it, if it fits, it can be fired :))


Method-
^^^^^^^
Right, first things first, get the modified cap bomb, <! and dont forget to put
a fuse in it !>, and wedge it into one end of the tube.  Now take the bottle
top, and drill a hole in the top for the fuse.  Then put it on the same end as
your cap bomb.  It probably wont fit exactly, (if its too small forget it, get a
bigger lid !) so cut up a bicycle inner tube, or something and just make a seal
around the bottle top.  Now pull the fuse through the hole, so it looks like
this......

Legend---
<<< = ammo
888 = modified cap bomb
] = lid
__
__ = pipe

| = tissue (to stop screws rattling)


OK, that probably made it worse, but what the hell :)   mail me if ya got any
trouble :)

I aint finished yet!  when we made it, we placed it on a green box (in a park),
faceing at a red volvo, across a busy main road!  (i thought this was a bit
dangerous, cos it was at head height for passengers in their cars!)  first off
we lit the fuse and ran about 300 metres away, then it didnt go off, so we
poured some white spirit down the end.  lit it.  nope.  nothing.  then the
plastic started to melt all over some dry grass!  Great! fire!  so we rushed and
got some dead grass/hay and there was a raging fire.  Yippee!  then we got bored
and went back to his (my friends) house, and there we were, reading SWAT on his
PC and about 10mins later we heard a 'crack' in the distance.......hmm, what
could that be?  but we never went back to it just incase someone was decapitated
:)  OK, it didnt work this time, but ive heard some of his (friend)s stories and
the results were pretty kewl, one was full of screws and went thru the rear end
of a Peugeot 206! hehe!

Have fun making :)  and if ya do, send me the results of it! :)
