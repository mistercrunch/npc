The FBI has developed what they call Internet and Data Interception,
aka Carnavore.  It intercepts e-mail, data packets, anything that can
be used against known-felons, or anyone under their watch. Some people
exposed the so-called Diagnostic Tool Carnivore and the FBI 
is attempting to support and back it 110%.

Under Title III; applications or tools for interception require the
authorization of a high-level DOJ (Dept. of Justice) official before the
local US Attorneys offices can apply for those orders.  Interception
orders must be filed with federal dist. Judges or b4 other courts of
such jurisdiction.  Hence, unlike typical search warrants, federal
magistrates are not authorized to approve such applications and orders.
Further, interception of communications are limited to certan federal
felony offenses

All of that is about to change w/ the introduction of carnavore.

Electronic surveillance has been extremely effective in securing the
conviction of more than 25,600 dangerous felons over the past 13 years.
In many cases there is no substitute for electronic surveillance, as the
evidence cannot be obtained through other traditional investigative
techniques.

In recent years, the FBI has encountered an increasing number of criminal
investigations in which the criminal subjects use the Internet to
communicate with each other or to communicate with their victims. Because
many Internet Service Providers (ISP) lacked the ability to discriminate
communications to identify a particular subject's messages to the exclusion
of all others, the FBI designed and developed a diagnostic tool, called
Carnivore.

The Carnivore device provides the FBI with a "surgical" ability to
intercept and collect the communications which are the subject of the lawful
order while ignoring those communications which they are not authorized to
intercept. This type of tool is necessary to meet the stringent requirements
of the federal wiretapping statutes.

This to me sounds like a bunch of bull fucking shit; I am offended and so
should other people by this, they can view our conversations for us not
even committing a crime... but there oh so this only happens if you ____
____ ___ fill in the blank.

The good part? There are significant penalties for misuse of the tool,
including exclusion of evidence, as well as criminal and civil penalties.
The system is not susceptible to abuse because it requires expertise to install
and operate, and such operations are conducted, as required in the court orders,
with close cooperation with the ISPs.

The Carnivore device works much like commercial "sniffers" and other network
diagnostic tools used by ISPs every day, except that it provides the FBI with a
unique ability to distinguish between communications which may be lawfully
intercepted and those which may not. For example, if a court order provides for
the lawful interception of one type of communication (e.g., e-mail), but
excludes all other communications (e.g., online shopping) the Carnivore tool
can be configured to intercept only those e-mails being transmitted either to
or from the named subject.

Still sounds like bull-shit... They can't program a tool to intercept just
e-mail because there are ways around using say Outlook or hotmail.. you can
use Anonymous tools off of websites, it can't just look at pop3 accounts...
its total bullshit
