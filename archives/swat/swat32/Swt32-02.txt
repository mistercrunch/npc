Hi, Im Xenophon, and this is my first time writing for swat team mag,
if you like it then tell me and Ill try and churn out some more stuff
for the mag. I havent read the mag  for long, but I feel that the
content is just in my field of interest so I didnt wait that long to
contribute. 

ANONYMOUS POST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Ive seen loads of articles all over the internet and in swat,
with instructions as to how to send anonymous email, but very few
instructing people how to send post, or packages anonymously. I thought
for a good while, and I think Ive come up with a fairly good method
for sending post, or packages anoymously. If you follow all these steps
you could probably send a bomb to the whitehouse and still not get found
out :) But you dont need to bother if your just sending some written
abusive message to your teacher, or some other unimportant lil thing
(as it probably wont even be reported), but an explosion in the whitehouse
WILL, so bear that in mind.

INSTRUCTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Obviously how secure you want to be depends both on your level
of paranoia, and on the content that you will be posting. I have written
the instructions as though you were VERY paranoid, and sending something
extremely dangerous. Use your common sense to tone down these instructions
to your own tast, but remember the longer you take to prepare the
package/letter the less likely you are to get caught. This txt is meant
to be thorough, but doesnt cover everything and doesnt specify obvious
things, such as "dont sign your real name". <g>

0. GENERAL NOTES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        As with all good things this is zero-based :). General notes
        include:

*       Dont buy all your supplies from the same shop, or preferably even
        the same town.
*       Handle your material as little as possible
*       Make inquiries in one chain store then buy it in another
*       Try to be as "common" as possible in all ways.


1. PREPARING THE CONTENT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        This section aplies mainly to packages but also to letters to
a lesser extent. One of the first rules of dealing with anything is to
try not to get your fingerprints on it, and definitely not handle it with
dirty/greasy hands, as that increases the effect of the prints. I recomend
any pair of rubber gloves, or other disposable latex gloves.

2. PREPARING THE NOTE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Skip this section if you dont want to include a note (i.e. You want
no reansom &c. / Your package is a bomg :). Never hang write a note, and I
honestly wouldnt reccomend using cut & stick from a newspaper, as you get
your prints all over it. Print your notes from a computer (not a typewriter),
use the most common piece of word-processing software - MS Word (yep 'fraid
you ought to use micro$oft :). Use a simply font like the standard default

- Times new Roman, or use Arial / Helv or something not to uncommon. Set
your margins to a standard width - Default preferably. It is very important
to SPELL CHECK your document, nothing gives someone away more than a
misspelling that they always make. Dont be to gramatically picky if your the
type that tend to be. Throw in a few prepositions at the ends of sentances,
use "who" in the object of a sentance, stick "s" on the end of first declension
latin derived words instead of ae, &c. &. (BTW: If you dont have a clue what
any of that means then you prolly already do it :). Type your document at home
on a computer you are sure is not keyloged, then print it. If you need to save
the doc, then use a floppy. Check the paper you are printing on and make sure
it isnt watermarked, better still buy some specially from a shop in another
town. Use the aforementioned gloves if pos when hangling the paper. Clean the
printer roler by running through a meths coated sheet of paper, to remove any
taltale previous documents that could have made their mark. Hit print on your
word processor, and take the printout and put in in the package as in section
1. If you have a a choice of printers use the most run-of-the mill one you
have (as in use your hp deskjet not your limited edition panasonic, only
released in ubangiland 14 pin dot matrix). Also use the standard photocopier
paper (as i said NOT watermarked). At this point the note should be all done.

3. PACKAGING
^^^^^^^^^^^^

        This section is fairly simple. Go out to one town buy a jiffy bag/ set
of 20 envelopes, or whatever you need. If the shop doesnt have what you want,
dont ask for it, just buy a roll of cello of summint, and leave and try another
shop. In large cities you can use about 10 different shops in that city (eg London).
In small city / big town use 5 shops (eg Oxford). In a small town use 2, and in a
village 1. Going in too many shops will attract unwanted attention, and also try
to but only one thing (for the package / letter) per shop. If you use a supermarket,
thenm use your brain and buy some groceries at the same time. Once you hafe obtained
the appropriate packaging, (buy at least 2, but dont buy only 2 (with envelopes
for example)). Take it home, and then carefully (using those gloves) Place your
stuff in it. Weigh it accurately. Now take your second package and stuff it full
of shit (that one might post preferably incase of some mishap - as in dont fill it
full of stones :). So that it weighs just a little (2-5% more), this is your dummy
package. Address your dummy package / letter in plain handwriting to the same
country as your real one is going, and make it look just as thought it was about
to be sent.

4. SENDING
^^^^^^^^^^

        Take your dummy package / letter to a post office (out of town in somewhere
were the peeps dont know you &c. and all that shit), ask then to weigh it and say
how much it would cost to send, say thankyou, that you will post it later or
something else and leave the shop. Hopefully you remember the price, if you are
really forgetfull, as soon as you get out of sight (a good mile away) write it down.
Go and buy the stamps, now if the package costs £2.43, or it was a 1st class letter,
dont ask for £2.43 of stamps, or a single first class stamp, ask for say £5 of stamps
(remember it never hurts to over-pay your letters / parcels), or a book of 1st stamps.
Once you have these return home.  Print a label using the above method on your printer,
Ill leave how to obtain these labels to your imagination, (if you cant think of a
way you shouldnt be reading this doc!) Stick the label on (remember gloves if possible).
 Afix your stamp(s), dont lick the stamp, put a drop of water on it. That stage is
probably not necessary unless you are sending a nuklear warhead to the commons (!),
most un-paranoid people can just lick the bloody stamp like any normal person. Drive
out as far as possible with your package you MUST reach a different postal area,
 preferably go to one about 2 or 3 postal area boundries away. Put your letter in
the box / give your package in at the post office. Leave. Go home.

5. CLEARING UP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Have a few beers and congratulate yourself. Bin or otherwise dispose of or
destroy your other packagings / encelopes that were in the set. Delete the file you
typed the stuff in, remove it from the floppy, and then format it. I guess at this
point I better wrap this thing up, as its already probably beyond most peeps attention
span. Just dispose of anything else you had, and do any obvious things needed.

6. THE LAST WORD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Just be carefull, and remember dont do anything illegal (year right). Also
if you get busted its YOUR problem, dont go turning me in. I may have given you a few
pointers, but nowhere have i encouraged you to send letter bombs / flame mail &c, nor
do I condone such activities.

        Well with that behind us, if you want to contact me you can do so, please
direct comments, hellos, criticism, suggestions, ideas &c to: xenophon@phreaker.net,
and spam or flame to /dev/null@127.0.0.1 Most weekends you'll catch me on irc, it
hard to say where I'll be, Ill generally be in #rm-hacking but it keeps changing
server so often that I have difficulty finding it myself sometimes. So try me in
#rm-hacking on irc.progenic.com, sandman.ukshells.org, or irc.darkwar.net. Im
also often in #progenic, also on irc.progenic.com.

        I could now fill this with about 10 lines promothing my organisation, and
saying how great it is, but I won't, because if Im anything to go by I prefer reading
usefull info rather than a shitty little half-baked txt, and about a page of promo
for someones org.

        So see you all around, email me, /msg or /memo (if thats still up) me. And
I will try to manipulate the electrons into some usefull reply.
