Cool lyrics:
I'm sure that you saw the Brit awards, well if not then you missed
a really cool anarchistic song by Chumbawamba, well it was Tubthumper
only they changed a line or so in it, it went like so:

We'll be singing
When we're winning
We'll be singing

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never going to keep me down

Pissing the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a larger drink
He drinks a cider drink
New labour sold out the dock workers
Just like they'll sell out the rest of us

Oh Danny boy

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never going to keep me down

Pissing the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a larger drink
He drinks a cider drink
New labour sold out the dock workers
Just like they'll sell out the rest of us

Don't cry for me
next door neighbour

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never going to keep me down

Pissing the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a larger drink
He drinks a cider drink
New labour sold out the dock workers
Just like they'll sell out the rest of us

New labour sold out the dock workers
Just like they'll sell out the rest of us.

Pretty cool eh?

see ya next month.
