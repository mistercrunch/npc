Fun is getting harder and harder to cause without breaking the law.
So with a minimal amount of equipment that can be easily purchased,
you can have some great laughs.

First off you will need some simple stuff:

Name:                     Where aquired:  Cost:    Used for:
Potassium permanganate    Chemist         69-89p   Disinfectant

Marshmallows              Food store      1p       Eating

Ok so thats all your going to need to cause havoc and carry out some
pretty cool sabotarge.  Heres some basic info on the stuff in the list

Pottasium permanganate is an oxydiser, this will make things burn
hotter and more fiercely.
Sugar, once ignited burns hot.
Non-safety matches give off a lot of smoke when lit.
Fire lighters burn for a long time.
Lighter fluid can be made to explode
Meths is good fun.
Super glue, will jam up and mechanism.
Rocket engines fly.
Marshmallows melt and set.

Now here are a few sugestions:

First of all break off a ton of match heads and put them into one match
box, now mix in some pottasium permanganate, now take this into a
public toilet and light it, if the toilet has windows glue them shut
an hour before. (This was done at my school, unfortunatly the windows
where not glued shut, so we learnt by our mistakes, the corridor stunk
for hours).

Send a rocket engine flying down a street.

Light about three fire lighters and put the can of lighter fluid (still
closed) on top of them.

Cram a marshmallow into a lock and melt it with a lighter.

(Another school one) Set fire to cleaners mops.

Mix Pottasium permanganate, sugar and meths together, put it on the
ground, light it, it will not go out, if it does it will re-ignite
soon.  If you want to, then when it's burning really good give it a 
boot and send it everywhere.

Glue doors and windows shut.

(Yet another school one) Wrap two boxes of matches in paper, then get
a birthday candel, break off all but a centimeter of wax, insert this
into the paper, light the candel and just walk away. (Best done in
toilets away from flamable stuff).

Put super glue all over the back of a post-it note and stick it to a
wall, when the glue has set write a message on it (No one will be able
to remove it).
