		     **With Taxi's and Autoglass**

The art of getting revenge on a person or persons can turn to war
sometimes, and what better way to get an advantage than to prevent
them from getting a good nights sleep.
First of all at about 11:00pm ring the nation taxi line on 0800 123 444
and ask for a taxi at your enemies house, answer any questions they ask
so you don't seem suspect, then sit back and wait.
Now the taxi could take about 20 minutes to get there so we'll wait
about an hour.
Now it should be Midnight, so we'll ring some glazers on 0800 919 700
(This nnumber may be regonal to either: North Yorkshire, Hampshire or
Dumfries and Galloway, so check with your yellow pages) tell them
that somebody smashed there window and you want it boarded up.
Now that they will get woken up at about 12:30, and should start to
get pissed off.  Shall we stop there, no I don't think so. At about
1:30 phone up your enemy snd ask if they have enjoyed the visits.
Now that has been sorted out lets get really tight.  Download a 
Wardialer from a sight (Key word: Phreaking) and set it to dial up
each hour all through the night.  You can leave the computer on and
go to bed now, to get a good nights sleep.

REMEBER: Always use a payphone when you are calling the freephone
numbers, and always dial 141 befor you punch in the numbers, this
will stop any tracing from your enemy or the company's that you
have rung.
WARNING: don't always dial the taxi number (I mean ALWAYS) as a form
of revenge, be warned that they always record the phone call and after
a few hoaxes they will get the police involved because they loose out
on money, the cops will patrol around suspect phone boxes questioning
people, so don't do it.
