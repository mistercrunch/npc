Well the title of this article should actually explain what it going 
to be in it! Yep it's Jan 2nd and Brakis and myself have concluded that
we are kind slacking on this supliment style edition of the magazine.
So with a keg of Bud that somehow survived out millenium party and 
fuck loads of nibbles and other alcoholic bevrages, we decided to fire
up Brakis's trusty ol' laptop and type up numerous articles that will
be informative, amusing, pointless, stupid, bullshit or even just
mag fillers! so if things start to get dumb and appear that they have
been written by somebody who has just challenged a Russian to a drinking
game with Meths, then just assume that we finished the keg of bud and
moved onto the Vodka!

Hmm, we're just in the middle of the interview and we're kind drunk.

Ok a little info about the interview, ok it's mainly us just talking
to one another and a lot of people will think that what we are doing
(talking to one another and making a pathetic attempt to interview
each other.) is lame and very childlike, but personally i couldn't
give a fuck. 

Ok it's 3 or 4 hours later, Brakis has fucked off somewhere and
he's left his Laptop here, teehee could be a fatal mistake if he
was anyone else. But anyway back to the article, oh yeah i forgot
that it was only intended to be a mag filler, or something like 
that anyway. Right ok, i'll admit it that i'm a tad drunk/totally
wasted.  

Anyhow, befor the 2 of us fucked of to annihilate stuff beyond all
recognition we where talking about an interview, actually we where
interviewing me. Umm, i dunno far we got in that, but it was all
right, no doubt we'll finish it off tommorrow or perhaps it'll
never get done and then you'll never know what words of wisdom 
where mentioned!!!!!

ok i admit it that i'm realllllllllllly drunk and in no fit state
to write articles, hell if i din't no how to touch type then i
wouldn't be able to write anything since i can't see the keyboard.

Teehee for a mag filler it ain't half bad. And i personally couldn't
give a shit as to what anyone says about this. Anyhow i'll wrap this
up and bung it in the mag for you to all laugh at.

<a day or so later>
Ok the interview never actually got finished, but i'll probably take a
few sound clips from the tape and upload them to the web site, for the
simple reason they are amusing!
