Well i thought that i'd share my knowledge of chipping good old diga's
and C12 handsets for the sole purpose of getting free calls. But those
of you out there that don't know what i'm on about- the handset keeps
a record of the credit that you have, all we're gonna do is modify
it a little so that our credit can be topped up with the use of the
"on" button :-)

Ok first off we're gonna need some tools:

1 Trox screwdriver - Try the hardware shop
1 Fine tipped soldering iron
1 Cellnet phone (preferably C12)
1 pic programmer (i'll get to that later)
1 pic12c508 (thats the pic btw)

Ok first off i'll get the easy stuff out of the way, we need to
reprogram the pic, now i've seen a few pic programmers, ranging from
ones that simply plug into the serial port on your computer, right down
to some really sophisticated little devices that have all the bells and
whistles on that you'd expect. Personally i couldn't care less what you
decide to go out and purchase, a simple serial port pic programmer
suits me fine. Anyway i'll get to how you get your hands on these and
the cost later on.
Ok so now that you have your pic programmer, time to program the pic!
ok so what you need to do is dump a little bit of code onto the pic
so that your credit gets topped up when you turn your fone on.

Ok but what if you have a Diga fone? then use this code instead:

ok so now that you've dumped that bit of code onto the pic i guess that
it's time to solder it to the fone's Epromm. Now because i'm overly
paranoid about blowing componants with a soldering iron i'd rather use
very thin wire to do this next bit.
Firstly remove the back cover of the fone, thus revealing the innards
of it all, now locate the Epromm! (Note: this is for the C12)
Right what we need to do is attach 4 wires to the Epromm of the fone,
right we'll attact a wire to pins 4,5,6 and 8. Do this carefully! i'm
not 100% sure how volatile these componants are (i don;t mean that they
explode, but take a soldering iron to a transister for a few seconds
too long and it will never work again - get my point). Ok so now that
you have 4 wires attached to the Epromm, let's attach them to the pic
that you recently coded. Now my prefered method of this, like attaching
any IC to a circuit board is just to solder the wires onto a chip
holder then plug the pic into it. ok the wires that you need to solder
to the pins are:
Epromm pin:	Pic pin:
	  1	8
	  5	6 
          6	5 
          8	4

Once the Pic is installed, piece your fone back togeather and turn it
on! call a friend, turn the fone off, turn it on again, wayhay free
credit!

Anyway, here's the Diga settings:


12C508        to     Eprom chip
pin 1         to        pin 8
pin 8         to        pin 1
pin 5         to        pin 5
pin 6         to        pin 6


When programming the Pic you need to check the configuration fuses.
Oscillator    =     Internal RC
Watchdog      =     Disabled
P U timer     =     Disabled
MCLR          =     Tied to Vcc

Very handy indeed!
Anyway i hope that this has helped out all of you in chipping fones!

<just a little note, i used the hex code and the config settings found
on www.cablehack.co.uk! well i gotta give them credit for informing me
how to do it>

Now on to the Pic programmer, you can spend anything up to several hundred
quid on one of these things, fortunatly Maplins will sell you pic's that
are pre-programmed with a hex code of your choice teehee, you can always
abuse this service for a small service charge. But your best bet is to
use the www.yahoo.co.uk search engine and look for +pic +programmer
in the UK only section, Netw0rk Bug and myself found a good site on Demon
that sold them for about £70, can't rememebr the URL though.
