Well while wasteing hours of my life trying to connect to x-streams
0800 number i decided to see if i could tweak it a little so that it
would redial up the very second that it disconnected from the net,
either from a busy tone or whatever. Anyway i opened up regedit to
sneek a look at the x-stream settings and almost pissed myself
laughing over the amazingly elite encryption algorithm which it uses.

Ok if you thought that M$ was bad for storing passwords, your gonna
love this (well ok it's not that interesting but what the hell, i
need to fill in space or this article will look pathetic). Anyway
in the path: 
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\X-Stream
there is a number of settings for X-stream, they look like this:
(actual registary export): 

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\X-Stream]
"ProgramPath"="C:\\Program Files\\X-Stream3_6"
"CurrentCountry"="United Kingdom"
"CurrentCountryTo"="United Kingdom"
"ModemName"="Sportster Voice 33.6 (UK) Internal"
"ModemType"="modem"
"AreaCode"=""
"InternationalPrefix"=""
"PhoneNumber"="0800 988 9999"
"PhoneNumberID"=dword:00000003
"ModifyNumber"=dword:00000000
"CallingCard"=dword:00000000
"CallingCardNumber"=""
"RotaryDialing"=dword:00000000
"ISPName"="0800 Free Calling"
"IsVirtual"=dword:00000000
"LoginName"="ferret@x-steam.co.uk"
"Password"="gvctxsglmph"
"SavePassword"=dword:00000001
"RasName"="X-Stream"

Ok now i knew the password for the account in question so i decided to
test the amazing encryption powers of X-stream, heh, what did i have
to do? simply rotate the letters back by 5 and i had the password.
So if i take g and count back 5 letters it becomes c, v becomes r 
and so on, counting all the way though it gvctxsglmph will decipher
to cryptochild. So hows that for amazing password protection?

Oh well i hope that this pointless article will hope those of you
who forget passwords on a regular basis and then dread the day when
you acidentally delete it from the box and have to re-type it.

Oh yeah, and if you want to get rid of the banner on the screen (not
