Well know doubt all of you little spunk offs are having shit loads
of trouble trying to register your M3588 Motorola phones on Cellnet's 
pay and go service well a certain batch have been nik named happy 
phones for the ver reason that they can make and recieve calls already.
If you phone cellnet then they will tell you just to return the phone 
to manufacturer or the dealer (well don't because that is being silly) 
you don't need to register them and cellnet pre assign there phone
number MVUH !?!?!?! the only limitations are international calls and 
premium and 0800 calls (so Cletus and Ernie can put down there hard 
ons and pay attention). So if your having trouble registering then for 
fuck sake don't.
