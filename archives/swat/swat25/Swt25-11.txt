A wicked, and rather simple scheme to absolutely PISS someone off !
I've tried this on someone I know & he got in a lot of shit with his
parents. Not something I'm usually into - revenge I mean but someone 
might want this or find it endless entertainment while online - I 
know I did :
 
The site to go to is www.freeukstuff.co.uk, which give out free 
samples. I signed up as a member - false name & address, but get a 
temporary email address so they can send you your username & password. 
Well, the stuff they give out there is stupid - goats milk, ferret 
food, dog shampoo, MANY mouse mats, etc. I had a field day inputting 
the address it was to be sent to (the victim), and after about 20/ 30 
parcels through the post they got quite upset...hehehe, BUT its very 
wise to use an 0800 number or hacked internet account coz they can & 
will phone up and ask who's been sending it - believe me ! Even
better - email the name & address of the victim to all your friends 
and ask to join in the nasty plot. Just think of that poor postman 
though carrying about 4 sacks of parcells to their front door.

Its also good if you wanna start selling mouse mats or some of the CD 
ROMs they have.
