Well since your all reading this and it is the big 'ol Y2K then i can
assume that the millenium bug hasn't nuked you all! 

Since i'm not the kind of person who thinks that the year 2000 is an
excuse to make an attempt at a "mega zine" then fail to live up to
everyones expectations, i simply has pieced togeather this issue with
a lot of hard work and as usual bringing you the top quality up to date
work that is in every issue of SWAT Magazine, but anyway enough of the
bullshit. <-- exactly why i added that paragraph i will never know, 
just link it to alcohol.


Ok the web site has been down lately, the reason for this is that some
script kiddies have been running a denial of service attack on the
server that the site is hosted on.
