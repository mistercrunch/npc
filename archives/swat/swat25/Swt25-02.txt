(Note- this is a old version of the code...at present it is much better
I.E. the code is cleaner... it can crypt any file type..blah blah...
so don't email me bout it k? :P )
Ok I'll make this brief..

Shanecrypt is at present in the beta stage, there are many many ideas 
yet to be implemented, Shancrypt for now is basicly just an engine, 
but it wont take to much hard work to write your own algors for it.

The purpose of me building SC is to learn as I go along.. 

So far it will only crypt anscii files NOT binarys, Im working on the 
ASM code for this as we speak.

Shancrypt is dedicated to the family dog Shane that passed away on 
22th of july 1999, may his memory live forever in this here code :).

There ais a small prob, it won't copy files with more than 3 letter 
extensions. 

Thanks for trying out SC and if you find any faults or have any 
surgestions please email me at :- ukhg@btinternet.com or check the HDC 
site at :- www.hdcuk.cjb.net for my email addy incase it has changed 
(damn all the spammers).
