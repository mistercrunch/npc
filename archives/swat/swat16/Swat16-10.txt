Well I fucked up my pager at new year (I still don't know how).
PageOne said that it would cost me £40 to repair, so I told them
to fuck off and decided to strip it down.

Right, just to point out that all that had happened to my pager is the
screen had cracked, it still worked and could recieve messages.

Anyway after I had unscrewed the back of it, I noticed that it was in
two parts, one part recieves in information (the input) and the other
part translates the information and makes the beeping noise/vibrates
(output)

These two parts are joined by a little plug, anyway enought about my
pager, so what's the point? well the input still works, and so does the
output (well the bleeper and the vibrator).

Under closer inspection the vibrator is attaced to the main board by
two wires, the wires are easily accessible and can be unsoldered, the
bleeper is also attached very close to those wires, so if you have 
the IQ above a house plant and you know a little about electronics
then you can build a wonderful pager detonator.

Here's how it's done.

First off you'll need some hardware:
Soldering Iron
Pager (Mine is/was a Pageone Minicall PA3PY-20B model)
Some thin wire (very very thin wire, 1mm or less in thickness)
Small relay
9v battery
Normal wire
Small box to put it in.

First off unsolder the vibrator and the bleeper, do this very carefully
as there is a few IC's and other heat sensitive components about.
Normally I would just touch the solder with the iron and blow on it to
keep the other parts cool.

Right now that the vibrator and the Bleeper are removed it's time to
get the relay and solder some of that thin wire to it, once that's done
solder the other end of the wire to the pager where the bleeper and/or
the vibrator where (solder them in parallel).
A simple diagram would be like:
 
                   _________
         <-       |        |
         \        |        |-----------|-+ <- Vibrator 
   3--->  \<-1  __|                    | Pager
        ~~~    |-----------------------|-- <- Vibrator 
      2 | |____|  |
        |_________|  

Ok that's about as good as I could get it. If You don't have the
faintest idea as to what that is, then go out and get some education in
electronics. But for those of you who do have a clue: 2 is the relay
1 goes to the 9v battery and 3 is a loose wire for the time being.

Anyway, solder the wire from 3 to one end of the bulb detonator (look
at previous issues of SWAT Magazine), then attach the other wire from
the bulb detonator to the 9v battery. Ok now unclip the 9v battery and
turn on the pager. Ok as anyone with a pager knows they either bleep or
vibrate when you turn them on (well mine does/did). So what happens?
the little relay starts to click on and off.
This is where having a screen comes in handy, set the pager to
bleep constantly when it gets paged. Well bleep and vibrate, better
safe than sorry. Ok now that your pagers turned on, fone up PageOne
and say something along the lines of "If you fuckers send me the news
headlines I'll kill you all", well ok just ask them not to send you
lottery results or newshead lines, hehe wouldn't it be ironic if you
got the winning numbers only to be blown up seconds later. Anyway
now that PageOne has turned off all of those extra's and shit like that
you should be just about ready (oh yeah, make sure that nobody has your
pager number either.) Solder another wire to the arial on the pager,
(that's that long bit of metal that's shaped like a car). Now put it
all in a box with the bulb detonator on the outside and the arial
extension poking out as well. Right now plug the 9v battery in so it's
all ready to go. All you have to do now is to stick the bulb detonator
into your chosen explosive device.
Now give your pager a call when you want the chosen device to explode.

Pretty cool eh?
