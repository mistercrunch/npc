At time of writing the European security comission and interpol were
trying to get the European government to introduce new legislation
that could seriously make life difficult for us Phreakers and Hackers.

The plan being proposed:

1,Realtime security over the internet (This means they will be able to 
catch you and arrest you in the act)

2,Closer integration of European security forces 

3,New legislation that will enable the security forces of one
country to prosecute the Hacker or Phreaker in another country more 
easily

4,Illegaly encrypted E-mail (e.g. PGP and other such programs) will
immediately attract attention

5,Wider use of line taps and the telco will no longer have to inform you
if they are tapping your line or not.




What these basically mean is that the fact you are hacking a system
in another country it would be very difficult for that country to prosecute
you........

Here is a hypothetical situation..

A Hacker in Albania has been Hacking a Military server in France
which he heard about through a French militray VMB that he had hacked 
earlier.

Just now:
If the French wanted to prosecute then they would have to get permission
from the French government, then the Albanian government and then they
would have to decide if they could extradite him. Basically too much
money and too much time to even bother.

After these new laws have been passed:
Albanian hacks French server----------------French police inform 
Albanian police and then hacker is tried in a European court
making him well and truly busted.

Just now though it is looking uncertain if these laws will be passed
because of various problems concerning crusty,obsolete polititians.
If you wan't the latest new about the situation then Keep reading 
S.W.A.T and ill bring you the latest on the situation.

ATTENTION ALL NON UK HACKERS AND PHREAKERS IN EUROPE:

An alliance has recently been formed between Brakis and Sintax both
formerly of Darkcyde. We are setting up a new group that is NOT going
to be a hard up "31337" eleet groop. It is merely going to be a 
laid back,easy going information network that is going to be based 
just on telephony based information gathering. It will mainly be concerned
with European telecommunication so those based in the US please don't 
get in touch. We are looking for a base of no more than 7 members 
who have an interest in Hacking and Phreaking and have enough knowledge 
to get by (especially of their own countries phone and computer systems).
We already have a stronghold in the U.K. and so are looking to recruit 
members in countries who are on mainland Europe i.e. Germany,Spain
France,Sweden etc if this sound like you and you live somewhere in Europe
(including Russia and the Balkans) then please get in touch 
at BRAKIS_LOPEX@HOTMAIL.COM 

Thankyou
