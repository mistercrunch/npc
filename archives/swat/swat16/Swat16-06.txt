This is mainly for all you newbies out there who are just starting off into
the world of hacking.  You will find hundreds of exploits on the net ready 
to be compiled on the target machine.  However I have never come across anywhere
helping you to get the code onto the target.  So i decided to write this file.

Hope it helps.



METHOD1
^^^^^^^

Use cat to input the source code
This is very easy to do. It is also very effective.
All you have to do is type something to the effect of:

machine1:~:$ cat > code.c << STOP
#include <stdio.h>

main()
bla bla
and the rest of your program

then you can compile and run it with:

machine1:~:$ cc -o code code.c
machine1:~:$ code



METHOD2
^^^^^^^

Mail The User The File

This method is simple, easy to do, pretty undetectable, but sometimes may be
a touch too slow, depending on the location / speed of the system...just mail
login@host.com the file or whatever, then wait at the other side for them to
get it.



METHOD3
^^^^^^^

FTP the file to the system

Using an FTP client, you can FTP to the remote server from your system, then
upload the files to the server, but you will most probably get logged, and so
if your exploits fail, this may not be such a good idea...




I hope that helps out all u newbies.
