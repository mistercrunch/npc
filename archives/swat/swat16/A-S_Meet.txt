A-S is planning a meet-up in Manchester, which will be a monthly event.
It's currently set to hold the first one on a Weekend in mid-summer so
that it's attendable whether you work or are in education.
Expect to see :  Armageddon, Valen, possibly Loki & Neurosplicer +

Newcastle, London and even rumours of people coming from Cardiff and 
Scotland to attend the first one.
The meeting point at the moment is set for Victoria station and we'll 
be then moving on the Cathedral Archers (a MASSIVE pub).
