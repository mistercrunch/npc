So what are large scale firebombs? well take your normal molatov
cocktail, multiply it by 15 and add a timer, there you have a large
scale firebomb. Ok so you can't throw it, but they do wonders on
vehicles/phone boxes/garden sheds almost anywhere really. Ok so for
these little devices you will need:

5 Litle water bottle (the ones full of mineral water that cost £1 each)
4.5 liters of petrol/napalm
Cigar Tube (or small pipe bomb)
Optional: Strong oxerdiser, I recommend Potassium Permanganate.
Timer or fuse
Low grade explosive (Black or flash powder work perfect)

Note: Adding a lot of potassium permanganate will cause a huge
explosion, also it can cause the device to become unstable, you should
add it just before you set the timer. Other oxidisers you can use are
Sodium Chlorate or Potassium Nitrate

First off take your cigar tube and punch a small hole in the top, the
hole should be big enought to take the fuse, or igniter. Fill the
tube full of your chosen low grade explosive, pack it loose since it
will work better that way.

Now seal the tube, I would recommend using Epoxy resin and leave it
to cure over night. Don't use anything that will disolve in petrol
because that will seriously decrese the effectiveness of the device.

Fill the bottle with petrol or napalm, this is where you find out that
you got a crapy bottle and it disolves on you, but most of the time
this won't happen.

Add your oxidiser (NOT POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE) and screw on the lid,
the ammount of oxidiser you add depends on how much you have spare,
you could easily add 1kg of Sodium Chlorate. Shake up the solution
until it has all disolved (aren't you glad you didn't add potassium
permangate, if you did you would now be a nice big human fireball).

Unscrew the lid and lower the cigar tube/pipe bomb into the water
bottle which will be filled with your chosen liquid mixed with
an oxidiser. If you chose to use a normal fuse for your device then
you should use something like an anntenna to cover it up and make
sure that no petrol seeps through, it's easily done and I think that
I've previously covered that in another issue.

Ok so now you should have something that looks like this:

        ||
        || <- Fuse/Det wires leading to pipebomb
       _||_
      / || \
    __| || |___
   |    ||    |
   |    ||    | <- Bottle filled with solution
   |   /  \   |
   |   |  |   |
   |   |__|   |
   |__________|

(That is not to scale)

Screw on the lid, chances are you will need to punch a hole in the lid
and seal it with Epoxy resin to make sure that it's water tight.

Ok your pretty much done now, all that you have to do is rig up your
timer and away you go.

Right here's a basic run down on what happens, the pipe bomb in the
center will ignite the petrol/napalm while sending a small shock
wave through it. Thus causing some of the petrol to explode and
spraying it everywhere and burning whatever it splatters on.
You can pretty much add any mixture of flamable substance to it, just
think of it as a large scale molatov cocktail. Even if the petrol
fails to explode enough to cover a large distance (for whatever reason,
petrols explosive anyway and with added oxerdisers it should go up),
then it will burst into flames and spill everywhere.
If you wanted to add a "fail safe" then add magnesium powder to the
low grade explosive mix, hell that'll ignite anything.

Ideas for mixtures instead of petrol/napalm:

Chud:

Chud is cheap and can burn all kinds of things.

To make it all you need is flour and petrol. Fill a bowl 1/3 of the way
full of flour. Then add petrol. Stir it until you get a mixture that is
like dough. It is done.

"Blue Fire":

This is one of my personal favorites, mainly because I made it using a
load of flammable chemicals I had about the house.

Simply mix: Methalated spirits, Turp's, Model plane fuel (any kind),
lighter fluid, sugar (enough to make it a thin syrup) and some kind of
oxidiser. I call it Blue Fire because when I made a molotov with it,
it exploded in the usual orange fireball and continued to burn with a
flame on the ground.

Blue Napalm:

Another one of my little creations, this stuff actually has some good
uses, mainly because if you keep it togeather (in a bottle) then it is
a liquid, but as soon as it splatters on something it will adhear to
it forming a thin film and continue to burn.
Simply mix: Blu-Tak with Lighter fluid (petrol will also work), until
it forms the consistancy of a thick milkshake.

Devastator:

Excuse the name, I couldn't think of anything else to call it, another
piss easy one, naplam (any kind) with a load of Jet-X engines in it,
I don't really have to explain this one do I? ok I will, Jet-X engines
flare up when you ignite them, 'nuff said.
