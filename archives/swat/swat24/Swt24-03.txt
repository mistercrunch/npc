Ok i'm not one for writing hacking articles, mainly because i'm not the
most elite hacker in the group, anyway, while bumming around the
internet in the hope of getting some information about why my shitty
motherboard won't allow my modem to work in Windoze NT (yes i do have
the minimal of NT hacking skills, but with no modem they go to waste),
I came across a program that seems to combine script kiddie technology
with WinNT essential hacker capability. So what the hell does it do?
basically it allows me to put most of my Windows NT hacker skills to
the limit and let me use my Win9x box to hack!
So what does this cool progarm do?

NetBios Scanner, this is very very usefull indeed, bacically it will
scan for a range for NT systems and give you some basic information
about them (name, shares etc)

NAT scanner, for those of you who don't know, this will test a number
of users names and passes on a system to see if they are valid, just
a note for some of you out there: You may be able to get a login and
pass, but without winNT you won't be able to do shit, found this out
while helping Netw0rk Bug with some tasks he had.

NetStat, will give you a nice GUI of your Netstat, you can refresh it
as well, very cool.

Hostname/IP resolver, this is always handy to get IP addresses or host
names.

LMHosts, this will easily add computers to your LMhosts file, very 
handy when used with the NetBios scanner.

Shares, probably THE handiest thing on there, this will allow you to do
what Win9x wouldn't let me do, it will allow you to connect to a shared
drive AND specify a user name and password. You have the option of
specifying the drive letter as well as the option to mount and unmount
it.

Other cool features are the opotion to right click on IP addresses in
the Netbios Scanner and send the IP to the LMhosts file, NAT scanner
or copy it to the clipboard. Handy indeed.

So there we go, a tool that offers atleast some hope to those of you
out there that, like me, you are stuck on a Win9x box when you want
to try your hand at NT systems (even if it is in a limited way), the
potenial of this tool is great, but i won't go on about how to use it
to it's full potential and hack some sites, since that's Netw0rk Bugs
field of expertise!

The tool is called: Essential NetTools
