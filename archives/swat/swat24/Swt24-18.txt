What with the christmas rush in prepay mobilephones, it is a good idea
to tell you all about the various bits and pieces of GSM security.  
The sad truth is more and more of you are buying mobile phones 
and acting like tossers in our city centres,  public toilets  
and parks. OK OK OK I  admit it I too use one of these mobile 
monsters and yes they can be deemed too be useful (however this my
article and  I have been working all day so those of you who use these
things under the guise of "only wanting to use  it for emergency use" 
are wanks).  One of the safest ways of communicating  in the 
underground is with the use of prepay mobile phones. 
    There are two classic examples of how this is the case.
 1) Richard Branson uses Prepay mobile phones for all his business 
    calls
 2) It was revealed by the NCIS last month that the mysterious man 
    whom killed Jill Dando also used a prepay mobile phone. 

This is for the very reason that the things are completely anonymous 
Why is it the British military don't export GSM technology to countries
like Indonesia ? Also the beauty of prepay mobile phones is that they
are completely anonymous and some of them offer features that we 
Phreakers may find usefull such as free 0800 calls, One2one is a 
particularly good network for things like this.

      The only real way they can get at you is by knowiing your 
geographical location and I very much doubt that they are going to 
attempt to trace you to any great extent.
