Recently in Seattle, to coincide with the WTO negotiations. There were
what was labelled as ''counter culture'' demonstrations.
To me these riots seem a sign that the beliefs and ideas that SWAT has
been espousing for years are finally going mainsitream.
Notable people who were inuolued included Krist Novoselic, formerly 
bass player in grunge band Niruana. His political pressure group 
JAMPAC, fervent aduocates of free speech and anti-hate. If you want to 
check out their angle go to www.jampac.org.
Also, watching BBC News 24, I heard some journalist make quite an
