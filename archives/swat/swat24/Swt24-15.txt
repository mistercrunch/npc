If your like me, then you'll be use to the odd attack of paranoia,
whether this is due to you breaching the security of a server or (like
me) your just like that at times :-)
So i'd like to describe the numerous ways in which i like to make
myself feel nice and safe by encrypting stuff, protecting my Win95 box
(which is the only thing i can seem to get online- Mandrake seems to
freeze everytime it connects to the net) from a number of things
including virus's, trojans, outside attacks, physical access, prying
eyes etc.

Ok first off Virus's and Trojans, best way to protect against these
would be virus scanners, but it's worth bearing in mind that even
though a mate of mine had the most up to date version of Norton Anti
virus, Win95.CIH still killed his hard drive, so what's my point?
Norton is crap. I use two virus checkers myself, since i've never seen
a single anti-virus (no matter how up to date it is) stop all of the
virus's out there, so i use InoculateIT PE and F-Prot for DOS, ok so
what's the reason behind this? well they are both free for a start
and one is for DOS while the other for Windows. DOS virus scanners will
be able to disinfect files like explorer.exe (where Norton seems to
fail - well it did when i checked it last) which are used by windows
and DOS scanners are usually a lot faster. I use Inoculate PE when
ever my computer isn't doing anything. As for Trojans, well i use
The Cleaner, most virus scanners can find a lot of the trojans out
there, but The Cleaner comes out best when its down to specific trojan
cleaning your after.

Next up outside attacks, well ok not many people can get into Win95
boxes from the outside without the use of a trojan, but it is however
possible to nuke the box, which is a tad annoying to say the least.
Ok best way to protect against this is a Firewall, i recomment Conseal
since it seems to offer the best protection as well as being highly
configurable, just be warned that it's a real basdard to set up if you
don't know how. NukeNabber is also fairly good if you just want to
protect against certain ports, i wouldn't bother going to all of the
trouble of those programs that block specific trojan ports and send
text that says "You have been caught trying to hack this box with BO,
we have your IP" first off all you've done is ping the specific port
and as far as i'm aware that isn't hacking (then again niether is using
a trojan, but i won't get into that) and you can't get busted for
pinging a port no matter what anyone says, but i'm getting side tracked
on that, anyhow go for something like NukeNabber if you just want to
watch ports, because if something sends out 100 bytes of text each time
somebody pings a port with a few bytes, you easily have your bandwidth
taken up by some guy on a cable connection flooding that port.
Oh yeah just a little tip that i find amusing, most lamers that try to
connect to boxes with trojans often have trojans on there own boxes, so
if you happen to find one, just format there hard drive, yeah i know
it's lame, but it's fun and it keeps them off the net for a while.

Physical Access, to me anyway, means people actually using the computer
to any extent. So somebody sitting at your box doing god knows what to
it is kind of unsettleing. So we have ways of stopping people doing
that. First off is passwords, a BIOS password will keep people out to
an extent, but anyone who knows the first thing about BIOS passwords
knows how to get around them, whether it's by a backdoor password or
resetting the BIOS via the motherboard. So how about we tweak a few
options in Win95 to allow us to add our own options, well rather than
go on and on about fiddling with files and such like, just search the
net for "TweakU" and grab a copy of that, you'll be able to alter a
few options in windows that'll not only make it run faster but give us
the option to add out own security features, my personal favorite is
to turn off the option to press F8 (or whatever it is) and have the
option to go thought the Autoexec.bat file loading each line at a time.
The reason i like this is because you can add lines to the autoexec.bat
file to load your own custom program, i usually use a simple program
written in QBasic that prompts you for a password, something like this:

--cut--
10 print "Enter password:"
20 input $pass
30 if $pass = "letmein" then goto end
40 if $pass = "" then goto 10
50 end
--cut--

yeah i know that it's simple, but it's a start. Then there's other
programs out there that restrict access to parts of Win95, you can
always use them. But at the end of the day Windows security is total
shite and can be bypassed by a 4 year old.
Which is why we turn to Encryption...
I use PGP and PGPDisk to hide away all of the sensitive data that i
have, whether it's a list of CC numbers, passwd files from numerous
computer systems or just private e-mails sent to me.
A good idea is to create a PGP disk of 600mb and on occation back it
up onto CD (if you own a CD burner that is). I don't really have to
go on about encryption all that much since i'm sure that you all ready
know about it and it's uses.

Next up is data deletion. Well you can delete all of that data that you
stole from some company but it's no good if the government decide to
take a peek at your hard drive with either software recovery tools or
hardware recovery tools. So you need to make sure that the data is
well and truly deleated. For this i recommend East-Tec Eraser. You have
the option to wipe files, specify direcories that you often wipe and
just cleanse them every so often (windows temp, recent files links and
internet cache amoung others). You can also clean up the free space and
file slack with it. The good thing is that you can specify how you wipe
data, you can use normal wipe with a single pass of zeros, right the
way up to "Stop hardware recovery" and wipe the living shit out of the
free space/files on your hard drive with about 7 or 8 passes, or best
of all you can specify your own wipe method to your own standards.

Well i hope that this has proved to be of some use to you all.
If your looking for any of the tools described in here, search the
net for them!
