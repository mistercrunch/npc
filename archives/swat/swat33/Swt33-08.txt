Who remembers F.A.T magazine?-well it seems some people do and liked
our activity descriptions,o.k-heres all the things from the 'stuff we
done' bit for peole to laugh at

ANARCHY ON THE WASTELAND
Done by deathbringer and sorcerror
Every city worth its british-ness has a run down bit of concrete
with fridges and cars dumped on it.The one we went to is often a
testing ground for improvised weapons by everybody in the area as we
can tell from the craters and burnt grass there.We used it just to do
some RSD and build a bomb.We went down there and first set up our bomb,
it was a flattend bean tin filled with sodium chlorate powder.We made a
pile of sodium chlorate and set the tin into it,lit it and ran.Bugger it
didnt go off,tried 3 times then it eventually ripped open abd blew out
loads of fire with a big whoosh!(wich i didnt hear because i was 100
meters away behind a concrete block with my hans in my ears-for safety
reasons).After this we engraved a big anarchy sine into an old plastic
sine that was already totally coverd with paint and then went along a
path,climbed over a flattend fence and a 'danger deep water-keep back'
sign(yes spelt it right).We then chucked a big rock into the lake there,
bugger a fisherman decided to see what was going on so we ran off

THE BIN FIRE
Done by deathbringer&sourcerror
He came round mine to sleep over for a weekend and we sneaked out at 3in
the morning,here is what we did:
First we made some smoke-powder(more on it later) and took it to the
allotments (publicly owned food growing place) where we set it off and made
a huge cloud of smoke that stayed there for ages.Meanwhile we waz up to
differnt things,we went to the park and put some papers in a bin and lit
them.Bugger they ran out and it still stood so we went to the other bin
and put in some smokepowder (1/2 a kg of it!) and lit it with paper.I then
threw in match heads and a lighter which exploded with a deep BOOOM and
blew out tons of fire.We ran phucking miles and i heard the faint crack
of another explosion(heist knows what it was).After a bit of a sturuggle
trying to open a jammed backdoor quitley we gave up and went in the front
for a sleepless night(because i downloaded porn and he watched a film about
satanists-channel 5 of course)

THE SHOOTING
seen by deathbringer,done by an unoficial member
While i was on my bus travelling to the pits of hell the unoficial member
(T.F) started firing off a bb gun.Theres a lamer who is always being
patriotic and sexist who took one shot from it.As T.F went back to get his
bullet he shot him again at point blank range and gave him a big bruise.The
kid fainted later  (pretended to) and t.f got done by the filth,still,pretty
entertaining.

THE CHEAP-ASS FRAUD
done by sorcerror and 4 other unofficial members,rumor-milled to me after
a while Sourcerror found a credit card number generator on the internet
and used it to get about 30 numbers wich they orderd 5 laptops with(just a
little cheap thing to practice with).This came to about £10000-BUUUUT they
got found out and the order was cancelled.They are trying again though,last
i heard they where buying a house

A MINOR EXPLOSION 
Done by sorcerror and differnt friends
They filled a bog roll with greens explosive and put it near somebodys bmw
(so someone didnt see the fuse burning and put it out).As it went off
sorcerror casually looked back to see the damage and just saw the cars
front crash back down and the lights and windows break.FUCK!.This doesnt
mean we like to blow up peoples property(unless there our leaders)but they
just didnt expect it to be that powerful

ATTACK FROM ABOVE
Done by:deathbringer,sourcerror and ivan
At lunch in school we go to this room upstairs next a bit where students
usually walk along-and this room was full of elastic bands and paper!.Soon
we had made a load of pellets and took aim-Heres some of our funnier hits
1-A guy got slapped from the girl infront of him after one hit her ass
2-This little kid got shot on the head by me then as he looked around a mate
shoted gotcha! Out of the window.He kept looking around really scared then 
ran off
3-A lamer took who kept warning people about us as they went past (to wreck
our vengance for mr jamal) took no less than 12 shots in about a muinite
before retreating

BUS FUN
Done by deathybringer
The elastic band wars where raging on the bus too-only I was the only one
who could make em right and small enogh so they flew well.I also started to
fire them with one of theese jar-jar sticky tounge things-they flew at the
speed of light!.This also caused a bit of pain,he he-wait till I get some
caps to glue on the front-small rocket launcher!
THE SHORTEST CRANKS EVER
Also done by deathbringer
It really was,I called a lamer for about 2 seconds and my school for an even
shorter time
THE SCHOOL ONE:
Op:hello,Saint bollocks school,how can I help you
Me:im gonna knife ya!
THE LAMER ONE:
J.l:helll-o
Me:err I can even smell you through the fone
Both these where done on a day when I did a few other things as well,like
there are theese little disc boxes at our school computers now and I stole
a disc and left a little note that said:
#4 #4 d|D Y00 +#|Nk | w0UldN+ $+34l +#3M
from the 31337 #4k3R

SCHOOL DESTROYING
DONE BY:DEATHBRINGER
Now youll probably not remember that last month I said about us ripping signs
and stuff up in school well it escalated this month
I had a bit of metal that I discovered fitted neatly into screws.a few days later
and the school had a complaint from someone about a exposed lightswitch with no
cover on.heh.And also I took away a sign for a room that was screwd in and wrote
'yes I am taking the piss' and hid it,wait till they find it (yes I did disguise
my hadwriting to look like someone from the conformist mainstream had done it-I
wonder if anyone will get done for it-heh heh

R.S.D ER 4-ODD HOURS
DONE BY DEATHBRINGER AND SOURCERROR (and boy did we enjoy it)
I went round sourcerrors house for a bit of phun,the end result was a insane run
of destruction and practical jokes.First we went into the town center (a large
city in cambrigeshire-work out which one) and I brought a pen that writes with
paint (the master tool of graffiti artistes) and used it for a few anarchy signs
and stuff.Look for adam and evel road next time your er wherever.Later we saw a
sticker that said something about natwest killing animals (BTW-A week later there
was a cool protest,if my pearents werent there and I didn't have a sex pistols
cd to listen to I woulda joined in-honest).Well I belived it was true so went
to crank their number ( 0800 505050 ) but shit they had all gone to their nests.
Still,where it said 'ad call-free phone calls I changed it to 'free phone
calls- blue box'..Any way I had a 'pipe' bomb that I made at home (actually a
bit of cardbord pipe whit 2ps in the end and tape round it full of sodium
chlorate) we went to this 'free land' (read:shit hole) to set it off.First I
tried to light it (we used an indoor sparkler for the fuse) but someone was
coming so we let him go past.Then a train came.Sourcerror lit it but this girl
came round on a bike,shit!!! There where thoughts going through my head of her
with a 2p shot into her neck laying dead on the rails below.BUUUT..the bomb
just burnt and made a load of smoke,phew that wouldn't even get us an arson
charge.I set another one off that was intended to smoke and to cries of 'flares
are coming back in man' sourcerror knocked it off the bridge onto the rails.We
then tried several attempts to start a forest fire by chucking sparklers and
burning paper around but they all went out (but still did damage and made people
shit themselves).We went to a lampost and wrote fat roolz on it then went into my
school to see if anything was up,tried to damage something but it was too strong
so I wrote a big anarchy sign and wrote 'fat own3d joo' on it then sorcerror
chucked this metal thing at the window but it was reinforced so didn't break,
the crack was big though at which point we decided to run.Later we came back and
ripped off a bit of wall progressivley.IE:Rip run rip run rip run peel of
insulation to reveal inner wall,kick shit out of enter. and I pissed in the
hole yes that was sick but the tree we where going to put in wouldn't come out
of the ground-we know to take saws next time.Oh yeah we threw the bits of wall
into a ditch. (Teachers: if your reading this you wont catch me and its an old
mobile so it wasn't exactly serious now was it) I bet writing THAT  gets me
busted We went to one of sourcerrors friends houses and told them about our
'run' which they thought was 'suitable' (for an hours work) then thought we'd
go to a fonebox to try and power it down.Damn that doesn't seen to work anymore
(it said test mode so I dailled 02 like it said I swat magazine but nothing
happened except a funny tone and the fone still worked afterwards).We walked
back home cause our time was nealry up so he set fire to this bit of paper and
chucked it over a fence then we went back and I had to go home
 
SCHOOL HAVOK
DONE BY DEATHBRINGER,IVAN AND PSYCHOMETALLICA
We had planned to fuck over our school for a while now and finally the day had
come.First I wanderd round looking for sourcerror but I found out from ivan he
had chickend out.Anyway I went into a toilet and got out my trusty paint pen and
wrote
-1234-we want a class war
-Up the fuckin punx,sid vishous owns joo
and
-BAN THE BOMB!
And also went over some old graffiti like anarchist!!!!!!!!! And fat own yoo.
I then unscrewd the metal bit where the bolt from the lock slides across and
took it with me.I put my rio back in my bag cause I don't know why I took it
with me (Redboxing maybe,not that ive got the tones on it mr bt man) and threw
the bolt thingy into a bin.Later me and ivan went into the library and sat down
near a heater with a VERY big book on the planets.I started to undo the heater
knob but a teacher came so I quickly hid it.She went away and ivan carried on-
squeak,squeak clunk tiiiiing!.The whole room goes silent then noise picks up again,
I pocket the knob as a little trophy and walk out.We start to walk along and get
two well meaning but FUCKING annoying girls following us,after losing them (by
singing,no growling anarchy in the uk) ivan had to sort something out so I left
him to it.Later on I went into a lesson with computers,hmm I had put a load of
virii on one but I needed to edit autoexec.bat for them to work and there was
too much witnesses around.I went and pulled out the network connection from a
load of them and fucked around with them and cause they wernt on the network
the admin couldn't monitor me (but I couldn't use the internet-bugger) So
anyway I left a load of digital graffiti (text files with a message left on
the hard drive for anyone to see who is bored in a lesson) that said stuff like
anarchy rules and the words for friggin' in the riggin' by the sex pistols (I know
theres a racist bit in it but the songs so fucking funny).I also took out the
mouse and threw it in a bin and re-named the fonts folder on another.Later on
the bus home I wrote anarchy in the uk and the sign on a seat and started to
unscrew something 
And the next day we...
Got to school,this time I had the heavy artillery,a multi tool!,Well anyway I
went to this bit under a stairwell and wrote anarchie pour sur la uk (And it was
nowhere near a french room).Also I unscrewd the cover on a lightswitch (tee hee
for health and saftey reasons they have to have them on there).

going on holiday and removing one of the P's from
'please show your passes' on a sign

THE LAST GREAT SCHOOL ANARCHY
It was our last day of school on may 12th so,like everybody we left causing
havoc and destruction-hahahha.
Before I got on the bus I drew a big anarchy sign in the gravel that's probably
still there.On the bus I wrote a few anarchy signs and we where passing round a
bottle of coke with a special ingredient added in.When we got there some of the
teachers cars and a minibus where coverd in paper and tape,further on there was
a big barricade of razor wire and tape across a little 'bridge' thing between two
doors (not on my doom level so don't look).Anyway I made some 'out of order' signs
and put them around and then we had to go to a history lesson where we watched
blackadder all the way through.Later on when we had our break sourcerror came
in (from skiving) and we put up some weird posters the he went again.Probably
cause he had organised a 'beer festival' and loads of hells angels and truckers
where due to arrive by 11 (but they didn't).And then we had more booooring
lessons including a learning support one that only I showed up for but at least
when the teacher went out I did an anarchy sign in the dust on some books.Then
at lunch me and ivan rebuilt 'the shrine' where all the hitler books are in one
place.We also did some graffiti and stuff.After that the idea was just bugger
about on the field and we wrote a load of stuff on a bin.And then we had a looong
assembly and went home on the bus which got a few more anarchy signs written on
it.Well anyway I also took a lot of pictures of all the damage and things so I'll
put them up on the site sometime

SOURCERRORS A BUGGER INNE?
Heres something sourcerror sent me,track 24 is otherwise known as friggin in
the riggin by the sex pistols.(Which isnt the thing you get the vicar to
hear-but this bugger sent it to 200 vicars)

of england (about 200 churchs!)
