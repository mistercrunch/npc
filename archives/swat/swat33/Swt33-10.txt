<situation> So youve made that fire bomb, and you havent got any firework fuse
left..damn...all you have is a box of matches...hmmmm...make a rigid fuse!

Right, first, cut the match heads off the sticks (lol), so you have like 50
heads.  Good, now, glue them in a line, so they can be lifted up when dry. 
Excellent, now glue the string to the match heads, so if it breaks, it wont get
lost...

it should look like =
