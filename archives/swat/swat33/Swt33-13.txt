Materials:
-Non-Dairy Coffe Creamer
-1 Lighter

Procedure:
1.Take a handfull of non-dairy coffee creamer.
2.Light the lighter under your hand several inches.
3.Release the powder over the flame letting it turn into a dust before it
hits the flame.

This creates a huge fireball, it might take a while to get right, but when
you get the hang of it you can make 5
foot fireballs on the first try easily.This is a great trick to show people
at night, it'll light up the whole street giving it a larger looking effect.
You can go into a resturant or coffe place (Dunkin Donuts) and take like 25
packets of these. It's really easy to get it for free, and that makes it even
better.
