Well you heard it last month in SWAT, but I'll summarise it for you if you
haven't
already.
FireStarter and Goblinz both went to DNS-CON this year and they had a GREAT time
including dunking ARMAGEDDON (the A-S leader) into the Irish sea, and then
Geddon was
reported to have ran off crying... awwww, the poor boy got a little muddy and
wet
nevermind, mummy will clean him up....
Gobz also shot Geddon in the elbow with a BB gun and they caused all sorts of
havoc
from stealing multiple items that you wouldn't normally, like various signs, and
a
ticker that counts the number of people going into the tiolet (worth about £70)
and
all sorts. They generally had a great time and socialised with some interesting
people....
.... Oh and did I mention, they made Geddon look like a complete dickwad,
actually
that ain't very hard to do, and it's also reported that some A-S "pixies" that
were
there, were all for getting Geddon, and helped do it....
Oh well, nice to see how loved he is, right?

One more thing, we've heard something about what would happen if SWAT made a big
deal
out of what happened... so... I got one thing to say... Geddon, go fuck a
ferret.
Photo's of the best bits of DNS-CON can be found on the SWAT site, including
pics
of Geddon getting his just deserts :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two months after we discovered that swateam.org had been hijacked, we have now
regained control, and www.swateam.org is back up :)
F_S got the domain up late last month, and it's all working now, so that's that
:)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we are changing the SWAT site design once again :)

We are looking for anyone who wants to help with the site, to contact F_S as
soon
as possible, we've had some people contact us, but we are looking for the best
design we can get.

We would appreciate it if the design were compatible with Netscape and Internet
Explorer
and any other browsers as well (Mozilla etc..)

If you DO want to help out, then please contact me at phreakazoid@hitemup.com
                                        FireStarter at xellent55@hotmail.com

or catch either of us on IRC in #cocytusuk on irc.darker.net
