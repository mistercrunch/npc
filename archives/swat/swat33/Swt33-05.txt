This is a collection of easy-to-make bombs,mostly already known to
people-and some ive made myself-also for each one i'll put saftey
measures,a rating and weather or not its been tested by me.

TENNIS BOMB
You need-
1 tennis ball
a knife
a lot of match-heads
O.k,we all know this one dont we?-cut a slit in the ball,cram a load
of match-heads in and tape it up.To set it off throw it against
something to make it explode in a cool diaplay of blazing matches.Now,
for this to work,It'd probably depend on the ammont of match heads and
how well they where crammed in,also if they are saftey or strike-anywhere
types.Of course,you could always tear up some bits of striker and stick
em in there too.Or cram in some gunpowder

Saftey measures:
-Dont drop it!
-Dont squeeze it
-Dont tread on it
-Dont make it
Likleyness to work-3/5 (4 if fired from something,like a speed server)
rating:3/5
Tested?:no

SIMPLE SMOKE BOMB-invented by me (sorta)
You need-
Sodium chlorate weedkiller
sugar
epsom salts
film canister
tape
indoor sparkler 

Now,i assume everybody can get the shit to make this,hell,i did! 
anyway-take the film canister (the black plastic camera film) and puch a
hole in the lid-Get your 3 ingredients and grind them seperatley so there
more powderd than they are-then fill the canister with the mix (you dont
need much),tape the canister up good and tight.now stick an indoor
sparkler in the hole.Hold the device and light the fuse-wait till you
can see the smoke from the powder starting-then chuck it!

Saftey measures:
-Careful when grinding up the cheimcals,dont do it once there together
-After the powder starts burning-you really should chuck it!
-Dont make it

Likleyness to work-4.9/5-sodium chlorate can be a bitch to light,but the
sparklers are HOT!
rating-2/5 (doesnt really do to much)
Tested:yes-only we forgot the tape and it fell apart halfway to the tracks

SUPER SMOKE BOMB!
You need-
sodium chlorate weedkiller
water
two jars
a few sheets of kitchen roll

Stir some sodium chlorate into the water,leave it for a while
(about a day)-then put the sheets over the other (prefrably larger) jar
and pour the soultion through the paper-if you get any clear stuff on the
top that doesnt stick-save it,its pure(er than befor) sodium chlorate-and
goes like anyfink-but anyway-let the paper dry out and then look at it-is
it coverd in clear-ish crystals and rigid?-good! light the bastard up and
stand back-and dont breathe in!

Saftey measures:
-Wash your hands-just a tiny bit of sodium chlorate can make you feel
awful and throw up (thats tiny bit as in two grains!)

-Dont hold it when you light it,it burns up bloody quick
-Dont breathe the smoke,it cant be good for yer
-Dont make it
Likeleyness to work-5/5 (if it doesnt,kill yourself)

Rating-4/5 (fucking excellent!!!!!!)
Tested?-yes!-a proto type sourcerror threw out the window (hardly any sod
clor on it) went for ages!-and i set off a good one in the back extension
on our house while holding it-it filled the entire thing up with smoke
and had all burnt up by the time it got outside from me chucking it
