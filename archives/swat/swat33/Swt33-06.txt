Right, heres how to alter peoples Voice mail messages on BT Cellnet
PAYG (Pay And Go, U, Unsure about Easylife) fones. First of all, the
call is national rate, and posibly traceable so I either recommend you
Beige Box (Best idea, you can go on for ages with no cost) or 141 your
number. First of all dial in 0802 190 100 and some BT Cellnet person says
some crap. Just start typing in the number of the fone e.g 07718 541976
and the existing voice mail should play. Press # at any time during the
voice mail and it will ask for your PIN code. The default PIN in 8705 so
try that. If that doesnt work, and you know the person try stuff like
their birth year, day/month (e.g 2502) etc. Once in you can change the
persons voice mail message etc. The only thing you cant do from a
landline is change the PIN code. I will write a detailed explainations
of the menus on the voice mail service soon. Thanx for reading, I am
Jelly PsYchO, Seeya all later.
