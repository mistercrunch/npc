Well i figured that i might as well get my arse in gear and write some
words of wisdom for you all to ingest. Well i gotta be honest lately
i've not had much time to put into SWAT, i dunno how long it's gonna
be before i'm back on track, but things are still getting done and
i'm still getting the magazine out! Oh, thats a point, if your not on
the mailing list then i advise you to join it! the reason is that the
people on the list will almost certainly get the magazine a week or
so before it goes "live" on the web site.

So, yeah, anyhow other news that may (or may not) be of any use is the
SWAT site update, ok let me explain a little about what is going on
with that, well i was working on the new design and i got a good portion
of it all done, then something SERIOUS came up, which was pretty much a
"life or death" situation, well as far as being a free man and being
Bubba's play thing goes, so it was a case of PGPDisking my entire
hard drive, burning them to CD then getting rid of the CD's followed
by a nice overwrite of my hard drive (Note - if you EVER try to overwrite
a 20.4GB Hard drive 7 times to comply with the DoD standard - set a WHOLE
day aside!). Anyway, that allowed me time to move over the Linux and
get a load of shit done in that, then my monitor blew up - a result of a
dodgy graphics card, so i got a new GFX card and then a new monitor.
Over all this took a month or two to get fully sorted, by this time 
everything had blown over, so i installed a spare 4gb hard drive i had
lying around and bunged Win98 on there. A quick attempt to access the
PGPdisk volumes failed because they where made in Win2k. But of course
i still have computer problems due to an error with re-flashing my BIOS,
and it not liking my DVD or CDRW drives, but thats no problem because i
have Win2k on a spare box so i can FINALLY get the web site design back.

So the point is, the web sites new design will get worked on soon, and
the reason the current site is stale is because its not worth working on
too much while i'm working on the new site!

As for other stuff, well personal problems and illness have been keeping
me from doing a lot with the magazine and the group, but i assure you
that SWAT is carrying out some "operations", many of these where sorted
out on IRC with NBug, Phreakazoid, Doh-Boy myself, and for a tiny ammount
of time, Brakis (untill we realised he was too drunk to see his keyboard
which was why he wasn't saying anything or what he did say was bullshit),
anyway, SWAT's projects are also gonna take up some time once i can get
my life sorted out, the projects will be detailed in SWAT Mag once we
feel that we've got good enough stuff to put in articles!
