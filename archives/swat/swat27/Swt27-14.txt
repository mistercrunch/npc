The third revenge section will be dealing with some highly illegal shit
at the start, but I'm sure all you anarchists will love every minuite
of it.

I'm sure all of you have seen these temporary traffic lights all over
the show during road works. The old ones operate by wires running to
each other over a distance of about 100ft give or take a bit. The new
ones however communicate by radio signals, and these are the ones to
look out for especially. They were prototypes when a set were 'borrowed'
them from their standing spot by the road last year. THEY ARE WORTH
THOUSANDS! Thats the battery unit & radio transmitter included. But
they are a bit heavy so I wouldn't suggest that you try running down
the road on your own with them - you wont make it - unless you are
fairly strong - but then again you WILL NOT MOVE THE
BATTERY-TRANSMITTER UNIT by yourself. This SHOULD be done around 3am
and keep a look out for latenight traffic or police cars. 

So how does this all tie in with revenge? Well, you will have to start
by steeling one, two or maybe more traffic lights. These are going to
be delivered to your victim's back garden if possible, and hidden at
the very back so they will not notice. It doesn't have to be in the
same night so give yourself plenty of thinking time for this operation,
keeping your mischief out of sight as much as possible. Also you could
start with as many street signs as possible, and those yellow flashing
lights. 

Once your victim has recieved these in the back garden its now time for
a bit of REAL fun. Phone the police from a phone box stating that you
are a neighbour (from across the road from the victim) or just a
passer by, and that you saw some strange goings on from across the way.
Say that you have regularly seen a man taking street signs, lights,
etc into the back garden. Now phone up the local council demanding
that you want a ransom of £5,000 or however much you want to say, to
the victim's home before midnight or you will destroy the traffic
lights (making them think you are the victim that is as stupid as to
give away their own address in the conversation). They will obviously
know the lights are missing and immediately phone the police. 

Your target being totally unaware of the 'small' package he has
recieved in his back garden, will recieve a visit from the police if
all goes as planned, and hopefully find the traffic lights. They will
be arrested by the police and taken for questioning.

If you stand at a far enough distance and watch for the police to come,
phone up the papers and news saying that there is a massif drugs bust,
riot or whatever the fuck you want to get the newspaper reporters down
as quickly as possible. You can laugh your ass off if you put your mind
to this stunt. It should have wasted a large amount of the councils
money to replace the lights & cause absolute havoc.

****	
In fact I think we should all join forces steeling traffic lights from
all over the country and see whether it hits national news. One can
only wish!
****

So do we leave our friend of these outragous attacks alone at this
point. Well, if this person has been sent down for a crime he/she
didn't do then YES. If they haven't, then we can start another (less
illegal & more simple) attack. Collect as many used stamps as possible.
Get friends and family to help collect 'em. Now you have a fairly
desent pile of them, you need to buy as many envelopes as possible.
When you send people a letter with a used stamp they have to pay the
price of the stamp (I don't know about any additional charge).

Affix the envelopes with the stamps, and try to get labelled printouts
of the victims address to save time and stop the chances of being
associated with the hand writing. Hopefully your friends will help you
on this mission. Once all the envelopes are done you can send what ever
you want to them. This can include red amber & green sheets of paper to
remind them of their traffic light accusations by the police. If
parcels exceed a certain weight the charge should increase. Just to
make sure - wear gloves to avoid finger prints and post in MANY
different post boxes so there isn't a pattern emerging which the police
could catch you for. Just be careful and remember to give up after a
bit!

If all this doesn't send your new found friend - the target of your
games - over the edge, combined by the last two revenge articles, then
 I don't know what will. If the worst comes to the worst, try the
article from the Jolly Roger Cookbook I think it was called "Operation
Fuckup". So have fun & take care.
