A little amusment for all that know SWAT and it's members (and some
others)

Right, we (meaning f_s, UG, Phreakaziod, -=TnC=-, _Smurf_) assembled
to perform a mission, like no other mission that had been performed b4.
f_S, being the kiddie pr0n hater that he is threatned to hack our boXes
(ye, right) if we didn't help him on this rather craZy mission.  We
assembled @ 08:00 hours, with the equipment that we needed.   f_s had
brought his whole fucking anarchist toolbox, UG had brought his wallet,
phreakazoid had brought his tupac-ish ways (quote 'u better back the
fuck up b4 u get smacked the fuck up) -=TnC=- had brought his generally
good sense of humour and list of werking cc's, just in case we needed
a pizza and _smurf_ had brought nothing, just his devilish face >:-(

WE got to our targets destination by around 11:00, and by the way, the
target was a building holding every single webserver containing a
kiddie pr0n website (every ONE server....).  The plan was to distract
the girl security guards away from the d00r of the building, so we
could get in and sMaSh the place to bits!

_Smurf_ tried a diversion first, he just walked up to the 3 guards and
snarled at them, which normally makes girls run for cover (lol)
(j/k m8).  It didn't werk....maybe the guards had been trained to not
pay attention to devil like people.  Next, and this was my part of the
plan, UG walked up to the guards...(oh yeah, if u don't know, UG is
L0aDeD)..he proceded to drop his credit cards and wads of money in
front of the guards.  The guards quickly l00ked at him and he looked
back with a wink.  Maybe the guards could resist a devil, but not a
rich ginger :)

With the guards out the way, we proceeded to enter the building (minus
UG, he was shaggin the guards).  The plan was to find the server r00m
b4 the cops came to the building, and if they did, we were safe cause
Phreak's tupac quotes would scare them off....  We found the server
r00m and f_s was already rigging the C-4 bombs to the walls outside
the server r00m and when we entered f_s and -=TnC=- and Smurf went
absolutly BeRsErK0 (phreak was freestyling about the incident)...
planting bombs, smashing the place up etc...everything a g00d anarchist
can do....!

When we were finished, f_s got the timer ready and we split.  We nearly
didn't make it to the outside of building, f_s's dodgy timebomb blew
up 10 secs early :)  With the explosion came glass, and a 1,000,000 of
 Gary Glitter dreams ruined :) BTW, Ug was still shagging these birds
:)
