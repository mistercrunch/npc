Over the next few issues I will bring you many recipes on cooking with
cannabis from the famous brownies to huge crack cakes.

Hash Yoghurt:

It is one  of my favourite recipes and it is also one of the easiest.
Prepare in a teaspoon enough hash for a decent spliff. Add a small
amount of cooking oil into the spoon so that it covers all the hash.
Then heat the spoon with a lighter for about 2 minutes. The cooking
oil will start to bubble and become cloudy with a dark colour. The oil
extracts the THC from the hash and 'brings it to the surface'. When all
the hash has dispersed into the oil, have a yoghurt ready prepared. Dip
the spoon, with its contents, into the yoghurt and stir. Leave for 5
minutes to let it disperse into the yoghurt, however if you can't wait
that long, eating instantly is still alright. When finished, throw away
yoghurt carton and prepare for a trip!  Note: Let the oil/hash mixture
cool before mixing to avoid curdling the yoghurt.

2. Use as little oil as possible so as not to impair the yoghurt's
   flavour.

3. If you only have one spoon, let it cool before diving in!


Well thats all for this month but I will be back with more recipes
next issue.
