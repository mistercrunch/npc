Ok I thought I would take this opportunity to show you HOW. Unknown
Guest gained access to a NT machine connected to my network.
The network I have consists of 21 fixed computers, 4 laptops, 2
routers, 1 100mbit 16-port hub, 1 100mbit 3-port hub and 1 10mbit
8-port hub.

The Network is connected as follows:



[Section 1]     Server1------Hub-------Server2         [Area 1]
                              |
                            Router
                              |
[Section 2]     L-L-L-L------Hub -----------------------       [Area 2]
                              |                         |
[Section 3] C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C       |
                                                      Router
[Section 4]                                             |
                                    ---- C-C---- Hub -- |      [Area 3]
                                    |             |
                                    |             |
                                    |________C-C__|

When any person connects to the network they reach a Solaris machine
that is secured very well. From there you are redirected to another
machine.
The machine it connects to is random (but it does follow a ratio)
The Chances of being connected to a: 
Section 1 machine is 1:25
Section 2 machine is 0:25
Section 3 machine is 24:25
Section 4 machine is 0:25

When Unknown Guest connected to the network he was connected to
Server1 and then redirected to a machine in section 3.
The Machine he connected to was a NT machine that was not running its
www service properly. The reason why this box was connected to my
network was so I could fix it, Usually the machine is connected to a
LAN I someone else's house.

What was on that machine? The Pamela Anderson Archive.
It contains all sorts of stuff such as 'The Movie', Normal Pics, Bios
and all sorts of stuff.
The Mpeg Unknown Guest accessed was just an extract from the movie.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Now how did he get in?
My theory is went into the Dos Prompt and typed
"nbtstat -A 213.45.67.890" he then would have received a net bios
information table. Why this is built into NT I'll never know.
The table gives you information on usernames on the system, it also
give you details about the group that is logged on.
From there he typed, "Net view \\213.24.67.890"
This gave him a list of active shares on the machine
He would have got a list of something like
\\212.24.67.890\as
\\212.24.67.890\MyDocs
\\212.24.67.890\overloaded
\\212.24.67.890\proxy
And some other stuff, not to sure what.
As far as I can remember some machines shares had passwords on, but
that was not relevant because he decided not to give up.
He found a user on the system called "Rob 'The Random Sex Goose'
Graham". Prizes for the first person to guess what his password was.
To log on to the shares he used "net logon" and logged in as rob (with
his 'amazing' password)
Then he used "net use F: \\213.45.67.890\as" then went to
'my computer' in windows and just deleted the files.
Then he was able to access the shares just the same but replacing the
"AS" with any other share.
This article is not designed make anyone look stupid etc....It was
just to resolve a point.

If I get some time I will setup a machine for you all to have ago.
Should be at "ntserver4.212.56.119.157". But I may not make it online.
And don't forget to check out Overloaded for the exploits that I find.
(Some big ones coming soon)
