Ok myself and Goblinz (hacked666 on ph.uk) on occation enjoy a bit of
"stalking" online to hunt down the scum of the earth and annihilate
them (either IRL or just there computers). Ok this particular
inncident took place early this month when Goblinz and myself decided
that we'd have a bit of fun winding people up online (well Goblinz had
the idea), Goblinz connected to MS Chat as a 19 y/o Bi Female (heh).
But why? i hear you all ask. Because the sickos that we seek out are
quite stupid people, we use there weaknesses against them
<buhahahahaha>, well ok it's simple, if you can social engineer in
anyway, then posing as a female online and bullshitting them is a
handy thing to do. This task was a simple one, and riginally had no
malicious intend, nor did we indend to get the people that we did
(actually all we wanted to do was piss off a dirty old pervert with
Sub7).
So Goblinz decided to send the dirty old git an "avi" file, well
myself.avi.exe which was the sub7 trojan. Now you've got to be honest
that it's not exactly something that you expect to work, i mean any
person with half a brain would suspect something a little strange, but
this guy is obviously the kind of no skilled lamer that knows how to
turn on a computer and download pictures from the internet.

Well he accepted the file and executed it, hahahahahaha Goblinz and
myself had 0wned him! Now goblinz had never really played about with
Sub7 before so he used the opertunity to test out some of it's
functions, like i said, all we wanted to do was piss this guy off for
a laugh. Now i did a search of his hard drive for all the *.jpg files,
well u see file names like "11yearsuck.jpg" you kinda class this guy
as a pedo, well that was enough to warrent a recoding of the
autoexec.bat file to wipe out his hard drive as well as display nice
little messages explaining what we'd done. 

Once that was done and we took over his ICQ account we decided to
find out where he lived, unfortunatly it was in Turkey, so sending
round a bunch of people to beat him and burn his house down there was
little we could do (also i couldn't understand any of the files on
his computer so it was impossible to get his address). 

Well after much more flipping of his screen, opening and closing of
his CD ROM and pissing about, he went offline. I added him to my ICQ
contact list so that i could see if he came online again, heh a few
days later he was online:
