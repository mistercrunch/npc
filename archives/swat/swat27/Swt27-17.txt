(if that appears as weird  fucked up chars, read this in DOS's EDIT! :)

Hacker Ethics

Yeah, i know...A beginner (read: never actually attempted) writing
about hacker ethics... but what the hell! I'm willing to learn!!

The way I see it, all this bout "following a code" is crap.  If you're
just having fun, then fair enough, and it aint nice to be just delete
stuff from a server and format their Hard Disk for the hell of it :). 
With stuff like child porn, bestaility, all other sick shit like that,
then: go right ahead..
If i knew how, I'd be taking sites down myself (looks like I'll have
to read up :).  If yer out for revenge, then surely thats up to you. 
Hell, go in and kill the lamer's HD off!  Like I said....It's mostly up
to the individual.
If you want to go in and delete stuff from a server, or take down
someone's machine 'cos they pissed you off then great.  What's my
point?? My point is: Quit moaning.  Alot of people I speak to on IRC
get pissed off with "not following the code"; that's crap, just do what
you think is right  Anyway..

Enuff of me rantin'...

Network Fun

You mighta heard this before/know it already, but what the hell...
We all know Win9x security does not exist.  But that's where we have
a bit of fun :).  Get a hold of your admin's password (admin, staff
member whoever), and if ya dont know how to that via PWL files, go
crawl back under your rock.  Once you've done that, get yourself a copy
of NetBus.  Yeah, its a trojan, call it lame, but hell, if the network
you're at is as badly set up as the one in my college then its good
fun!  Get on to your Admin's acocunt, and if you can, access the
server's HD, and upload the trojan.  I know it can be done, dont ask me
how, I haven't done it yet; and as long as ya have the servers IP, then
have some fun :).  Its quite good fun to put BackOrifice or netbus on
as many machines as you can, trust me it's good fun to sit there and
open someone's CD-ROM from the other side of the room :)  Anyway...
Yeah, it's easy, but its fun :)
