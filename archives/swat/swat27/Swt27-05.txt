What I'm about to discuss is a little device which was tried and tested
on Christmas Eve a couple of years ago. I'm always fed up when lighters
won't light a fuse coz its too windy so I used an electrical ignition
system - very simple too:

Material
--------
Clothes line peg
Tin foil
Insulated wire
Strip of plastic / non-conducting material
9v battery
Rocket (solar) ignitor
Fuse
Pipe bomb
Insulation tape
Candle wax

How to make it
--------------
	Squeeze the peg so the two ends are apart. Wrap both ends with 
        tin foil and secure with tape. Attach a length of wire to both 
        tin foil ends. When you let go of the peg, the two pieces of
        tin foil should make contact. Use a piece of plastic or  
        non-conducting material to place between the contacts to act
        like a grenade pin.
        From the peg, one wire connects to one leg of the ignitor, and
        the other goes to a terminal on the battery. From the other 
        terminal, a wire leads to the second leg of the ignitor. Thats
        the ignition system.
	Now at one end of the fuse make a slit of a widened entrance
        to insert the solar ignitor. To hold it there melt some wax
        onto it and maybe secure with tape. Insert the other end of
        the fuse into your pipe bomb. Just make sure you have a decent
        sized fuse and work out the time you'll need to get out of the
        area. 
	For final adjustments, fix the peg & 9v battery together with
        tape and attach them both to the pipe bomb. This stops
        everything falling about which could break either the fuse or
        circuit. To ensure things, place the whole lot inside a tin
        can or wide cardboard tube so its more efficient to throw.
	When I made it, the pipe bomb was simply a metal marker pen
        full of firework gunpowder. Myself and a friend used it coming
        back from a party, pissed as farts, I pulled this device out
        of my pocket, pulled the pin out and threw it. We RAN ! And
        getting to the other side of the field, the whole place lit
        up by the flash followed by an almighty boom.

This design is used in delay booby trap mines as well. Just attach
the grenade body to a tree about 3 or 4" off the ground, and use a
fishing line from the pin to another tree. 

Homemade Fuses for the grenade:

	Here’s one subject that every pyro mag writes about. Most of
        them tell you to soak string in a warm water solution with
        gunpowder and allow to dry. Well that’s o.k. but I have
        invented a more reliable fuse. The ‘White Worm’ fuse. For
        this you need:

-	A single square piece of tissue paper 
-	½ a teaspoon of gun/black powder (DO NOT USE ROCKET POWDER)
-	Cotton reel

Cut the square piece of tissue in half. Fold on of these in half -
lengthways. Now there is a crease down the centre, this is going to
be your guide line to sprinkle the powder up and down from the spoon.
When you do sprinkle the powder up and down, you should end up with a
line similar to the size of a cigarette/roll-up. This is good for all
you smokers ‘cause now you have to roll the tissue (with the gunpowder
inside it) up so it looks like a spliff. Now use pieces of cotton to
tie both ends of the tissue fuse so non of the powder falls out of the
end. Now tie a knot with the cotton from the reel at one end of the
fuse, and instead of breaking the thread off you are going to wrap it
round the fuse in a spiral shape. Make sure it is very tight, and try
not to break the tissue. You are ready! You can make another with the
other half of the tissue square left over. You can replace the
gunpowder for ground up matches if necessary.
	Also note that different grades and amounts of powder can
change the rate of burning. Another being the thickness of the tissue
& the amount you use. Experiment before dispatching in your explosive
devices, because you may just blow your head off with a very fast
burning fuse. That brings me onto the reason why you should NOT use
rocket powder - this stuff is VERY fast burning. It demolishes the
fuse in about a second ! You’ve been warned by personal experience.


I don't recomend using the hand grenade to play fetch with the next
door neighbours dog, but I'm sure you can find a use for it. The usual
disclaimer applies - dont blame me for your destruction. Have fun.
