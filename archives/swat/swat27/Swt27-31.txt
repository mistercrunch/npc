For a short month, Feb certainly rolled out a mammoth issue, so a big
thanks go out to everyone who submitted those amazing articles. Keep
up the good work, because SWAT wouldn't be where it is today without
the reader support that we get.

Hmm, dunno what i could put in here, nothing that's worth mentioning 
has happened. 
I guess that i'll just plug my personal web site:


http://firestarter.swateam.org


Now i can sit back and await the linux version of A-S, but i think that
the sun with burn itself out before that sees the light of day.


Ok TOTAL shit point - my computer going fucko on the release date. Heh
thank god for backups!
