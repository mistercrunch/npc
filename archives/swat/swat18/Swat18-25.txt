Well i must be honest, i have hardly writen anything for this issue
of the magazine, it's due for compleation within a few hours and i'm
just in from a party, so here i'm going to detail some very simple
fuses that anybody can make.
I don't think that i've written a file on these before, if i have then
i'm sorry, if i haven't, that here you go:

Materials:
Matches
String (or paper)
glue
Razor blade (or sharp knife)

(1) Scrape all of the match heads off, i know that it might seem like
    tedious work, but if you want to make a fuse, then your going to
    have to do it. Keep all of the match powder safe somewhere (inside
    the match box is a good place).

(2) Get your string (or paper strip) and put a VERY thin layer of glue
    on it, i tend to put a blob of glue on one end and scrape it down
    the string or paper with a knife, try to keep the layer even.

(3) Wait until the glue is almost dry (about 2 minutes if the layer was
    thin enough and the glue is quick drying), and roll the string or
    paper in the match head powder, try to get it coated as fully as
    you can. Now take it out and let it dry compleatly.

There you have it, you will need to test the burn rate since it varies
depending on the size of the match powder grains and the ammout of glue
etc.

Tips:
(1) Grind the match powder up compleatly so that there is no large
    pieces of match head in it, this keeps the burn rate constant.

(2) Experiment with stuff like wax to make the fuse water proof but 
    make sure that the wax coating is very thin or else it will end
    up putting the fuse out.

(3) If your makeing a fuse from paper, NEVER roll the paper into a tube
    and have the match head powder on the inside, this will burn up
    in under a second.

(4) Make sure that the glue is dry before you light the fuse (the glue
    will most likely be flammable).
