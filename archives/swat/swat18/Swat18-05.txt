In Blackpool us anarchists get up to all kinda shit. Here are 10 most
favoured things that me and my mates do.

1 . Make Carcide Bombs and knock on peoples door and when they open it
    peg it and leave the bomb on their door step.

2.  Going on to golf courses and putting dog crap on the playing fields
    and smeering it on the bookin windows.
 
3.  Well at nightime me and my mates usually go to the park to mess 
    arround and we sometimes set fire to the cafe throwing bricks
    through the window.

4.  Nicking stuff from peoples cars and we never steel cars..You think
    thats lame well think what you want we get up to tons more 
    intresting stuff.

5.  Smashing all the lamposts at night. 

6.  Making irritating phone calls to our college teachers fuck you 
    Mr Fielder my chemistry teacher who gave me a B+ and all my other
    teachers gave me A+.

7.  Smashing Mr Fielders car up and putting crap in it. Puncturing 
    All the teachers tyres.

8.  Making prank phone calls -(lamest thing we do)

9.  Sending pornography and ameture stuff to kidies schools.

10. Well lastly but by no means bleaching peoples garden with crude 
    pictures.

I hope this has been enlightining for you and from this you should
have learnt that people who live in Blackpool are not little bastards
we are the reall thing. Fuck society.
