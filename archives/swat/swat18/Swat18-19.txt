If you want to quicky check your mail while you are at school, college,
work or what ever and you do not want to create a new mailbox on the 
puter you are using then this is a quick and easy method you can use. 
This is also usefull to know if you have been mail bomb4ed by some
lamer...

So whats first? Well, you need to find out the name of the server that 
you receice your mail from. For demonstration purposes I will be using 
mail.server.com You will need to connect to port 110 on ther server to 
retrieve or view your mail. If you open up a command prompt and type

"telnet mail.yourmailserver.com 110"

You will be able to log into your mail server, So type

'user nbug' where nbug is your username you use to collect your mail

then type 
'pass password' where password is your e-mail password.  
It should then tell you how many messages are waiting in your mailbox, 
or congrats, or something like that.

Type 'list' to get a list of all the messages, they each will have a 
number beside them.

Type 'retr #' where # is the number next to the message you want to 
read.  This will allow you to read it, but it stays on the server.

Remove any messages you don't want by typing 'dele #' where # is the 
number you want to delete.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you disconnect properly. You must type 'quit'
before closing telnet or you may lock up your mail box. Now by me 
saying this I know that people out there are thinking, hey, I don't 
like george, I know his e-mail password, I think i'll lock up his 
mailbox... well I just give you the knowledge, Its up to you what you 
do with it.  However, this does not work with all mail servers.

If you want a sneek peek at someones mail and don't want them to know 
you have been looking at it then the following mau be very usefull to 
you.

after the 'retr' command, the mail gets marked with a -R or something. 
whenever you go to get your email at your house, you will notice that 
it has already been read.  to keep it from looking like it's already 
been read, type 'rset' before you quit to reset it back to the original
way it was.

This is useful for checking other people's email.
