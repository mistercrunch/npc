Well on the topic of the NSA i thought I would make clear that there are loads of other US 
intelligence and security agencies. In addition to the thirteen agencies which provide positive 
strategic foreign intelligence under the National Foreign Intelligence Program, it also includes 
tactical military intelligence and security organizations, as well as those responsible for 
security responses to transnational threats, to include terrorism, cyber warfare and computer 
security, covert employment of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics trafficking, and 
international organized crime.
