I am going to be writing a number of articles about the design of a 
small LAN and how it SHOULD be designed and how the network devices 
actually work. In this article i will be talking about the need for 
cabling in a network. This article will go into depth so be prepared 
to think. I will slowly make some more articles progressing further on 
so you are able to recognize certain aspects of a network and how it 
works.
CABLES::::::::::::::::
Everything electrical will emit electronic signals. The signals that it
emits can conflict with each other if allowed to coexist on the same 
plane. Thus two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. 
It is thus important for network cable to have the resiliency to thwart
such interference from other devices. If it didnt there could be a high
possibility of the data being carried to become corrupt or damaged. If 
the cables didnt have this resistance devices could EASILY intercept 
the valuable information travelling in these cables. Which of course 
would be very bad :-) 

TOPOLOGY::::::::::::::
Now to organise a network there are threee main formats that are 
recognized and can be obtained easily. The big difference between 
network cabling layout in pcs and in telephones is that in computer 
networks layouts have been designed to make fault finding easy. 

LINEAR BUS::::::::::::
The linear bus arrangement is a simple bus or trunk running down the 
network, a bit like a backbone. The cable is terminated at each node 
of the network. Another common name for this method is daisy chaining.

The hardware required for this network is fairly simple obviously the
NIC (network interface card) about £15 and some BNC cable and some 
T-Connectors. Unfortunately with this method of networking error 
finding is hard.

T-Connectors:::::::::

                       ---
                       PC1

STAR-SHAPED TOPOLOGY::
Here all the wires are connected to a central location (a hub) which 
completes all the connections.

                          /     /
          PC3-------------///////--------------PC6

This is a good layout for a network bcause if a cable was to fail the 
entire network would not go down only the PC connected to it. And it 
would deserve the PC user right since in my experience it is normally 
due to the user tripping on the cable or knocking it out the wall 
anyway.

TOKEN RING::::::::::::
This is where the cable is laid in a circle. These networks are 
typically configured with a specialized star-shape topology.

There might be another article included in this issue containing 
informatin on cabling.
