This is the one to use if someone has *really* pissed you off

--Girlfriend--
--------------

This remote password stealer is good, in that you dont have to use the 
client file to steal the passwords. I'm pretty sure you can connect to 
a host computer using telnet, but I might be wrong. 

GirFiend Server sits on infected computer and looks for windows in which
user enters passwords. The server writes these passwords with other text
fields in that window to a registry key and will send this list on your demand.


Included files -

gf.exe <--client file
windll.exe <--server file (mine 'mysteriously' dissapeared. Better watch
            out for that!)
gf.txt
vc's passwords.txt <--this is the password file I ripped from someone. 
 (read on)

The server installs on port 21554


Full features -


Show passes
Send message
Reset password list
Custom

It dosent look much, but have a peek at this......

Well, it might come in handy. (one of these passwords still works!!!!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I think you get the idea.


I'd advise this one because its nice and discreet, and gets most passwords.
You just have to search through all the junk.

--Masters Paradise--

have a good look at it.


Included files -

Autopoll.ini
Deutsch.ini

Paradise.exe  <-- This is the client file

This one dosent actually have a server file, so it might not be a trojan
as such, but I think it has remote disk access. Oh, and theres spaces 
for IP addresses. Any info on this would be appreciated.


-------------
--Millenium--
-------------

This is a remote access program thats not unlike back oriface, and 
netbus. When I was writing this t-file, Millenuim just refused to 
connect, and wouldn't give me access to its features, so I'll just have to 
quote from the text file.

last trojan in the file becomes known! 3:-)  )


--------------
--Netbus 1.7--
--------------

At last, the best version in the series. Nice compliment of functions, 
and loads of cool stuff. And a port manager.

screen grab files and stuff. I'll list them all anyway.

This is the best version of netbus by far.


------------------
--Netbus 2.0 pro--
------------------

I'd just give this one a big miss.  There are reasons why (its a setup 
file to install, and it leaves reg keys - amongst other reasons) but I 
wont go into them.  Just dont use it unless you have to.


--------------
--phAse zero--
--------------

It just looks like your average netbus/BO clone, but it can trash the 
server. 


I'm getting pissed off with all this typing, so i'll paste the attached
 .txt file......


phAse zero is remote administration tool composed of a server running on all
current win32 platforms (windows NT / windows 95 / windows 98), a graphical
user interface (GUI) and an installer.

some of the features of this first release (1.0 beta):

  o  integrated remote ftp client
  o  remote file system control
  o  spawning of processes
  o  functions to manipulate the windows registries
  o  restricting access to the phAse server via ip masks
  o  configurable registry/executable name and server port

and much more (see the list below for a complete listing).

in order to install phAse zero on a server, copy the three exe files
(setup.exe client.exe phase.exe) to a directory and run setup.
a dialog box will appear; if you don't want to change the default settings
for the registry, click on 'yes' to proceed.
next, you will be prompted for the port to use (default is 555) and an
optional ip mask.  if you specify the ip mask, only users from a certain
host will be allowed to access the phAse zero server.  you can leave this
field blank if you don't need access restrictions.

these are all valid ip mask formats:

  123.45.67.8
  123.45.67
  123.45.6
  123.45.
  123.45
  etc.

the installer will write to the windows registry and install the server's
executable (one file).  then control is returned to the user.
please note that the executable file size is random.

if you need further "security" you may change the default registry keys
(key name and file name) using setup.exe.

once the server is installed, it runs hidden from the tasklist and the
taskbar and uses CPU time only when needed.

to activate phAse from remote, use the GUI interface (client.exe).
you just need to enter the server's host name or ip address and the port
that you have chosen during the installation (the default is 555).

now, click on OK.  the server will respond with its version name and number.

select the command you want to use and click on it: one or more parameters
(edit boxes) will be activated if necessary.
fill in all the required parameters and press the SEND button.

to terminate the current session, you can either click on OFF or enter the
"terminate session" command (followed by the SEND button).

these are all the commands currently implemented in this version of phAse
zero, along with their parameters:

FTP UPLOAD
 <user> <pass> <host> <local file path> <remote path> <remote file>
 tell the server to upload the specified local file via ftp to remote path

FTP DOWNLOAD
 <user> <pass> <host> <local file path> <remote path> <remote file>
 tell the server to download the specified remote file via ftp to local path

EXECUTE
 [s|h] <file path>
 execute a file (S=show window, H=hide window)

CHANGE DIRECTORY
 <directory>

LIST DIRECTORY

please note that this is the first public beta of phAse zero, and it is by
no means complete.  possible future additions: file sharing support, stealth
key logging, media player, integrated port and host scanner, plugins, etc.

--Protogenic--
--------------

(oh yeah, get a hold of their mail trojan)

The functions on this captured my imagination.  Here's the .txt file......


he server will pop-up a message "Runtime error 403 wrong statement" so 
the user thinks aha! this program have an error and thinks its not 
started ....
pretty g00d to fool people, but when the server is installed in 
autostart no message will pop-up.

--Subseven *series*--
---------------------

Its a pitty I'm tired, cos I gotta run together the whole of the 
subseven series.  In my opinion,  these are the best trojans in the 
world EVER!! (apart from one....).  Find a copy of 1.8, and have fun.

Oh well, here ya go. The SubSeven 1.8 text file. And it really is good.....


[ d e s c r i p t i o n ]
SubSeven can be used as a remote administrating tool or as a hacking tool.
it consists of three files: server.exe, Sub7.exe and EditServer.exe. to
use it, run server.exe on the victim's computer [don't ask me how! 
figure that out by yourself], 
find his/her ip number then run Sub7.exe from your computer. 
that's about it, after that you can _really_ have some fun with the victim.
you can configure the server before sending it using EditServer.exe

[ h o w   i t   w o r k s ]
well, it's pretty easy. the first time you run server.exe on a computer,
the program installs itself into the memory, and starts every time windows
is restarted. Sub7.exe is the main program you use to connect to the
server.

[ c o m m a n d   l i n e   p a r a m e t e r s ]
+ you can run the server with the following command line parameters:
   /PASS:password   where password is the password required to connect
   /PORT:xxxx       where xxxx is the port number
+ example "server.exe /pass:fuckoff /port:1777" will install the server
 on port 1777 using the password "fuckoff"

[ f e a t u r e s ] [grab a coffee, light a cigarette and read on]
 + SETUP SERVER. you can setup the server before sending it to the victim.
   to do that, use EditServer.exe. for example, if you set it up to your
   ICQ #, when the server is ran on the victim's computer, it will
   send you his ip number
 + PACK the server.exe with another EXE file or with an image.
 + you can change the victim's resolution. it displays a list with all the 
   resolutions available on the victim's computer and you just pick one
   and hit "change it!" :)
 + e-mail notify. it allows you to specify an email server, and your email,
   so you'll receive an email with the victim's IP when he connects
   some people requested this, because for some reason the "icq notify" did
   not work for them
 + you have the option to see all the running processess [visible or not]
   you can use this to see if other trojans are installed for example
 + print feature! allows you to specify a text to be printed on the victim's
   printer [along with the style and size of the text]
 + registry editor. view/create/delete/change everything in the registry
 + find files feature. find any file on the hard drive. you can also use
   wildcards
 + ScrollLock, CapsLock, NumLock can be turned ON and OFF
 + disconnect victim. hangs up the victim's connection to the net
 + focus window has been added in the "windows manager" section.
 + you can now specify the _quality_ of the preview image and screen shot
   image. this is useful on slow connection, the lower the quality the faster
   the transfer.
 + auto notify on the specified UIN when the server is first ran. So it goes
   like this: you setup the server before sending it. you specify your icq 
   number, and a name [if you're sending the server to more than one victim,
   you'll know which one this is]. then, you send the server and wait. when the
   user clicks on it for the first time, you'll be notified the victim's ip#,
   port and the name you specified on icq. this'll make _a lot_ of people happy. 
 + show image feature. it allows you to pop up an image on the victim's screen
   from the victim's hard drive. the image can be: JPG,BMP,GIF,ICO,WFM,EFM
 + continuous screen capture is finally here! oh yes! you can now see
   what the victim is doing on his/her desktop whithin seconds. it's just
   like a live video of his screen, and it does NOT interfear with any
   other feature. so you can actually listen for his keys, download his
   files, and view his desktop at the same time. :) 
 + flip screen. that's right. you can flip the victim's screen horizontally,
   vertically or both. when the victim double-clicks the left button
   anywhere on the screen, the desktop is restored. 
 + hide/show the victim's desktop icons. i don't know why the hell ppl want 
   this, but they got it. 
 + the program [subseven.exe] notifies you when new versions are released 
   [starting from 1.3 and up]. it checks for new versions, and if a new version
   has been released, it shows you a [pretty neat] window, with the link to the
   new file, the size of the new file, the date released and even a list with 
   all the changes. that's, all without even running the browser.
 + you can set your server.exe file to act in a certain way when it's ran.
   for example, you can set it to display a fake error message, or just
   to install without any notification.
 + FTP server. change the victim's hard drive into a FTP server. you can
   access every single file, using a FTP program [like CuteFTP]. it's
   basically a Serv-U clone, that gives you full access to everything.
   While setting the FTP server, you can specify the PORT number, the
   PASSWORD needed to connect and the maximum number of clients that can be
   connected at one time.
 + message manager. you can send custom messages to the victim. you can
   specify the type of window [question/information/warning] the caption
   of the window, the text, and even the buttons. you'll receive the button
   clicked by the victim
 + set the online notification on/off. NO more email server crap. just
   enter your uin and press enable. that's it. it works!
 + enable or disable Ctrl-Alt-Del. when ctrlaltdel is disabled, the victim
   won't be able to press CtrlAltDel anymore. works for Alt-Tab too.
 + send keys. you can type your own keys, send one of the victim's windows,
   and send those keys to that window. useful for mirc if you wanna make the
   victim type "i'm gay" or something.
 + send messages or questions to the victim's computer with the specified
   message or question. you'll be noticed of the victim's answer
 + open the default browser at the specified address
 + hide or show the Start button
 + take a screen shot of the victim's desktop. the image will be shown and
   saved as desktop.jpg
 + disable keyboard
 + chat with the victim. a small ICQ-like chat window will appear on both
   computers. the difference is that on the victim's computer, the chat
   window will _always_ stay on top. while chatting, you can do a few things
   like: hide the victim's typing space [meaning, the small window where the
   victim types will dissappear] start/stop his/her PC Speaker.
   the victim will _not_ be able to close the chat, so if you don't close it
   it'll be stuck there the whole time :)
 + start/stop the victim's PC Speaker. [i thought it'll be nice to tell the
   victims about the good-old PC Speaker]
 + restart windows. don't abuse it though.
 + open/close the CD-ROM
 + set the length of the victim's mouse trails. [you know, that annoying
   trail you can set windows to add to your mouse pointer]
 + set a password for the server. [that's if you don't want other people
   with SubSeven using that server]
 + get all the active windows on the victim's computer. after that you can:
    - close a specified window
    - enable/disable a specified window [the victim will or will not be
      able to interact with it]
    - disable the close button on a specified window
    - hide or show a specified window
 + get a list of all the available drives on the victim's computer
 + turn monitor on/off. this only works on the monitors that _can_ be turned
   off programatically
 + show/hide the taskbar.
 + get more information about the victim's computer. like: windows version,
   user name, company name, screen resolution, etc.
 + change the server name. the server will save itself with the specified name
 + listen for all the pressed keys. you'll see all the keys pressed by the
   victim. useful to get passwords.
 + record. yep, exactly what it says. you specify the number of secounds to
   record for, and the server will send you the recorded file when it's
   finished. the file will be saved as soundfile.wav [note: this only works
   for victims who have a microphone installed]
 + file manager. you can easily see all the files and folders on the victim's
   computer. when you double click on a diretory, the server will change to
   that directory. when you select a file, you can:
    - get the file's size
    - download it
    - set it as wallpaper [only if it's a JPG or BMP file]
    - delete it
    - play it on the victim's computer [only if it's a WAV file]
    - execute it [the program assigned to open that file will obe launched
      on the victim's computer]
 + reverse/restore mouse buttons. this is awsome when you play some kind
   of multiplayer game with the victim]
 + close the server on the victim's computer. [note: the server will
   start again next time the victim starts windows]
 + remove the server from the victim's computer. this completely removes the
   server from the memory
 + change the port used. you can do it in 2 ways: run "server.exe /port:xxxx"
   or, connect to the server with Sub7 and click "change port"
 + IP motherfukin' scanner! it ONLY scans for Sub7 servers, and that's why you
   _don't_ need a port (it has its own method of recognizing the server). if
   you find an infected IP, that doesn't mean you can connect. you still need
   the port [if other than 1243] and the password [if set]
 + get passwords. you'll receive a list with all the passwords recorded on the
   victim's computer since startup.
 + offline key logger. "get offline keys" retrieves a list of all the keys
   pressed since the windows startup.

Here it comes.......The biggie.....The most bestest greatest trojan in the world EVER!!!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------
---XXXXXXXXXXXX---
------------------

The name (for the moment) must remain a secret, If it became widespread, then patches would be 
released for it in no time. And it really is great. I guarantee it can do everything you would 
be able to do if you were at the terminal yourself. Wanna access the control panel? no problem.  

Oh yeah, there is one feature you wouldn't expect to see on a trojan.

If you see me on ICQ, I might just send you it.... (32342808)
