This idea comes from the Ozimandis book on sabotage, so i decided to
work on it a little and expand on the original idea.
Basically this is a type of molotov that can be placed somewhere
instead of being thrown, this makes it much better when it comes to
timing and such like. I don't think that these would be much good in a
riot though.

Materials:
Match box
Sodium chlorate weedkiller
Sugar
Tape
Bottle of meths (must be a plastic bottle)
Tissue

(1) Mix 1:1 of weedkiller and sugar and place this into the match box,
    just use the tray of the box and throw away the cover since it's
    not needed, use a small piece of tissue and some tape to keep the
    contents in.

(2) Use a lot of tape to stick this box of weedkiller and sugar to the
    side of the meths bottle (make sure that the tissue "lid" is
    against the side of the bottle. Wrap the tape atleast 5 times
    around the bottle and the match box.

(3) Make a simple fuse with the tape and the weedkiller:sugar mixture.

(4) Insert this fuse into the match box, usually by makeing a small
    hole in the side of the box or by pushing it down between the box
    and the bottle.

Well that's about it. All you do is light the fuse, that ignites the
match box contents, which will burn away the side of the bottle and
ignite the meths, which will of course spill everywhere while on fire.

Cost:
Meths, £1 (1ukp)
