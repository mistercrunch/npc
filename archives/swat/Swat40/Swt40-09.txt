As promised, heres how to make an ice filter for the
Uberbong which we detailed in SWAT38.
Ok if your not familiar with the Uberbong then go
and read up on how to make and use one.


Ok enough of the introduction, the following materials
are needed:

1) 1 330ml plastic drinks bottle
2) Screw driver (or knife)
3) Lighter
4) superglue
5) Bowl (see below on how to make one)
6) Tube (empty pen tube works)
7) Ice
8) 2 screw on bottle caps (plastic ones)
9) Blu Tak

Ok, first of all you must mount the bowl to the bottle,
do this by heating up the screw driver or knife with
your lighter and pushing it thru the bottom on the bottle
dead center. Once you've got a nice hole push the tube
into it (about half way) and seal it with blu tak or glue.

Now attack the bowl to the end of the tube. You should
have something that resembles this:

         \   / <- bowl
          | | 
          | | <- Tube
        __| |__
        |     | <- Bottles main body
        |     |
        |     |
        '\   /'
          | | <- Bit where cap screws on


(ok so its VERY out of proportion, but u get the idea)


Ok now get the two end caps and stick them togeather.
Do this by smearing the glue onto the tops of them and
sticking them togeather! 

Once dry, heat up the knife / screw driver again and punch
a fairly nice hole in it (about 1.5 / 2 cm in diameter).

NOTE: You might want to mount some kind of screen between
them, i.e a gauze or a few pins "criss-crossing" 

Ok, now get your ice and crush it up a bit.

Half fill the bottle with ice, then screw on the lid,
now take the ice filled bottle and screw it to the
uberbong.

Fill the bowl with your choice of smoking mix, ignite
it and unlease the Uberbongs water.

It'll filter all of the smoke thru the ice, not only
cooling it, but removing a lot of the nasty bits,
when its ready, just take a nice long toke!



Bowl construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok you can make a bowl out of just about anything at
all. 

I've found that the perfect bowl can be made from a 
13mm socket wrench attachment thingy and a bit of 
Gauze (i use Basil Brush gauzes, only costs 75p for 5)
draw back is that its heavy when attached to a pen
bit or a tube. 

But anyhow, there are many ways of making bowls and 
screens, heres a few ways i've found that work!

Simple bowl
~~~~~~~~~~~

Materials needed:

Tin Foil
Tape
Pen Tube
Pin

Take the tin foil and burn it!

Why? well you know that some people say "its coated in
plastic" (tin foil that is), well its almost true,
it is actually covered in Teflon, and smoking the
fumes from burnt tinfoil will result in teflon poisoning.

So take a lighter to it before you do anything (you don't
have to burn it a lot, although i find that slowly running
a flame all over it works well.)

You might wanna skip the burning for later on tho depening on
how you want to do things.

Anyway, onto the bowl construction.

Once you've scorched the tin foil, wrap it around the pen tube
and mould a bowl shape from it. You will need a lot of foil
if you want to make a nice phat bowl.

Once thats done put another layer of foil over it all so
that its totally sealed, then just punch a load of holes in
it with the pin.

Simple!  Oh yeah, if you didn't burn the foil, then 
attached it to a nice 5 liter uberbong, and burn away
(while draining off the water). Do this a few times with
a nice long flame and it'll be fine.



Beer Bottle Bowl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was used by a good friend of mine, known as
Mr. Fwibble! it worked a treat in the bong we made.

All thats needed it:

1) Beer bottle top
2) Knife or drawing pin

Firstly take the bottle cap and burn off everything thats
on it, that includes the little rubber seal and the other
crap (you will probably be able to pick it all off with a
knife). 

Next up, punch holes in it. To do this with a knife, just
stab it a few times, but i've found that better holes can
be made by holding a drawing pin in pliers and stabbing it
several times.

Now with the little "lip" pointing upwards, push it into
something to keep it in place (we actually used tape to
keep it steady).
