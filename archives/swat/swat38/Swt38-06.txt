 I found something out a little while ago that may develop into other things later on.
 I was playing with my mobile and I turned my key tones on. When you press a key you can
 hear the different tones.  This made me think about red boxing.
 I went to my home phone, picked up the receiver and placed my mobile against the mouth
 piece. I dialed a number and waited. Sure enough the number rung. I had just dialed a 
 number without touching any of my home phones keys.  

 This means you can red box with your mobile :) Go to a taxi phone. You know the kind at
 supermarkets with one button that dials a taxi when you press it? Well go to one, lift up
 the receiver. Use your mobile to dial the number you want, like I explained earlier. 
 Wait and BINGO! The number should dial and ring and you are now talking for free.

 Just remember - It DOESNT take 2 hours to ring a taxi! 

 Have phun with this and experiment this method on payphones etc..

 Thanks for reading.
