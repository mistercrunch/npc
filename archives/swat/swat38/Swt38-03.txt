Tools:
soldering iron
knife
lighter
black powder
fuses
blue tak
alluminium tape
4 pack of guiness (or as many as you can drink)

Now make sure you get the ones with the little widget inside

For the best result try to seperate the the widget down the seal as
best possible.

Insert the fuse into the hole in the top it's usually a bit small ok
it phucking tiny make it bigger.

Seal the fuse hole using blue tak.

Now fill both halfs with black powder and use the small edges to
re-seal the ball using a soldering iron.

Wrap it up real tight with alluminium tape.

Use the lighter and ****BOOM****

Thanks to there small size you can fit about 50 in a small carrier bag
so they serve wonders as minority ammunition.

warning some people may suffer from severe loss of garden shed door
if used correctly (but it aint me)
