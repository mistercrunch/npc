aiite, I haven't done any shit for a while so I thought I better get my
finger out and do some something ,so I am gonna tell ya about a
scam/business/pissup me and some mates came up with a couple of years
ago, we didn't actually make any money outta it in the end, but we
didn't lose any money (well I didn't) and we got very drunk almost
everyday over the summer holidays and it didn't cost shit. basically
we brewed a shit loada beer, bottled it and try'd to sell it to some
suckers, got lumbered with it and got totally fucked on it

if you wanna waste some time making beer then readup.....motherfucker

ok what you will need
---------------------

fermentation bin

syphon tubes

beer bottles

bottle caps

bottle capper

sugar

beer carton


where to get them and what they do
----------------------------------

Fermantation Bin: stores/ferments your beer you need one of these and you
can buy them from boots or you could use a bin if you are a gypo the one
we nicked from my mates dad held 40 litres and was perfect for what we
wanted i think they cost about £10-15 in boots but not to sure

Syphon Tubes: are used to move the beer from ya fermantation bin to
 your bottles you can just use some sorta tubing if ya want or you
 can buy one (like we did) from boots for about £1-2 and it comes
with a tap :)

Beer Bottles: these might be a bit harder to get hold of. I know you
can buy them from boots but they cost a fuck load of money and who
wants to spend money on bottles anyway (espically if its gonna eat
away at your profit) so we nicked our bottles from some local pubs,
we cruised up to some crates on our bikes outside a local pub and
picked them up put them in our bags and cycled off, it was quite
easy, but then we did it again somewhere else and got busted cos
they had CCTV they didn't do anything just ask us what we were doing
and if we could be kind enough to put them back :( so be careful

Bottle Caps/Capper: you can buy these both from boots the caps will
cost £1-2 for about 50 and the capper is like this thing you stick
over the cap and bottle then hit with a hammer and that costs about
£5 from boots

Beer Solute:this is the stuff you put in the bin and add to water
this makes the beer and you can buy it from boots for about £5-20
depending on the quality you want. they normally make about 40 pints
and comes in a powder

What you do
-----------

ok get the Beer Solute, boil 40 pints of water, and stick them in a
Fermantation bin stir thorouhly for about 10,15minutes after that
stick it in a corner somewhere and leave for about 4-6 weeks after
that syphon it into your stolen (washed out)bottles, add a teaspoon
of sugar into each bottle (turns it into evil beer) then cap and
stash the bottles for another 2-3weeks to make sure they have
fully fermented, ok now after the waiting invite some mates round
and get totally fucked outta ya head on 666brew! btw watch out for
all the sedement at the bottom of the bottles pour them gently
into a glass or you will have a mouthful of shit ,after a few pissups
we decided to get some money back so we put labels on the bottles,
called it "Grebrew" and sold a crate of it to some sucker that buys
anything, for £10 which was not bad and we did get the bottles back
we have made a few batches of the "beer" now. and its not a bad
idea if you wanna get pissed on the cheap. also its not illegal
for people under 18 to brew/drink it, mind you it is illegal to
sell it to anyone. (so you ain't seen me.....right?)
