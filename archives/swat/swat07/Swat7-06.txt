Oh yess the file all of you anarchists have been waiting for, this is
my knowledge on carring out urban warfare I have done this many, many
times before and I KNOW it works, if I where to write down all of my
knowledge if would take up a very large file indeed, so I'll write a
short article, maybe i'll do another some other time. Before I forget
I should tell you that Urban warfare can be for fun or serious shit,
I've decided to make the premeditated section for fun and the 
spontanious section for general riot stuff.

First off: There are two types of urban warfare and both will be 
discussed 1: Premeditated 2: Spontainous 

Premeditated

For this you will need:
Bleach
Salt (Around 1kg)
Water
Food colouring (Any/all colours around 10 bottles)
Latex gloves
Cheap toilet rolls (around 12)
5 liters of mineral water (One of those huge bottles)
Bucket
Shaving foam
Eggs
Optional: Napalm and a can or 5 of beans

1: Go to your location at around nidnight or around 10 if it's winter.
2: Tip all of the water into the bucket and add all of the food 
   colouring.
3: Unravel about 8 toilet rolls.
4: Put on the gloves and rip the toilet rolls to pieces, mash it all up
   like paper mache
5: Add 500g of salt to your mixture.
6: Now carry the bucket around, while pulling handfuls out and hurling
   them at building, windows, cars or anything else.
7: (optional) add 3 of the eggs at this point to the mixture.
8: When you run out of toilet paper mix use the eggs.
9: Open up the 4 remaing toilet rolls and hurl them down street and
   over buildings, they should go like a streamer and unravel in flight
10: Find the nicest lawn you can and bleach an encircled A in to it.
11: Pour large amounts of salt on to lawns, flower beds, open windows
    and into letter boxes.
13: If you took the napalm and beans then pour the naplam on to the
    ground, maybe a carpark or near a lot of houses, then stand the
    bean tins on it so they are facing upwards and light the naplam.
    On advrage you'll have around 5 minutes to evac before the area
    is covered in boiling hot baked beans. (You can also use dog food)
14: Now place the can of shaving foam on the ground and throw a brick
    at it, it should break open and spray foam everywhere (Rember to
    shake the can up first)
15: and finaly piss into letter boxes. Now return home.
You can do all of the above to a single house if you don't like the
person.

Spontainous

This is more difficult and all depends on how psycotic you are, you
should generaly throw BROKEN bottles at attackers, beat them with stuff
like sticks, throw petrol bombs. Once you get hold of an attacker, you
can have some fun, just do whatever you want. In general have fun, I
mean that's what urban warfare is all about, if you can get onto a
roof of a building then throw bricks and petrol bombs at attackers.

Well thats how I've been doing things.
Remeber to adapt you plans to your situation.
