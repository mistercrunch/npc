There is much mischief to be had when it comes to mail box hacking.
Recently Barakis and myself (-=The Firestarter=-) got some wierd
messages from a german guy called Marcus Tunigun, the messages where in
German, and we couldn't understand them, so we decided to hack his
mail box. Barakis social engineered the password from him, this saved
me hacking it. Once in we changed his personal verification and
greeting.
Personal verification:

From: "Marcus Tunigan, Mail box 1 0 2 8, Mailboxien (german) 1 0 2 8
      (in german)."

To: "I am adolf hitler, leader of ze thrid riech and I have taken over
    this mail box in the name of the Arien german race, zik hiel, I 
    hate all jews. Mail box 1 0 2 8, zik hiel Mailboxien (german) 1 0 2
     8 (in german) zik hiel, zik hiel, zik hiel"

And his Greeting:
From: "Marcus tunigan, head of catering for the (company)"

To:  

Ok now let me explain a few things, we don't have anything against the
germans, I lived in germany for eleven years. We just figured that his
old boring messages needed "spicing" up a bit, personally we would
have done this to him if he was American. (This is not a racial thing
and no offence is intened, if you are offened then we are sorry.)
So next time you hack a mail box, send us in the number and we'll
take a look at it, we'd give you all the number for this only it's on
a system which number I can't disclose for security reasons.
