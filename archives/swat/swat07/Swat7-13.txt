-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The art of getting free stuff is vital, the most popular things to go
for are software, or other things that you can download, good porn site
access is always helpful. Anyway here's what you may need:

1. A fake credit card number, preferably a generated one. I tend to
use Credit wizard because in has an Info generator in it. Here are a
few addresses you can use: 

Nicole Beck
3478 Knox Rd.
Los Angeles, CA, 90027
213-453-4026

Blair Foster
2541 River St.
Salt Lake City, UT, 84120
801-550-2989

Remeber, these are not real peoples addresses, it's just something for
you to fill in when it comes to putting in the data in the relevent 
screen.

2. An anonymous proxy server, or a string of them. If you don't have
a proxy server address then use a public computer, like one at school,
colledge, library, internet cafe or at work.

3. An e-mail forwarder, get one from Blistering.com or bigfoot.

4. Fill in all of the data, and use the e-mail forwarder address, you
may want the e-mail to go through a lot of forwarders before it get's
to your account, Again use one from somewhere like hotmail.

5. Once you've got what you want, cancel all of the accounts you used.
No matter what it was you got, it doesn't matter if it's a cheap 
shareware program or some really expensive upgrade, the point is it's
theft and people will be after you. Leave no trace.

If you are getting porn site access don't expect it to last all that
long, so use it while you can.

Well that's probably the safest method to use, ok so maybe i'm a little
paraniod when it comes to these things, I just don't want to get busted
just for downloading the latest upgrade of Tweak DUN, which cost only
5 pounds.
You can also use a free trial CD, like Compu$erve or AOL, again
cancel the account once your done.

Well if all goes well then you will have got a free piece of software,
and not get caught. This is a good method for getting serial numbers
or upgrades for products. Well if you decide to use this method then
Good luck and don't get caught.
