This file is an import from the SWAT Database (Where we keep all of our
"elite" files). These are well worth the effort for what they can do.


Materials:
1 Very small 555 timer circuit.
1 small 12v bulb.
4 boxes of matches.
Potassium nitrate (KNO3) or sodium chlorate (NACLO3).
Sugar.
Cassette box (the ones for your walkman).
Super glue.
6 1.5 button cells
1 Candle
1 Small plastic zip bag
6 Empty perfume sample vials
Tape

(1) Put the button cells together and attach a wire to the top and
    bottom, this should make a small 9v battery, it won't last long
    but then again we don't need it for too long!

(2) File away the top of the bulb but don't damage the filliment

(3) Shave about 10 match heads and grind them up, put this match powder
    into the bulb, once again do not damage the filliment, add a drop
    of wax to seal it.
    NOTE: If the bulb isn't full add more match powder.

(4) Mix 1:1 of KNO3/NACLO3 with sugar.

(5) Cut off the rest of the match heads and mix it with the KNO3/NACLO3
    sugar mix.

(6) Put the mixture inside the zip bag.

(7) Make sure that the 555 timer is off and attach the battery and bulb

(8) Put the bulb inside the bag.

(9) Cut a small hole in the side of the cassette case and put the 
    on/off switch through it.

(10) Attach the bulb wire to the out put on the circuit.

(11) Put the timer, battery, bulb and explosive mixture inside the
     Cassette case.

(12) Fill the perfume vials with lighter fluid, wipe them down and
     tape them to the explosive mixture bag.

(13) Close and glue the cassette caes together.

It should look like this:

	_________________________________ <-- Cassette box
	|  _________________	|	|
	|  |Explosive mix   |  _|	|
	|  |  __________    __/_| 555	|
	|  |  |_Vial_ /	\--/|	| Timer	|_
	|  |  _______ \_/--/|B	|	|_|  <-- Switch
	|  |  |_Vial____|   |A	|	|
	|  |________________|T	|	|
	|_____|_Vial____|___|T__|_______|

Now simply throw the switch, and deposit somewhere.
Note: Please set the time delay before you glue the case together.

How it works: The bulb glows which ignites the match powder this can
either cause the bulb to explode or melt the wax and spray fire into
the bag, either way this will ingnite the explosive mix, the mix
will burn very hot, this will either explode violently or burn.
while this is happening the case is melting and the lighter fluid is
boiling, the vials will explode and spray lighter fluid everywhere,
this lights and burns anything it splatters on, the explosive mix
will burn for about 30 seconds to a minute. enough time to start a
fire.  Once the temprature builds up the battery will explode, it
won't do any damage but it will make a bang.
