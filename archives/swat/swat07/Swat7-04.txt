One of my specialities in S.W.A.T. is Phreaking.

Now if I have to explain the above term and all the little nuances of it
then go away because I really have no time for the amateurs.

Any way now that there away we can get down to the business at hand.

Deception for Anarchy,

This is great if you are good at impressions,good at acting and lying 
you probably have what it takes: Its the same thing as my infamous 
Phreak to insure my Penis shaped car, Its being able to Blag your 
way passed anything the phone company puts in your way, Its being able 
to Bullshit your way into an office or laboratory and getting your hands 
on some Chemcals and/or information.

The next couple articles will be about the various ways that I have found 
over the years to get into places and systems ussually not open to us 
mere revolutionaries.

============================================================================

Ridiculous as this sounds I have always believed that those of us with the 
gift of being able to twist people's perception of you and the things 
you present them with as something you can choose to use any way
you see fit. I think what I am trying to say is that whenever 
you feel what your doing is wrong or you feel you are getting an 
unfair buzz out of what you are doing then just accept it and remember 
that its for the greater purpose of Anarchy fighting for your individuality
,fighting for your freedom and just accept that you enjoy what you do,
after all we are only human.

Any way thats my philosophical ramblings over for this month..
