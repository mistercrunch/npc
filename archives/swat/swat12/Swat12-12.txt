Here's another one of my little toys for you too all make and have fun
with. 

You will need:
330ml plastic bottle
300ml of flamable liquid (meths, petrol, white spirit)
Jet-x engines ( or anything that is a powder and burns, like sodium
    chlorate and sugar)
timer or fuse
tape

(1) Fill the bottle with your chosen liquid, screw the lid on and leave
    it for a while to see if it dissolves, if it does choose another
    liquid.

(2) If you have jet-x engines then use a small amount of glue to fix a
    ring of them around the middle and bottom of the bottom. If your
    using anything else then put small amounts in plastic bags (about
    50g) and tape them around the main body of the bottle.

(3) Attach your fuse or igniter to the engines or bags of powder, if you
    are using a timer then tape this to the body of the bottle as well.

You are now ready to use your fun little device.
If you go and find a nice little bin full of rubbish set your timer or
light the fuse and place your bottle on top and watch it all burn.

It works like this:
The burning engines or powder melts the bottle and allows the liquid to
escape, if a highly flamable liquid is used then it will ignite as soon
as it escapes from the bottle, if a less flammable liquid is used, like
white spirit, then it will usualy absorb into or onto something before
it begins to burn. Either way you can be sure that it will burn.
