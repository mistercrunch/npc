I didn'y come up with this, I read another file on it. I've just made
a few modifications to the design. Basically this is a cannon that
launches a load of burning napalm at a target, probably good for
burning down your local co-op.

You will need:
1 meter pipe, 5cm in diameter and 0.5cm thick with an end cap
1-2 table spoons of fine black powder
1 or 2 Jet-X motor engines (from your local model shop)
Thick cardboard (same diamer as the pipe)
Wax candal
Napalm
Drill
Fuse or electrical igniter.

1) Screw the end cap onto the pipe, you will need to drill a hole into
   the end, insert the fuse and seal it with wax.

2) Add your fine black powder, it should be as fine as talc powder. Now
   add your jet-X engines, the engines must be whole as they are what
   ignite the napalm.

3) Push the cardboard down the tube. The card should serve as a barrier
   between the black powder and the napalm which will go in next.

4) Seal the cardboard down with wax, basically you want to melt the 
   candal and pour it all down the tube to make sure that it's well and
  truly sealed.

5) Get your napalm, this is just polystyrene dissolved in petrol. Ok
   now the type of napalm depends on what you want. Thick napalm will
   basically burn for ages and will look like a comet as it exits the
   cannon. Thin naplam will not burn as long and will look like a huge
   fireball. Thin napalm won't fly as far as it will burn up quicker.
   You can use just petrol as ammo, but this is only for very short
   range.

6) Pur the napalm down the tube, add about 30cm of napalm.

7) Get another piece of cardboard and shove it down the barrel, add
   some tissues etc, this is just to make sure nothing spills out.

Now go to the location where you want to cause havoc, I'll just assume
that you will go to a field to test it out.

Using it:

You will need:
Your loaded cannon
Lighter or matches
Rocks or something heavy.

1) Prop up your cannon with rocks, adjust the elevation to what you
   require. Also put loads of rocks around the base where the gunpowder
   is incase the pipe isn't strong enough to withstand the explosion.

2) Light the fuse, I recommend that you use either a long fuse or a
   long delay, if you only have a small firework fuse then make a
   cigarette delay, read the cookbook.

3) Run like fuck

4) Watch as a fucking huge ball of fire flys towards it's target and
   burns it to the ground.

So what happens?
Ok you should all know the basics of a cannon, the expanding gasses
force the cardboard out, this pushes the napalm out of the barrel.
The fine black powder will burn up in a second, this is why we added
the jet-x engines, they will burn for a few seconds, once they exit
the barrel they will be like small fire balls and the chance that they
won't ignite the napalm is very slim. If in doubt add a few more jet-x
engines.
