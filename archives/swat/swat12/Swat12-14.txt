This is an extreamly powerful device that is capable of spreading
damage over a wide area, because of this mearly running away from
it once the fuse lit, will not really get you to a safe distance.

Materials:
D.I.Y Plastic explosive (see below)
Air bomb center or detanator
CO2 cartriges
Black powder
Antenna arial
Small pringles tub
Lot's of Fuse(s)

First we'll make the plastic explosive, it's the same stuff I've
detailed in other issues, it's just polystyrene, motor oil and
petrol mixed up, just look back an issue or two if your not sure.
Adding potassium permanganate will increase the power.

Once you've got a nice amount of thick explosive fill the pringles
tub, pack it in tight.

Now get your black powder and crush it up so it's like talc powder.

Fill all of the CO2 cartriges with the powder, take care here as
one of these is capable of removing your hand(s).

Get your antenna arial and insert the fuses through them, now carefuly
push the antenna (and fuse) down into the middle of the CO2 bomb, it
should be in such a way that if you lit the fuse the bomb wouldn't
explode until it burns down to the bottom, it should also look like
there is a small amount of arial sticking out of the top with about
two centimeters of fuse poking out of the top of that.

Make between 5 and 10 of these CO2 bombs.

Push the CO2 bombs into the plastic explosive in the pringles tub, try
to get them on the outer side of the tub. The CO2 bombs should be almost
fully submerged in the explosive, make sure that the fuse's are pushed
into the explosive.

Press the detanator or air bomb center into the middle of the explosive.

I would recommend using an electical timer or an extreamly long fuse
for this.

When it explodes it will also ignite the fuse's of the CO2 bombs and
throw them in all directions. They will probably go between 1 and 50
meters. Some of them will probably explode in the air, sending shrapnal
in all directions.
