Have you ever wanted a 100% free net connection? no large phone bill?
but you can no longer abuse the pipex dial up. Well heer you will need
basic knowlege of phreaking, a modem and a copy of credit wizard.

Ok if you ever scan a range of numbers and you get:
"Meridian mail, mail box?" (american version not UK)
then you have found a direct dial meridain mail system, now all direct
dial meridain mail systems have outdials, but mostly to there local
numbers.
Ok so when you find a box hack out a mail box and password, try using
the box number and use the password as the mail box number, i.e
Box number 1020 pwd 1020. Once you in dial 09 911 #
this will connect you to there 911 service, they should say,
"(somewhere) 911 emergency" now write down where the (somewhere) is and
dig out the phone book. Look up the area code.
Now get your compuserve free trial that come with windoze 95 and set up
the american version. Ok this next bit can be expensive unless you have
a 1800 access out dial, you set it up to dial the 1800 number, by 
fiddeling about with the dial up settings, once thats done you will
connect to the sign up screen, fill in all of the details, use credit
wizards info generator for this, because it checks the zip code. Now
it should ask for your phone number, enter the area code as the one
your outdial can reach, and fill in the other numbers as random.
Use a credit card, either a stolen one or a generated one for that
part of the set up. It should then disconnect and try to connect you to
the local number, so fiddle around with the settings and get it to go
via your outdial. After this is done you have a free net connection.
You can also sign up at the number you dial into, i.e you don't need
to use the 1800 number.  Ok here's basicaly what I mean:
1) find an outdial into america
2) sign up a compuserve (or aol) account using the outdial.
3) connect to the account using the outdial.

Simple.
Advantages: Carding stuff, you will not get caught.
Participating in operation: Cyberkill
totaly free, nothing to pay ever.
And the number should last forever as it won't show up on there
phone bill, but they may notice a lot more usage of there system.
