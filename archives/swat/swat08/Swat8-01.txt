The don't Stop me I am important manouver.

Equiptment needed:

Shirt and Tie
A very official looking piece of paper 
and the name of an important person who works in the target
(If you dont have the above then use John)

Method:

Simply put on the shirt and tie (wearing trousers will help as well)
and undo the top button and ruffle yourself up a bit in the typical 
harrassed business man style. Now get your official looking piece 
of paper and burst into the office and just look very harrased.
absolutely no one will try and stop you they will be in fear of 
their jobs (and possibly lives) for the fear of getting in your way 
and if anyone does have the ordassity to ask you just say you desperately
need to speak to John (etc). And now that you are safely in the 
office/lab/factory then look around but just keep looking harrassed and you 
will be fine.
