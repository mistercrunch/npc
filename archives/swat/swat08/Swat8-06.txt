Most people started to shit themselves when E.S.S. came in in the U.K.,
fearing that it would ruin their phreak related phun. I on the other 
hand don't worry too much about this because like with any other system
there are bound to be cracks in the structure which allow people to 
abuse the system. One such feature of E.S.S. is call forwarding. When 
used correctly this can be an amazing way to make every call you ever 
make be charged at the local rate. 
In the U.K. call forwarding can be controlled from your home phone 
using *21*xxxxxxxxxxx# where the xxxxxxxxxxx represents the number for 
all incoming calls to be transferred to. The caller only pays for the 
first leg of the call. The rest is charged to the account of home where
the first leg terminates. So if you are ever left in an enemies house 
alone with the fone, walk up to it and dial*21*0898504030# or something
like that. Hey presto, call up Fuck Boy and rack up massive calls to 
sex lines, mates, e.t.c. that could be a pain to explain away.
In the U.S.A. there is a facility known as remote call forwarding. This
could be absolutely abused the hell out of. Just dial the access 
number, enter the number you want to dial, dial up Fuck Boy when his 
line is busy and send his bill soaring. As far as I know if you dial 
up the operator and give her a good old sob story about you being on 
holiday, and that you programmed your computer to connect to the office
every day at x:xx pm/am and that while the line was busy you'd like 
calls forwarded to your current position. She'll probably do that for 
you if you make it sound convincing. If you can't get a hold of that 
then just fone up and pretend to be a B.T. engineer who's looking into 
technical faults on the line. "Yes sir, i've been having problems with 
my line. People keep foning up and they get disconnected e.t.c." Well 
you say: "Just dial *21*xxxxxxxxxxx# and this will help us run tests 
on the line, we'll also have an engineer fone tomorrow and update you" 
ha ha ha.
Who I really feel happy for are those of you connected to cable 
telephone. Imagine having fonecalls to abroad/mates or anywhere else 
for the 1.5p connection fee.
You could also forward Toys 'R' Us calls to Fuck Boy, leaving him with 
hundreds of fonecalls per day. As ever endeavour to be creative with 
such techniques and the rewards will come.
On another note, if you fancy a wild party at your house while your 
parents are away but are lumbered with relatives, no problem! Just go 
to another relatives house and ask to use the fone. Call up your 
temporary minder and say:
"Aunt Beattie (he he) has asked us to stay over so we will. Call her 
house if you want to reach us" 
Then hang up and dial *21*number of your house# So as far as you 
minders know your tucked up safe in Beatties house. If and when they 
call you just pick up your home fone and say:
"Oh Beatties just popped out, I'll tell her you called"
