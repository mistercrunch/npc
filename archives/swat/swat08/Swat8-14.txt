Late last month I went on a raid with a few friends, we where running
low on supplies and we'd got board. So what did we raid? the military,
yes thats right while there out training we raided there stuff.
Needed:
Between 4 or 5 people
Bag or Box (we got a box while we where there)
An escape route
The ability to run while carrying stolen goods.

Ok here's how we did it:
One person stands on the road near to where we were raiding, playing
around with a rugby ball. The others go through hut's and the area
surrounding, looking everywhere that could house goodies. Every so
often the lookout would call out and tell us someone was comming, we'd
all leg it up a hill out of site, carrying our goods. Once they'd gone
we'd return.  After about 2 and a half hours of this we'd got all there
was worth taking, we got: £50 worth of ration packs, about 50 wind proof
matches, a blank and a large clubbing impliment. Not bad for a spontaious
raid. So what's been taken on previous raids? Night vision goggles, a
few of the raiding party once stripped them off an american tank, well
two pairs actuly, tons of ration packs; there always a favorite because
they fetch a good price, Polystyrene -> naypalm, fuel, ammo, strange
chemicals, essensial chemicals (like the ones that where in Barakis's
box 'o' dodgy things).

Why raid? Well it's fun, you can make a fortune if it's done right
remember not to get caught, if your jackets full of ammo you don't
just get slapped wrists, you usualy get a prison sentence and a
boyfriend called "bubba".
Raiding is much like planning and executing a robbery, a file which
Barakis did, just stick to the same rules and you should be fine.
