This little bomb could be very dangerous but it is a right laugh to
watch exploding when I did one with a few friends a huge purple flame
shot about 10 feet into the air. The bang wasn't all that loud and
glass didn't go that far.

Here's how I made my one:
Materials:
Sodium chlorate (Pure)*
Charcoal*
Sulphur*
Sugar*
Sodium chlorate weed killer*
Potassium permanganate
Glycerin
Small glass jar (I used an empty potassium permanganate jar)

* all of these can be substituted for any low explosive like gun or
flash powder.

(1) Put your chemicals into the jar and crush them up until they are
    quite well mixed.
(2) remove the lid and place it somewere safe.
(3) Put the potassium permanganate on top of the chemicals (try to use
    large grains for a long delay)
(4) Add only one or two drops of glycerin to the potassium permanganate
(5) Screw the lid on and run like fuck.

30 seconds to five minutes later it will explode.

When I found the shrapnel from this thing it had blown only one side of
the jar out, the only thing holding it togeather was the lable, when a 
friend picked it up he burnt his fingers, it was really hot and it
gave off a lot of smoke.
I would recommend a safe distance of 150m if you use a big jar, I was
50m away when it exploded, and I was quite safe, but the jar was only
small.

Red Viper made an even simpler one.

Materials:
Potassium permanganate. (In a glass jar)
Glycerin.

(1) Pour about 1 and a half teaspoons of glycerin in the jar with
    the potassium permanganate.
(2) Screw the lid on and leave somewhere, oh nad run like fuck.

Red viper made one like this and threw it down a toilet, BOOOOOOM
the water went dark purple, water went everywhere, oh and a kid that
was nearby shit himself when it exploded.  This got him kicked out of
school and as far as I know he got done by the police.  So remember
