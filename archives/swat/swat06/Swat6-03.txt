This is a new explosive that I have developed, it burns for a long time
compared to other low explosives and it smokes a lot.

Materials:
Black powder or flashpowder , make sure that you do not use potassium
        permanganate in any of this or you will hurt yourself big time.
Glycerin.
Corn flour.

(1) Add enough glycerin to make the mixture damp, mix it up for about
    2 minutes or until you have a black sticky dough.

(2) Roll it in corn flour until it's covered.

(3) Leave to dry in a sunny place.  

Once dry it can be ignited with a fuse or by rubbing in a large grain
of potassium permanganate.
