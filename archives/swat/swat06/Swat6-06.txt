This little file will tell you how to carry out a sucessful internet
warfare attack on a victim, if your really sick then you can find there
address and phone number and carry out urban warfare as well, but
that'll be discussed in a later issue.

OK let's assume that a lamer has gave you loads of abuse, via e-mail
(Psyclone@dac.org) the first thing you want to do is to get your
hands on a program like Ænima and Nowhere utilities V2.0 as well as a
good virii or trojan, now using the program called Fakeware place the
virii or trojan into the program, you may need to edit a few of the
documents that it creates if you want a good responce.  Instead of
having a game, try to make it look like a database or spreadsheet.
Now write a genuine looking letter about this great new shareware 
database or spreadsheet, make it look really good.  Now e-mail it
to your victim using Ænima, try to make it look as genuine as possible
when it comes to e-mail addresses etc.  Now when the lamer tries to
install it the trojan or virii will be released.

Also if you are the rich type run Ænima, at about 10:00pm amd try to
get a good fast connection, write a really abusive message, set it
to send the e-mail until it's turned off, leave it running, and do
what you normally do at night, when you go to bed leave it running.
In the morning, see how many e-mails have been sent and turn off the
computer.  You may want to attach a picture, get a really sick one
from Rotten dot com (Rotten.com) with the message saying that it's a
picture of his Mum/dad/him/baby picture whatever.

If you know that he is on AOL or Compuserve then get one of those CD's
with the free trials and a hex editor, now copy all of the files to
your hard drive, and find the sign up one and all of the shit that's
needed to run it, now with your hex editor, edit where the stuff goes
instead of going to AOL or Compuserve have it sent to your e-mail
address, then once you've got there password, change it, run up a huge
bill, buy stuff, find out where they live, and finaly delete the
account.  Attach a message saying that the version that they where
running had a bug in it that would allow hackers to get there password
and therefore they should install the "patch" that you have attached.
Zip it down with winzip and make it an auto-extracting file with the
AOL/Compuserve logo so that it looks as genuine as possible.  If you
use this method then leave your computer on all night so that you use
up all of there free time and the bills start to roll in.

Go to all of the porn site that you can find which have the "10 free
pictures in your e-mail every day" option, now put his e-mail address
in all of them, if you have a web site with Geocities and you don't
use the e-mail forwarder then have it forward to his e-mail address
and sign that up too.

E-mail him all 640mb of the Windows '95 CD.

Get him with Win nuke.

E-mail him huge worthless files.

Fill in all of his details in the Ænima from section, remember to send
the mail through the proper server so that it looks real, now get your
hands on a mailing list and send out a short and very offensive
message to everybody, if your lucky then he'll be kicked off the
internet.

And finally for you hackers out there get his I.P logon to his computer
remotely and upload loads of child pornography to his computer and then
call up his local police station and tell them that he's a peadophile
that showed you the child porn on his computer (remain anonymous). Hey
presto the lame fuck gets a few years in prison.

Next month:  URBAN WARFARE.
