Originaly this file was going to be an import from several sources, but
since I've joined Darkcyde communications and spoken with the guy that
hacks voice mail, he said that most of the systems in the file no
longer existed.  So I've written a file on what I have learnt, well
sort of, I've done this file on hacking Octel voice mail since it is
the easyist one to hack.  Ok so in order to hack it you need to know
how to login, this is simple, you dial the number (usually an 0800 89)
and when it answers you press # (that's the hash/pound key) it will 
then say "Mail box number please" you then type in a box number, they
are 4 digit box numbers, it will then say one of the following:
"XXX is not a valid mail box number please try again" This means that
there are no free boxes in the said string, let's assume you entered
1234, it will only say the first three numbers because there arn't
any boxes in the 123 range, if there had then it would say:
"1234 is in invalid box number please try again" then you just enter
numbers like 1231, 1230 etc until you get either:
"(some person say's there name)" This is a taken box, it will then say:
"please enter your password"
these boxes are useless, you are only after ones that say:
"Hello. (some long message)" These are free boxes, the default 
passwords are usualy the same as the box number or ones likes 1111, 
2222 etc, once you've cracked it just follow what it say's and you've
got a box number.  For someone to leave a message in your box they:
Dial the number, when it picks up they enter ** (box number) and
leave a message. To login to your box simply copy what you did to hack
it. Simlple. once you've got a default password for one box e.g 1111
it will work on all free boxes. I'd like to give you some number's
but I don't want them to die, so try scanning in the 0800 89 range
or the 0800 96 range, if you scan all of the numbers then you will
find hundreds of voice mail boxes using Octel.  Enjoy.
