OK first of all this month I want to talk to all you people
who have been E-Mailing S.W.A.T. saying that Krank phone calls aren't
Phreaking, Well think of it this way, all us folk who have an interest 
in the phone line -whether we are boxers,people with codes or what-
have done Kranks at some point or another because of this interest.
It all boils down to the same thing the fact that we use the phone line 
to promote Anarchy and freedom. The term Phreaking has become to 
generic anyway to be thought of in such small minded terms I mean Boxers
are phreakers ,we dont call them Boxers and make them seperate from the 
rest of the phreakers do we? If it wasn't for the Krankers (they cant 
even have a name unless you call them Phreakers) you wouldnt have pissed
off operators who didnt do their job properly, you wouldnt have companys
WAISTING millions of pounds on trying to stop them. So try not to forget
that they cause as much damage to the monopolising scum like BT and AT&T
as anyone else so dont knock them. If Anarchists are going to start arguing
about names and getting all pedantic what kind of state would that put 
us into? How could we fight the establishment if we are fighting 
each other? 


THINK ABOUT IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
