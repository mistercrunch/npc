By now you should all know that the jolly roger/anarchists cookbook is 
full or rubbish and that nothing it it works, i lernt this the hard way 
by trying just about everything with no explosions to show for my 
efforts. 

I did find one artical that has worked very well, it was for making 
chlorine gas.  The next part of the artical is allmost entirely ripped 
and verry little of it is my own work.

If you mix ammonia solution with chlorine bleach the it gives off 
chlorine gas.  To capture it, get a large bottle and put a small amount 
of chlorine bleach in the bottom.  Then pour some ammonia solution down 
into the bottle.  Because chlorine gas is heavier than air, it will 
stay down in the bottle unless you use a lot of ammonia and bleach 
(don't!).

(Back to my own work, most of the rest of the artical has been built 
up from experiance of making the gas.)

Thats really all there is to it, now for getting hold of the right 
stuff to make it.  Allmost all bleach that you buy is chlorine bleach, 
this is because it contains sodium hypochlorate solution, check the 
side of the bottle just to make sure.  It will probably be accompanied 
by a warning, telling you not to mix it with other cleaning stuffs, 
this is because they don't want you to accidently make chlorine gas.

Get thin bleach, not the thick stuff as it tends to make bubbles and 
doesn't release the gas well, also get the strongest thin bleach you 
can as this will react better. (the strongest is usually the most 
expencive too.)

Ammonia isn't so easy to get, supermarkets probably wont have it.  
I got mine from Boots, it wasn't in the chemists bit though, it was 
with some cleaning stuff under the title of household ammonia for all 
purpose cleaning or something like that.  Again get the strongest 
concentration you can.  My ammonia solution is about 10% ammonia and 
this is strong enough.

Once you have these use a glass bottle (i find they work better than 
plastic ones, dunno why) and start off with small amounts, to get a 
feel for how much you can expect to get produced.  You should get a 
cloud of gas produced that you can see, it will kill you if you breath 
it in so don't.  i'm not sure what it does to your lungs but there is 
a good chance that it will lead to you coughing up bits of your lungs 
at the dinner table, if you breath in small amounts so don't do this 
either.

If you get white foam produced this is because the bleach you used is 
too thick, the foam is made from little bubbles of chlorine gas.  Use 
a thinner bleach and make sure it is not a kind of bleach that makes 
lots of bubbles.

Uses
Chlorine is very reactive. Get the gas as pure as you can and as 
concentrated as you can and try dropping stuff in it.  A good one is a 
rag soked in turpentine that you drop in the bottle, then it should 
light and burn,  this does work but you will need a very good 
concentration of chlorine.  Use your imagination and common sence for 
what will react well.

Disclamer
Don't do anything stupid.  I am not responsable for anything that you 
do as a result of reading this artical.  This artical does not tell 
you to do anything, it is just to educate.
