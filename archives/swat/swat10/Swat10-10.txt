How to build a rocket with a payload and how to safely attach warheads.

Well here's part two of my rocketry guide. If you followed the steps in
part one you should be able to make simple rockets.

Ok now how to make a payload:

You will need:
Cardboard (the thin kind A4 size)
Dowel rod (same diameter as the rocket engine)
Rocket engine (D type work best, but a powerful C will do)
Epoxy resin
Tissue
Balsa wood (30cm long, 0.5cm thick)

1) Wrap the cardboard around the tube twice and mark where it overlaps
   using a pencil, add about 2cm extra.
2) Cut the cardboard.
3) Now starting in reverse order (start from where you cut the card)
   add a thin layer of epoxy along the 2cm of extra card and re-wrap
   the card around the dowel. Do not epoxy the card to the dowel. Make
   sure that the card is epoxied to the card, once this has dried
   remove the dowel rod and you should have a perfect tube. (you may
   wish to make a load of tubes for future use.)
4) Now insert the engine in the bottom (not all the way, just to make
   sure it fits). Once you know that it fits scrape away the clay at
   top, exposing the black powder.
5) This is the difficult bit, you need to make three fins exactly the
   same size and shape. They should have this shape:
   ________
   \_______)
   
    The best way I've found to do this is to make the wood like this:
   ____________________________
   |\_______)\_______)\_______)|

(ok so that's not too acurate but you get the idea).

6) Now mark the tube, the best way to do this is to use a door frame,
   but getting the exact possision of the fins is an arse, so get a 
   strip of paper and wrap it ONCE around the tube, make sure that it 
   is EXACTLTY once around, then cut it.  Now measure it, and divide 
   the number by 3 this is how many centimeters apart each fin should 
   be, now you might get some really wierd number, if this is the case
   then just take the measurments and use the formula of the circle 
   rather than the "rectangle" Now stick this around the tube and 
   extend the lines onto the tube using a ruler and pencil.
7) Now epoxy the fins onto the tube. Leave the epoxy to dry.
8) Nearly finished, apply a thin layer of epoxy to a rocket engine and
   shove it into the rocket body.
9) Fill the rocket with you chosen payload, remember to keep the weight
   balanced or else it may arch.
10) You can attach a nose cone if you want the ultimate in stability,
    but usually a ball of tissue soaked in epoxy and shoved in the end
    works just as well.

Now how to attach war heads:

Attaching warheads is simple, you won't need to attach a warhead to the
rocket described above, because if you like me you'll just fill it with
black powder. But when it comes to attaching a warhead to a simple
rocket, or even just an engine you need to ask your self these simple
questions:
1) What type of warhead? (explosive, incendrie)
2) What is the warhead going to be? (Gun powder, thermite)
3) What am I putting the compound in? (paper, plastic, metal)
4) How heavy is it going to be?

The type of warhead isn't too important, but the compound is, for
example, gun powder is more sensitive than thermite and magnesium.
This ties in with the warhead construction materials, gun powder is
more dangerous if it's in metal, but thermite would be useles in paper.
And of course the weight, too heavy and it could blow you up, too light
and it may not have the effect you wanted.

Attaching a warhead is pretty simple, scrape away the top clay, stick
the container to the end and maybe use a small fuse.
It's the compound that is more dangerous, but if attaching a metal
warhead you run the risk of the rocket engine accidentaly igniting
whilst your attaching it. Just use common sense and be carful.
