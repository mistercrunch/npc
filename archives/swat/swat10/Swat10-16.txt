Ok guys here's the ultimate way to fuck over someones e-mail account!
You need:

1 Bigfoot account
1 Mail forwarder
Optional: 1mb of data

Ok first off set up you Bigfoot account but use your e-mail address to
start with.

Now set up the mail forwarder, use geocities or something. N.B Some
mail forwarders won't forward mail to bigfoot, so look around, once
you've done that forward all mail to bigfoot.

Set up bigfoot to send mail to the mail forwarder. (get the idea)

Set up a distrobution list with bigfoot and fill in the e-mail address
of upto five lamers, here's two if your stuck:
Admin@cyberthrill.com
Sponsor@cyberthrill.com

Once you've done that mail the 1Mb of data to the mail forwarder and
sit back.

In case you can be outwitted by a teabag here's how it works:
Bigfoot will send the mail out to all of the lamers and back to the 
mail forwarder, the mail forwarder will then return the mail etc etc.

I say use 1Mb of data because it takes longer to send 1mb of data
than it does to send 1Kb of data, and it fills up there mail box with
bigger files. Of course this will drain bandwidth on the server of the
mail forwarder and the victims server, so if you hate the sys admin of
a certain server like Cyberthrill.com it will hopefully cost them a lot
of money in extra charges, and if they complain it will get back to
them 1000+ times.
N.B If you think that 1Mb is too slow then use 100k, again it will
drain there bandwidth, a 1kb message will be relayed hundreds of times
in about a minute.

Tips: Mail bomb the mail forwarder.
      Send one mail to it using an anonymous mailer (hides you IP)

Problems: This can KILL servers if (ab)used too much.
          Bigfoot will usualy stop a message after 20 loops, but this
          has it's advantages, I.E you send 10 messages and it get's
          looped to them 200 times. With an autoresponder this is
          increased to 400 messages.

I've used it against a few people and I think that it makes a good
internet warfare tactic. 
This method can be stopped if the person has the ability to block the
sender of the message.
