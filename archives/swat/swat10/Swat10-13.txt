The Doh Boy has shown the way. This is how easy it is. Get the address 
and fone number of the fuckwit of your choice. Call BT and send him a 
chargecard. Then call Fuck Boy pretending to be BT and socially 
engineer the chargecard no. Tell him you will cancel the card. Then 
wait 'till the next quarterly bills arrive. As soon as they do, call 
away. You have 3 months b4 FB will even notice.

PS-This WILL get traced to your home, I don't care how many PBXs u go 
   through. And don't call friends as their numbers will be logged too. 
   If there is anyone you want to get busted, however, then call away.
   Just do it from a payfone.
PSPS-There is a limit to what u can do - after u have racked up a bill 
     of £200 to Fuck Boy's bill, BT call him and let him know the score.
     Of course, BT employees all go home at 5PM......
PSPSPS-Please note that I am NOT expressly telling you to go out and do
       this. I wish merely to educate. This is a major flaw in BT's 
       system, but I do not in ANY way wish for you to exploit it. 
       Neither does anyone else remotely connected with SWAT in any 
       way.
PSPSPSPS- "Lie mode cancel"-Kryten from Red Dwarf.
