OK, everyone must have made these at some point. And I'll bet all you 
used them for was firing stones at cats. Well, they have MUCH greater 
potential. Be Afraid. Be very Afraid...
For those of you who had a deprived childhood, here's how to make a 
Johnny Gun.
You will need: 
The neck of a glass bottle
A condom, or, for preference, the middle finger of a rubber glove.
Sellotape
Epoxy (optional)

What you do: Take the bottle neck and sand/file the edges till they 
are smooth. Tape the johnny to the inside edge of the opening of the 
bottle neck(the end where the cap used to be). You can glue this if 
you like. Now simply drop a stone into the open end of the gun, pull 
back, take aim, and let fly. These things have been known to fire 
stones faster than some airguns fire pellets.
Alternative Ammo:
This is where the fun begins....
NAILS: Pretty self-explanatory. Or get some twine and tie three nails
together. Use BIG nails. Then go about firing nails at things. Cool.
MINI-GENERIC BOMBS:You should know how to make these. Just make smaller
ones.
DAMP OXO CUBES:Make the whole place smell of beef...
HAALOWE'EN SPECIALS:Peanuts. Lots of 'em.
SCALDERS:Take a peanut shell. Break it in half. Remove peanuts. Then 
make some pop tarts. Try to burn them. Remove the jam without touching 
it. Fill peanut shells with boiling hot, very sticky jam. Fire these @ 
ppl.
GARDEN CANES:Make these about a foot long. Sharpen one end to a point. 
Hee Hee
