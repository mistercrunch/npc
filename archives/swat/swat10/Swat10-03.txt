Greetz to J-Day (a local anarchist) and all the Swat members

A golf course is one of the best places to cause anarchy, they are 
large, open and almost totally deserted at night. There are also lots 
of expensive things to cause damage to...
A list of suggested equipment to cause real damage:
Shovels
Cement
Bleach
Epoxy resin (30 minutes setting or above) and hardener
Fishing line (as strong as possible without being easily visible)
Fireworks, land mines (see Anarchists cookbook)
It's a good idea to bring some bangers, a camera flash unit or bright 
halogen torch to scare off/dazzle anyone who might notice you and chase
after you.
Here are some ideas for things to do on a golf course:
1. Steal the flags.
2. Burn the flag leaving just the pole and replace it with your own 
   anarchy flag.
3. Dig holes in the green (as deep as possible).
4. Shovel sand out of the bunker and spread it around the fairway
5. Go to the place they tee off from, pull up all those stupid notices
   saying what par the hole is and throw them as far as possible or 
   into bushes. Rip up some turf while you're at it.  
6. Spread bleach or flammable stuff (e.g sodium chlorate and sugar) in
   the Anarchy symbol pattern ("A" in a circle). Light it if required.
7. Tip over litter bins and scatter litter around.
8. Beat up all the bins and kick them around.
9. Place a land mine in the hole, set to activate when a ball goes 
   in... Bang! ha
10. Fill the hole with cement.
11. See those green things that they clean the balls with? Well either
    put glue or grease on the handle, or fill them with paint stripper!
    Lets see them try to clean the balls now ha ha ha!!
12. Use a rake to draw the Anarchy symbol in the bunkers or scratch it 
    into the green.
13. Throw the rakes into the water obstacles.
14. Our golf course has a toilet in a small building (it is a portable
    toilet) you can either run off with them, beat them, put something
    down them like fill them with soil or block them up. 
15. Mix up some epoxy, take the flag out of the hole and spread it on 
    the base of the flag. Then put it back into the hole. Later, check
    if you can pull it out. Once it's dry, you wont be able to, and 
    neither will the golfers. Ha Ha Ha!!
16. Put fishing line tripwires between trees across the fairway where 
    they walk. Try to get at least 10 strands across. Hopefully it
    will trip them up.
17. Spread non-selective weedkiller on the green. 
18. Since the golf course owners are very proud of their course why 
    not give them something to be even more proud of by digging it up 
    and leaving the turf in a huge pile by the clubhouse for them to 
    admire.
19. Tip over and smash up benches.
20. Scatter mud, rubbish, junk mail, free internet access CD's or 
    anything else useless that you have too much of around the course.
21. Break into any sheds, barns or buildings, and cause damage inside.
22. If there are any permentant shelters to keep the rain off, then 
    graffiti on them.
23. Light fireworks or thermite and make sure they burn large holes in
    the ground.
24. This one might take some time to explain. Connect a "D" class model
    rocket engine with fins on it to an ingitor connected to a 555 
    timer circuit set to activate the next day. Set it up in the 
    bushes, pointing at somewhere the golfers will probably be. Make 
    sure you around to watch when the sparks and flames fly! 
25. Leave bricks, roadkill, for sale signs (nicked from a nearby 
    estate) or anything else on the green or fairway.
26. Egg the clubhouse or buildings.
27. During the early evening when golfers could still be playing, 
    throw golf balls through the windows of nearby houses and clear 
    the area fast. Since there are no golfers around, they'll blame 
    the golf club itself, and they will have to pay for the damage!!
28. Plant pineapples/bombs/dynamite in the holes, hopefully they'll 
    blow craters around it.
29. Pollute any water obstacles with sodium chlorate, bleach or poison.
30. Build a big bonfire on the green and light it. 
31. Crank call the clubhouse repeatedly, saying how you hate golf and 
    golfers and are going to kill the lot of them.
32. Steal anything that isn't bolted down and throw the whole lot in a
    pile in a nearby back garden.
