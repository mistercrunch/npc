This is something me and Brackis got up to after far too much Vodka. 
Simply get some spray-paint, find a field full of docile cows, and 
spray whatever the hell ya like on 'em. Take photo's. Scan 'em. E-mail 
them to me and I'll stick 'em on a web page. Check out 
Http://members.xoom.com/Onion2/WhereTheBeef.htm from time to time. 
Enjoy
E-mail your cow art to me at Onion_666@yahoo.com
