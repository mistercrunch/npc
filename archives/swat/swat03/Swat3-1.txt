Phreaking with a RED BOX: I.e PULSE GENERATOR

(I got this from a book on electronics, in theory it will work)


Parts list: 

1 555 I.C and Holder
1 220 Resistor
1 10uF Electrolytic capacitor
100k Variable Resistor
1 L.E.D Any colour
1 9v Battery clip
1 9v Battery
Matrix board
some wire.


ASTABLE multivibrators can be used to provide
a pulsed input to other circuits. The frequency and
duration of the pulses dependes upon the resistor
and capacitor values.

Frequency (f) = 0.72 Hz
		----
		R x C

Pulse duration (T) = 1.4 RC 's

The output from the 555 timer I.C. is "low
powerd" and will normally need amplification
by a transistor if it is to be used to drive
an output transducer other than an LED.
NB. The mark / space ratio for this asrable
is 1:1 the output is "high" for 0.7RC seconds
and then "low" for an equal length of time.

The output that should be used is an 8 ohm speaker, adjust the
POT to 72K and there you have your red box.

British Red box tones:
(please note that these have not been tested, so if you find them
to work or not, then let me know.)
