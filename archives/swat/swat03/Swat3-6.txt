                                   Which boxes work in UK?
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            This list of boxes stolen from the alt.2600 FAQ and converted for the uk
             (this is just an 'educated' guess of what will or will not work in the
            uk, this is only in *theory* and any which I say will work will probably
             need a lot of modification to work, that's if you can find a schematic
                                  thats half way readable :) )
