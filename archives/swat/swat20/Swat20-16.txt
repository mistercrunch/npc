Apologies to the Jolly Roger, who ever you are
This was written to only be a source of entertainment (but who the 
hell ever reads this bit anyway)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The perfect assassination weapon
What you need:
A thin syringe (try your schools science lab when teach ain't looking)
A dead stinging insect (not squished)
An inflating pin (maybe)
A deadly nightshade plant (or anything else poisonous as long as it's
 natural)
What to do:
1: dissect the insect and remove the sting
2: put the inflating pin in the syringe and secure it
3: carefully put the sting in the end of the pin
4: stab the end in the deadly nightshade berry
5: cap the spike (to be on the safe side)
6: find the enemy
7: aim carefully (you don't wan kill some innocent little brat now do 
   you?)
8: slam the plunger down hard
9: make up an excuse like "oh my god there was a wasp on your back 
   just then"
10: walk calmly away 
11: watch the news
Notes: this is great because
1- you get off Scot free:)
2- you get out of school/work while loads of scientists come to look 
for the 'deadly killer bee'

How to make a ray gun                                  -by deathbringer
(This is based on theory only but is damn powerful if it works)
What you need:
A large hologen torch
About 10 large magnifying glasses
Duck tape
A hacksaw
What to do:
1 put all the magnifying glasses in a line
2 saw of all the handles except the two at each end
3 turn the torch on:)
Enjoy

Impact sensitive explosive (geff)                      -by deathbringer
This is absolutely lethal!!! Be careful (im not shure if it works ,some
say yes,some say no)

What you need:
Flour
Water
Salt
Vinegar
Plastic bag
Expensive oil paint

What to do:
1 weigh out 1 pound of flour
2 add water until it's the consistency of toothpaste
3 add 2 table spoons of salt
4 add 4 table spoons of vinegar
5 add more water until its like sludge
6 knead it a lot
7 add paint (I don't know how much but use a fair ol bit)
8 put in the plastic bag and knead it some more to mix it in good
9 leave to set for about an hour
Notes: this is not set 0ff by heat or electricity but is by violent 
impacts such as being hit with a hammer (not recommended) or adding a
fire cracker which will set it off. This makes it useful as a booster
for a smaller device
WARNING: after 2 years it breaks down and explodes on its own

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple bombs                                     
This isn't very safe but is dead easy to make
You need:
A tennis ball
About 1000 (non-safety) matches
A sparkler (or any other fuses you have)
What to do:
1 drill a small hole in the ball
2 cut the heads off all the matches
3 fill the ball up with them
4 ram the sparkler in the 'top'
5 light and run
Notes: try sealing the hole up with tape and throwing the damn thing.
Or powder the heads to add a bit more of a kick. Another thing is to
add tipp ex to make it burn well or napalm to make it burn damn well
Have fun  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

How to build a CRUISE MISSILE! (u¬)
Exercise extreme caution with this one- it'd make a good anti-tank 
weapon:)
What you need:
A model rocket
About 5 engines
Some match powder
A pipe (it needs to fit in the rocket whith room each side)
Polystyrene
Geff (not a lot)
2 discs of storng metal that you can wedge in the rocket
ball bearings
a drain pipe
a bit of metal that fits on the end of the pipe
a sparkler
duck tape
damn that's a lot-but its worth it:)!
What to do (finally)

1 fit the engines into the rocket and attach the fuse
2 put in one of the metal discs in front of the engines
3 fill the small pipe whith match powder
4 put the 'pipe bomb' in the rocket and fill the cavity around its
  side whith balls
5 wedge another disc in over it
7 make a 'nose cone' out of polystyrene and hollow it out from behind
8 fill the nosecone whith geff and attach it with duck tape
That's your rocket. Fire it like that if you want or make the launcher
1 drill a hole in the large disc
2 attach it to the back of the pipe whith more trusty duck tape
3 slide in your rocket (it may need more fins to steady it) so the 
  fuse pokes out the back
4 aim it at the nearest petrol station and light the fuse
   this should really only be used if you are very phucked
have a (big) blast! :)                                
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

school escapes                                      
1 flush some pure sodium down the bog and run- they'll have to call the
hazodrus chemicals squad to investigate it
2 put a few chlorene tablets in the water supply (if very disturbed 
  hide outside the pe showers and wait for the screaming) (u¬)
3 ring up and say something like "zimon zez zere iz ay bomb in van 
  offf za lockerz vich vill go ov in 24 hourz"
4 put a smoke bomb in a coridoor, go to your lesson.AND WAIT!
5 when the (sad) day comes that you leave school don't forget to put 
  little blobs of geff in vases, lights etc then 2 years later pop-bang
  whose doing that-zing blam-oh no run
Have fun                                         
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Napalm
This shit is nasty-it can burn in just about anything even under water
simply because it provides its own fuel, heat and oxygen 
(that's what a fire needs to keep burning-every anarchist should
know a little science) and what is the recipe for this all powerful
weapon of death and destruction? huh?
Well its:
Soap flakes and petrol
What?????:
Simply add soap to petrol until it turns into a nice thick goo, then 
add it to a bomb and run-if you get any on you its almost impossible 
to put out (u¬)
Be careful with that now                              
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenge (how to totally boogeh an ass hole)    
HEALTH WARNING-DO NOT LET THE VICTIM KNOW ITS YOU!
- Ring up companies that supply industrial chemicals in large amounts
  and say " hi my names (ass holes name here) and I need 12 tons of
  limestone for a building project delivered to (ass holes address  
  here) by about 3 am-don't be late now" then get up early and sit 
  near his house (you better be well hidden-hell be totally phucked)
  and wait . they'll either deliver the stuff and bugger off (fun) 
  or ask him to sign for it (then a very angry trucker lays him out 
  for being dragged out of bed in the morning for nothing)(u¬)
- (THIS ONE MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE) Get mega phreak from my site and use
  it
- E-mail him huge files that say nothing
- Put bombs in his garden (they do wonders whith the front lawn(u¬))
- Cut his car in half whith thermite
- Shoot his house whith a rocket launcher (at night!)
- Draw a swastika,anarchy symbol or anything else nasty on his lawn in
  napalm and light it
- Beige box him and leave the fone off the hook
- Connect a blotto box to his line only 
- Poison his pets (or even better use laxatives!!!!)
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------


Quietly breaking in (warning-may result in prosecution that is if you
don't use these methods)
1-the watch: watch the house and make sure they're out (preferably on 
  holiday)
2- make your own way in: screw picking the lock-too obvious- instead
   put sellotape all over a window then gently crack it into small
   bits and peel off the tape (the window should come off with it)
3- the catch: take gloves, plastic bags, a bomb (optional) and an 
   innocent looking sports bag-head for the living room then bedrooms
   and lift every thing vaguely shiny or electric
Come out the back way, over the fence, in the car and away (don't 
speed-if you get stopped then they'll want to search the motor and a 
bag full of shinies and electric's is slightly suspicious.
Notes: put the plastic bags around your feet so you don't leave 
footprints (you'll look like a twat but at least you don't get caught).
Wear the gloves-even in this day and age some idiots still get caught 
for fingerprints. If the resident is on holiday any guard dogs should
be in kennels-BUT BEWARE: The pet sitter if any one goes to the place
regularly then forget it (or take a deathbringer-brand assassination
weapon)
Oh yeah- if there's an alarm don't bother but neighbourhood watch 
areas (just about all of England is by now) are safe because no-one
actually does that anyway

A cross bow                                           - by deathbringer
Most of the other things here aren't actually tested and are really
based on common sense but this is A REAL 100% PAIN-GAURANTEED WEAPON.
Its range is about 10 meters and it could probably kill something at
close range here it is

You will need
2 thin but strong planks of wood
Nails
Garden canes
Strong elastic (the white stuff they sell in super markets or sewing
shops)
How to make it:
1 cut a chunk out of one (longer) plank big enough for the second to 
  fit in
2 slot the second in and nail it
3 put 2 nails in the end of the cross bar it should look like this

                                        ==================
                                        [ N         o      o    N]-Nails sticking out
                                        ==================
                                                      I       I  \
                                                      I       I    Should all be level
                                                      I       I
                                                      I       I 
                                                      I       I 
                                                      I       I   
                                                      I___I     
                                                      Now tie elastic
round the sticking out nails and bend them down and put another 
through the elastic at each join

4 that should do for a nice looking cross bow now take a garden cane 
(make sure its pretty long) and plane down the ends to sharpen them
5 now put one in the elastic and hold the bottom of the bow and pull 
it back as far as it will go-crap huh? Try putting two nails in the 
main body just as far apart as the width of the arrow these can steady
it while aiming

Ok so iys not really anarchy but if you live near water it could be 
used for escape
You need
A big board of wood
A propellor (a BIG one)
Rubber sheets
Two big engines
A pole
Another propellor(sorry forgot)
Metal grids able to fit the propellors in
Ok, now to make it

2 fit one engine so the bit it turns faces down through the hole then
  fit a propellor on the bottom and cover it whith a metal grid
3 fit the other engine on a tripod and fix it to the back so it can  
  rotate easily then fix the pole on for a rudder
4 Put the skirt thing on (made from rubber)
have phun
