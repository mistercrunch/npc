               Getting All Of the Free Workareas You Want

Ok, then. This is my first EVER article, and im gonna try not to let
you down. First, this article will come with one part each month (I
havent decided how many parts to write yet - it depends on the response
to this article) and each part will give
you a bit more to exploit your school netowrk (and perhaps make a bit of
money ;-) ). First, all the examples i will give WORK at my school, and
using, an NT server, win95 Workstations, and an ethernet network. If
some of these examples don't work, then the Admin will have thought
about what you are doing, and bloked it out, try another exploit.

NOTE: You could EASILY bring your school net krashing to the ground with
the info I'm gonna give you, I have never done this, as I an taking a
GCSE in I.T, and that would be sorta shooting myself in the foot :-/
Remember that I only give you the info - It Is Up to you how you use it
(blah blah blah). Now onto the good shit!! :->

Remember - Knowledge is power. Learn all you can about the network.
EVERYTHING that the wanker sysadmin will give you. Actually, The Sysadmin
at my school, is quite okay, and he gives me all the info that I want,
you may not be so lucky >:-(. At My school, there are LOTS of loopholes
in the network security, but also a lot of hacks that should work that
don't, because the sysadmin has thought of it.

The first step, is being able to BROWSE THE SERVERS HARD DISK! this does
work at my school. The Keybord shourtcuts Aren't Disabled, so you can use
all of the apps, even if they aren't on the start menu.  If you wanna get
access to the server hard disk, the press: Windows Key + Ctrl + F, this
brings up the find computer dialog box.  Duh! just put in server1 (or the
name of your server). and hit find. im sure you can figure the rest.

Now, you won't be able to open most of the folders, don't think that the
hack hasnt worked - it has.  All of these 'Access denied' folders are
actually peoples workspaces. One file that you CAN open is repo.  However
you aren't concerned with this file. you are concerned with the 200 or so
folders at the start of the hard drive. these should all have names like
0012010 For ALL of these files, the password is ........PASSWORD (!)
You can use all of these work areas for what you want. In the next issue,
I'll Tell you how to use these for finacial gain.

If the Default password doesnt work - try the user name - eg

Login: 0110100
Password: 0110100

Also, there are other work areas, tha use the defult password
you will have to find these for yourself, but at my school, there are the
RMUSER accounts these take the form

Login: RMUSER3 (or any number between 1 and 30)
Password: password

BTW, If you school uses 'Priner Credits', as mine does, then all of these
accounts come with free credits. :-)

Thats It, now you will have all the work areas and credits that you could
desire - EASY-PEASY!
