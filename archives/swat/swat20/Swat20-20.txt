Anarchy rules and racisit people will be mercylessley annialated
zlowly unt painvully bevore bvekvast Oh yeah i didnt do it!!!
Anyway onto my article coal bombs
Ok i havent tried it (i havent got any handy) but on the discovery 
channel this program said that powderd coal was 60 times more
EXPLOSIVE than petrol. Woo hooo!-you know what to do anarchy stuff:
I had to stay in plymouth for a couple of weeks recently for the 
eclipse (which i couldnt see because of 2 miles of clouds) and i was 
cut off from the internet,sky tv and porn,so i came up whith some 
anarchistic things to do, heres the list
(some are taken from other sources including past swat mags but thats
 what i wrote so ill bung em in anyway.)

1:Drill a hole in a ping pong ball then funnel in some explosive, 
  Then put a bit of sparkler in the hole,there a nice looking bomb
  (try using coal powder for the explosive!)

2: spray paint anarchy signs everywhere

3:spit gum on the floor-prefrably carpet

4:prize buttons out of computer keyboards wiv a knife and clip em back
 in the wrong way-phunny!

5:let peoples car tyres down

6:make prank calls to enemies(apparently not called phreaking)

7:order the enemy some gay porn/industrial drums of manure

8:hold a coin wiv tweezers,cook it wiv a lighter then drop it near a
  scav and wait

9:put bits of geff (go to www.fightwinhail.com download deathbringers 
  hanbook and look for geff) in vases and stuff, wait two years then 
  whatch as the phun starts
10:send e-mail to the enemy from Y0ur_W0r$+ N1gHtm@r£

13:get a spray can,tape down the lid and light the spray then leave it
   behind,when the pressure runs down-boooom
