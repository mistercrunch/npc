As people we have been denied our fundamental rights, the right to live
our life the way we want to live it. The right to think and feel and 
behave any which way we want. When it boils down to it there are us 
who are the many and them who are the few. If there is anything I have 
learned in living on the earth is that money doesn't make the world go
round its bullishit, bulshit is the fuel and we gobble it up like 
mindless cretins. There is a system of which every human being is 
forced to comply to of course this system is hidden from your average 
Joe bloggs walking down the street, they give him cable TV, 2 weeks 
Spain and lots of other benefits to help him forget. Every desire, 
thought or action is controlled by them through the television, radio,
newspapers etc. They are reluctant to introduce any form of 
communication technology which cannot be controlled regulated 
and documented until what is left is a labyrinth of grey corridors 
leading to rooms which all look alike. And then theirs the Internet, 
created by Us for Us they hate it. Who are they? Look around you there
in your TV they approved the rigorous standards at which you microwave
was build they are (almost) everywhere.
