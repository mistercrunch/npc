Yeah it's november, and we all know what that means: MORE GUNPOWDER
finally we can all top up our reserves of this wonderful chemical
compund, and of course get potassium nitrate and fuses in the process.

Although I have heard that bangers are outlawed, this is a real problem
when it comes to getting loads of cheap gunpowder and fuses, but still
you can use the exploding parts of "air bombs".

You may have noticed that the server currently hosting the SWATeam site
is really slow, bare with us on this one as the domain is just around
the corner.
