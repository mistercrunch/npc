I suppose some of you must have asked yourself at some point, "I can't
be arsed to make a 555 timer circuit, can't I use a normal stop clock?"
well the answer is: "yes you can", but if you up the voltage to 9v then
there is a good chance something will go wrong. This is where you will
need a relay.

Basically a relay is a small electromagnetic switch which requires a
small amount of voltage to throw it, it can then allow a larger current
to flow through it.

Ok first off get a relay, they cost a few pence from maplins, while you
are ordering it, buy a 9v battery and a clip for it and anyother items
you think you will need.

Your relay should have 8 legs on it, then should be paired like this:

0  0 (row 1)

0  0 (row 2)

0  0 (row 3)
0  0 (row 4)

(a view of the underside)
Ok if you put a current through the legs on row 2 then the relay should
start to click. This should throw the switch to allow current to travel
through row 4, Use a bulb and a battery to test this, remember that the
relay is the switch.
Now get you stop clock (or watch, pager, mobile phone or anything else
that can give off an audioable signal when you want it to) and open it
up. You should see a small speaker. VERY carefully unsolder or cut the
wires going to it and attach them to row 2 on the relay. Now set off
your chosen device, you should hear the relay click. If you hook up
your 9v battery and detonator (or whatever) to row 4 then allow the
alarm to go off, the detonator (or whatever) should go off. Here's a
very basic schmatic.

   Watch=====================Relay row 2
                             Relay row 4-------9v battery----detonator
                              |__________________________________|

Get the idea.

Ok so now you can hook up a detonator to almost any circuit, you can
litterally set off a bomb and be on the other side of the world, just
use a pager or a mobile phone (if using a pager then cancel services
that you can get paged to you). Also if using a mobile phone, use one
of those pre-pay ones and don't give anyone the number, the last thing
you want is to get blown up because somebody wanted to tell you that
there's a party on somewhere. Always test the circuit before you use it
just incase there is a problem with it etc.
