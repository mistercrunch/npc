                Note: These views are my own. They in no way
                reflect the views of my parents, my friends,
                my relatives, my associates, or anyone else
                in my life.




So, here I sit. Seemingly hitting random keys, watching the insane chaos
of my fingers translate into words, phrases, order onscreen. What do they
say about monkeys banging away at typewriters? Something like, an infinate
number of monkeys at an infinate number of keyboards will one day produce
the entire writings of William Shakesphere? Whats the rejoinder to that?
Something like, Thanks to the internet, we now know this is not true?
But I'm getting off course. I'm here to explain exactly why Public School
is evil.

First off, I suppose I should explain a little about myself. Just enough
to explain why I might hold these views, and the reason for or against
my being taken seriously.

Right. I'm 16. Now, that might leave some with doubt as to whether they
should waste their valuble time reading this. Probably just some lazy
punk kid, trying to get out of his school work. For this, all I have to
say is that I do my school work, I enjoy it as much as possible, and if I
wanted to get out of school work, I wouldn't be writing this!

Now, a second cause for doubts regarding my ability to explain my views
without prejudice, is that I have homeschooled my whole life. You may be
asking yourself how a homeschooler, in paticular, one who has done so his
whole life, could know ANYTHING about public school. Let alone think he had
the knowledge and expirence nessacery to write against it!

An excellent point. And I'm afraid that the only answer I have, is that bits
and pieces over time have accumulated into, for me, a disturbing picture of
the public school system. This information has come into my grasp through
friends, books, radio, computer, internet, and newspaper. Whether this is
enough to dispel your doubts, or not, I at least ask you to read what I have
written and re-evaluate for yourself, the public school system.

      "We don't need to education
       We don't need no thought control"
              -Pink Floyd/Another Brick In The Wall Part II

Pink Flyod brings out a very important point. This point being that anyone
with the status of teacher, in a school system, is imparted with tremendous
power. The power to mold the minds of tommorows citizens.

This means, that a teacher can create a future terrorist, dictator, politician,
lawyer, or any number of people! Do you really want some one to have that much
power over you? Do you, should you be a parent, want someone else deciding what
your child will become? Someone telling you, or your child, how to think? How
to speak? How to act? How to view yourself and others?

And it's not just the teachers who have this power. Other children/youths have
the same power. And most of them couldn't care less about anyone but themselves.
Parents, is it fair to expose your children to this enviroment?

Fellow youths, do we want this? Do we want to spend our lives with dictators
examining our every move, our every action, waiting for us to slip up?

        "Yes I know my enemies, they're the teachers
         who taught me to fight me. Compromise,
         conformity, assimilation, submission, ignorance,
         hypocrisy, brutality, the elite."
              -Rage Against The Machine/Know Your Enemy

Rage sums up the situation pretty well. But, it's not only the
teachers who fit the above description. The other students also fit this.
The pecking order at school is sick. I've seen the end results of this.
Some of my friends have been driven to the verge of suicide. Some of my
associates are the kind of freaks who enjoy picking on smaller people. It
sickens me. And where is this attitude learnt? The Public School System.


Perhaps this file is more of a rant, brought about by the after effects of
a parents verbal attack of the preffered teaching method of a friends mother.
My friends mother homeschools her children. The other parent, and others,
claim that homeschool students are socially inept. Withdrawn.
Unable to compete with public school students.

Just the opposite. Home schoolers know how to address someone without putting
them down. We can hold just as radical views as anyone else. We know what is
happening around us. We are not afraid to speak our minds. And I scored above
average in my CAT 5 and Graduation tests. Except in math...but thats another
story...

I hope that I was at least able to make you sit back and think. I'm not arguing
against Public School. Instead, I'm showing the holes in the system. Areas that
need to be fixed. How we fix these holes, is a discussion in itself. But hopefully
you'll keep your eyes open, and be able to avoid the evils of Public School.

Peace out all!
