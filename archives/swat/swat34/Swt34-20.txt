Ten steps to pimpin' Goblinz:

1. Bribe him away from his Laptop by the use of toffee
2. Lure him into some dark and dingy room with promises of beutiful
   naked women with large breasts.
3. Unleash a horde of hard basdards to pin him to the ground and
   remove and items that could be used in a defensive manner (knife,
   grenade, obscurely shapped root vegetable).
4. Tie him up.
5. Go around the docks looking for Russian Sailors.
6. Lure Russian saliors back to the dingy room with promises of Vodka
7. Introduce the sailors to a gagged and stripped Goblinz
8. Leave the room while the sailors "introduce" themselves to Goblinz.
9. Have a drink or something else to waste time.
10. Re-enter the room and collect payment!
