1st of all this article is for your enjoyment not for actually doing.
i am sure you'll have lots of fun and enjoyment reading it

get a pencil case from Muji that japanese place that have stores
everywhere. Theyre aluminium + cylindrical in two halves about 2x as
long as your index finger. if u cant find a muji then get some kind of
tin thing wich fits together and come apart easily like the old tobacco
cans or whatever u can find
old gas cooker lighter sparky thing
wires and stuff
batteries 4 the sparker if u need them
stiff stainless steel wire or the most unreactive stuff uve got
24v
bowl or takeaway box (plastic)
bit of plastic from the lid of the box

get the wires and cut of the plasic in separators and put the wires
though them @ a distance smaller than the diameter of the tin like so:


   | width of tin |

     |         |    <- wires
     |         |
     ===========     <- plastic separators 
     |         |
     |         |
     |         |
     |         | 
     ===========
     |         |  


etc and make the wires bout 5 inches long
ok fill the bigger 1 with water and the curry box with water and put
the wires in and turn it upside down.
put 24v (dc) across the wires and go 2 sleep 4 about 3 hrs
heres a pic . its a x section (the wires are inside)

after 3 hrs or so it'll be full of hydrogen+oxygen

ok take the other half and drill a small hole in the end (just big
enough to put a peice of 1core wire through.
put a peice of single core wire through so it pokes though inside but
is about 1/2 cm in so that it could spark between the case and the wire
make it stay there with blu tack or something remove the tube from the
water UPWARDS and keep it facing upwards.
as soon as its clear of the water put your hand over the end to make
sure that no gas can escape/diffuse etc....
put the two halves together (it doesnt matter abuot any water still
on the tube) put wire int he opening so that it has good contact with
it either bury it 1/2 foot under or point it up like a rocket, stand
well back, conect the igniter and cover your ears.
it will either go bang v loudly or shoot up into the air or send
shrapnel everywhere (oh yeah be careful) or it wont work good luck and
i didnt tell you ANYTHING
