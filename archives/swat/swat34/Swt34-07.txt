Ok so this is an obvious scam, but why not have a little fun, this guys obviously
shelled out between 40 and 50 quid for a PO box for the stupid to send him cash to.

Not that i expect that he got much, so instead of letting him waste his money, i
decided to invest a around 50p. So a quick trip to the post office to collect 2
first class stamps. Taking them home i attatched them to one of the many padded
envelopes that i use to send out SWAT CD's (or use to until i got my hands on
special CD postage boxes). Anyway, after writing down the address on a lable
and fixing it nice and firmly to the envelope i lined this inside of the envelope
with plastic, well, i didn't want anything to leak out now did i :o). Actually
i didn't need to do that much lining since they are already pretty much lined.

Now it was time to load a "payload", since i didn't know of any decent road
kill lying around where i live, and i wasn't prepared to mow down a cat in a
stolen vehicle since i am quite fond of animals (sick ppl can get THAT idea
out of there head RIGHT NOW <lol> ). I deceided to quickly inspect my garden,
woohoo, dog shit (well it happens when you own a dog). So in it went (yes i
used gloves), might as well load it up a bit more nasty items, so in go a 
handful of maggots that where acquired.

So after it was nicely taped up it was sent to the above address :o) I hope
he enjoyed it.

Other nice things where a load of aluminium cans inside a padded envelope
with a second class stamp on, shame he had to pay the extra as well as a 
handling fee.

Also if everyone here bought a packate of 50 cheap envelopes and put a few
bits of scrap paper in them and labled it "FREE POST" i bet it would cost a
fortune (/me makes a note to buy 100 envelopes in the morning)

Well Enjoy!
