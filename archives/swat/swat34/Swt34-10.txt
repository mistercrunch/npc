Heres a cheap way to blind someone for a sec or two, hehe.

You will need:

Party Poppers (Bag of 20 costs something like 99p)
Very fine ground pepper (Almost like dust, buy in bulk)
A knife

Firstly, the inside of a Party Popper looks like this:

        /¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯|
««««««««|a   | b  |
        \____|____|

« - String
a - Muffler chamber
b - Paper shit chamber
| - Card layer

Get a knife and carefully lever the first card layer out, revealing
the stupid paper stuff that stupid people find funny. Take this stuff
out and burn it, hehe. You should be seeing a second layer of card.
This prevents a spark when you pull the string and keeps the paper in
place. Leave this on and get your pepper. Sprinkle in so it doest clump
together until chamber b is about half full. Place the card which you 
removed before and put back in (It should fit into a slot). Repeat for 
how many cannons you want. Now find a target, hehe. Pull the string,
aiming at their eyes and laugh as they cry like a little girl!

Thanx for reading, dont play near my bins.
