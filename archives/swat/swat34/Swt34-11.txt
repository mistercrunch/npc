Plus my trials and tribulations of doing it...


OK, This took me exactly 5 days to get workin, 4 days mainly to figure 
out why it didn't
work..., so in this article I will look at what I done and where I went 
wrong...

Oh yea, I got the disk on a Monday, got it workin on the following 
Friday.

-== Monday ==-

Ok, I first wanted my disks to looked like this, my ascii art is bad, 
so view in Courier
or Fixedsys....

...and so I wanted to use BootMagic as a boot menu to select between 
them. Seems fairly
straightforward, but isn't. I had just one (tiny) problem, that took me 
about 45mins to
find out... The Temporary files need a FAT16 partition to sit on. So, I 
then did this to
Drive2...

And so re ran the installer, which copied temporary files to Drive 2, 
which is D: in Win98,
using the command line E:\i386\winnt.exe /T:D  ( /T:D means 'STICK THEY 
TEMP FILES INTO
DRIVE D')

You have to make new boot floppies btw, coz the temp dir has changed 
from C: to D:. So it
looked promising, it copied temp files, it asked to reboot, it did, it 
loaded the installer
from the floppy disks, then BOOM! It read that it must have some FAT16 
space on The First Drive
to allow WindowsNT to boot! Bugger! 

-== Tuesday ==-

So I decided to Fire Up Partition Magic 5.0 and get it to resize my 
Drive C:. But the damned
thing needed to go into MS-DOS to resize the partition, and when it did 
it said:
ERROR 657: Some bollox about the reading of the drives taken in Windows 
don't match the ones
made by the BIOS. FECK!

I had come across some program called VComs System Commander on a PC 
Plus SuperCD, it was
only trial edition so I decided to rake the underground, and got meself 
a copy of,
VCommunications System Commander 2000, which I have previously 
reviewed.

After this was installed, I decided to use the built in parition 
manager which it boasted
was one of the best on the market(dunno what market its on about...). 
So I did so and 
resized me Drive1 to look like so:
             __________________________________________________
             |                                             |  |
Drive1(8GB): |             WINDOWS 98 (FAT32)              |  |<--50MB 
of FAT16
             |                                             |  |
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
BTW: Resizing 7GB of data took me 4hours, I left it over night on 
Tuesday.

Reran the installer, re copied the temp files after deleting them, 
which takes painstakenly
long, about 3 hours, and selected my Drive2 for installing WindowsNT, 
which worked! No error
messages, nothing! It installed! It rebooted, I selected 'WindowsNT' 
from a newly created
Boot Menu Item in System Commander, and................nothing.

Nothing, Just a:

_

A flashing underscore. I even left it for 40mins and it did nothing. 

-== Wednesday ==-

After 8hours of swearing in my sleep, I decided to go onto 
comp.windowsnt.installing 
(I think thats it, just search for windowsnt and look for installing in 
the name), and 
posted a message blaring my cries for help. 

-== Thursday ==-

Next morning I got a rather nice reply, the type I was waiting for. I 
didn't save it (damn) 
but it did say that the WindowsNT Boot partition needed to be WITHIN 
2GB of the start of 
DRIVE1. If it had said that at the start, I would have had WindowsNT 
running 4 days earlier!
So I again fired up Parition thing in System Commander and did the 
following:

1. Select the minute FAT16 Partition
2. Delete it(!)
3. Move the FAT32 partition with displacement 50MB
4. Reboot.

This took all day to do, and plus I wasn't arsed to be on the computer 
all day.

-== Friday ==-

Re-Ran the installer, again with E:\i386\winnt.exe /T:D and it copied 
the files, rebooted
etc, I forgot to create a partition at the start of DRIVE1, so I did so 
from within the
WindowsNT Installer, and selected DRIVE2 and continued. It installed OK 
Just like last time,
and this time it was everything crossed(everything!) at the boot 
menu... then a GUI Booted!
WWWWWWWWWWWWW000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!

SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!

It needed a damned OEM Code, trust it, eh? I raked about the 
Underground again, and found:
09496-OEM-0009552-77303.
I rebooted, and the GUI came up again, I entered the code, and it 
WORKED! THE DAMNED SYSTEM
FINALLY BOOTED!!! And so did Windows98. Not at the same time of 
course...

Ok, so thats my story of 5 days of hell. Now to prevent that for you. A 
step by step
tutorial on how to get WinNT to dual boot beside a FAT32 parition.

1. Prepare disks. Make sure you have at least 1MB of free space at the 
start of your first
drive. Resize and move your FAT32 Partition like I did, use something 
like System Commander
or, if]ÛÜšÜË\š][ÛˆXYÚXËˆ[ÛÈ]™H]X\Ý 120MB FAT16 space 
somewhere for the
temporary files, and at least 130MB further for WindowsNT itself.

2. Run the installer, make the boot floppies and reboot with the 
floppies. At the partition
bit, make a partition by selecting the EMPTY bit on DISK1, and pressing 
'C'. Press Enter at
the next screen, and then select the big FAT16 parition, and press 
ENTER. Press ENTER to
format the small parition. It should then install the files and opt to 
reboot.

3. In the GUI, follow instructions and enter the OEM code. Use the one 
above if you don't
have one handy.

4. Install Service Pack 6a

5. Install Hardware drivers, hex editors, Winamp, mIRC, Napster and 
anything else you may
find useful.

6. Enjoy long uptimes, less crashes and a faster system. For a while.


See ya around,
