APARATUS

ice cream box
a big glass jar
soap
petrol
polystyrene
paper
straw
black powder (or use one of those fireworks that ejects stuff upwards)
fuse (sparkler or line of match stick heads glued 2 string will do)
dog shit

METHOD

Mix the petrol polystyrene and soap it should become like dough then put
it in the jar and place the paper on top. Now use a drill or sumthin to
make a hole the size of a McDonalds straw in the side of the glass jar
and push a straw through the hole and into the jar. Push the fuse through
it into the section of the jar not filled.Insert the firework or black
powder into the jar and if using a firework connect the two fuses now
put the lid on the jar and turn it upside down in the ice cream tub.
make a hole in the tub and push the straw through it.Use glue to make
sure nothing gets out of the jar from the hole made in it and then using
gloves or a plastic bag pick the shit up and fill the ice cream tub three
quarters of the way up. Fill the rest with water and mix to form a really
sick slimy concuction. Then tape the lid firmly on light the fuse and
leg it!!!

IDEAS

* Push through someones cat flap.You can guarentee theyll have to do
some redecorating!

* Leave on someones doorstep or in their car

Try to do these when there on holiday then the whole house will stink
and it will be impossible to get the stains out of the car seats.

Try and experiment with the stuff you put in it jam is pretty cool when
they get back from holiday itll have gone mouldy!
