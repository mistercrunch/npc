Heh, i can't sleep, i'm fucked if my insomnia has returned, mind you i
don't really give a flying fuck if it was, i mean its the summer and
i'm not back in College until sometime in September.
Personally i wouldn't mind but i gotta be out of bed at 10am so that i
can go into town with my girlfriend.

Well life is just peachy i guess, wasting my existence on IRC and
DCC'ing the latest "updates" to Phreakazoid so that he can compile them
in the mag that you are reading now.

Man, so much has happened lately, well both with me personally and
within the underground community that i see on a day to day basis,
personal shit, well, your not gonna get to know about that :-p it's
nothing bad so you lot who would laugh at me for comming to some
demise can sit and sulk, in fact, just to piss you lot off i'll let you
all know that life has been extremely good for me and it doesn't look
like changing any time soon.

Underground shit, well theres the domain name, that ain't quite
underground, but its part of the site, basically some cunt redirected
it to the DoC in the states, i have the IP of the person who did it
<muhahahahahaha> and if i ever get it tracked down to the bod who did
it then they can expect a parcel bomb.

Also check out www.krib.net and sign up for 5mb of free space, yeah it
ain't a load but you don't need a lot of space to create a cool site,
face it, most people are bought off by "unlimited free space" or "50mb
of free space", face facts, if you are getting a load of space then
the server will either full our pages with adverts of the service
will be slow as fuck due to warez being stored on the servers.
swateam.org only takes up about 7mb of space, and thats only because of
the sound files, i mean lets face it, u can always sign up for an
account on www.theglobe.com and bung your heavy duty shit on there
and leech it from your www.krib.net account.

So yeah. ok i'm tired, well kinda, i'm gonna leave my box on overnight
leeching a couple of addons from a warez site then i'll shut it down
sometime tomorrow (or atleast the next few days). anyway i'm sure that
this article has made of no interesting reading, but i don't give a
fuck because i only wrote it because i couldn't sleep.
