Ok, before we start this months news, I just wanna say that next month
there will be no news from me, as I will be abroad, and I'll be back
in the UK on the 27th August, so it won't give me enough time to put together
anything.

Don't forget to visit us on IRC......
irc.destructor.net (6667) #CocytusUK - Official Room of SWAT and AWOL
if irc.destructor.net doesn't work, then try irc.darker.net as they are
the same server.

CocytusUK News will bring you the latest news from the world
of the Underground, including news about SWAT, AWOL and
other goings on that we think it's worth you knowing about...
Anyways, on with the news.

OK people, here you have it! As promised the Official SWAT Theme has now been released
and can be downloaded from:

http://www.awol4life.org.uk/swat/
http://www.awol4life.org.uk          <--- The Files Section

The theme is done in true SWAT style and made by AWOL's own Narayan, so a big shout out
to that crazy mutha-fucka who worked well on this theme, and he's also working on The
Official SWAT Desktop Theme (v2.0) and also the Official AWOL Desktop Theme (v1.0)
The SWAT Desktop Theme (v1.0) comes as a self-extracting zip file and full instructions
and is approximately 2.6mb.
He's made a BETA AWOL Wallpaper and it looks fucking sweet so far, so lets see how it
develops...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This month, we discovered that swateam.org had been hijacked, due to a security flaw
from the people who the domain was aquired off.
At this moment intime we are unsure as to exactly how this happened, or as to who has
done it.
We have had no luck so far gaining access to it and if anyone has any information then
please contact us here at SWAT.
At the moment the SWAT site can be accessed from:

swateam.hypermart.net
and all of the SWAT issues can be d/l'ded from
www.awol4life.org.uk/swat

We hope to have the domain up soon, so watch this space for more info....

As DNS-CON draws closer, we here at SWAT collect together various explosives and
weapons, for a nice day or two of AS-BASHING!
Anti-Social are running a "Hack the Flag" competition as far as we know so it will
be interesting to see what goes down at DNS-CON this year.
We reckon it will be a laugh and don't blame us if we leave covered in blood (j/k)
Nah, we've spoken to some of the A-S crew about it, and they were actually kinda
pleasant, but we failed to meet the Ferret-Fucking Geddon (no offence intended of
course) teehee.
Anyway, so when DNS-CON finally comes, we'll keep you posted on what goes down and
include every gory detail :)
So if any of the UK readers are going up to DNS-CON then e-mail us and u never know
we might see you there.

www.krib.net

Yes ladies and gentlemen, a web-hosting company brought to you by the one and only
F_S (-=The Firestarter=-).
It offers 5mb webspace and great speed.
So Check it out and tell us what you think.
www.krib.net
This site had actually been up for ages but F_S apparantly "forgot" about it until
recently me and him were gonna start something up, under the name krib.net and he
realised he already had it done
so he revamped it and is doing that now :)
So check it out and sign up for some free web-space, you never know when ya might
need it :Þ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes people, I am going legal, well, one half of my life is :)
I've started up a business with a friend and previous SWAT member, many of you may
know as deimos.
I won't be revealing the company name and other details yet, but let me jsut say that
our prices are LOW and we do everything from parts, upgrades, local house calls
and full systems all at low low prices.
Stay tuned for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, as I said, there will be nothing from me for SWAT or anything else for that matter
next month as I am off abroad for the month and will be back around the 27th August
and seeing how things are doing.
Rest assured, that where I'm going, the law isn't, how can I put this, "as strict" so
to speak, so I should be smuggling a nice set of knucle-dusters and flick-knifes and
stuff into the country not only for myself, but for numerous people who have asked me
and sommat for F_S and Brakis too...
So, even though I know you won't miss me, I thought I'd tell ya anyways, I won't have
access to a computer there, so I doubt I'll be seeing any of the #CocytusUK regulars
but you never know, I might just find one with internet access so I may be checkin
up and spying on people :)
That's enough of my rantin' and ravin' so this is the last any of you lot will be
hearing from me for about 2months...
