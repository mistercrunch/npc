Those of you who are on Vodafone PAYT will know that to get how much
money you have left, you need to dial 1345 (there are other ways on the
digital service, but the bug doesnt apply to these). When you dial up,
the automated woman asks you to type in your mobile phone number. Now
Vodafone don't know which phone you are calling from (otherwise you
wouldnt have to enter the number in in the first place), so you can type
in any Vodafone number you want, and the current balance for that number
is shown.
This would be useful in social engineering ie. it would be much more
convincing if you could quote the persons balance to the operator or
something, use your imagination.

An offshoot of this is that when you phone up the Vodafone helpline
(191), the operator asks you for your phone number (presumably so they
can check your details), and again, this suggests that the people at
vodafone don't already know your current vodafone number - you could say
any number you like - and Bullsh.. ahem.. Social Engineer whatever
information you like from that person eg.

Operator: Hello, Bob Speaking may I take your number please?
You:      Yes, its {number of person}
Operator: Thank you, now how can I help you? (Ever so kind these people)
You:      I've just moved house and I wanted to update the registration
          details - They should be {Random name/address here}.
Operator: No - I'm sorry, the details shown here are {Victims address}
You:      Oh - Right! I must have already changed them! Thank you very
          much.
Operator: Goodbye, and have a nice Day!
You:      Bye!!

Or something like that - you may need to press a little for the
information, but as long as you come up with a good excusee, the
operators will probably give you anything - in this case an address for
your victim which could be used in other cases.
Sometimes they ask you for your secret password, but 9 times out of 10
the operators forgot to ask me, and for that 1 time out of 10, just say
anything and act like some hacker has messed your phone up (including
the password... :) )

I don't know if this works for networks (I only have vodafone), but
on cellnet 'U', cellnet have no record of when you last
topped up - so in theory, you don't have to top up with in the time
limits they set (90 days or something) - except that the prices are so
outrageous, that you need to top up every week or so anyway! On cellnet
Pre-Pay phones, the balance is stored on the phone itself, so the trick
with vodafone balances won't work.
