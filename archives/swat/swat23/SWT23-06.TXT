For those of you who don't know, several members of the Allience
(the allience being: SWAT, APT, UP and several others) decided to arse
around in #as-mag on the 20th and 21st of this month. Only when one
of us happened to get ops (due to the stupid nature of Geddons army of
pixies, who assume all people with the nick name Geddon are infact the
real Geddon himself). So here are the logs of FerretBoy:
