Here is just a couple of Linux related tricks, commands and general
stuff that linux users might find useful:


Commands
--------

grep
----

grep is the KING of linux commands.  Learn to live by it.  In its 
default mode, it excludes everything from its input pipe that doesnt
match the search criteria.

<sum program> | grep <search criteria>

example:

pgpk -l | grep @

will give me a list of email addresses on my PGP5i (www.pgpi.com 
getitNOW) keyring, along with their public key information.  If I 
wanted to check whether I had a gates@microshaft.com on my keyring,
I'd issue a:

pgpk -l | grep gates@microshaft.com

If nothing was printed, then I dont.  If however, I do have his key, 
then I'll receive a line along the lines of:

PUB KEY ID <893498394> gates@microshaft.com

I dont have linux up at the moment so this is a guess of the real 
output, but you get the idea.  Grep is particually usefull when I want
 to view extended info on a directory.  If I used 

#ls -l root 
I'd get the contents of my root directory (if logged in as root)

however, I dont want that, I want to view the file permissions of the
directory itself.  
What do I do?  I use grep:

#ls -l | grep root

bingo, extended information on the root directory.  Nice.
grep has many other options and usages, just info or man grep for more.
One particually useful option is grep -v, which includes everything 
that doesnt match the search criteria.  
Ie:

<que cheesy senario> Crap!  A disaster has occured! While experimenting
with perl scripts, I have managed to flood my home directory with 
10000 1 kb files starting with 'frog'! (dont ask me what I was doing).
However, one file called frog776 I want.  How do I delete every frog
but frog776?  Yup, you guessed it, with grep.  I simply issue a:

#ls | grep -v frog776 | rm -f

viola.  I should be left with only 'frog776' in my directory
</que>

Hopefully you now apprichate the power of grep.  An interesting
development is the ongoing work at www.packetfactory.net (admined by 
route of phrack) to develop grep's cousin, ngrep.
ngrep is a network version of grep which allows you to filter packets 
in the same way as you would files with grep, allowing you to ignore 
those nastily fragmented DOS TCP packets for example, or filter through
a sniffer log file looking for interesting packets.

whatis and whereis
------------------

whatis <program>
whereis <program>

These little proggies are well useful for the beginning linux sysadmin
swamped over by incidious unpronouncable commands.
whatis gives you a one line description of the program you give it, if
its in its database.  whereis tells you where a command on your path
(one that you can execute without being in the present working 
directory) is.
ie:

# whatis ls

ls [1] - Prints a list of files in the current working directory

# whereis ls

/bin/ls

Even better is the fact that you can issue a whatis *.  Ie:

# cd /bin
# whatis *


ls [1] - Prints a list of files in the current working directory
rm [1] - Removes a file or directory
...
etc


Useful for finding a command to do something without having to sift
through stacks of man pages.

Ok, thats enough commands for now.. if you're still stuck or need more 
assistance on command for linux, get Linux in a Nutshell by O'Reilley
publishing (www.ora.com).  It gives you a complete list of the standard
commands with verbose descriptions.



X Windows & FVWM2
-----------------

X Windows.. aah.  The truely configurable GUI for linux.  Or it is if 
you know how to configure it.  First let me explain a few things.
X Windows runs on a server/client basis.  You run the x server specific
to your graphics card and you connect to it when you run startx.  
X windows was designed for network computing, so you can run multiple 
x clients connecting to the same server. A Window Manager is an 
application for X windows which controls the size, height, colour, 
position etc, of the windows that you run.  This is the 'configuarable'
part of X windows, unless you are into TCL/TK and applications 
programming.

Today I am going to discuss configuaration of a particular window 
manager called FVWM2 - F? Virtual Windowing Manager 2.  No one knows 
what the F standed for, or stands for, but the acroymn has stuck.
OK, enough smalltalk.  To install FVWM2, you'll need to remove the 
existing window manager that came with your distribution.  Usually if
you select to install X, the distro script will install a window 
manager for you, with a 'nice' configuration.  RH5.2 for example, by 
default installs a really crap window manager 'manager' called 
AnotherLevel.  Stay clear, remove and install the latest version of
FVWM2 is what I always do.

Anyway, now I am assuming that you have installed FVWM2 and you have a 
nice clean install.  If you go into /etc/X11/FVWM2 directory, then you
should see the worldwide configuartion file for FVWM2, called 
'system.fvwm2rc', Any changes you make to this file will effect all 
users on the system.  If you delete this file, fvwm2 will panic, and 
wont let you run anything until you a) reinstall fvwm2 or b) rebuild 
system.fvwm2rc from scratch.  Neither are particually pleasent things
to do, so leave the file alone.
To configure fvwm2, you'll need to copy the system file to your home 
directory to .fvwm2rc or .fvwm2rc95 depending on your version.

I havent got time to explain the config file in its entirity - there 
are web sites devoted to that, all I will do in this limited space is 
to show you a few neat tricks you can use to set up your fonts.

First, find this section in your config file:

#
# Fonts - one for window titles, another for icons, and another for the menus
#
WindowFont      -bitstream-charter-bold-r-normal--16-80-0-0-*-0-iso8859-1
IconFont	fixed
#MenuFont   	-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*

These fonts are standard X fonts.  You need to find a program call 
xfontsel. On my box its in the /usr/X11R6/bin/ directory, but it will 
vary.
Once found, run it under X and it will present you with a number of 
drop down combo boxes with a lot of options.  Tweak these combo boxes 
and the displayed text will change shape, width, height, boldness etc. 
Once you are satisfied with your selection, select copy font, and copy
it into your .fvwm2rc file, which should be ideally loaded in an editor
on an xterm.
Reboot fvwm2 and viola, your fonts will have changed.  Keep fidling 
until you are satisfied.  You can download other fonts from various 
websites if you want to customise your fonts even more.

This is just a taster of what you can do with fvwm2.  The fvwm2rc file
is well documented and, as long as you dont touch system.fvwm2rc, 
messing around with it will not hurt your system.  So, go ahead, play 
around and see what you can do with your x windows.

Quickly before I move off the subject of fvwm2 - setting a backdrop.  
You can do this by running display on startup.  There is a function 
that runs programs on startup, find that function in your rc file, add
an entry saying:

display -size 1280x1024 -window root <picture path>

The size is variable to the picture obviously, play around with it.


Linux Resources
---------------

There are a number of good linux resources on the 'net, as you'd 
expect, Linux being one of the most popular network operaing systems
around.  Here are just a list of a few I've found while browsing:

www.zillennium.com - Linux distribution site, 2 pounds per CD.
www.polo.demon.co.uk - Cheapbytes, another UK based cheap Linux 
distributer.

www.linux-HOWTO.com
www.linuxlinks.com
http://linuxpower.org
www.linuxstart.com - Good site for newbies.

www.users.dircon.co.uk/~trix/Raven/ - Cool guide to building your very
own linux box from scratch.
www.magma.ca/~bklimas/ - Linux Newbie System Administrators Guide.. 
    coolio
www.cygnus.com - Free GCC win32 IDE
howto.linuxberg.com/LinuxGuide/index.html - Good newbie guide.
www.x.org - The main X
www.x11.org - Windows Sites
www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.framed.html - Lee's X Links - 700 X 
    links related to programming X mostly, but still worth a look.
http://fvwm.math.uh.edu/ - The FVWM Home Page.
 
Also, a new magazine has just come out from Future Publishing (PC 
Format/FHM people) on Linux.. its called Linux Answers or something.  
Anyway, after having looked through the first edition I would highly
reccomend  it for anyone considering venturing into Linux or any 
Linux newbie.

I hope you have found this article informative.  Ultimatly the best 
way to learn more about Linux is to play around and read man pages and
online tutorials.  If you need any more help with Linux, email me and
I'll see what I can do.
