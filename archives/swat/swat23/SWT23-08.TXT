To get ammonia nitrate buy an Ice Pack or Cold Pack from the chemists or pharmacy. On the ice 
pack there should be two layers the inside layer is the water and outer layer is ammonia nitrate 
All you have to do is simply cut it off. If you are goin to store it for later keep it in an 
air tight space as it will take in water from the air. 
Now soak the newspapers in ammonia nitrate and leave it out in the sun to dry unless u live in 
the UK. Once it,s bone dry roll it up in the toilet roll. So it like the diagram below.

Now just light the newspaper and it should let a load of thick smoke out. Now i recommend you 
start with only one newspaper so you know at how much you want
