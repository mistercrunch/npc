Ok despite the title of the article the news might not be all that
interesting, i just needed a title for this article which will 
basically be a collection of information about the group, the mag and 
the web site in general.
So anyway here it is:

(1) SWAT Magazine file names change! 

Oh My God, nearly two years now you've all had the mag files as 
SWAT<*>-?.txt which basically had the issue number, and the article 
number.
So why the sudden change? well this month i got a new monitor to 
replace my old one that blew up, then my hard drive fucks up, i get a 
small 545mb one, windows doesn't install and it is generally crap, i 
grabbed a copy Mandrake Linux 6 that Netw0rk Bug had generously 
supplied me, i slapped that on, then the change happened, Microshits 
operating system had been blue screening on me for years, i couldn't 
hack shit with it and it was slow as fuck even on a p233). So I've 
decided to stick with Linux. Anyway what the hell has that pointless 
story all about? well long file names don't seem to wash well with 
Linux (they are basically SWAT23~1.txt and shit like that), so I've 
simply changed them to SWT23-01.txt for the time being, ok so perhaps
it's because i haven't used Linux as much as i should. But that 
explains the shorter file names.

(2) Web site update!

Some of you will have noticed it, this month we brought back the web
board as well as the long awaited Free For All links page, fell free 
to add your link to it, all we ask is that you link back to 
www.swateam.org it's not required, but since we are allowing you to 
link from us for nothing, it's only fair.

(3) Group closing it's doors! 

Sorry to dissapoint a lot of you, but the SWATeam now has full member
capacity, our trial member lists contain a lot of budding recruits 
whom we are looking at getting into the group, we will take on about 4 
or 5 of these trial members, then that will be it, no more trial 
members until one of them drops out, sorry to disappoint you all guys, 
but requests to join the group will be ignored.

(4) File Library

I know that I've been promising you for months now about the files
library, once it contained no less that 300 files and utilities, then
we got shutdown and lost all of them, they are still around (Unknown
Guest has them on CD somewhere) but they haven't been uploaded 
anywhere. We simply don't have much web space on the Webjump account 
(yeah it's a shit company, NEVER use it, it's slow, goes down all the 
time and puts a crappy frame at the top of your documents). We may 
soon be uploading the files to another server, when this happens we 
will link to them, until that happens will the select few of you script
kiddies quit  bitching about it.

(5) New web site section!

In the near future I'm hoping to upload a new section to the web site,
this will be more of a text library for those of you who like to read.
It'll include as many text files as i can upload, covering hacking,
phreaking, anarchy and a range of other cool subjects that you all 
love. Until i find time to get it all sorted out, please don't e-mail 
me about it, it will happen sooner or later.

(6) The Allience grows stronger

Many of you out there will not know very much about the allience, well 
i'll explain a little about it, it consists of several UK groups and 
underground magazines, these are SWAT, About Phreakin' time and The 
Underground Periodical. The members of these groups, as well as the 
groups affiliated with them are considered to be members since the aim
of the allience is to make us all stronger. Groups within the allience 
are now: SWAT, APT, UP, ERH, Krash and AWOL (ok so Krash release APT 
magazine, but that ain't the point).
