I know this has been covered by SWATeam magazine before but I thought 
it would be good to tell everyone how to do it. As a member of the 
A-team I hear lot about programs that can be used for "remote 
administration", these are programs that can be used to perform/execute
actions on another computer. These actions can range from making a text
box appear to formatting the hard disk. This is ideal as if you, like 
us are still in education then you can use these programs to find out 
your network administrators password. How can I do this you may be 
asking, well firstly you'll need a network which you are planning to 
administrate over, a remote administration program (many are 
available), a client program (for your remote administration program) 
and IP address's or machine names of what you are going to hack.

 The network

The network which you are going to hack over should preferable be 
connected to the Internet, but this is not necessarily required.

 A remote administration program

There are two main remote administration programs available:

Back orifice

A good program and I think the first one.  It has a slightly over the 
top as it has a background that changes colors, this is annoying for 
when you are trying to hack in your school or college as teachers soon
notice none school based work.  It has many features such as being able
to remotely play sound, make text boxes appear and "spawning programs"
(opening programs remotely).


Netbus

This program is god as it has a discreet interface, it can perform 
advanced tasks such as opening CD-ROMs , controlling the mouse and 
copying files from he other computers hard disk.  At our place of 
education however we (the a-team) we have had problems with the client
program which unlike back orifice has to be run every time the computer
is booted (it is not like this on many computers but this applies to 
our education establishment),

 Client program 

This is the program that has to be installed on the computer you are 
going to hack, this program is what allows the machine to be remotely 
administered.

 IP address's

These are numbers that are given to each computer that is connected to 
the Internet, you can find out a machines IP (Internet protocol) by 
using a program called Internet maniac, you run this on the machine you
are going to hack and you are given the IP address. The IP address is 
typed into the remote administration.

Once you have all of the above you will be able to hack some body else 
machine.  Firstly install the client software onto the machine you want
to hack, then use Internet maniac to fin out the machines IP number 
write this down as you need, then go to another machine on the network
and load up the remote administration program.  Enter the IP address 
into the program and wait until the program tells you that you are 
connected to that machine.  You can now do anything you want with that 
machine.  

Have phun!!!
