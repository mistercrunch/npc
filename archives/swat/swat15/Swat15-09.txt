This article was destined for last months issue, but I just wanted to
test my theory that "if a PBX get's used to call all over the world
then it dies very soon", before I published this. Well I was right to
an extent.

All the time on newsgroups I see people saying "How do I get free calls"
and everytime they get flamed, and people insist that's all people want
nowadays and there not interested in learning about phreaking, but
personally I couldn't care less, so what if all they want is free calls
to anywhere in the world, ok I know quite a bit about phreaking but I
mainly used what I have learned to call all over the world. Ok just
imagine that you need to call somewhere really badly, but you don't
want another £50 on your phone bill (while I never pay for calls like
that, somebody out there might) or you may just want a free internet
connection for a while. I'm about to describe a very simple flaw in
the Meridian Mail systems (I've heard that it affects 1 in 10 systems).
Ok if we assume that most direct dial systems have an outdial then
there's a place you could start, but I'm not going into that one as I
have already covered it in a previous issue. But what about those
systems that aren't direct? to hack out a box on each one that you
find would take ages, and the chances of it having an outdial are
pretty slim. So if you have a list of say 30 systems that aren't direct
dial, more like an answering machine for the company, then we can start
by checking them for this little exploit.
First off you dial into the system, it will pick up and start to play
the pre-recorded message. Now simply hit 09 <number you want> #
if your lucky then it will connect you for free.
* For UK systems always try an 0800 number, if a UK system has an out
dial then you can use it to call anywhere in the world. If the system
is a US one, try any number you can think of, if you get any message
other than "That number cannot be reached from this service" then your
in luck.
I tend to go for UK systems since there outdials can call anywhere in
the world, the downside to this is that if you call from your house
you will almost certianly get busted if you make very long calls to
far flung places, but in my experience, occationaly using it to
dial into your ISP is ok, (well ok I would probably get busted, 
hell I could make a small firm go bust in one night). US systems 
are of equal importance though, a free and anonymous internet 
connection is vital to all of those hackers, carders, warez traders, 
etc in the UK. US out dials (most of which are only local or 1800 
outdials, I have never seen a US outdial that has given me 
international calls) will always last longer, they seem to last 
from between 1 and 6 months (for me), that's based on being 
online for between 4 and 6 hours a day. UK outdials will usualy 
only last for a month or so (depends how often the company
get's billed), that's based on phone calls to Canada lasting 4 hours.
Although Brakis did find an interesting way to get international calls
via a US local outdial, he would simply call AT&T and tell them to
place the call for him.
So now it's time to scan for your meridian mail systems, do this any
way that you want.
Well have fun and don't get caught.
That little exploit again is: 09 <number you want> #
Yep a large article for such a small exploit, but I got board and
decided to write a load of stuff that might have some relevence.
