Remember the Mardi Gras bombers? a year or so ago these guys where
sending bombs to Barclays bank and Tesco supermarkets, for whatever
reason. That was before they got caught. Ok I didn't follow the story
too closely. I was more interested in how those things where made
rather than the reasons behind the bombings. Ok maybe I should correct
that, they wheren't bombs, the devices didn't explode nor did they
burn (so there not incendries). The devices where infact simple
mechanical devices that set off ammunition, usualy rifle or shotgun
rounds, although I seem to think that one or two of the deivces where
designed to explode, but that's irrelevent. So imagain a device that
blasted off a shotgun cartridge when you opened it or it was set off
by means of a timer, hell if somebody blasts you with a shotgun at
about 10 meters it will cut you in half, imagine if a cartrige where to
be set off less than a meter? there's no barrel to direct it, so it's
entirly likely that you'd get 180 degree spred from it. And who say's
that the cartridge has to contain normal lead shot? I have (in the past)
seen them loaded with all sorts of projectiles, and then set off by
devious means (I'm telling you, if you compare the damage of lead shot
to what other forms of "shot" does, you'd see just how nasty they
can be). Ok so what is going to be needed for these nasty little
devices?

1 Video case
1 Spring loaded bolt lock
10cm of Nylon string (the real strong shit)
35mm film case
box of matches (large)
any form of ignition
1 battery (for ignition system, if electrical)
1 Shotgun cartrige
Epoxy resin (go for the 24hr stuff)
Small plastic bag
Tape
Blue tak

1) First off take your video case, open it up and examine it, take it's
   verious messurments. You will need to punch a hole just small
   enough for the string to fit through, punch the hole on the top of
   the case (the bit that's 12cm x 3cm) around the center. Now thread
   the string half way through. Tie a knot in it and try and pull it
   back, don't yank it really hard because we haven't finished with it
   yet. 

2) Next, mix up a batch of epoxy resin (remember it's the 24hr stuff
   so we don't need to rush this). Once you've got it mixed really
   well, paste some of it over the knot which should be poking just
   through the hole (on the outside, the rest of the string should be
   in the case).

3) Take the spring loaded bolt lock, make sure that it's got a large
   metal base, also make sure that it's not covered in any form of
   paint, 'cause if it breaks loose when you building this, you will
   die. Pull out the bolt and measure how long it is, also take a note
   as too the strengh, it doesn't take much to set a cartrige off, but
   if it's too weak it will do fuck all. I can't really remember what
   the poundage is needed to set off a percussion pin, something
   similar to that of a cap gun (if that's of any help). Now let's
   assume that it's fairly strong if you pull it back about 3cm.

4) Measure 5cm from the top of the video case (where the string is)
   and place the bolt farly centeral. Now tie the string around the
   bolt so that it can be pulled back (I mean, pull the bolt back and
   tie the string to it). Use epoxy resin to secure this, make sure
   that 2cm of the string is epoxy free. Now once it's all set you
   should be able to place the bolt in it's predefined position (i.e
   the center of the case) and the bolt should be held to it's limit
   by the string with no slack. Now here's where you have a few choices
   you can either epoxy it directly to the video case, or apply epoxy
   to it and use small screws to hold it in place while it dries.
   Note: You can epoxy it too the case before you tie the string too
   it, that's what I'd recommend anyway.

5) While that's setting, take your 35mm film canister and cut the back
   center piece out of it (it should be the small indentation on the
   bottom). Before I go any further, has anybody noticed that the film
   canister is 35mm and the video case is 30mm? this is a simple problem
   over come by cutting 1cm from the film canister (as in, cut the side
   off it) What you should have now is a small trough shapped canister
   that will fit into the video case, allowing you to close the lid.
   Take care in positioning it in the video case. The part that you cut
   out (on the bottom) should fit where the bolt will be once the string
   is cut. I.e the bolt will shot through the hole, if it won't, then
   cut a bit more plastic off.

6) Now get your blue tak and your shotgun cartridge, use the blue tak
   to prop the cartridge up so that the percussion pin is against the
   part you cut out of the center of the film canister. To put it one
   way, make sure that the bolt will hit the cartridge once it shoots
   forward. Now you'll want to epoxy the film canister into postion.
   DON'T add the shotgun cartridge yet, if anything goes wrong, you
   don't want it to blow a hole in your wall (or wherever you build
   your tools of destruction).

7) After a while you should have a bolt and a film canister epoxied in
   position inside the film case, you should also be able to close the
   lid. It should look similar to this:
  

  _______________________________________
 |      _________      _______          |
 |     ___       |_    |      |         |
 |-1-x|_2_|==3=== _    |4     |         |
 |      _________|     |______|         |
 |______________________________________|

Key: 1= String
     2= The bolt where the sring is tied
     3= The bolt that will shoot forward
     4= The film canister
(Obviously that is not to scale)

8) Now we will get the small plastic bag, cut off all of the match
   heads and place them inside the small plastic bag. Place the bag
   either so that the string is running through it, or the string is
   running directly over the bag.

9) Get your little device's ignition system, this can either be a
   simple switch, or a timer. I'm not going to describe how to make
   those little bulb igniters because I'm sick to death of it. If you
   really don't know how, then read the last issues of SWAT Magazine
   and make a huge batch of them. You should now have your igniter
   going into the bag of matches. If you where to now set off the
   igniter then it should ignite the matches, thus burning the string
   and sending the bolt forward. (I guess you now know how this works)

10) Now you device is all but compleate, how you fix the cartridge into
    position is up to you, Epoxy is the best bet, since it will hold
    it well with little or no chance of it comming loose. Once the
    cartridge is in position your device is compleat. You now have
    another piece of terrorist hardware, all you need to do now is
    to scan a black and white picture from resoviour dogs and write
    "Welcome to the madi gras experience" on it (BTW that was a joke)
    
11) So just to re-cap, when the device's timmer/ignition system goes
    off, the matches will burn the string. Once the string has burnt
    away the bolt will shoot forward and set off the cartridge. That
    should blow the front end of the video case away, along with any
    body else that's unfortunate enough to be there.

I'm in no way encouraging you to go out and bomb your local supermarket
or local bank. I'm mearly demonstrating how such devices can be built.
And another thing: I am not in anyway linked to the mardi gras bombers.
