Hi all, here follows an article on cloning digi fones which you might 
like. Those of you familiar with SMS on mobile fones should be 
competent enough to pull this off. I'll take you through it step by 
step.
First you need a GSM1800 fone which is connected to the Orange network.
Best one to get is a second hand JustTalk. Second of all you will need 
an Orange contract fone which you wish to clone. Hang around airports
or hotels and your bound to find some.
Once you have a fone which you know is of the GSM1800 type, you can get
started. Firstly get the fone number for the fone, which is usually in
a menu somewhere, and write it down. mThen call 150 from the fone and 
order a new service like LineTwo. Then you keep the fone turned on and 
between 30min. to an hour later you should recieve a text message on 
it. Read it, then go to the menu option to send it. When that menu 
arrives then select it and enter the number of *YOUR* fone. Send the 
message and a few seconds later you should recieve the same message on 
*YOUR* fone. Read it, delete it, then turn your fone off and on again. 
Hey presto, when you look inthe "My number" menu you'll find your 
number has changed to the one of the other fone. You can now use the 
other fones account to your will. If you "borrowed" it, then make sure 
to return it or you wont have long before it gets dis-connected.
Simple and effective....well sort of, you need to wangle past the op at
Orange in order to get the order through. And you need to come by an 
Orange fone. If you could get an e-mail to SMS gateway then you could 
send all of the SIM Updates (the messages you recieve) to that and 
start a file up. This would make it better because you could make a 
program to generate SIM Updates and just plug in the services you want 
to have.....................................................
