What is documented here is the result of a group of four phreaks 
fucking about with  mates fone line. The techniques enclosed are not 
only accessible to the 'leet, anyone can use them. Basically, this is 
how we got Brakis a phree, untracable fone line.
Brakis *used* to be with BT but hated them so much that he moved to a 
competitor (No names mentioned) Naturally when he switched BT came and 
took his fone line off. I might mention of course that he did have two 
BT lines, and now has one (legit) BT line which is a business line. 
Well when we started off we were on the jolly side of drunk and had the
idea of Beiging Brakis' old line. ODC had the great idea of checking 
the line length using 17070. He did this from my Orange Mot. c520 
(I have a 17070 dialup, I aint making it public, mail me if you want 
it) The test came back and the line length was 2.4km. This was odd 
because the distance from Brakis' house to the local BT Xchange was 
about 2.4km!!! So ODC reckoned that the line was terminated INSIDE 
BRAKIS' HOUSE!!! After fixing the second line after we screwed it up a 
bit, we hooked our Bieges onto the terminated wire pair. THERE WAS A 
DIAL TONE!!! We tried dialling a few 0800's but got nowhere, then we 
dialled 100 and got through!!! We could get the op to connect us to 
wherever we wanted. We then called it on the cellfone to check to see 
if it could get a call back trace. We got: "Sorry, the number you have 
dialled is not available" There was no CLI on the line, it couldn't 
get traced, and it was FREE. Its the perfect line!!!
You can follow more or less what we done for yourself if you want a 
foneline for phree. Just use 17070 to test your old lines, if BT were 
as stupid as they were in our case, you can get yourself a line.
Cheers!!!
