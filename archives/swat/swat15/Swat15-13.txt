Engineer Line Testing
---------------------

This is info I stole from a guide sheet for BT Engineers. It basically 
gives them a list of numbers which they can use for testing 
lines/recording line activity e.t.c. This can come in useful for the 
phreak intent on controlling certain aspects of someones line. Some of
this may have been covered in other artices, but I think the stuff on 
ASU's is relatively new.


Testing On System X
-------------------

Subscriber Automatic Line Test (SALT)

175 - Voice read out of number, follow prompts

01 Dial test
02 Power down line (shuts line down for 3 min. also wipes ANI)
6 Partial recall
7 Full recall, returns adiministrative DT
06 Power down exchange (I've never seen it happen btw!)
No response - New DT

Cable Pair Identification

176 Followed by Full area code and number of line on which tone is 
placed. Should get NU Tone, this means succesful placing of tone on on 
line.


Testing On System Y
-------------------

Subscriber Automatic Line Test

175 - Fast engaged tone/interrupted dial tone

Commands same as System X

BT Linetest Facility

This is a doosie of a number, it was covered in last months issue of 
SWAT so I am technically repeating this but........

17070 - Read out number (if no CLI no readout)

1 For ringback, 2 for quiet line, 3 for fasttest, 4 for fasttrans, or 
clear down.

1 Rings back upon clear down
2 Gives quiet line for testing LN
3 Gives ring back line test, Line test, Cable Pair Identification e.t.c.
4 Recodring of test results
Clear Down = Hang Up


ASU's
-----

OK so your asking what the hell an ASU is. Its basically the main 
control point for that local area code. Not all exchanges keep these 
in the range I am specifying but do some scanning and you should find 
them. ASU's allow switching engineers to control the main features of 
the switch from a remote fone. I don't have to spell out what this 
means for the phreak.

ASU's in most exchanges are found at <area-code> <exchange-code> 9999
They should present you with a message requesting a pin. You may need 
to sleep with a BT employee to get one of these. You could war dial 
one, but for gods sake NOT FROM YOUR HOME FONE. Once inside you can 
check the volume of calls coming through the exchange, perform house 
cleaning tasks on the switch, mess around with lines. You name it. Hack
one of these and you will become 31337.
An interesting point I might like to make about these numbers is that 
they automatically step you up to <Trunk Level 0> or STD level. This 
means if you dial your local ASU you will be stepped up to National 
level. Find a break signal like on 175 (after ring back flash hook) 
then you can mess around on national lines for local rates.


Fiddles
-------

These are fixes put in the circuit by fraudulent engineers wishing to 
exploit their position. They hide these in the 17x range and they are 
unique to each exchange. There are only 10 numbers to look through. 
They are usually hidden behind NU tones or "sorry........" messages. 
Mess around on each number till you find a fiddle. You should be able 
to make free calls off these, or possibly access looped lines. Either 
way, corruption in a powerful organisation is inevtiable, ABUSE IT. If 
you find a fiddle and want to use it outwith your own exchange your 
going to have to either find a PBX in your area in the 0800 range or 
hook a black/beige/gold box combo and dial through that.


CSS's
-----

The Holy Grail of numbers. If you find this you will become more 'leet 
than Captain Crunch, Whistlin' Joe, Onkel Deitmeyer, and Alexander 
Graham Bell put together. You can do SHIT LOADS with this number. You 
can even check up on line records of any number in that area and see 
the caller log. There are dial ups on PSTN and over the net through a 
special BT server. I also believe there are dial ups on PSS/Featurenet.
To find a CSS you may have to know a BT employee or if you don't it'll
take LOADS of scanning, hacking, and heart attacks over your local 
exchange. Scanning in your local prefix is always a good bet.


Exchange Dial Ups
-----------------

Your local exchange WILL have a modem dial up on PSTN or 
PSS/Featurenet. Once you have found this you can access fun things. 
Tracing calls is rather easy from these. Changing Line status and so 
on is also easy.


Weeuurd Stuff!!!
----------------

I found a severely weird number on a 373 scan I did myself. Its 
<a secret>. Its exactly the same as 17070!!! Whats weird is that I can
dial it from non-BT fones (including my Orange JustTalk) and use it to 
test lines (great for bieging) It'll probably die now that its in the 
Public Domain <no it won't since you asked me to remove it -F.S> 
but hey! why not share. <cause you told me not to- F.S>


Wrap up
-------

Thats all I know on the subject of local exchange phreaking at the 
moment. Maybe I'll learn more and update you on it!!!
