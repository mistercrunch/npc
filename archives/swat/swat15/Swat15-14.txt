The 90* Scam In All Its Glory

Firstly I want to say that this aint my scam, I'm not sure who first 
thought it up but full credit to them. Its been driving the Gestapo 
round the bend trying to put a stop to it! I am sure from all the SWAT
articles on PBX'es that you know about Meridian Mail and how to hack an
outdial (how many articles are there? I dont remember!) This can prove 
tedious up to a point coz you gotta scan like a whole prefix to find an
MM system with an outdial on it right? On top of that you might have to
hack a box or even a dialling prefix. It aint like the old Blue Box 
days. Well I have been reading ph.uk, and despite that annoying lamo 
Habanec trying to sell me 07005 numbers (which I dont want BTW), I
actually read somethin interesting. People were banging on about 
"The 90* Scam", I just presumed this was the basic outdial scam we all 
know and love, until a full expo was put up. I was pleasantly suprised 
to find that it wasn't..................... 
Basically what you need is the number of a company with a PBX on it 
(nothing fancy, just one with extensions), I think an 0800 is
required. What you do is dial up the company on your fone and plug in 
any old extension. You want to say the following: YOU:
"Oh dear, I think I dialled the wrong extension, could you put me 
through to the one I want" SADDO: "OK" YOU: "Ok its
900x" SADDO: "I'm puttin you through now" SADDO proceeds to put you 
through to the extesion and hangs up, you notice that there is no 
ringing and dial some numbers. Magically you have been put through to 
an outside number. How this works is
when SADDO dials the 900x (more in a mo) he puts you through to an 
outside line, leaving you to dial the rest. The 00 after
the 9 is your international dialling prefix, and the x is the first 
digit of the country code you want to dial. Ask for 9004 for UK
numbers then just dial the 4 and AC+N. There are a few ways this could 
mess up, if the office monkey waits for a ring before hanging up, and 
finding that there aint one. Or if he already knows the scam. 
Supposedly BT are going nutz trying to inform companies about this. 
Phreaks have been calllng international and runnin up MASSIVE bills for
the companies. Memos have been passed so it might be a job getting it 
to work. Incidentally I was running a similar scam on a US Country 
Direct number, It /was/ a 1-800 PBX. For a laugh I thought I would try 
dialling 0900# from it, suprise suprise I got "AT+T" on there. 
I managed to convince the op to connect me to int. numbers. This ran 
for about a month before they noticed. If your gonna use a US
number then ask for 0901, then dial the 1+country code+AC+N So there 
you have it, not much need to scan and hack for this one. A word of 
advice though, I would divert through the op before dialling the 
company, this stops them getting your number on their log!!! 
I'll explain diverting next article!

Diverting Through The Operator. By =The-Doh-Boy= 
"thanks to 9x for this" 

OK this time I'm gonna explain diverting to you. This is the art of 
giving the finger to all those CLI machines that companies have 
nowadays. And its pretty simple too! Firstly all you have to do is 
dial 100 and ask to be connected to the number you want to call, think
of an excuse if they ask why. You should then be connected to the
number and be able to use it as you would normally. The effect this has
is to stop your CLI going out to the comapny. You might be thinking 
"I can dial 141 instead" well that would get rid of your normal CLI but
not the network CLI (BT own this!!!) which is always released. What 
they get is the generic packet which doesn't give any info on you
at all. Scam away my friends!!
