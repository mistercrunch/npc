		Glass fragmentation bomb 
		 By _=The Firestarter=_

(I got the idea from another magazine only I've modified it)

You will need:
1 Large empty glass jar with a metal screw on lid. (the thicker
the glass the better)
1 Empty Re-fallible lighter
1 Glue gun
1 Saw
1 Can of lighter gas
A large rag 
1 Can of lighter fluid

Step 1: Cut a hole in the lid of the jar just big enough to hold
the lighter.

Step 2: Saw off the end of the lighter.

Step 3: Place the end of the lighter (Valve pointing out) in to
the hole and glue it in place.

Step 4: Screw the lid on tightly and put allot of glue around where
the lid meets the jar, so that it is air tight.

Step 5: Fill the jar with the lighter gas via the valve.

Step 6: Wrap the rag around the jar.

To use:

Step 1: Soak the rag in the lighter fluid.

Step 2: Light the rag.

Step 3: Throw.


What happened (As if you couldn't figure it out):

When the jar cracks (because you've thrown it) the gas forces 
itself out, widening the gaps, now the gas ignites and the flame
rushes back into the jar which ignites the (still) liquid gas 
causing an explosion sending glass every where.

Or alternatively you could just leave the bomb on the ground with
the burning rag around it and wait for it to explode.
