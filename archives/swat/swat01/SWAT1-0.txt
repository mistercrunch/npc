S*W*A*T Magazine is an anarchy magazine, giving information on Hacking,
Phreaking and Anarchy topics.  Each month or every other month it case
there is not enough articles or files it will include at least one,
Hacking/Phreaking file

along with other information and flies that seem relevant.

It is published in TXT format so PC, MAC and ATARI can read it.  There
is (will be) a better version for Microsoft word coming out soon in
DOC format, so why is that better? well it will have pictures, sound,
and more articles along with other cool stuff like that.

and it is suitable then I will put it in the magazine, just mail it
