Exploding Drugs
The explosives are fashioned from a compound of red phosphorus and 
potassium chloride which is then rolled and wrapped into aluminum foil 
balls. The balls are soaked in alcohol to make the mixture safe. When 
the alcohol completely evaporates, the chemicals incisde the ball 
become explosive.
These foil balls are then place in locations that are commonly searched
by the police. The devies detonate when an officers, believing he/she 
has found commonly wrapped narcotics, opens the aluminum foil ball to 
examine its contents.
They are extremely sensitive to heat, shock and friction. Attempts to 
unwrap the foil will likely result in an explosion capable of blowing 
off the fingertips. Dropping these devices may cause detonation. Two 
officers were slightly injured recently while attempting to unwrap 
mini-bombs.
Explosive devices have been found in three sizes, equivalent ot a 
marble, egg and baseball. The explosive force of the latter will cause 
death.
The mini-bombs resemble foil-wrapped illicit drugs, the most common 
being from one quarter to one half inch in diameter. Construction of 
these devices consists of a BB surrounded by a mixture of red 
phosphorus and potassium. This concotion is then wrapped tightly in 
aluminum foil.
Dropper is the term by which users refer to the mini-bomb. The majority
of those discovered so far are marble sized.
Detoantion of a 25 or 50 dropper mini=bomb could result in serious 
injury or death,
It is believed that suspects possessing or transporting thes devices
wrap them in heavy padding, such as cotton or sponge rubber.
Any suspected device or container labeled red phosphorus, potassium 
chlrorate or perchlorate should be handled by explosive disposal 
personnel only.
These bombs first appeared in Arizona in 1983 and resurfaced again in 
1986. Since January 1987, these have been at least six occasions where 
the mini-bombs were discovered during drug searches.
Aluminum foil mini-bombs have been uncovered during routine searches 
by the Arizona Department of Public Safety adn the Phoenix Police 
Department.
To date, mini bombs have only been found during searches involving 
motorcycle gang and prison gang members, primarily the Dirty Dozen 
motorcycle gang and the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang.
