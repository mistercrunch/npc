Yes i Know it sounds to good to be true but then that is where you 
would be wrong this article will teach you how to get a BT account for 
free.
we all know that BT internet has a 0800 number that works from 12 fri 
to 12 sun well here is how to get a username and password without 
spending any money.
you could use a false credit card but i wouldn't recomend it !

Now here we have some information i got off the CD for BT and first 
try this.
BT Internet
Phone No: 	0345 288000
User: 	        register@btinternet.com
Password: 	BTinternet

BT Internet ISDN
Phone No: 	0345 640000
User: 	        register
Password: 	BTinternet

Now on these accounts you cannot browse the internet but (i think) you 
can collect your mail send mail to other people using your normal mail 
program also you could run a web server or FTP server like i do 
(i don't know if it works someone tell me).

it will dissconnect you after 20 minuites of inactivity. rumors i have 
heared is to have at least 2 things downloading this will stop it from 
disconecting you.
also BT disconnects you after 2 hours i have been told by using an 
external modem you can bypass this.

MORE TIME !
At 12 sun you cannot redial up ! it doesn't disconnect you ! so you 
can stay on for another 2 hours if you dial up just before 12 (for 
internal modem users) but if you have an internal modem you can stay 
on for ages depending when BT shut down the server my mate was on the
BT free until wed then his computer crashed ! Thats K00l.

Now if these arn't what you want here is another soloution get wingate 
scan and set it to scan the BT internet IP addresses on port 12345 or 
another trojan ports, when you have found a person who has port 12345 
open you can try and netbus them to get there password.

Good Luck,

P.s i recomend you get more than one pass so if one goes dead the 
other one will work.
BTW the 0800 number is 0800 7317963
