[Yet another "space filler", once again i wasn't going to release this]
 [but it's amusing and helps add to what would otherwise be a small ]
  [   patheticly sized issue, but hey, we like to inject a bit of  ]
   [ humour into our issues, even if it is ripping the piss out of]
    [                          some guy.                         ]

Ok this I couldn't resist, actually it was the idea of both Netw0rk Bug
and Unknown Guest, now i'm sure that most of you will be aware that
i don't mock people in the magazine, and if i do then it is always with
a reason, so i won't put his name or ICQ number in this file.

Anyway on with the amusements (as well as a few comments so that i
don't look like a sick bastard - Note, if the party involved wishes to
e-mail me his comments then i will gladly re-release this article in a
revised manner including his comments). My comments are <like this>

                                  volernable it is

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:50 PM  <lol> we don't threaten them, we close them
                                  down

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:51 PM  UG wants to know if you can access
                                  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

<that was a server with no security, hell even i could have accessed it and
i know fuck all about NT hacking, well i know the basics anyway>

??????        6/21/99  8:51 PM  ya i like for them to swet first
                                  just give me a server to see its weakness

??????        6/21/99  8:51 PM  why?
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:52 PM  UG's just like that

??????        6/21/99  8:53 PM  getting back to subject give me a server to
                                  test

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:54 PM  that was a server

??????        6/21/99  8:54 PM  a web server?
                                  

??????        6/21/99  8:56 PM  ??
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:57 PM  yeah, UG's elite (although he doen't like to
                                  admit it), he just has trouble getting Admin
                                  rights on that server. We know what's on it
                                  because on of our guys got some stuff from it,
                                  we need to test it out for a full blown attack

<this is where i begin bullshitting, UG might not be elite, but he is a good
 hacker (just incase some of you start thinking that we think SWAT is some
 'leet skillz 0nly gr00p)>

??????        6/21/99  8:58 PM  give me a web server that acually works and
                                  didnt ip block me
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:58 PM  that does work, they just don't run a HTTP
                                  daemon on ports 80, 8080 or 3128 like others
                                  do

<actually does HTTP daemons run on port 3128? or was that bullshit, no doubt
 our 'leet friend will tell me if i'm wrong, actually i honestly don't know>

??????        6/21/99  8:59 PM  ok give me another
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  8:59 PM  can't, we need to get admin on that system,
                                  something UG's having a little trouble with at
                                  the moment. 

<LOL UG had admin access on that in a matter of seconds>

??????        6/21/99  9:00 PM  give me a server which i can get on eaisly

<how fucking easy can you get? UG had the admin password in an instant>
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:01 PM  that server isn't hard to crack, UG can
                                  already get into some of it

??????        6/21/99  9:02 PM  can you give me another server?
                                  cause i cant acess that one 

<ROTFL>
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:02 PM  i thought you where elite?

<elite? read: lame>

??????        6/21/99  9:03 PM  look man if i want to acess it i would but i
                                  dont feel like it 
                                  give me a server with a default port


Firestarte 6/21/99  9:04 PM  but that server has the default ports, i mean
                                  port 139 is open, and stuff. It just doesn't
                                  have a HTTP daemon running on the normal ports

??????        6/21/99  9:04 PM  exactly i dont have the time to get on those
                                  ports give me a server with default ports
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:05 PM  u can acess it via port 139? i thought you
                                  knew that

??????        6/21/99  9:06 PM  give me somnething with port 80
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:06 PM  why? that's only a HTTP daemon

??????        6/21/99  9:06 PM  i know trust me
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:07 PM  your not a kiddie fiddler are u?

??????        6/21/99  9:08 PM  DA FUCK I AM HOW DARE YOU?
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:08 PM  well why else do you want port 80 open? NT
                                  isn't vulnrable to CGI exploits like others
                                  are, if it was i'd have rooted it ages ago

<yeah i'm learning *nix CGI exploits incase any of you are wondering>


??????        6/21/99  9:08 PM  understand me i have different methouds of
                                  server destruction

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:09 PM  we sdon't want to destroy it, we want admin
                                  rights

??????        6/21/99  9:10 PM  fine i wopunt do anything unless you say so
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:10 PM  yeah but we need admin rights so that we can
                                  download some of there files, then we
                                  annihilate the server with "GSCRUB"

<before anyone asks, i made GSCUB up off the top of my head>

??????        6/21/99  9:11 PM  oh sure "download"

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:11 PM  yeah download, how else do we get them off the
                                  server?

??????        6/21/99  9:11 PM  ya and view them
                                  

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:12 PM  yeah, how else do we get the information?

??????        6/21/99  9:12 PM  read between the lines ===-====

Firestarte 6/21/99  9:13 PM  oh, we're not after kiddie porn, we need there
                                  database

                                  isn't it?

??????        6/21/99  9:35 PM  so what do you say?

                                  stoped doing it
