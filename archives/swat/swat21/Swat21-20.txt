                        A-S BUSTS ??????

Well the main controversey this month seams to have been the confusion as 
to whether or not Geddon of Anti Social (The shit Underground mag that you 
are not reading)was busted after a fight.
 It of course turned out that it was all  a lot of class A BULLSHIT that 
geddon and his army of pixies invented in their tiny collective mind.
 The speculation reached a heated climax  when APT (About phreaking times) 
published an article saying that they believed it was all a publicity 
stunt on the part of A-S, so that when Armageddon got that oversized Ego of 
his round to making a "statement" saying that it was all rumours he could 
call the other mag's lame for "falling for it" and "not being leet enough" 
to investigate the rumours. 
      Well here at Swat we were not going to fall for it for two reasons, 
1 We would not publish anything concerning the events untill they had been 
confirmed by A-S themselves and 2 We really wouldn't care if Armageddon 
got busted or not. To be honest (and this is purely my own opinion)  
I wouldn't put it past A-S for trying some stupid stunt like this. 
However if Geddon had been busted I sure he wouldnt't get shagged up the 
arse too much (The amount of excrement that guy talks he would better
giving them blow jobs). 
        I wouldn't worry though if people are concerned about
SWAT loseing it's credibility by printing faked rumours just to be called
lame because if the truth be told we hear lots of rumours about armageddon
usually about his "alleged" unnatural romantic inclination towards sheep and 
small ferrits.
