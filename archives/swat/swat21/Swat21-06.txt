If you are taking part in a campaign targeting an individual or large
company and you wan't to carry out your campaign over a long period of time
then you will eventually need to either put the mark under surveilance or
alternatively infiltrate it's business/circle of friends etc. For the first
part of this series of articles on infiltration and surveilance we are going
focus on infiltrating big companys.
Theyre are several ways of getting inside a company some pleasent and some
not so pleasent. One of those not so pleasent ones is getting out of bed at
three in the morning, dawning some very old black clothes and then begin
rummaging through your compnay's garbage. This can be very rewarding
and you can ussually find a lot of useful "crap" e.g. security manuals,
old pay slips anything that gives you some kind of guide as to the companys
operation. The above method is called "Trashing" this is not the kind of
thing someone should do regularly (unless of course they are a complete
Skank merchant like those in A-S who have bad personal hygiene and enjoy
stripping off and playing in the rubbish "allegedly"). Just remeber it is
an arrestable offence because untill the enviromental services take it away
it remains private property.
   One of the more sanitary ways of infiltrating a company is to maybe get
summer job in the Admin department or something similar this will also
allow you to commit a bit of pre-strike anarchy by just generaly being
a shit employee and pinching pens, or anything that you can think of to
cause a bit of trouble (of course not enough to get you fired). For
extended fun why not commit a bit of minor theft and implicate the
fat loud mouth biggot who sweats too much. Many of these companys reward
whistle blowing. This you give you at least two or three months to gather
information in preparation for that major robbery,raid or supreme
firebombing. One thing to remember when trying this approach is not to
let other employees know about your real "mission", As I said before
these companys heartily encourage whistle blowing. If your more interested
in the computer system then this can be an absolutely excellent way
of finding out about that however since most serious hacks are inside jobs
and you have been entrusted with a password the you instantly come under the
spotlight. The same applies to voice mail however I know people who have
tried this type of infiltration for the sake of cracking Audix VMBs and been
quite successful.
   The next method of infiltration of large company involves digging
out that old suite and tie and getting a fake Id, Yes you guessed it,
You pull a surprise inspection on them (A-S is shit) you pretend to be part
of some kind of governement comission set up to oversee some bollox, the
amount of commisions and sub comittees the British government has set up it
shouldn't be hard to find something to impersonate, just use your
imagination and try a bit of that Social Engineering I have been talking
about for the last 22 months. Don't be afraid to have a bit of gumshen
just believe in yourself and there is very little you can achieve,steal
or deface.
   Another way of fucking with a company is the old mail interception.
Sorry my hacker friends but I am not about to tell you some "733t" way of
getting other people's E-mail I am actually about to tell you how to steal
someones letters and parcels, so hey guys your all good at what you do
but get up from you terminals, get a bit of excersise and beat up your
postman. Yes in seriousness attacking the postman's mail route is a great
way of getting you hands on the mark's mail, This can involve stealing
his mailbag/van or just mauling him or her with a baseball bat. If the
company get's its mail before the staff arrive then your job is even
easier. Just dress in black again and keep your face away from the
security camera/guard then smash in the front door and nik their post.
That brings up another point I should have perhaps mantioned. When you go
on your initial spying run take a careful note of all the things that are in
place e.g. security camera's night watchmen shifts etc.
   In my our opinion one of the easiest ways of infiltrating a company.
Is teleconferencing most big cooperations will conf at some point so all you
have to do is get details of conferences. This can be done in severel ways
Monitoring VMBs,mail,E-mail, and even chatting to employees when you happen
to see them in the bar they all go to on a friday night (you get them all
pissed as farts and ask them whatever you need to know.) All you will need
for the conference will be a profile number and a passcode and oc course
the number of the conference bridge. For further details of
teleconferencing and for a begginers guide see Brakis's other articles on
the subject in earler editions of SWAT.
