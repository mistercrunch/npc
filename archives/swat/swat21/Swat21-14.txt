Hi, as promised by me, here is hacking RM part II! I guess you know the 
drill by now - i take no responsibility for you actions......;)

This section is about back orifice and financial gain (skamz ;). I know 
that most of you will be saying that using tools like back orifice and
netbus are lame, but the truth is that they are one of the best ways to
hack RM. This is because all you need is the IP adress, and that isn't 
hard to get (In fact me and one of my friends have made a database of all
of the IP addresses and hostnames, and we may be adding a column that 
shows which machines are BO'ed ;)

Financial gain is one of the most piss easy things to do on the face of 
the planet. EVERYONE has got somethinhg other that they'd rather be kept 
quiet, right? Well, sell the workareas that I told you about in part one 
at a profit. If your skool uses 'printer credits', to limit the number 
of prints that you can make before you have to buy (yes actually BUY - 
YEAH RIGHT!!!!!)  more credits. The good news is that these workareas 
usually come with a load of free credits - I'm sure that I don't gotta 
tell you what to do next.

Back Orifice
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The good thing about BO and other tools like it are that they are so piss 
easy to use!! All you have to do is install the server component on the 
target machine and then you are away with the GUI!!  some good things 
that you can do are:

*You can steal other ppl's work, by opening an HTTP server, and instead
 of putting c: as the root directory, you have to put n: (or the network 
 drive where your work is stored. Then you have to open up the internet 
 explorer and BAM! you now have access to some ones MyWork folder!
*Delete other ppl's work (I'm sure you can do THIS). This is good after
 you have 'borrowed' someones w0rk! >:-) hehehe
*If you really want to get somone in the shit, then you can open 
 command.com on a port (app add), i find port 8000 works well. After this 
 all you have to do is open telnet, connect to the remote machine, and 
 type in the format command:

C:\>format c: /y

 this will totally format the remote machines HD!! (in the words of Austin
 Powers - Yeah Baby! Yeah!)

Hell, im knackered, and i don't wanna spoil all of you discovery fun, so i'll 
leave something to your imagination at least ;) if you are really desperate for
BO Hacks, then I suppose that you can contact me ;)
