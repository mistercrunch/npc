After the unfortunate news last month that Candyman died in Prison.
The official police inquest states that it was inconclusive the SWAT
inquest however with the "help" of inmates we were able to come to a
conclusion about what happened. Unfortunately for reasons of security
concerning his family we are unable to divulge out information
of our findings. All I can say in the most sincere anger this
incident has caused me personally is that those who's actions
brought about the death of Candyman should get their affairs in order.
The Bible says an eye for an eye, Candyman's spirit will be avenged.
   Candyman started with SWAT in 1994. He was an enthusiastic and
commited member of the group. His first "mission" along with myself
and the now inarcirated Onion was a chemical plant robbery, which could
perhaps have been labeled as SWAT's first foot in the pool of serious 
crime. this was back before the days of our current stars such as 
Unknown Guest and Netw0rk Bug. He then preceeded to undertake all kinds
of tasks from busting open cab boxes to blowing up cars. After leaving 
School at sixteen he was what could only be decribed as a proffesional 
Anarchist. Thenm of course this sparkling young social outcast bent on
blowing up whatever got in his way succumbed to that one evil that 
kills off all Anarchists.
The one that is stronger than the police, MI6 and BT security put 
together. Yes he got into a "commited" relationship with his
girlfriend. This was however the start of the end for Candyman. His 
Girlfriend left him after 8 months of living together. When she left 
him he found solice in Cocaine and Heroin.
   Thankfully his new girlfriend aided this now recovering drug addict
but one night what can only be described as fucking up big time and
getting busted for selling crack. He was sent down to an infamous 
Glagow prison for 5 years of which he was only to serve a year of.
