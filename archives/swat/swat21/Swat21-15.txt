A simple but effective bomb, that makes a helluva loud bang, 
and splatters chemicals eveywhere.  (Avoid eye contact)

What you need: -

Granulated pool chlorine ("Borrow" some from school/leisure center)
Sugar
Water
2 liter coke bottle (Drink the coke first)

First, take the bottle (Make sure the inside is DRY), 
and unscrew the top.  Fill the bottle one third full of chlorine
then fill it another third with sugar.
When ready for use, take the bottle, 
and add water until it is 75% full, put the lid on, and throw.
The idea is that the sugar and chlorine react together, 
to form lots of chlorine gas, which fills the bottle until
it reaches its burst point, and explodes, making an extremely
loud bang. 
(The water speeds the reaction up, not really necessary, if u can be
arsed to wait for months, it would prolly explode all by itself)

Note: chlorine gas is highly toxic, 
do not inhale it/get it in your eyes
