Right first i changed the logo at the top coz my other one took up too 
much space (sorry m8, i removed it 'cause it was too much trouble
formatting the colums in the text file - F.S) but im still the same 
deathbringer,Now on to the conspiracy.First off i nicked one of those 
board pens from a cupboard last parents evening-IT STILL WORKS-so next 
time one of your pens run out, blame the govorment!(Oh by the way yes 
i did use it a lot)Conspiaraccy 2-Schools usually have sponserd walks 
to raise money and provide better facilities for the school. Well do 
you ever notice any improvements?i thought not!If you really wanna see 
where the money goes,look at the staff car park-and they say the pays 
crap..Conspiracy 3..Learning support classes,in these classes,if you 
ever where forced to go to one do you notice how they always try to 
teach you how great the govorment is and 'where we would be whithout 
leaders' i suggest on your last day or if your in trouble anyway, say 
either1-Actually a system of anarchy where everyone has the same rights
and nothing forced upon them would lead to a more educated,aware and 
carful population-or 2 FUCK YOU BITCH ANARCHY RULES-By the way i agree
whith the first one and say the second one.
