I recently discovered a file n how to make these, so after setting off
several of them i decided that i'd write them up along with ways to
improve them. 

Ok so what are they? well in a way they are simple fireworks that bang.
They aren't really dangerous in there normal state, they produce a fairly
loud bang and a nice ammount of smoke.

And this is the cool part, for about 50p you can make about 6 of them
assuming that you have (and 99% of you will) the rest of the materials
at home.

Ok what do you need?
1 Box of safety matches (they work better than non-safety)
Tape (masking tape is best, but normal tape also works)
Knife

What to do?

(1) Remove the sleave from the box of matches and cut the striker off.

(2) Tip the matches out of the tray and place the striker along the top
    of the box with the striker edge pointing inwards.

(3) Put the matches back into the tray with the match heads pointing
    towards the striker. 

It should look somewhat like this:

 _______________
 |} <>--------- |
 |} <>--------- |
 |} <>--------- |
 |} <>--------- |
 |______________|

<>------ is the matches
} is the striker
| and  _  is the match box tray

(4) Now wrap the match box sleeve around the tray and hold it in place
    with tape.

(5) Now wrape as much tape around the box as you can, it doesn't have to
    be tight, but as long as it's as sealed as you can get it (i used about
    4 layers of tape).

(6) Ok all done.

Now just throw it agains't a hard surface. B0000000M

simple and fun.

To add weight to it, pour some lead shot or air gun pellets into the box,
these won't fly every where and cut things to pieces, but they will give
it enough weight to allow it to be thrown quite far. You can also tape
coins on the outside of the box.

Adding black powder from fireworks as well as some weight to the outside
will make an even bigger explosion, i've not tried adding sodium chlorate
and sugar yet, but i believe that it will only increase the ammount of
smoke.

If you can get a Jet-X engine add that to the box (you may need to cut
some of the match sticks), once it goes up if it doesn't explode you'll
have a cool incendiary.

Now fun thigs to do with them:

Make about 20 or 30, add weights if needed and drive around throwing them
at little kids or Neds from a fast moving car. Also fun if thrown at people
waiting to cross the road.

Get onto the roof of a block of flats and hurl them at the local populus
below you.

Throw them into open windows.

Drop them down stair wells.

Well use your imagination, these are cool impact sensative bangers that
(unless modified) are quite safe. I mean even if they aren't made righta
and they kinda fuck up, they still make a popping sound and smoke a lot.
