_Home made Cherry Bomb / Mini napalm grenade_

*Supplies:
-Kinder Egg
-Fuse
-xplosives (naplam recomended see botom of page)
-glue

*What u do is:
take the Kinder Egg, eat it but keep the plastic egg
that is inside, and discard the shit toy. next, make
a small hole in each half of the plastic egg, at the
top. Make a Knot at 1 end of the fuse, and feed it
through the hole. the purpuse of the knot is to stop
the fuse from falling out of the hole. if it does,
make another knot around the first to make it bigger
I have made a diagram in case u r to thick to
comprehend.

I recomed you use a good 3 to 4" of fuse wire, or
else it might take your hand off. u should fill it with
Napalm. you can make some by heating some kerosene/gasoline
in a double boiler and add saop chips. if you 4 units
saop, then use 4 units of kerosene/gasoline. NOTE
that this is heighly xplosive and only a small amount
should be use(1/4fillthe egg). to insrt the mixture,
pour it through the hole you made @ the top of the
second half of the egg and seal this hole to prevent
spillage in mid throw. You should seal the egg in the middle
b4 you do this. use super glue to seal it. U may also want
to dip the last 1/2" of fuse in gasoline to stop it from
going out when it gets into the the egg. you should
seal the bit where you inserted the fuse so that the
xplosives dont come out, but make sure that the fuse
will burn past it. i used Scotch tape to seal it,
bcause it burnswhen the fire hits it.

*how to use:
Light the fuse, throw and run. The kerosene/gasoline &
saop mix are v explosif (it is a form of napalm)
, so be VERY VERY carful if u r stupid enough to go
through with this.
This may work with other containers, but i like the egg
Bcause it splits down the midlle when it xplodes & it's
easy to hide & carry.
