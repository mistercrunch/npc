                    escape this, all of hell inside,
                     create this man to make my stand,
                    and break this hardened shell in time"

Well this month has been "interesting" to say the least, from RSD-Day
to serval fun and amusing incidents with numerous pyrotechnic delights
right down to every anarchists nightmare - getting searched by the pigs
and having your favorite knife confiscated. Although i had to laugh
when i was told (a few days later) that there was some loop hole in the
law that made it legal to carry a lock knife as long as the blade wasn't
open, lol to word it in the way of the pig that paid me a vist:
"Because it's a lock knife, if you stab somebody the blade won't fold
up and you'll do them a lot of damage" lol that's the reason u get
busted if the blades out. /me thinks this guy don't know the principle
behind stabbing somebody <lol>. So yeah,. i got my knife back and i'm
happy about that.

Well Green_Goblinz promised RSD articles for all of you, but his modem
fried in a thunderstorm, so unfortunatly you'll get them all next month
along with a load more he said he's working on. Well it was either
delay the issue or place them in next month, and i didn't want to
disapoint you all.
