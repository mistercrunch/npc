Use may remember a previous file on knives which was not written by me.
This one talks about cheap knives, you know, ones you can pick up for
2 dollars. Remember, if you get your ass busted by the cops or kill
some poor fuck with anything you might make from here, it ain't my
fault.

First of, cheap knives. Yes they are rather crude and may break but
they are an effective self-defense weapon. You might note that most
items I mention here are for self-defense. If you know you're gonna
be in a fight, take a knife but as a last resort. Either a gun or
plank of wood with a couple of nails shot into it or somthing.
Anyways, a cheap folding "swiss-army" type are the best. Some may
include serated (sp?) blades as well as a sort of sharp blade. If
you wish to get one, make sure the main blade is at least 2 1/2in
long. No point in using something long as a quarter. With the folding
knife, you may want to sharpen it to a fine point. Then, you might
want to convert it to a fixed blade. For this, find a piece of
stainless steel that will fit in the space where the main blade
would go. Either use that liquid metal shit or braze/solder it to
the bland and the casing. If you plan to use the other tools included
with the knife, converting it to fixed blade may not be the what
you're looking for.

At this point, you might be thinking that this is bull shit and you
decide to spend your, let's say 30 dollars, on some cool looking
single folding blade with a lock. Ok. Just think, you spent most of
the money of that cool looking casing, that "maintainance-free" ball
breaing joint and the locking part. What a waste! Why not buy like 10
of those cheap "swiss-army" types? If some cop see's you with those
30 dollar and up knives which open and close with those neat parts,
well, those are more likely to make the fuck suspicious than a
"swiss-army" knife which even boy scouts carry. 

Now to the part on making them. I have made a few from some pieces
"borrowed permenatly" from my tech class at school. Here's a real
real crude yet cheap one.

You'll need: 1 piece of metal/steel whatever width and length you prefer
             1 piece of plastic at least 1" by any length
             super glue/epoxy/hot glue
             electrician's tape or somethign else for a grip for the 
             handle
Instructions:
First, decide on a length and blade width. Go ahead and cut the metak to
the size you want. Cut an angle to one side (see picture).

Not to scale
-----------------------------------
|                                  |  before angle is cut
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
\                                 |           after angle is cut, you might want to
 ----------------------------------           put a long angel on it (can't draw too
^^^^^^^^^^^^ at least sharpen that much       good with ascii art)

 

Sharpen one or two sides of the metal using the picture as a template,
you might wish to increase or decrease blade length. After that, cut the
plastic so it's the same width of the blade but only as long as the
unsharped side so the sharp area is not covered, duh! Then put the metal
in between the plastic like a sandwich. Here, check for a close fit then
glue these pieces together and put in a vice or under some bricks and let
sit over night. After that, wrap the tape or other material around the
plastic handle and presto, cheap blade useful for some stuff. You could
add nails to the one thin side and use those nails to fuck up some guys
face when you punch them with the cheap shit in your hand. This little
bastard is good in a sense that is can be manufactured quick and cheap
and you won't have to worry losing lots a money in the event that you
have to toss it or the cops seize it. If anyone reading this goes out
one night to see what uses it has and to see how it fairs in a one on
one battle, let me know what happens. I personally don't do that shit
so I can't give you results. This little bastard should be used as a
last resort when all you have left are bare hands or if you have the
element of surprise and can whip out this thing quick when the ememy
least expects it. 

How to effectivly use a cheap knife
I'm sure many of you will skip this part and I don't blame you. It's
just an add-on to the last section. Well, if you got a "swiss-army"
type knife with no locking feature, this may seem like a disadvantage
but not really. If you look at the botoom of the blade, you will see
an unsharpened piece about 5mm long. This piece may save you ass. if
you hold the knife closer to the bottom, if you make a wrong move,
the bland may close on your fingers, cut youself, drop the knife and
get your ass whooped. But if you put your finger all the way against
the 5mm unsharpened part, this will hit you finger first, instead of
the blade which will prevent it from closing. You might feel a small
pinch but that is better than the blade cutting you! Personally, i
prefer to hold knives with the blade pointing out from my pinky finger.
This way, you can punch some fucker with a hook, then follow through by
cutting up there face. Some with an upper-cut. With stabbing, you get
more power from a downward strike than and upward strike. 

Guess that's about it, if anyone has suggestions and stuff like that,
email me and I might add it in my next article.
