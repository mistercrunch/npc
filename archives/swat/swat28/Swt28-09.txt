I was just looking round Tesco the other day when I noticed- looking on
the  back of the Anchor aerosol cream that the propellant was nitrous
oxide . Does that ring a bell? Laughing gas? Yes?

You need:

A bucket/sink
A can of cream
some clean plasic tubing (about 5mm wide)
Water
A bag with no holes in.

First, snap off the nozzle. Next, put the tube over the bit where the
ream comes out (I've forgotten the name)
Fill the sink with water, and submerge a bag.
Do this, and squirt:

You get the general idea. Make sure that the bag has no air in it
beforehand. (and that the sink is full of water) You will get a mass
of cream at the bottom of the sink and the bag will fill with laughing
gas. Have fun! 

REMEBER: FIRST READ THE ANARCHISTS COOKBOOK / JOLLY ROGER (i can't
remeber which one) ARTICLE ON LAUGING GAS FIRST. YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IF
YOU PUT THE BAG OVER YOUR HEAD


50-60 Hz (ish) jammer


This will jam most radio stuff working of mains, and some battery
powered suff as well. I do not know how far it works, or if it damages
anything. Just don't put your £200 GPS unit next to it.

You will need:

A high wattage mains bulb
A cheap light socket/ bedside lamp
A VERY CHEAP seperate mains light switch (not one connected to the base
  of the lamp)
A G-Clamp
A TV/Radio to test it- try the least modern one- no complex remote
controls and things

Get a cheap switch, bacuse those work better.

OK, just wire it all up, and if you switch it off very slowly, you
should find that it sparks, and the light flickers.
All you need to do is put the clamp over the switch and turn it VERY
slowly, and there should be a point where it sparks continually and the
light flickers continually. Turn on the TV, and you should get little or
no picture and no sound. Test this out and see how far it goes.
