Damn, this shit I'm about to discuss IS powerful!!!

THESE CHEMICALS ARE 'PRIMARY' HIGH EXPLOSIVES AND ARE NOT FOR THE
=================================================================
BEGINNER PYRO
=============

ACETONE PEROXIDE
################

Materials:
==========
- Hydrogen Peroxide around 6%, found in hair bleach
- Acetone, the contents of nail pollish remover in chemists or
  supermarket
- Hydrochloric Acid, hardware stores
- 2 large glass jars
- filter paper, you can use newspaper or paper towels

Instructions:
=============
Pour 200ml peroxide into the glass jar. Add 150ml of Acetone, and
then 50ml Hydrochloric acid. 
Stir this mix for 2mins than put into a fridge and leave for around 3
days. After 3 days all the crystals of Acetone Peroxide should have
formed out of the mixture. A thick layer of white crystals should be
in the bottom of the jar. Now filter the crystals out of the solution
with the filter paper of your choice into a second jar. 


The crystals left, dry, are extremely dangerous, they are
friction, heat and shock sensitive and you will now need to be VERY
careful. The quantity you are left with is quite enough to do a LARGE
amount of destruction with.

USE:
====
     Just load the crystals CAREFULLY into a rifle shell or a small
container, epoxy the end (dont attempt to close it with pliars) and
make sure you have either a rocket igniter or long fuse to light it.
Try inserting into the ground under something like a plant pot to see
if this plant pot will orbit the earth seconds after detonation.
Compare it to a rifle shell full of gun powder...



HMTD
####

Materiials:
===========
- Hexamine, from army stores sold as fire lighter (I bought the
  tablets around £2/3)
- Hydrogen Peroxide
- Hydochloric Acid (although Citric acid is supposed to work)
- Lange glass jar

Instructions:
=============
	In the glass jar add 100ml peroxide and 3 teaspoons of
crushed hexamine, stir until disolved and leave for 30min. Now add
30ml of HCl (Hyrochloric acid), stir and sit in fridge overnight. A
large amount of fine white crystals should form out. Filter the powder
and wash by pouring distilled water over the crystals, as much as
possible - very neccessary to get rid of contaminents which greatly
effect the explosive. Dry it the same way as acetone peroxide by
leaving it on some filter paper.

From the "IMPROVISED MUNITIONS Black Books" it is formed slightly
differently:

1.  Measure 9 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide into a container

2.  In 3 portions, dissolve 2.5 teaspoons of crushed
    hexamethylenetetramine (hexamin) in the peroxide.  

3.  Keep the solution cool for 30 minutes by placing container in a
    pan of cold water.

4.  In 5 portions, dissolve 4.5 teaspoons of crushed citric acid in
    the hexa-peroxide solution.                           
   
5.  Permit solution to stand at room temperature until solid particles
    for at the bottom of the container.

Note: Complete precipitation will take place in 8-24 hours

6.  Filter the mixture through a paper towel into a container to
    collect the solid particles.

7.  Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with 6
    teaspoons of water by pouring the water over them.  Discard the
    liquid in the container.
 

Use the same way as Acetone Peroxide. Both primary explosives are
very similar, yet HMTD is slightly less sensitive. BE EXTREMELY
careful, don't take short cuts and follow safety rules at all times.
Primary explosives are usually used for initiating things like TNT,
but are just as much fun on their own.

I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITY!!! HAVE FUN & ENJOY!!!!!
