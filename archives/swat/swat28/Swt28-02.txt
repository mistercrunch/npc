	I advise this for the more experienced pyro 'cause beginners
will blow their head off.
I don't care whether you put this idea to practice or just include it
in the rest of your pyro article collection, as long as you enjoy
reading, stay outa trouble, and by all means don't blame me for your
own destruction. Just be careful sending it through the mail. 

To make the electrical version, you will need the following materials:
======================================================================

- A cardboard box (give yourself enough room to work within it; so
  theres room 4 the bomb & other stuff)

- Desired explosive (Recomended Acetone Peroxide/HMTD)

- Hot glue gun

- Wires, 9v batteries, solar igniters

- Video cassettes, empty rifle shells

- Clothes peg and tinfoil 

Instructions
============
	Afix solar ignitors into the rifle shells, and carefully pack
        the shells with Acetone Peroxide or HMTD, and seal with epoxy
        glue. BE VERY CAREFUL!!! Now Pull apart the video cassettes and
        rip out the ribon shit. Now you can put the shells into the
        cassettes and use loads of tissue or foam to cushon them from
        rolling around inside. Wire up the ignitors to some wires hanging
        out of the cassettes. You can make a few of these shells for the
        cases - the more the merrier! Just wire in a parallel circuit.
        If it needs more 9v batteries for a large amount of ignitors then
        there is no problem encorporating this into your circuit. Thats
        the explosive out of the way.

	Squeeze the peg so the two ends are apart. Wrap both ends with
        tin foil and secure with tape. When you let go of the peg, the
        two pieces of tin foil should make contact. Connect two wires
        individually to the tinfoil ends, and put a piece of plastic /
        cardboard between the peg to break the contact. Now make sure
        the cardboard box has its top and bottom flaps pushed out so you
        can work with both ends. Inside the box, making sure the
        cardboard flaps are pushed together, glue the peg to one flap
        and the non-conductive contact breaker to the other flap. This
        end of the box is obviously the top end. Meaning that when the
        flaps of the box are pulled open the contact breaker will come
        free thus the circuit will be completed. You get the picture. 

	Wire one of the peg pins to a terminal on the 9v battery, and
        from the other terminal to a leg of the igniter wire. The other
        igniter wire is then connected to the other peg pin. All wires
        should be hotglued down the sides of the box as neatly as
        possible, and the video cassettes also so it doesn't fall about
        thus detonating the explosive. Run a piece of selotape down the
        middle of the flaps on the top of the box to keep it sealed and
        not accidently go off. Seal the bottom with much more tape, and
        you could stick the target's address on the top, with 'FRAGILE'
        & 'THIS WAY UP' signs on it.    		

To make the non-electrical version:
===================================
	The solar igniters will need to be replaced by regular fuses
        which will have to be fixed together somehow. As for the ignition
        from opening the box, the use of the pull cord out of a Christmas
        cracker (the paper strip with the explosive stuff on it), and
        apply lots of black powder and glue arround it which at this
        point you add the fuse. Each end of the strip will be glued to
        both flaps. When the box lid is pulled open, the pull-cord
        explodes igniting the black powder, then the fuse which hits all
        the other fuses in a matter of a second or two. Its best you
        design your own system.

Advantages of using this method: The post office will not detect it as
easily (with there being less metal components). 

Disadvantages: More chance of this going wrong and not working as
desired. Also a delay before exploding.

IMPROVEMENTS
============
	The box could also have flammable liquids/gas containers inside
        with the explosives. Along with sodium chlorate, thermite, napalm
        and flash powder to make a much deadlier effect! Its your choice.
        This will probably bring down the house.


CONCLUSION
**********

	  You are being stupid by sending this in the post. If - for
          WHATEVER reason, give this to a postman saying there are
          expensive films in there so not to be X-RAYed. The explosives
          that are mentioned are PRIMARY HIGH EXPLOSIVES, and for the use
          of advanced pyrotechnic users. Just the use of ONE rifle shell
          full of the explosive is VERY powerful - you won't believe it
          till you see it, so more than one shell is looking at a large
          scale of destruction. It will kill!
