 This file deals with preserving your anonymonity whilst surfing the
 web on Windows 9x. If somebody wants to find out where you've been it
 wouldn't take them much bother unless you have gone to the trouble of
 trying to hide yourself.

 1. Getting Started

 Before you start your web surfing backup files that are likely to
 change on a floppy. Anything that is modified should be preserved in
 its initial state then re-intergrated after you are finished. Also
 disable all programs from the Task List that you can't be sure of.
 For instance, if you see something that your not sure you installed
 but looks important fuck it off the Task List anyway because there is
 no way your system is running off it. Anything could be watching you,
 many keyloggers are disguised with important looking names to throw
 you off. Keylog98 shows up on the Task List as DllMan32, trying to
 appear as a 32-bit Dll manager.

 2. Nosy Websites

 When you browse into a website they record all sorts of information
 about you. More than you might feel comfortable with. They record your
 IP, O\S, Browser and any and all other information they can retrieve.
 Have you ever heard of Anonymizer? It is a web-based service which
 allows you to access websites anonymously. Just browse into:

 http://www.anonymizer.com

 and use the URL box in the middle of the page. Anonymizer witholds
 information from the website in question. This can be an important
 luxury due to the fact that some early beta versions of Windows 95
 are searched for pirated software by http://www.microsoft.com every
 time you access the site.

 3. Netscpae Navigator

 Netscape can be a pain in the ass because it stores URL history files
 all over the place. Go to Edit|Preferences on the menu and choose
 clear history. To clear the URLs on that drop down history list go to
 the current user's folder in \netscape\users\username and edit 
 prefs.js deleting all URLs mentioned in it. Be careful not to omit
 anything else as you might fuck up the whole thing. Now to remove temp
 files go to \netscape\users\username\cache and remove all non-
 important files. Just remember to keep fat.db as its a very important
 config file.

 4. Internet Explorer

 IE just loves to take up your bandwith by creating several pointless
 files in numerous locations. There are some obivous places to start:

 c:\windows\temp\
 c:\windows\history\
 c:\windows\temporary internet files\

 Delete the contents entirely. Now browse over to \windows\cookies but
 careful not to delete Mm2048.dat and Mm256.dat. Everything else can go
 to hell. You could probably rig a batch file up to do all this work
 for you if you're in a big hurry.
