This file will give you a rough idea of picking stuff up in order to
make certain devices, and also how much you can expect to pay. I know
that I've made a list similar to this before, only this will go into a
bit more detail.

Shotgun shells: If you don't own a shotgun or hold a fire arms
license then getting hold of these may seem to be difficult, but the
truth is it's piss easy to get a box of shotgun shells, you just
have to know the right people. If you know somebody who lives on a farm
then you can usually buy a box from them, in College or school getting
them is pretty easy, like I said it's all down to the people you know
if you ask around, don't go and do something stupid like "can you get
me some shells?". Once you've found a person who casn supply you with
them, ask questions as to there cost, whether they can get them, and
any other question that seems relevent. Finally ask them if they can
get you some. I could get a box for £2.50 but you can expect to pay
anything from £2.50 to £5 for a box of 25, I'd never pay more than £5
since they only cost around £3 if you buy in bulk, a lot of people will
try to rip you off, just remember, it's not hard to get hold of them,
so if one person is wanting £20 for a box, go else where.

Rifle ammo: Again this is the same as shotgun shells, only a lot of
people in the Cadets will be able to get them for you, around £5 will
get you a small case of 0.22 rounds, but larger calibre shells will
cost a lot more, unless you actually have a rifle or means of fireing
them then don't bother getting them.

Nitrocellulose: This is the same shit that's used as propellent in
ammo, shotgun shells hold a nice ammount of this, but buying the shells
purely for the powder can get a bit expensive. Surprisingly enough
this isn't classed as an explosive, so you don't need an explosives
license to pick it up, infact you don't need a license at all, there is
however an age restriction on it's purchase, you have to be 18 to buy
it, this doesn't really cause that much of a problem if you underage
just get somebody to buy it for you. I'm guessing that the price is
around £12 for a bag, I'm not all that sure sincve it's a while since
I looked into it.

Potassium permanganate: I've been asked a lot of questions about this
stuff, I'll just set the record straight for everybody, Potassium
permanganate is a purple salt, you can pick it up in almost any chemist
without having to answer any questions. You use it as a simple
disinfectant by disolving it in water, for example, if you have
athaletes foot, you might disolve the potassim permanganate in water
and wash your feet in it. Chemists hardly ask questions if you buying
this stuff, so son't worry about it, remember ask for "Potassium 
permanganate" it comes in 25g jars for about £1

Potassium Nitrate: I must be honest, I'm not too sure of the avaliblity
as to this, I've never needed to buy any. But according to people I've
talked to "It's the salt you get on dry stone walls", it's used in
fertilisers and it can be extracted from horse shit (there's a file in
the anarchists cookbook on how to do it). I'm not too sure as to the
cost of this.

Sulphur: Try getting it from a garden center, you may have to ask for
it. Chemists also sell small packets of sulphur tablets, but there
coated in sugar and I'm not too sure if there any good, they're also
very small, you you'd need to buy a lot of them. Once again I'm not too
sure sa to the cost, I've never had to buy it.

Sulphuric acid: Get it from any car mechanics, ask for "Electrolyte",
it's used in car batteries, again I'm not too sure of the cost.

Nitric Acid: Depends on cost and avalibility of sulphuric acid and
potassium nitrate, your better off making it rather than buying it,
but if you do want to buy it, try asking at photography shops as it's
used in cleaning photographic plates.

Amonnium Nitrate: Used in fertilisers and is very hard to get unless
you make it, making it's easy, simply tip a bottle of ammonia into a
jar of nitric acid. Amonnia costs about £1 a litre. You can pick
ammonia up from a chemists (Boots sell it) and it's used in cleaning.
