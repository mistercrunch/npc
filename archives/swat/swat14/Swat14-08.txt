These things are brilliant to have fun with, they are next to harmless
and are fairly loud.

All you need is:
1 Shotgun Cartridge
1 Rocket Engine
Some balsa wood.
Drawing pin
Epoxy resin

1) Cut the top off the cartridge and tip out all of the shot, you can
   leave the wadding and powder in it if you want.

2) Pop the rocket engine inside the cartridge, make sure that the
   engines exhaust is pointing outwards.

3) Make up some balsa wood fins and glue them around the body of the
   shotgun cartridge (see a file I did in a previous issue on makeing
   rockets)

4) Glue a small piece of balsa wood over the back end of the cartridge,
   make sure that it covers the percussion pin. (use the epoxy for all
   this)

5) Press the drawing pin half way through the balsa wood over the top
   of the percussion pin, make sure that it doesn't touch the primer
   or it may explode on you.

Now that's just about it. All you've got to do now is to shoot it
down a street into a solid object. Your little missile should look like
this:

      _____
     \     \
      \     \
     __\     \____________
    |             |S.G    |
    | Engine      |shell  |=| <- Drawing pin
    |___      ____|_______| 
       /     /    
      /     /
     /_____/

There extreamly simple in design and they make a hell of a bang, you
don't even need the powder in the cartridge to wake up an entire
street.
