  You want to know someone's Hotmail password. You'd try social 
  engineering but you don't get out much. It's time to put your HTML
  knowledge to use. First go to http://www.hotmail.com and save it as a
  .htm file plus save all the pictures on it as well. Now you have on 
  your computer what looks like the Hotmail home page. Now search the
  world wide web until you find one those submit forms. These are web
  pages that require you fill in the text boxes and pressing the submit
  button will e-mail the text to the preset address. Now open up these
  pages in Notepad and edit the HTML. Just take the code from the form
  and stick it in the Hotmail form so that pressing the login button
  will e-mail the text from the Username and Password boxes to your
  address. Now rename the resulting page as http://www.hotmail.com.htm
  then upload it to your web page and put Hotmail in your links page.
  Now when someone follows this link they think that they will be going
  to http://www.hotmail.com when they are really going to the local .htm
  page of the same name. They will enter their Username and Password and
  that in turn will be e-mailed to you. Of course if someone found this 
  out you would be fucked so apply for the web space under a false name 
  and address, ditto for the e-mail address you register it to. If you 
  are interested in hacking, phreaking, programming or pirating then 
  e-mail me or visit my web page.
