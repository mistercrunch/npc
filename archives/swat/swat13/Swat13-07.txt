Here's another of my little toys I came up with over new year.

You will need:
Hundreds (if not thousands) of match heads, or a load of jet-x engines
Finely ground black powder (grind up some jet-x or rocket engines)
Small container with a lid
Fuse

(1) Fill the container 2/3 with black powder

(2) Stir in your match heads and/or jet-x engines

(3) Screw the lid on and insert the fuse (usually through a hole in the
    lid).

Well that's it, when you light the fuse and throw the bomb it should
explode as usual, only it will throw out all of the burning match heads
and/or jet-x engines. Match heads won't burn as long (probably only a
second or two), but jet-x engines will burn for a short while longer.
