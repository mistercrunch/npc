Since there is going to be a few changes to the magazines content (well
more stuff like general articles and reviews etc). I have decided to
write about security and paranoia. I can only speak from my own point
of view and my experiences, so make what you will of it.

I cover a lot of underground activities, I'm a phreaker and have ripped
off BT more times than I care to rememebr. I'm a hacker, (ok so I don't
follow "hacker ethics" but then again some would say my morals are 
screwed up), I have hacked into a few systems. I'm a pyrotechnition,
I have made and set off more explosive devices and started more fires
than I can remember. Finally I am a carder, I only tend to card
software off the net, but that's not the point. Am I paraniod? no. I
have no reason, I have only ever come close to being arrested three
times, each time (twice for explosives, one time for assult) I got away
with it. Some might say I'm lucky, truth is I never got into trouble
over things I had done, I have got into troube for things other people
have done. Why? because of security. I have a huge list of card numbers,
they are encrypted on my hard drive making them useless for evidence.
My room probably contains more chemicals than I know about,ok so on
there own they are ok, mixed and prepared in certain ways and they
become explosive, if the police come knocking at my door I'll just
dump the lot down the toilet. Both my computer hard drives can be wiped in
a matter of seconds, and all of my disks can be destroyed also. I don't
think all that much of my security, I talk over my home phone line
about stuff that I'm doing, I also use a PBX from my home phone line
quite often. Some of you will be saying that I'll get arrested very
soon. I don't think so. Let's look at some of the most common things
I do that a lot of you all seem to think is stupid, first off all
the chemicals and print outs in my room, there not hidden, my chemicals
is in a box labled "Explosives", and a load of print outs in just
put next to my computer desk. My chemicals could be flushed down the
toilet or tipped out of my window, my print outs can be saturated with
lighter fluid and touched if need be. It would take seconds to destroy
all that evidence. Second is the PBX, I've used both UK and US outdials
from my house, I know that I can't stop them getting my number, and all
that, but BT isn't going to bust me, why? because BT still get there
money from the 0800 number, it isn't BT's problem if some guy abuses
an outdial. I talk quite openly to people over my home phone line about
what I've done. According to a lot of you, you will say that it's
stupid. Why is it? is the police force going to spend all that time and
money bugging my phone line, I think not. I'm not wanted by anyone, I
cover my tracks when I do something, that I'm good at. The point is,
the police aren't going to spend a lot of money trying to catch some
guy that commits minor offences. Look how many times the Pentagon has
been hacked, have they caught everyone that did that? no they haven't.
If on the other hand you hacked the pentagon and got a lot information
that threatens US national security, then be paranoid. You don't have
to keep all of your information buried in your garden. Keep it encrypted
by all means. I know that a lot of you will have reason to be paranoid,
but ask youself, is my paranoia justified? if the police expect that
you bombed some place, the chances are they will have you arrested on
the spot, they can hold you for up to two weeks according to the
terrorism act. If you hacked into something, ok the police can arrest
and keep you for a few days (depending on what you did). Printouts on
hacking systems means nothing, if it's information about a particular
system (the pentagon for example) and it's information that you got
from the server itself, then be scared. But common sense tells us not
to keep shit like that. Credit card fraud, ok this is kinda dodgy. But
sources tell me that fraud squad don't have to investigate something
unless it's a grand or over. They're not goning to be bothered with
30 dollar software scam, but saying that I always use an outdial and
a dodgy ISP account when carding software. If the police where to
raid my house I could be arrested. But for what? what does the evidence
prove? fuck all. As long as I know for sure the police are not
investigating me I'm ok. The only way to prevent and investigation is
to be careful. As long as you use common sense you will be ok. If you
are truly elite in your chosen field of the underworld, then you will
cover your tracks along the way, thus preventing you from becomming
under investigation in the first place. If you slip up on security when
doing a something big, then destroy/encrypt all evidence, and lie low
for a couple of months, it isn't worth losing any sleep over. Anything
small, encryption or hiding stuff will surfice. The police could raid
every house in the UK, I can assue you that 95% of those houses would
get bused for something, weather it's mearly a pirate video/cassette or
A huge arms/drugs cache. Why don't they? they can't afford it. They
will not spend loads of money tring to catch a small time crook, when
there's more dangerous people out there. So just ask yourself to justify
your paranoia, then compensate with security.

(just thought tha I'd add, it doesn't hurt to have a boot disk loaded
 with PGP set to wipe your entire dirve, for emergencies only)
