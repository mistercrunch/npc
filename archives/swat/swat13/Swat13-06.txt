  Before I get this file started I would like to say that I do not 
  approve of mailbombing. Unlike most people I actually mean this but if
  you're going to do something wrong then at least do it right. Now on to
  the good stuff. We all know what mailbombs are, a chance for you to 
  release the malice inside of you by sending 25,000 STMP packets to 
  lamer@aol.com with something along the line of AOL sucks ass! in the 
  subject line. But I hope you also know that you are breaking the law. 
  However its too easy to get caught. There's an easier way. One day when
  I was bored on the internet I sent an e-mail to Bill Clinton:
  president@whitehouse.gov and I got back an automated message thanking
  me for e-mailing the white house. It was a big e-mail, 5k long and that
  got me thinking. Say someone was to send a mailbomb to lamer@aol.com
  consiting of 200 messages all 1k long. That's the same as sending 40 
  e-mails all 5k long. So the next time you send someone a mailbomb don't
  send 200 messages to lamer@aol.com, send 40 messages to the automated
  president@whitehouse.gov from lamer@aol.com. Sending 40 mails to an
  address that probably gets 200 mails a day is not a crime. Don't you
  just love using the US Government to mailbomb people for you? Make them
  work for you instead of you working for them. Note: If some clever joe
  decides he wants to send lamer@aol.com 10,000 e-mails and so thinks
  that its elite to send 2,000 e-mails to the US president then I'm
  afraid he's in for a big shock. If you are interested in hacking,
  phreaking, programming or pirating then e-mail me or visit my web page.
