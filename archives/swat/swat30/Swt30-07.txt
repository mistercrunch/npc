This is my first post for SWAT so heres what I offer. I got these dialups
from a government system - NO, I didn't hack it! This was readily available
information (free to the public!). I will be monitoring this system
for a while and will try to post updates if anything changes.

For links on hacking, phreaking and cracking, try my newly designed site
www.sin2k-productions.co.uk and follow the link on the main page

Any how, have fun.
