[I've only included this because of the gore content, and because it's
 kinda funny, not because it's a very practical article - Phreak]


  Hopefully if i get time i will ge round to writing a whole series of
these survival texts. Basically, because you are reading this i assume
you are some kind of anarchist/terrorist and these 'hobbies' could lead
to the guys in the flak jackets with yellow symbols on (The FBI!) paying
you a visit, and i don't mean coming round for coffee and a bickie; in
these circumstances you will need a place to stay and survival knowledge,
that's what i hope to provide.
 These are coming in a funny order, i really should be doing on preparing
 for survival first and then finding somewhere to stay, etc, in a nice
chronological way, but fuck that i hate order! So this article is on the
provision of food whilst away on your errr.... holiday.
 
 Right, there's only a certain amount of food tins that you can carry, so
i wouldn't bother with that much, remember you may need to get away fast.
So really all you need is the stuff to get food with,, in this country
there is an abundance of bunny rabbits, that's right,,, those cute 
ittly furry things are quite nutritous aswell !!! If your a vegetarian,
just remember that this is an alternative to having your arse-hole stretched
by your new cell mate and friend.... BUBBA.
   Right so, now how to get bunnikins, well you could make a veriety of traps,
but the best method is to get a gun.. A 2.2 air rifle is ideal, one for around
 £40 can be picked up and you really do need a scope, a cheap £10 one should
 do... Practice regularly and keep it cleen, ad the scope set up correctly,
also find out which brand of ammo gives best accuracy with your particular
weapon.  A rabbits kill area is basically the neck and head, anywhere else
then you will just injure it and it will run away,, which is a waste of ammo
and just tight on the bunny really. Right so find a field where you are staying
with a stone wall that you can creep behind without bunnikins seeing you,
(one near a rabbit warren helps) then pop your head and gun over the wall and
look at the bunnies.. You should select one close to you, and with its head
visible... breath in, aim, hold your breath and shoot............you can
start breathing again now... with any luck you now have lunch ready to be
prepared.

 You now need to skin and gut the rabbit, not for the squimish.

 Get a very sharp knife and lay the rabbit on its back and put the blade
in between its ribs on the higher chest area and with a firm wrist draw the
knife down the rabbits underside until the base of the belly, a sawing
motion may help!! dig a hole and with the belly facing downwards open up the
cut you have made to alow the guts to fall out... DO  NOT  ALOW  THE  STOMACH
TO BURST it stinks and will contaminate the meat! use the knife to cut the guts
where they are still attached.
 Now use the knife to cleanly take the head off. Next cut along the fur on the
legs and peel the skin back...This now alows for the rest of the skin to be
peeled back like a banana and discarded.
 The rabbit can now be cut ninto various joins and cooked over an open
fire,,, it tastes like chicken and be warned,,,don't use a sick rabbit, or an
old one 'cos it won't taste nice or do you much good.
