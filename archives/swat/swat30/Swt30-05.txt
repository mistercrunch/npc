Just a comment on the article about the Menwith Hill article:

>Along the way Mark Thomas rung somebody up in France who used to work for
>Menwith hill, asked a few questions and then casually explained to him that
>in answering him he had infact broken the official secrets act

The 'someone' was ex-Mi5 man David Shayler, in Paris (on +33 149 290
145). The following Monday, you may remember that a student was arrested
under the Official Secrets Act
(http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_668000/668663.stm), with the
media reporting it was due to her Shayler contact via the Mark Thomas
Product, she asked that no-one ring him via a blue boxed call, as it'll
only lead to more people monitoring him if he starts getting loads of
calls from bored phreaks.

> The actual point of the protest was against the echelon project

It was actually the Space Based Infra Red System, which is part of the
'Son of Starwars' missile defence project. Many people were there because
of Echelon as well, but it wasn't the main focus of the days protest.

>This meant that various people were dressed in luke skywalker outfits- hours
>of amusement.

I was with the only Luke Skywalker there the night before, and he wasn't
definitly dressing like that because of the project being dubbed 'Son of
Starwars' not 'Windows Find Utility'!
