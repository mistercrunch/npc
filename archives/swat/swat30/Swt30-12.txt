               Its penitentary steel
               This ain't no freestyle battle
               All you bitches getting stabbed
               With your mouths open
               Tryin' to come up off of us
               You and the clouds hoping
               Smoking weed
               It's like a Shermine
               Bitches think they learned to fly
               But they burn mutha-fucka they deserve to die
               Talking about you "Getting Money"
               But its funny to me
               All you fuckers living bummy 
               While you fucking with me?
               I'm a self made Millioniare
               Phreak livin', out of prison
               Pistols in the Air {Air} [Ha Ha]
               Geddon remember when we used to ring your mom at the house?
               And tell the bitch that we would kill her ourselves?
               Now its all about the e-zines
               You copied our style
               Your shots couldn't drop us
               We took it and smiled
               Now I'm back to set the record straight
               With my A-K
               I'm still the Phreak that you love to hate
               Mutha-fucka I'll Hit Them Up

[TnC]

               crash and mash through London
               With my gat looting, shooting, and polluting your block
               With fifteen shot,
               Cocked glock to your knot
               SWATeam Mafia click moving up another knotch
               And your [?"Pop stars" pops?] and get dropped and mopped

               Be approaching
               In the wide open, gun smoking
               No need for hoping
               It's a battle lost
