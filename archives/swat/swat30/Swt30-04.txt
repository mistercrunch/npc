Now this month, I went ahead and interviewed Brakis-Lopex, or Brakis as
he is known. Brakis agreed to the interview and it went well.

So ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls, children of all ages, I bring
"An interview with Brakis". :Þ


--------------- INTERVIEW START: Sunday 12th June, 00:30 --------------

Me:     Ok, hiya mate

Brakis: Hello

Me:     To start off, let's have a little introduction.
        What alias's/nicknames do you go by, and what others have you
        used in the past?

Brakis: Well back in the early, early, early days I was known as Razor
        and then Blaster and finally Brakis which has been fucked about
        with so much you wouldn't believe...

Me:     What about Barakis, how did that come about? Because your nick
        is Brakis isn't it?

Brakis: Spelling error, it is Brakis yeah

Me:     Ok, sweet
        So how long have you been in the "scene"?

Brakis: hphpphphphp fuck, em...... 4/5 years
        yeah.

Me:     lol, nice..
        So how did you get involved, in the early days?

Brakis: I was a silly little kid who enjoyed making crank calls from
        phone boxes

Me:     heh, what would be your personal favourite one that you did?

Brakis: Well the "Insuring of the Penis" was pretty cool but I have
        recently done one where I phone up the Bermuda international operator
        and shout SPUNK incredibally loudly (it sounds immature but who gives
        a fuck)

Me:     lol, nice one

Brakis: Yeah it should be on the website pretty soon

Me:     :) So how did you get involved with the bombs/destructive side of it
        all?

Brakis: I took GCSE (Standard Grade) Chemistry and found me copy of the
        Anarchists handbook, but as far as destruction goes that is just down
        to the fact that I am a naturally very angry kind of person

Me:     heh, I figured that from the Chris incident (see early SWAT issues)
        So, how long have you known FireStarter?

Brakis: We are cousins, so I guess about 6 months(!)

Me:     So you are cousins? nice

Brakis: No it isn't. Can you imagine what it is like being related to a nutter
        like that?

Me:     lol.
        How did SWAT come about? gimme all the gory details :Þ

Brakis: Swat came about as a kind of mixture of the two of us just messing
        about and causing havock during the holidays.
        It was originally known as A&D Anarchistic, but shit just seemed to grow
        and grow. In the early days it was crank calls an pipe bombs but it
        became so much more (people will remember from the early issues of SWAT
        how backward we were back then)

Me:     Yeah, I remember
        ahhhhh, the good old days

Brakis: 'spose

Me:     But they are better now

Brakis: it's like anything, the more it developes the better it becomes

Me:     Yeah
        I suppose this is a controversial question, but I just have to ask it...

Brakis: Go on

Me:     What are your feelings about the group known as Anti-Social (A-S Mag)?

Brakis: erm, they are a bunch of ferret-shagging, cock-sucking, fudge-packing,
        dildo-wiping, happy-hardcore loving bunch of script-kiddies who should
        enrole in basic literacy skills in night school so that they can try and
        spell there names correctly without sending the English Language to that
        concentration camp they call and E-zine ever month.

Me:     LMFAO
        Very nicely put..

Brakis: But seriously, I have a lot of respect for Farmer Gaydon and his vicious
        band of Ferret-fucking pixies...

Me:     <sarcasm> yeah, who wouldn't :) </sarcasm>

Brakis: heh, wonderful thing isn't it?

Me:     yep, sure is...
        We havent seen any articles from you recently. Can we expect to see
        anything soon?

Brakis: Yeah, Issue 30 promises some shit from me, unfortunately I have had a bit
        of shit recently at work and also with my little girl but at the end of the
        day I always make time for SWAT and also there should be some new sound files
        getting put on the website.

Me:     nice one
        should be a good read

Brakis: Hope so

Me:     SWAT 30 is looking good so far

Brakis: I should think so too

Me:     So, anything interesting happen in your life lately, that you wanna share
        with the world?

Brakis: Intersting stuff?
        Let's think......
        Well my little girl took her fist steps this monday

Me:     awwwwwwwww
        congratulations dude!

Brakis: Cheerz

Me:     Buy a drink on me (after you give me the weed you said you would, on you)
        If that makes sense

Brakis: [in a scottish accent] nae prob (I think)
        If it was a boy we would have called it Phreakazoid

Me:     lol
        sweet
        Recently, KRASH has declined in number, to now only 3 members, what are your
        feelings on the subject, if any?
        Do you have any contact with any KRASH members, or the head, Chicane?

Brakis: Well I liked the shit those guys put out, but I try to keep of these
        sometimes strange disputes that some groups have. Chicane is someone I have
        never really spoken to so to be honest I am fairly indifferent towards him.

Me:     ok, that's cool
        I mean, FireStarter knows him obviously, as SWAT and KRASH used to have an
        affiliation, so that's the only reason I asked

Brakis: Yeah it's cool, like I said I read the mag, liked it but Chicane never bothered
        me so I didn't bother him.
        But with reguards to the affiliation, it is MY OWN opinion that KRASH were
        just using SWAT as a kind of bridge to the bigtime. It was a kind of onesided
        "affiliation"

Me:     That was the oppinion of quite a few people as well, and now they've made it,
        they seem to have drifted, no offence to Chicane, or anyother KRASH members
        though, they did a good job

Brakis: Yeah they did and I wish the guys good luck but to be honest if i had my way
        SWAT wouldn't affiliate itself with guys who couldn't give as much as they wanted
        to take

Me:     Is it ok, if at this point we take a little 5-10 minute break? I gotta go
        pee.. I mean freshen up... shit, that sounds wrong

Brakis: ok, sure

----------------------------- Interview Suspended and 1:05am ----------------------------

At this point, I went to the toilet and Brakis went off to make a sandwich and get
himself a beer.

------------------------------- Interview Resumed at 1:17am ------------------------------

Me:     ok, lol, that took longer than I thought

Brakis: a good Caffreys takes time to settle

Me:     You drunk yet?

Brakis: nope

Me:     Stoned?

Brakis  with all respect mate I dont do that shit so much now

Me:     good, I wouldn't want you revealing something and them coming after me for it
        <heh>

Brakis: That would be a shame

Me:     ok, recently, there's been alot about Overhead GSP maps, real overhead photgraphs
        What is your oppinion on the subject?

Brakis: To be honest, and I say this without trying to give offence, but people who take
        stock in this paranoid bullshit I treat with the same contempt and loathing as
        the religious nutters who wake me up on a monday morning wanting to fucking talk
        about god

Me:     lol, ok
        I'm gonna try to link this in with Echelon, or to most people, "Big Brother"
        Now, there is little doubt that this DOES exist, but it's just hard evidence that
        is lacking..

Brakis: Well fair enough, dont get me wrong, there is something in this shit but I stopped
        giving a fuck when I realised I couldn't square to the whole world

----------------------------- Interview Suspended and 1:25am ----------------------------

I suspended the interview at this point as I accidently made a noise waking up my parents
So me and Brakis arranged a time to continue the interview the next day.

---------------------- INTERVIEW Resumed: Sunday 12th June, 6:53pm ----------------------

Me:     Ok, cool
        Before I go on, one thing I forgot to ask...

Brakis: what was that?

Me:     How did the nickname "Brakis" come about?

Brakis: When I was 15 (a long time ago) I read a book where the Dark evil Cyber Knight
        kind of guy was balled Brakiss... I didn't like the words "Bra" and "Kiss" being
        together so I changed it a bit and then shamelessly nicked it

Me:     lol
        -=Firestarter=- always had me under the impression that you got it off some
        japanese instructions for something

Brakis: Oh yeah, about a year after that I saw it, the word came up again, "Bra-Kis",
        in my Matsui Video instructions

Me:     ok, linking on from what I was saying about Echelon, but not really the same...
        ... from September, ALL internet traffic though UK ISPs will be sifted through
        and monitered closely by MI5. Including e-mails and other things such as web-sites
        based in the UK.
        What effect do you think that will have on the UK Hacking community, if any?

Brakis: Well while anyone can appreciate the need for security, too much security is a
        bad thing but what you have to remember if hackers and phreakers are going to
        busted effectively it is not the security equiptment used to catch them that
        should be updated, it is the legal systems that are used to try them...

Me:     Good point

Brakis: A lot of it stems from the natural paranoia that a lot of people in the
        "scene" have

Me:     hmmm, true
        ok, moving back on to you..
        ... what do you personally "specialise" in?

Brakis: drinking
        shagging

Me:     lol
        I mean, more underground activities :)

Brakis: seriously, I am a Social engineer and information gatherer

Me:     nice

Brakis: I used to have a finger in every pie but nowadays I just stick to what I am good
        at

Me:     How old are you now, anyway?

Brakis: I'm not telling
        Older than you

Me:     ok
        Do bombs and so forth still play a part in your life as much as they did in the
        beginning of SWAT?

Brakis: hmm interesting. well if someone is pissing me off then I am still partial to a
        good fire bombing, but there are stolen chemical stock piles in parts of the
        country that have lain there dormant since the days of Evil Onion and the Candyman

Me:     really??

Brakis: yeah

Me:     I think I'm gonna go on a treasure hunt

Brakis: ill tell you more later

Me:     nice.... :P

Me:     So your still up in Scotland right?
        How have things changed for you since the early days of SWAT?

Brakis: I am living in Scotland just now. but I have travelled extensively and lived in
        Spain, Germany and Holland but it's like anything, as you get older you have
        other commitments that in some cases even override you political and
        philosphical beliefs. e.g. my use of credit cards has changed dramtically from
        say about two years ago

Me:     lol
        Do you think the underground, or your activities in it, have taught you any
        valuable lessons, or anything else that you would like to share with us

Brakis: Yeah, and this is good advice for anyone.
        If you come to a bridge or a wall, that you think you can't get cross because
        some prick or company says you can't, you just have to find the balls and
        intelligence to get past it.

Me:     cool
        Ok, to finish with, is there anything else you would like to say to the
        good readers of SWAT, or any shouts you want to give?

Brakis: no

Me:     heh

Brakis: yeah
        no, I would like to thank everone who has kept the mag going for as long as it
        has, and shouts out to everyone who I speak to regularly.... except Pred (joke)

Me:     nice one
        ok, thanx for the interview dude, and thanx you for your time
        it's been a pleasure to interview you

Brakis: nae prob, bob
        I'm off to the pub

Me:     lol


------------------ INTERVIEW Terminated: Sunday 12th June, 7:16pm -------------------

And there ya go people

That was the interview I conducted with Brakis, hope you enjoyed and found it enlightening
into the world of Brakis :)
