This is custom amde but a well known design.

Get 5 coke cans and cut the tops and bottoms off of 4 of them. Flat cans
 don't work so keep them round.

Make a hole big enough to put a match, rocket igniter, or something that
creates flame.

Put another small hole in the top of the cannon.  I put a little funnel I
made from some scrap tin in this hole, but that's not needed.  All this hole 
is for is loading the propellant: lighter fluid.

Now, wrap the whole damn thing in about 20 layers of duct tape.  It should be
airtight and not melt.  After a few usings, it gets pretty hot.  If you have
enough duct tape around the thing, it won't matter if it melts a little bit.

Now, take apart one of those £2 cap pistols to get a gun handle.  If you want
to try to hook the trigger up to a switch to ignite the lighter fluid, that's
fine, but I find it's not worth the effort.  Now, melt the plastic on the parts
of the gun that are going to be touching the duct tape and some of the duct
tape where you are going to put it. Push them together and slide them around,
so you get a good bond.  If possible, try to wrap some duct tape around the
handle and top of the can for some added strength.

Now, build a sight.  I just melted and taped a 1.5 cm pvc sewer tube I got at
a local plumber's to the side of my bazooka.  Make sure the handle and sight
are placed where the most comfort and workability can happen.  Make sure you
can stick a tennis ball in the end of the tube and squirt some lighter fluid 
into the hole in the back of the tube with ease.

Think about cutting out some foam rubber as some padding.  A round tube, no
matter how light, can get very hard and heavy after a while.  Cut the foam
rubber to fit the curve of your shoulder.  Now, cut a slit halfway between
where the tube and your shoulder is going to go.  Stick the duct tape through
there, then wrap it around the cans.  You are going to be very grateful for 
this shoulder pad.

Now, to test it.  Put the tube on the ground with a tennis ball somewhere in 
it.  Squirt a little bit of lighter fluid into the hole in the back, and move 
as far away as possible and still be able to light it.  Try holding the match 
with some pliers or something, because lighter fluid isn't very forgiving 
stuff.  Now, light the stuff through the hole.  If it worked, the tennis ball
will go flying out the front of the tube.  If not, it might blow up.  Once you
have recovered from your burns, you could try again.

Here's a great thing to try: soaking the tennis ball in gasoline or kerosene 
before sticking it in the tube.  You get to shoot fireballs or comets and 
light on fire whatever is on the other side of the flaming tennis ball's 
trajectory.  My bitchy neighbor was gardning and I zinged one right over her 
shoulder.  You never saw someone so fat run so fast!  Great effect.


        My site has been down for ages, as like piratecity.com.  Who knows when
they will go back up, when when they do I will probably will not.  The M.A.B
group will still function but it will not display.
