Lungs? What the fuck?
======================
It came as a pretty big surprise to me when after asking several people
on the net from all over, none of them knew what a lung was (not even
ganja guru Phreakazoid!), and so I decided to educate them in my humble
little way.

A lung is a piece of home made equipment used for smoking pot (cannabis).
Out of all the weird and wonderful creations i've used in the past,
me and several friends all agreed that lungs are definitely the strongest
and most effective (my favourite!). If you plan on using a lung properly
then make sure you have the next few hours free. Here's how to make your own.

EQUIPMENT
=========
Plastic Bottle - size depends on what you personally prefer. Experiment
and you'll soon figure out your favourite. For now just a normal 500ml is
just fine.

Plastic Bag - If you were using a bigger bottle than the above then you
would probably need a bigger bag, but with this one just a normal clear
sandwich bag will fit nicely.

Tinfoil - As you'd expect.

Safety pin - For piercing the foil

Sharp Cutting Thingy - Must be suitable for cutting up the bottle.

Black Tape - Black looks cooler than sellotape :)

Lighter - One of those round ones you get are best.

Piece of string - About 5 inch long is fine.

100 Kit Kat Chunkies - Prepare to go do battle with serious munchies!

METHOD
======
1) First before I go into the lung I will describe how to make a good
bowl from the cap that will last a long time. Take the little rubber
thing out of the cap and sell it to your little brother. Tell him its a
hat worn by very small aliens. Heat the cap in the middle using the
lighter until it is starting to melt. When it is soft enough quickly
use the other (round) end to push a hole through the top of the cap.

                            | --PUSH LIGHTER END THROUGH TOP THIS WAY
                            |
                          _\|/_
                         |  '  |
                         |     | --BOTTLE CAP

2) (This is a brief description, i'm expecting you already know how to
make a bowl.) Place a bit of tinfoil over the hole so it is completely
covered and use the black tape to tape it on. Now push the foil down a
bit to make your bowl. Use the safety pin to put a few rows of very
*SMALL* holes in it. Your cap is now finished.

3) Onto the actual lung. Cut the bottom of the bottle off. Sell it to your
little brother, tell him it's a hat for larger aliens than before. Cut
as low down as possible so that we get a nice big smoke chamber. Now cover
the sharp edges with some tape to avoid putting holes in the bag.

4) As you may have already guessed, you now simply tape your plastic bag
airtight over the bottom of the bottle. Suck and blow in and out of the
bottle (from the part you drink out of, idiot) to make sure there are
no holes in the bag and that it fits nicely into the bottle. If there
are just patch em up with tape.

5) Tape your piece of string to the bottom of the bag, so that when you
have sucked the bag into the bottle you can easily pull it back out.

USING THE LUNG
==============
At this point it should have become pretty obvious why we call it a lung.
To use it, first suck the bag right into the bottle. Now, heat up your
pot and crumble it into the bowl as you do. Experiment with amounts and
you soon learn how it doesnt take much to get you battered, but still
dont be scared of putting too much in, the more the merrier!
Now, if you have a friend they can help, or you can sit down and hold it
between your knees for this part. Burn your pot with your lighter and at
the same time pull your string nice and slowly and get a nice thick
smoke sucked into your bottle. Then you've pulled the bag all the way out,
take off the cap and huff it all back. DONT suck it in slowly, this
will hurt your throat. Just take a sharp breath and hold it in a long time
for maximum effect.
Usually you can put the cap back onto the bottle and get a few more good
burns out of it.

It should now look something like this:

           __
          |__| <-------CAP
          |  |
         /    \
        |      | <------BOTTLE
        |      |
        |      |
        |______|
        |      |
        \      /
         |    |  <------SANDWICH BAG
          \  /
           ||
           *
           *
           *  <------STRING
           *
           *


It's cheap and easy to make, you get a quick concentrated hit, you dont need
to use as much pot and nothing goes to waste. The only disadvantages with
lungs are that it does not filter out impurities like a bong and doesnt
cool the smoke like a bong, but in my opinion they are still much better
because of the hit.

You may decide that you'd prefer one of greater size sometime, but I only
intended this text to be a guideline to lungs. You should hopefully be
able to make bigger ones without much help now.
I personally find 500ml nice and easy to take back, and if you have nice
thick smoke it will still knock your socks off so dont worry.

Well I hope I have explained everything clearly enough, if you need any
more help then please dont hesitate to e-mail me.
I hope my work will bring you great amounts of joyful feelings!
Have phun!
