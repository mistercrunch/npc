GOOD FIRE BALL

Well this is a good fire ball,
Take an air gun/rifle and a can of deodorant. Sit the deodorant out
side on a bit of wood or something with a burning rag behind it. Shot
the can and there ya go a good fire ball.

KENNY BONG

Well what you need is a plastic Kenny doll.
A saw.
Tin foil.
Some tape.

Well what you do is you saw a wee bit of the top of the Kenny doll so
there is a hole!

Poor some water in to the hole about an inch will do. Now take a screw
driver and heat it up with the lighter make a hole in Kenny's mouth.
Now take a straw and slide it into kenny's mouth. Take some tin foil
and make it in to a shap that will fit in to the hole in Kenny's head
so its a dent. Tape it to Kenny's head. Take a pin and make a few wee
pin holes in the tin foil so when your burning the weed the smoke can
get in. Now i think that is it now use it.
ENJOY!
