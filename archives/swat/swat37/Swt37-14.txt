The following is a list of several e-mails posted on our MechaPosse 
e-mail list, a completley useless talk-about-shit list BlazingMonga
built @ egroups.com,
Anyways, Blazing Monga & Kai Alive decided to attempt to get high on
Nutmeg, and as an added bonus, wrote handy realtime reports onto the
e-mail list, so, for any readers interested, here's a typical Nutmeg
Cycle(TM). Bear in mind that these two are normaly extremely
linguisticaly caplable and almost never have spelling mistakes...




MSG: 01:08 FROM BLAZING MONGA BEGIN::

Hey today: Me and Andrew took a bunch of nutmeg and we
thought it had not worked again.

That was nearly 5 hours ago.





Its working.

Aye, I am pretty sure of it now.

Current stuff: heavy arms, shivering, tired eyes,
hyper, blurry/fuzzy vision, twitching, feeling cold,
more hyper.

I dont get like this after coffee.

I cant type for shit now either, this message took a
lot of spelling correctioning.

Ok I do believe that nutmeg totally fucking worked
dudes. I am sitting here at 4:45am on my pc, andrew
has just left my house. I cant really remember how he
got into my house but he was here and we played
perfect dark, or rather we thought we played PD.
Anyway lets talk about the "nutmeg cycle"

Upon consuming vast quantities of nutmeg, thou shalst
meet the following stages and so commence the nutmeg
cycle:

Stage 1: Feelings of stupidity and failure. Feeling
very sick and may throw up, nearly. And some other
stuff.

Stage 2: Shaking, shivering, cold, heavy arms, funny
wet feeling, warm patches, twitching.

Stage 3: Memory lapses (severe ones), dizzyness,
inability to focus/concentrate AKA being pissed.

Stage 4: Who knows?..............I will find out after
I leave stage 3.

Fairelly dudes.

other symptoms.
