  Strictly this isnt Hacking, but it fits into the same category as hacking.
Make sure that no-one can see what you are doing, this is quite obvious and
you could easily get caught, what happens depends on what you do and your
school.
  When you go into your school, computer room the computer will usually be
booted already, restart it and when it tries to boot from a disk drive then
hit the F8 key, you should get a screen up saying thing like:

 Windows 95 Startup Menu
=========================
1. Normal
2. Logged (\BOOTLOG.TXT)
3. Safe mode
4. Safe mode with network support
5. Step-by-Step confirmation
6. Command Prompt only
7. Safe mode Command Prompt only
8. Previous version of MS-DOS

and things like that, if you dont, restart and try it again, if it doesnt work
then someone has done a good job. If this does happen then insert a Boot Disk
and try to boot off that, if it wont select the boot disk at startup then try
to get into the BIOS, if you cant get into the BIOS then the system is pretty
much secure and you will just have to do some of the other things and try to
get around much more.

=========================
 How to make a Boot Disk
=========================

At home go into DOS and type
FORMAT A: /S
then copy EDIT.COM and other utilities that you might need onto the disk.


======================
 Disabling Futurelock
======================

This only really works if you know that the password for the account that you
are using, the default user account at our school doesnt have a password, if
yours does read ahead on how to blank it.
Log out of your username, then log on again, Futurelock should have
disappeared, but some Windows security things are still on, Not all of them
mind you :), wanna know why it has dissapeared this is because the
Manufacturers of FutureLock made the program start at Bootup in to windows,
but when you log out all programs are closed, then when you login Futurelock
doesnt start again because the computer hasnt booted up, it has just logged
in!

===========================
 Killing Windows Passwords
===========================

This is pretty simple, boot into DOS by either means of a Boot Disk or F8,
type DIR C:\WINDOWS\*.PWL
this should bring up a list of Password files, to access the users accounts,
you need to delete their password files(or rename them if you dont want to be
detected), but this cannot be done at first because they are Read only, Hidden
and System files so type
ATTRIB C:\WINDOWS\*.PWL -R -H -S
now delete or rename at will and the users account should be yours.

Mix and match all these things and you should have the run of the system, :) if
not email me with your questions at screecht@scr33ch.f9.co.uk

Have Fun, Screech
