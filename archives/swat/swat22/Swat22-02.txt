Right, i would like to say a few things about the mailing list since i
am now handling that admin side in SWATEAM. Im writing this article to
hopefully persuade more people to sign up to the mailing list. 
	The mailing list at the moment has 825 people on it, and it 
constantly growing by about 1-10people everyday. I would like to get 
the mailing list to 1000 soon, so here are some reasons why you should 
sign up for the mailing list.

1) You get the mag mailed to you the day it is released.
2) You get send any important SWATEAM news directly.
3) You get on the good side of us by leaving us these type of comments:

comments: Love this mag, nice 'n' UK for once in a fucking while
comments: ABSOLUTLEY AMAZIN
comments: I love your shit!... 
comments: Great site, found a lot of usefull info :-)

So basically the mailing list is always growing but when you compare 
the number of hits v. the number of subscribers it "just dont add up" 
so come on people hit that submit button.
