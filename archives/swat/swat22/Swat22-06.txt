	Hi again this artical is an attempt to educate u all and the subject 
of drugs, there effects and what harm they will do to u, if any.  This is 
going to be a fair representation of the drug culture as i am not biais to 
either banning drugs or taking them, at the end of the day its up to u but 
i like to know what the things i take r doing to me even household things
like Anadin.  I hope u find this useful and take it into concideration when 
u r about to take any of what i write about in this series of articals.  I 
don't in anyway condone the use of illegal substances, this artical is for the
prepose of information and entertainment only.

	I will first start with what cannabis is.  Cannabis has various name
some of these include joint, blow, hash, scunk, super scunk and bush.  Cannabis
is found in two forms it can be a brown block of resin or dried out leaves, 
i would say that resin is the more popular of the two.  
There are three main ways of taking cannabis:-

1) Rolling.  This involves the use of tobacco. The cannabis is heated up 
	     with a lighter which makes it soft and easy to crumble. After
	     heating it the cannabis is crumble evenly in the tabacco. 
	     Then it is smoked like a normal fag.
2) The Bong. There are many types of bong about but they all have the same 
	     aim which is to allow the cannabis to burn and produce smoke 
	     which is then directly inhaled in to the users lungs. Since 
	     nothing else is added then the effects are stronger and more 
	     intense.
3) Eating.   This needs little explaination but it can be added to food or
	     usually hot drinks like tea and coffee.  This has the same 
	     effect as the other two except it take alot more to get u 
	     high or stone(term use to mean the user is under the infulence).
	     The reason that alot more is needed to get u stone is because
	     some of the THC is broken down by stomach acid.

	The chemical which gets u high is called Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
or THC for short.  The amount of THC in the cannabis will vary from block to
block and also depends on the type of cannabis u have e.g. super scunk is 
stronger than scunk. The THC there is in the sample then the more effect it 
will have on u and the stronger it is.  Cannabis is made from a plant called
Hemp or `cannabis sativa' this plant is very use full in a range of areas 
but cannot be used as it is illegal. Hemp is used to make canvass which is 
a very tough cloth, also the pulp is used to make paper and fuel. The seeds
are suitable of human and animal consumption, and also the oil from them 
makes a good base for paints and varnishes.  There are a great many use 
in medicine for the blossom and leavse of the plant but these cannot be 
exploited because of the tight restrictions by the law.


	It is important to realise that everything a person takes will 
effect them differently than the effect the next user experences and this is 
the same with cannabis.  The general effects of a good smoking session will
make the person become talkative, will be laid back(feeling of well being),
they could get intense hunger, can cause uncontrolable laughter and  users 
can become very sleepy.  These r some of the more well know effects. There 
are also effects such as increased heart rate which could cause the heart to 
stop, these effects have no evidence to support them and so i beleive that 
until further research has been done that  these effects should be ignored,
but let this be at your own peril.  Most of the research into cannabis was 
done in the early stages of a project called Reefer Madness research with 
was performed on monkeys and was proven not to be a source for good information
as the project was badly regulated and the results were discounted.


	There r a certain number of effect of cannabis which r untrue, like 
the supposide fact that cannabis kill brain cells well it doesn't unlike alcohol.
Cannabis stimulates receptors in the brain as does alcohol but cannabis doesn't 
kill any brain cells but alcohol does.  I is also a myth that people die from 
cannabis because there is evidence that cannabis is thousands of time safer than
the most common household goods eg. alcohol, nicotine, valium, aspirin, and caffiene
these kill far more people and they are all legal. Cannabis has never been linked 
to any death because it is virtually impossible for a person to overdose on it as 
they will become sick long before they r need the death limit.  It has been said 
that cannabis will cause memory lose and this is true when the person is high 
but as soon as the THC is broken down the memory lose dissappears.


	There is also the issue that cannabis is a gateway drug and leads to the use
of harder more addictive drugs.  This is ture but only if the user has a weak mind,  
everyone should respect their body and should realise what the effects r of the 
substances they inhale, inject, ingest or smoke.  This means that if u r a strong 
minded person then it will not be a gateway drug for u by this i mean that u didn't 
start to smoke cannabis just because your friends did, so again it totally depends on
the persons, the fact that u r reading this artical tells me u have some repect for 
your body, so keep it up.  In the case of drugs no one seems to be bothered about the
facts there is just a big arguement for the use(drug users view) or against the use
(antidrug societys), A good example of that antidrug part has arisen just recently 
in my area of Newcastle-under-lyme.  A private school Called Newcastle School
(Supprizingly) has found that a number of students in their fith form have been 
found in pocession of a small amount of cannabis and ofcourse the media(Sentinal-
the local paper) r using this to there advantage saying how bad the drug is, not 
taking into account the facts of the drug.


	Anyway thats all for the moment speak to u all soon.  If u would like to
