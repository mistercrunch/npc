Password Choices:

Using a password such as a birthday, phonenumber, spouse's name, or 
favorite TV show are all bad choices. Some guidlines are listed below 
for choosing a decent password.

DO:

Use a mix of numbers and letters. Punctuation is also good
Use a mic of upper and lowercase letters if possible
Use abbreviations or portions of words put together
Use more than four characters in the password
Change you password often; once every few months is good, once every
few weeks to be extra sure.

DO NOT:
Write a password down anywhere
Tell anyone  your password, especially over the phone or via email
Use words you could find in a dictionary
Use words that are easily guessable: proper nouns, repeated characters
(AAAA), character patterns (qwerty, asdfghjkl)
Tell anyone root password
