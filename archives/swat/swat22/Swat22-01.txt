This might already be common knowledge to a lot of people but theres a 
lot of ways of actually getting a bank account in a false name but 
heres a step by step guide. This requires a lot of patience and time 
but is well worth the effort.(Dont expect an account overnight) 

Are you sitting comfortably then I will begin.

STEP 1 - Firstly you need to get some fake id to actually have a hope 
in hell but thats what i'm going to tell you. You need to build up an 
impressive amount of id which will range from library cards, mvc store 
cards, post office savings account book,etc,etc,etc.

STEP 2 - Where to get the id from? First off find the local branch of 
MVC ( NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH HMV) these are stockists of cd's,videos 
that give you a club card for free, you have to fill a form in at the 
shop but you can give them any details that you wish and a card will be
sent to what ever address you give them. 

STEP 3 - Find a supplier of fake id such as in magazines like maxim,
fhm,bizarre,viz, to save you the hassle of looking heres the addresses
to some:

Sadbros (Dept CAD)      Marville Direct Ltd        LSL, Issuing Dept
PO Box 1664             Dept FHM9                  PO Box 24600
Ringwood                Marville House             London
BH24-3YZ                39 Philip St. - Chester    E9-5UZ
                        CH2-3BZ

Buy a good quality id ( Not the ones that say private detective ) Fill 
in the details of the id as you see fit.

STEP 4 - Go to the local WHSmiths and get a free loyalty points card 
sent with the name that you intend to use as your alter ego. Also join 
the local Elecronics Boutique (Computer games shop) as they also give 
you a card with your name on. Remember the more cards you have with 
your name on then the easier it is to convince people thats who you are

STEP 5 - Type up/scan a phonie letter to yourself because using your 
id that youve already gained you are going to get a solo bus pass from
a post office(Make sure they dont know your real name in the post 
office or the next one wont work) A solo bus pass can be bought for 
£10 and for this you will get a weeks worth of bus travel but you dont 
want it to travel ,you want it as extra id, so take your id along with 
a passport photo and they give you your bus pass there and then, They 
have to ask for identification but as they only think you want to use 
it to travel the will swallow any id you give them.

STEP 6 - Now using your MVC card, WHSmith card ,EB card , Solo bus 
pass and your fake id card you are going to join the local library. If
questioned on how you came about your fake id card( The one with your 
photo on it ) you just have to pull some shit like you used to have to 
have them the last place you worked/they were needed to access the 
computer room at college.The fake id with photo is usually quite 
convincing on its own ( I once fooled the police years ago once when I 
was underage drinking with a fake id)  Your library pass should arrive
in a few days.

STEP 7 - If you would like more id then use your imagination , get a 
post office savings account, join a video rental shop ( Join an 
independant one, dont try join the likes of Blockbuster as you have to 
have a barcode tatooed to your arse just to set foot in the shop) Maybe
you know a friend who works at a place were loyalty cards are given 
away (Boots, victoria wine)

STEP 8 - Remember to have a lot of convincing id before trying to open
a bank account, like I said earlier that time is the most important 
thing here as over a long period of time a lot of id can be gotten 
such as a Television license can be gotten in any name that you tell 
them( TV licenses are considered to be Id all on there own)Remember to 
research each peice of id and how it is obtained before trying to 
obtain it yourself ( Just have a friend go to enquire about 
club/loyalty/rental cards first to scope out the stuff thats needed 
and then you can go and take the exact id needed )

STEP 9 - When it comes to opening an account try and stress the fact
that you only want an account for saving( Dont worry as once the 
accounts set up this can be changed ) and it would also help if you 
went to open an account with a bit of money (Dont open an account with 
£1) Once you have an account opened for a while you could maybe get an
overdraft( Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me!)

Its not my fault if you do any of this stuff and get into some serious 
shit (Mainly by getting caught)I do not take responcibility for your 
actions ( If I told you to put your dick in the fire , would you?)
so be careful as this is intended for information purposes only ( Its 
strictly theoretical)
