-= Carding =-

There are many ways of getting peoples credit cards numbers, the 
first and easiest is setting up a fake website such as a porno or a 
shopping website. When people order it sends you their details and it
helps if you say there was an error and redirect them to another 
website. This raises no suspicion because their order actually comes.
You can also hack websites this requires hacking knowledge but i have 
come across 2-3 front page enabled websites which the administrator 
is as thick as shit and forgot to protect the  /_private folder. I 
checked the source code and the form was posted to 
/_private/order.txt so i typed it into the address bar and there was 
all the details.
Any of your mates work in a shop just get them to write down a couple
of credit card numbers every so often.

Dont send all the goods to your house, try and convince one of your
stupid friends that if you could send some stuff to his house. 
Another good way is to buy gift certificates and purchases products 
using the certificates (this usually works the best but make sure 
they send the number to an email address like amazon.co.uk)


-= Stealing =-

You shouldnt really steal from houses, well do if you want but look 
at the advantages of stealing from a business. First you get better 
stuff, you dont have people waking up in the middle of the night and 
chasing you to the other side of your town. Its more fun and its not 
very nice if you nick something what they really like.
I prefer to do it professional (not chucking a brick through a window 
to get in for example). Some shops and businesses have a metal stripe 
along the window, if this is broken the alarm will go off. There is 
two main ways of getting past this. Get a BB gun or a pellet gun 
shoot about 5-10 cm above the line it shouldnt crack much shoot 3-5 
more holes around the hole so it will make a shape then push it the 
square of what ever you have made should come out. Stick you hand in 
the stick a non plastic coated wire with chewing gum to one side of 
the metal line. Do the same with the other side then crack the window 
so you get in with the alarm not going off.
A laser pen is good for disabling infrared alarms or 'wireless 
alarms' just aim it in the receiver and the alarm wont work.


-= Phone Calls =-

Ever wondered what them brown boxes (10x15cm big) outside peoples 
house for what NTL of other cable companies put in. Well you can 
attach a beige box (or one of them £8 phones from argos, just split 
the end off) to them, i think the stripy white and blue wire and the 
stripy white and orange. Use a lighter to melt them first so the 
metal is showing, it helps! It beats trying to break in to one of 
them big green box things!
Or get a dictaphone, recorded a 50p tone and say to the operator that 
the number 6 doest work so when she tells you to put your money in 
play the tone and get a free phone call. You can download the tone 
off some websites or just record it your self when you put a 50p in 
the phone.
