Intro
~~~~~
If you didn't already know, sodium chlorate can be used as an
explosive.  It can be bought as weedkiller from most garden
centres / hardware stores.  Get the one which says "Fire depressant
included", this way you wont blow your hand off.


=======================================================================


Device one - plastique style
~~~~~~~~~~
You need: 

~ sodium chlorate weedkiller
~ sugar
~ water
~ jar
~ microwave


Put some weedkiller in jar.  Add the same amount of sugar.  Mix them
up well and grind them to a fine powder.

Add a little water and mix again until it is a thick mush.

Take the mixture and tip it on a plate, (make sure the plate is microwaveable).
Put the plate in the microwave for 20 seconds - no longer

The mixture should then be stuck together, but easily mouldable.  Mould
the mixture into any shape you want and then put in the fridge for about
30 minutes

Tada! - youve got solid blocks of sodium chlorate!  Light them and run!

They can be used as incendary bombs or just cool smoke bombs


=======================================================================


Device two - the deoderant bomb
~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps in device one untill you take the mixture out of the
microwave.  Mould the warm mixture into the bottom of the deoderant can and
stick a match in before it gets hard.

Device three - the glass jar bomb
~~~~~~~~~~~~

~ glass jar with lid

Screw the lid on and put the fuse in so it is touching the weedkiller mixture.
