Intro
Today we're gonna make a really simple Javascript , embed it in an e
mail and send it to a friend with Outlook Distress or Express.
All we are going to do is write a simple script with the alert or
confirm command and put in a message like
"WARNING: Possible Virus threst dectected. "
Then your so called frind will be scared and will probally not
read the email. The message will pop up before the email is displayed
becuase we are putting the code in the <head> tags.


Lets Get Started
Send an email in OutLook Express in the HTML format or rich text
as Micorsoft would rather call it. Insert something  like the following
into the email in between the <head> and </head> tags.

<script language="Javascript">
window.alert("WARNING:A Possible Virus Threat has been dected in this email!"
You can write anything in here. Be creative.);
</script>


That was very, very simple becuase Javascript functionality in email
isn't that great and you can't add things like the close command to
give the user an option to close the email.
This is very simple but if your experinced in things like VB script
or whatever you can do some cool things.


Sorry this wasn't anything spectacular. I haven't really explored
what you can do with things like this. This is my first text file
for Swat. If you manage to do anything cool with this then email it
to me. You really can write anything and you can scare your
gullable mates. Try putting something in it like
"Your system is owned by the leet haXXor Bambi and I am currently
formating your C drive as we speak" Some people get really scared
and think they are being hacked.If you don't put the code in between
the <head> and </head>
tag then the user might not think that it's anything to do with
the email but they will see the message after they see the email's
text.Remember to put the text you want inside quotation marks
otherwise it won't work.
