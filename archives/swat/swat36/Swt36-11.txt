All you need to make a cheap trip wire for any bombz with a fuse.
1. wire wool
2. Aluminium foil
3. 6 volt battery (nick em from road work light)
4. A good length of electric wire
6. 1 clothes peg
7. Electric tape
8. Container (to put it all in)
9. long bit of strong string(or fishing line)
10. wire cutters
11. A bit of plastic from an ice cream tub or any thing.

HOW TO MAKE

Right then get a nice amount of wire wool, roll it into a sausage shape.
Then wrap it in the Aluminium foil flatten both ends and twist them. Put
that to one side for a bit. Now get the clothes peg and squeeze the end
so that it opens up, wrap a bit of Aluminium foil around each of the bits.
Get about 10-40 cm of the electric wire and strip of about 5-7 cm off
both ends. Connect this to one side of the peg (where the Aluminium foil
is). Right do the same again but put this on the other side of the peg
make sure the are well connected. Squeeze the end of the peg again and
put the bit of plastic between them, put a small hole in the end of the
plastic and tie the string to it. now cut a small V in the container near
to the top. 

 Connect one off the wires to the battery. Now take a bit more wire and
strip 5-7 cm of each end. Connect this to one side of the wire wool
sausage. Connect the other wire to the other end of the sausage. Now make
sure there is a bit of plastic between the peg because now you connect
the wire to the battery, if there isn't any plastic between the peg the
wire wool will set on fire. Put all this into the container with the
string coming out of the V shaped cut.
You connect the bomb by making a small hole in the wire wool sausage and
pushing the fuse in onto the wire wool. Tie the string to some thing like
a tree and hide the other part in a bush.

HOW IT WORKS

when the bit of plastic is pulled from between the peg it connects the
circuit which makes the wire wool set on fire this then lights the fuse
on the bomb


  My mates and me did this on some wasteland near us. A old man walkin
a dog walk though and a second later an air  bomb shot in the air and
nearly gave him a heart attack.
