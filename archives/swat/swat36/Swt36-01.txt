Hi y'all again,

I am thinking about making my future articles into a mini-series of
anarchistic pranks and general terrorism items to be performed on
paedophiles...hmmm....yep I think I will. I will call this
Mini-series: Fun, Pranks and Pedo's.

Finger Splicer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This I got from a poster in Whitehall Building (yes the one across
the street from the Prime Minister's house!) If you want to know how
to infiltrate some Government buildings check the note at the end of the
text.

You will need:
1 Brown A4 envelope 
1 Mousetrap
1 Razor blade
Soldering equipment
Glue
1 Hated individual

Instructions:
Take the mouse trap and cock it back and clip the wire in. Tie it there cos
you don'twant it to cut off your fingers while you're working.
Solder the Razor to the whacking bar of the trap ( I call it a whacking 
bar but it's the bit that mashes the mouse) so that it faces upward
and when tripped it would slice the board where the mouse would be.

Get the envelope and write the victims name on it. Open the envelope 
and glue the trap in the middle. Seal it up and leave on victim's
doorstep, ring their bell/knocker and RUN!!! When they bend down to
pick it up they'll maybe pat it to try and guess whats inside and when
they do...CHING!!! their fingers have been cut to the bone or if they're
young or very old it can sever the digit!

I don't think you should post this because: A) Postman may notice the 
bleeding, 
B) Metal detectors won't let it through. Also I don't recommend 
INNOCENT poeple as this is not really very nice and totally off the track
of the Anarchist idea: Do it for a purpose.
I can only recommend pedo's as this will stop them wanking over li'l 
kiddies.


You know the drill, questions, comments, ya-de-ya-de-ya...

:GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS:
Just a thought but if anyone wanted to bomb or do something to Downing 
Street or
the surrounding offices then this is how you could get in. Just get 
hold of a PC box, 
put on a suit, and look really pissed off. I went contracting with my 
dad last christmas
and we had a call to replace a machine in one of the Whitehall offices. 
We took the new machine
and made our way over to Whitehall from the Cabinet office building. 
When we got there
they didn't have us on the personnel list. We explained that we were to 
replace a PC
but they didn't know anything about it. As soon as we showed them the 
box their eyes
lit up like kids on Christmas morning, it was pathetic. They let us 
right through
and left us to roam the building! After we set up the new machine we 
tried to find the exit and
got lost. We eventually came out of a door in the middle of Downing 
street. So we
had a look around the hall of No.10 and then left through the big black 
gates!. We 
could have left bombs everywhere and security wouldn't have known 
anything. I still
have my pass to Queen Anne's Chambers and the Cabinet offices if 
someone wants to
copy them and infiltrate the goverment, mail me below and I'll think 
about letting you
have one.
