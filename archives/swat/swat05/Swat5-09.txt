SWAT MAGAZINE ISSUE FIVE: MAY 1998*
***********************************

 ANARCHY FOR MUSICIANS

We have all been in our local music shops and been patronised by the 
shop assistants have we not ? well I give you a way to get your own 
back......

By the way if your not a guitarist then don't continue reading because 
this will seem very boring.

First of all go in and ask to try out their loudest amp-70 to 120 watts
should do the trik- and then once you have farted around with it on 
your guitar for a couple of hours turn the master volume up and keep 
the amp switched off and look at the pickups or something for ten 
minutes (close to the door) and then as you as you hear the next cunt
wanting to try out his guitar AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHH
his hearing gets sent to hell and back.
