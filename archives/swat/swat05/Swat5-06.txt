		 Mark 15

I read in a book about bomb disposal and it was talking about the IRA
one of the explosives was the Mark 15 Coffee pot bomb. After pondering
over this for about 5 minutes I came up with a reasonable idea of how
to make one.

You will need:
10cm antenna arial
Fuse
Gun powder, Nitrocellulose or any other low explosive.
Coffee jar.
Super glue.
Tape.

Ok now:
1) Punch a hole in the lid of the coffee jar just big enough to
let the antenna through.

2) Fill the jar with the explosive.

3) Put the fuse through the antenna so that a bit comes out of both
ends.

4) Put the antenna half way through the hole in the lid and glue it in
place.

5) Put more glue on the threads of the jar lid and screw it on.

6) While the gluse is drying compleatly cover the jar in tape, so that
if it smashed it would still retain it's shape.

Thats it.

Just light the fuse and throw it, if it smashes when it lands, it
doesn't matter it will still blow apart every where.

Variations:
Put a pipe bomb inside a glass jar. I did this with Crisp and Shadow,
glass went about 5 meters in every direction.

Put a pipe bomb in a glass jar full of petrol.
