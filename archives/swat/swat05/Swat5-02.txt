-=Buying sodium chlorate weed killer=-

Well this stuff can be easy to get, you can buy it from most garden
centers, it comes in 500g, 1Kg and 5Kg tubs.  Prices range from £1.90
to £15. It should have at least 50% sodium chlorate although this
can be increased (see file 3). Like I said in the last issue you
can't normally buy this stuff unless your 18, in order to piss on this
law, we at SWAT send in Crisp (because he's the youngest member) to
buy it.  Try to think of good excuses if they ask why you want it,
don't say "So I can make plastic explosives", try "My mum has just got
an allotment and it needs weeding" this should work because this is 
a powerful weed killer.  Also if you are going to make a lot of
explosives you might like to think about buying a large tub instead of
lots of little tubs, remeber that they may get suspisous if the same
person comes in to buy weed killer for the fourth time that month.
If you are only buying small amounts then go to diffent shops each
time. 

-=Separation techniques=-

Sodium chlorate is a salt, I don't know what the fire depressent is,
I might be a salt too I don't know, but that's not the point, the point
is that they both have different crystal formations, so we are going to
use fractional crystalization, this works on the princible that big
crystals grow bigger at the cost of the small crystals, (follow so far)
Righ what you need is:
Two large jars
1 Pencil
Some Cotton thread
Kettle.

OK first off put the ketton on to boil, one it's done that pour the
water into the first jar and add some weed killer, keep on adding it
and stiring it, until there is a small amount left undissolved, now
pour the contents of this jar into the second jar and leave it to cool,
Large crystals should form, scoop out the biggest one and tie some
thread around it, attach the other end to the pencil.  Heat the
water in jar 2 and stir it so that the crystals dissolve, now once
this starts to cool suspend the large crystal in the solution.
Repeat this process until you have a huge crysal with loads of
medium sized crystals.  They should look different shapes (the chlorate
and depressent) find out which is which, by making a small amount of
explosive and lighing it. Collect up all of the sodium chlorate and
crush it until it is very fine, like talcum powder. The apparatus
should look like this once they are set up:

-=Detanators=-

A simple yet affective detanateor can be made from a fat antenna arial
or a thin copper tube.

Materials:
Sodium chlorate
Magnesium powder (grind up a magnesium block)
Antenna
Epoxy resin
Fuse or solar igniter

1) Mix the magnisum powder with the sodium chlorate at a ratio of 1:1
   This will make flash powder.

2) Put a small ammount of epoxy resin in the end of the antenna.

3) If you are using a normal fuse then drill a small hole in the side
   If you are using a solar igniter then insulate the wire and add a
   wire extension to it.

4) Fill the tube half full of flash powder and insert the fuse or
   igniter (put the igniter into the tpo), fill it up with more flash
   powder.

5) Epoxy the other end.

It should look like this:

	|###|
        |###|
        |@@@|
        |@@@|
        |@@@|
	|-----------
        |@@@|
        |@@@|
        |@@@|
        |###|
        |###|  That is if you are using a normal fuse.

### = Epoxy resin
@@@ = Flash powder
--- = Fuse

-=Plastic explosives=-

SWATeam Type 1:
This is simple and effective with a detanation of about 2500 m/s.
You will need:

Sodium chlorate
Vaseline

Put 10g in a plastic bag and add 90g of sodium chlorate, mix them well.
Set it off with a detanator.
***********************************************************************
SWATeam type 2:
Petrol
Polystyrene
Sodium chlorate
Motor oil

Put the polystyrene in the petrol (to make napalm) and add the oil,
(like the anarchists cookbook file C4.txt) now mix in the sodium
chlorate, set it off with a detanator.
Ratio: 1:1:5:0.5
***********************************************************************
SWATeam type 3:
Lecithin
Mineral oil
Sodium chlorate
Magnisium or aluminium powder.

Put all of the ingreidents in a plastic bag and mix.
Ratio: 0.5:10:20:20
***********************************************************************
SWATeam type 4:
Sodium chlorate
Diesal
Mix 96% sodium chlorate with 4% Diesal, mix them well and set it off
with a detanator.

-=Sodium chlorate incendiary powder=-
This is a very basic incendiary powder that I have mentioned before,
just to re-cap it's 1 part sugar with 1 part sodium chlorate.
If it explodes (like if it's inside a pipe) then it will not burn but
if it's left in the open it will burn for ages.

-=Basic pipe bomb detanation=-

This nearly blew me up so don't fuck around with it.

Materials:
1 empty bean tin
Sodium chlorate incendiary powder
Large Pipe

(1) Fill the pipe with the incendiary powder and close up both ends.

(2) Put a load of the incendiary powder into the bean tin.

(3) Put the pipe into the bean tin.

(4) Light it and run like fuck, you should have about 5 seconds to
    run.  I recommend a good steel pipe for this because it takes
    longer to heat up, unlike the copper one that I used.

When this explodes it will give off a lot of smoke and flames, as well
as shrapnel.  I recommend that you use these in places like phone boxes
or an enemies car.
