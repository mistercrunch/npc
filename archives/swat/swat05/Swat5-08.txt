SWAT MAGAZINE ISSUE FIVE: MAY 1998*
***********************************

Vig Bomb 

This one is one of the easiest projectiles to make and is great for 
scaring little kids and O.A.P.s

INGREDIENTS:

Camera film case
Fizz tablet (dissolving indegestion pills eg Andrews antacid etc)
water or vinegar (for better results use vinegar)

METHOD:

Fill the film case three quarters full of the liquid put in the tablet
put the cap on the case and turn the unit upside down and (QUICKLY) 
place it next to the subject you have chosen to scare the shit out of 
and then run like fuck (and I mean like fuck)

The case will explode sending an the black bit about sixty feet in the
air and causing an almighty boom that is sure to empty the crevice of 
the nearest person.
