Bin Bomb: Incendiary.
By -=The Firestarter=-

I have invented these simple devices, they are called bin bombs, but
they are really cool fireworks that will burn a bin to the ground.

You will need:
1 sheet of A4 paper
1 or two boxes of matches
(optional) Gun powder, or Sodium chlorate incendiary powder.
Potassium permanganate/sugar mix.
1 Fuse (slow burning are the best)

1) either fold a paper water bomb, if you don't know how then just
make a square out of paper and tape.

2) Make a hole in the top of the paper square/water bomb.

3) Cut off all of the match heads and put 1 box worth in the bottom of
the container.

4) Put the Gunpowder/Incendiary powder/Pottasium permanganate sugar mix
in the main part leaving it only 1/4 full.

5) Put the rest of the match heads in.

6) Insert the fuse.

Ok just light the fuse and watch as the match heads light and either
cause the paper container to explode sprayin gburning match heads
every were or it will burst into flames spraying fire in all
directions. Pretty cool.
