Here is my FIRST ever hacking article (that is practical and works),
Ok, I'm no elite hacker and this is probably the easiest thing to do.

Ok, first of all you will need to know weather or not you have NBTSTAT
on your computer, so go to Start/run and enter C:\command.com this
will open up an MS-DOS window, now type in NBTSTAT, if it says:
"Bad command or file name" install AOL on your computer, then uninstall
it, this will leave NBTSTAT and all of the requireed drivers on your
system. If it says something along the lines of:

"Displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections..."
then you are ready to go.
Ok, you will need to be online (I.E on the internet) and goto
start/run/c:\command.com
then type in NBTSTAT -A (I.P address) the A must be a capitol, the best
way to get IP's is on IRC, just type in /dns (nick) and you'll be given
there IP address, just enter this as the IP.
Now it could say:
"Host not found" <- This is a system that you cannot hack get into 
                    using this method.
or a table will appear on the screen with the header NETBIOS,
ok there will be a name on the top left corner of this table, WRITE
THIS DOWN. Now type in Edit LMHOSTS
you should be presented with the DOS edit program, type in the IP,
press TAB 3 times and enter the Name that you wrote down, now save
this file in the C:\windows directory, now go to start/find/computer
and type in the name and click the button to start the search, a few
seconds later you will be presented with an icon with the computers
name by it, just double click on it and browse around there hard drive.
I tried to gain access to a brazilian goverment computer doing this,
I couldn't be arsed to hack the password so I crashed it using 
winnuke2.
Well have fun, and if you find any interesting computers take all the
data you want and mail me the IP address.
