The Basics.

Way back a few months ago -=The Firestarter=- found out that when you 
use your tone dialler to dial residential numbers at a payfone, you get
one second free. This is ideal for shouting short four letter words at
your victim, or exchange scanning, however it is hardly any good for a 
prolonged conversation!!!
Fortunately after some thought I have come up with an idea which will 
give you the chance to talk for as long as you want on the fone without
emptying your pockets. 
What you need:
A small spade,
Wirecutters,
Wirestrippers,
A secluded payfone,
Good nite vision.
Its basically the usual Beige Box Kit which all you experienced phreaks
actually have already but for the beginners who don't have these, GET 
THEM.
Basically wait until its nite time and go out to the secluded fone, if
it has a reasonably big area of dirt or grass behind it then so much 
the better. Start digging behind the fone with the spade until you 
come across the wires. Keep the red and green wires intact because you 
need these to make calls. However through trial and error and cutting 
the two wires, find the one which sends the billing pulses to the fone.
Its these pulses which kick in after a second and disconnect you. 
Anyway, cut that wire and cover over with dirt to hide your tampering.
Go to the fone and enjoy calling out to where ever you like. Try 
splicing the wires back together once finished so that no-one reports 
it.

The Advanced Section.

For those of you who want to use this personal "fiddle" permanently 
without the gestapo figuring out your scam too quickly. There are ways 
of prolonging its life. 
Firstly, cut the wires quite far back from the fone so that when the 
gestapo dig up closer to the fone, all seems well.
Secondly, you may want to add a switch at the cut or further back 
behind a hedge to prevent you having to dig up earth every time you go
out to the fone. For this you can acquire a switch from your local 
electronics store and a good amount of copper wire, and if you don't 
have crocs in your Biege Box Kit then GET THEM. All you have to do is 
attach two crocs to two seperate strands of copper wire at the desired 
length and wire these up to the switch. Hide the switch in some grass 
or shrubbery (its beginning to sound like gardeners world) and there 
you have it!
Also, if you ever phreak from a payphone, it helps to do some damage to
it so that when the gestapo come to check out why there is less cash 
in the box than there should be, they have a nice explanation right 
there. Personally, I dont have to bother with this because there are a 
lot of Kappa wearing dance music fans who do the job for me. 

Have some fun with this and remember the disclaimer at the home page of
this site. I care if you get busted you know, because its like another 
victory for the establishment.
