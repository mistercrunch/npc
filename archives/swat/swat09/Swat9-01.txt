This month I am going to discuss one of the most useful skills
any phreak can learn. The way of getting access codes without spending
half your life trying thousands of passwords or loading up some duff
war dial program that does your computer more harm than good.
The only way to do this is to become good at Social Engineering.
Many of my colleagues ad DARKCYDE believe Social Engineering to be
a last resort after trying thoudand of codes or whatever. I think thats 
crap, I have Social Engineered conference passwords in five minutes 
compared with more "elite" phreaks who can spend a couple of years at 
a time on a single system. The way to become a good social engineer is 
practise,practise and oh yeah practise. I found I had a certain gift
for this kind of Phreaking when I was doing krank calls as a child.
Alot of it is just about confidence and being able to strike up 
a coversation with whoever comes in your way. If you have a verstile
voice this also helps I can do everything from a disgruntled Irishman
to a frustrated new york yuppie. Try to develope a style and use names 
that are believable. To me doing hard work is a last resort I wont 
ever try to manually "crack a system untill I have exhausted every 
social engineering route".  But unfortunately many Phreaks and 
Hackers are (I am sorry for being so Brutaly ohnest) nerds,geeks etc
ok alot of these people are the most dangerous men on the planet 
but they dont get out alot and as a result they are about as social
as a stone on its first date with a rock. So if you want to become
a good social engineer then get out and meet people talk,
Although if you are a total recluse and dont want ot leave your home
trying doing some really complex crank calls : see what you can insure
try random dialling on 0800 89 XXXX and have a chat with who ever 
picks up its all about confidence. Another thing to practise
is coming up with storeys try becoming a good bullshitter
(Read my previous on deception for this)




Any way if you budding Social Engineers have a problem or are interested 
in learning more about this technique then E-Mail me 
at BARAKIS@HOTMAIL.COM  And believe me I am the best person in the business
as far as Social Ecgineering goes (ask anyone at Darkcyde)


That's how Brakis social engineer's, he decieves people and twists there
words back on them in order to gain the information that he requires, it
works too. I social engineer in a different way, I use psycology. Instead
of tricking them into giving away information, I will usualy use a compleatly
different approch. Try to play with there emotions, make them feel guilty.
If you can get them onto the subject of "being in my position", try to get
worked up when it comes to hostile cases but don't get carried away, if
you feel that your going to lose the particular case move onto another
target with the line "Let me speak to your supervisor!", this will not only
give you another go but it makes your claim seem more genuine, I mean as
long as you can remain calm but appear to be stressed on the phone there
is no reason why you should lose. If they hang up on you then just phone
back. I've trained like Brakis, doing crank calls. Where as he tries to
insure his penis shapped car I will tend to find ways of winding people up,
get on there nerves, making them feel happy or sad. Of course every person
is different, each person has a unique personality, so I tend to build up
to it, giving me time to assess the person in question. You can always
tell by there voice, is it cheerful and chirpy it which case don't act all
stressed as soon as they pick up the phone, build up to it, create a kind
of freindship with the person, make it seem like your tring to be nice to 
them but your aggitated, remember as far as you know they could have an
unstable personality and explode on you at any moment. DO NOT piss them off,
make them feel guilty, make them think your jobs on the line. If on the other
hand you get some grumpty old git then be prepared to call for the supervisor
ASAP as these types of people won't get you very far, but try never the less.
I'll have to say it though women are easier to social engineer stuff out of.
Not wanting to appear sexist or anything but women are piss easy to get info
from, where as women can social engineer stuff out of men just as easy,
so I guess it goes both ways. Experiment and see which technique works
best for you, well all do things differntly.
