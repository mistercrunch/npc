Oh well back to the twisted and devious means of blowing stuff up! yes
i know that it's been a while since i wrote a quality article on the
dark art of pyrotechnics, ok the reason for this is that i've been
mostly workng on my hacking skills rather than blowing stuff up :o)
But just to let you all know that i'm still in the habit of creating
wonderful devices that go b00m i have come up with this wonderful
device! The dreaded Car Bomb Grade II

Ok the reason for the Grade II added to the end is because i have
all ready covered car bombs, but i came up with this more powerful
and more devistating device.

*Note* For the first time in SWAT Magazine i will be dealing with
high explosives.

Materials needed.

Lo-Sal (get it from Tesco in the salt section)
Vasaline
camping Stove fuel (white gasoline)
Domestos (or any other bleach)
Tobacco Tin
Nail
Frige magnet
Lead shot or a ball baring
Bic Biro
Electrical wire
Pins
Wax
Hydrometer
9v battery
Bulb igniter (see past issues of SWAT Mag)


Ok so have you acquired all of those materials? the total cost of 
it all will be under a tenner and can be purchased from just about
anywhere!

Ok first off we'll manufacture the explosive, this is the same
process outlined in the Anarchists Cookbook that turns ordinary
salt substitute into high explosive. 
Ok what this involves is heating the bleach with the salt in it, now
be warned that this releases chlorine gas, so i recommend that you
carry out this procedure in a well ventilated area, anyway, here is
the extract from the Anarchists Cookbook:



Take one gallon of bleach  place it in the container  and begin
heating it.  While this solution heats  weigh out 63 grams of
potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.
Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer
and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a battery
hydrometer  boil until you read a FULL charge.
 
Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it
is between room temperature and 0 degrees Celsius.  Filter out the
crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution again
and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.
 
Take the crystals that have been saved  and mix them with
distilled water in the following proportions:  56 grams per 100
milliliters distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called
"fractional crystallization".  These crystals should be relatively
pure potassium chlorate.
 
Powder these to the consistency of face powder  and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.
 
Now  melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax.  Dissolve this
in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline)  and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above)
into a plastic bowl.  Knead this liquid into the potassium
chlorate until intimately mixed.  Allow all gasoline to evaporate.
 
Finally  place this explosive into a cool  dry place.  Avoid
friction  sulfur  sulfides  and phosphorous compounds.  This
explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3
grams in a cube and dipped in wax until water proof.  These block
type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  Also  a
blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.
 
The presence of the afore- mentioned compounds (sulfur  sulfides
etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive
and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage.  You
should never store homemade explosives  and you must use EXTREME
caution at all times while performing the processes in this
article.


Right ok have you all got that? good. Now you should have the
explosive mixture for this device.
Now make a hole in the side of the tobacco tin, just a small hole
is needed for this, if it's too big then the chances of everything
falling out are quite high.

Now press as many ball barrings into the explosive mixture as you
can, try to cover the entire outside of the explosive as you can
with them, once this is done carefully pack it into the tin.

Now to make the ignition device. Ok these take a while to get
right, but it is vital that it works.
Take the biro tube and put a small blob of wax in one end of it,
before it sets, push two VERY thin pins though it, make sure that
they are not touching and there is a reasonably small gap between
then, they also MUST NOT move in the slightest, i.e. they have to
be pretty solid.
It should look like this:

# = wax
 ________________
_|#_____  <- Pin 1     
 |#
_|#_____  <- Pin 2
 |_______________ <- Biro tube

You get the idea, anway, now pop a ball baring into the tube and
make sure that it can slide freely up and down, if it can make the
two terminals touch then it's fine and it works, if not, then use
another slightly larger ball baring.
Once you have it made, seal the other end with some tape.
Oh yeah you can use mercury for these if you have any, you can also
by pre-made ones from Maplins - mercury tilt switches - a tad expensive
for what you get tho.

Ok now wire up one terminal of the bulb ignitor to the battery and the
other to the tilt swtich, leave the other wire free but be sure that it
cannot compleat the circuit, coz if it does then it'll blow you sky high.

Now glue or tape the magnet to the tin, we're almost done now.

Ok if this little device it attached to the fuel tank of a car and then
a wire run from the battery of the bomb (the battery is normally taped
to the side of the tin) and to the tilt switch (which is usually on a
slight angle - again taped to the side of the tin). 
Once the car starts up and hits a slight angle, the ball barring 
slides down to compleat the circuit, the explosive goes off, ball 
barrings rip everything apart, including the underside of the car thus
blasting the fuel tank - the fuel ignites adding to the blast and
everything around it is wasted. loverly :o)
