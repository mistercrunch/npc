I think i found this on The Registar (or somewhere like that), i found
it an intresting read so i thought that i'd include it for you to all
enjoy :o)

Yesterday the UK Government published details of its plans to allow
law enforcement magencies to access email correspondence. 

Now, for the first time, UK police will be able to lawfully read your
emails and listen in on your mobile phone conversations. 

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill is being positioned by
Government spin doctors as nothing more than a move to treat new
communications techniques the same way as conventional telephony, but is
already attracting criticism. 

Pagers and the use of the Internet will also be covered by the proposed
legislation which is expected to come into force later this year. According
to the Financial Times, the Government wants it on the statute books
before the Human Rights Act comes into being in October. 

Critics of the surveillance bill are concerned that giving officials the
power to demand access to encryption keys will open the door to a range of
privacy abuse issues. 

While the attempt to crack down on the use of the Net as a way of
distributing offensive and illegal material (be it from racist organisations
or paedophile rings) will be supported by most people, there is a concern
that the proposed legislation will be used as a blunt instrument. 

Failure to hand over a text-only version of a suspected email or give
the police access to the encryption key you are using could result in a
two year prison sentence. Another area of concern is that the police will
be able to grant their own warrants to use the proposed Act's powers to put
someone under surveillance. ®

So, that says a lot for our so-called government, looks like the scum want to
invade our privicy even more than they do now.
Anyone else read 1984...
