THis might work on some porly set up networks. The server is running 
novel 4+ and you have a Graphical login ( you login in when you are 
in 95 ). Then after you have logged in with novell wondows prompts you 
to confirm your pass. This is were things get fun. As you might know 
novel has v.good security so its a bitch to hack, where as 95 and 
security the 2 words should not be used together. Win95/98 has no 
security. So when you confirm the password in windows all user settings
get saved in .pwl files these are usaly stored with the use name first
i.e john logs in with user name john1 the file is called john1.pwl 
these can be found in the 95 directory c:\windows once you have found 
the file you simply copy the file to disk and go home and run a cracker 
on it. then you have the users password you can then go back to school 
and login as them. Well some of you may be thinking i can log in with 
the same rights as him any way. Lets try this example, 

TempesT = ME 
dumn ass computer teacher (miss huges) = admin

Me : miss i cant log in
adimn : why whats wrong 
Me : it says that my password is invalid 
admin : ok i will just log in and change your pass word
me : thank you
* admin logs in *
admin : ok, done it 
me : thx
admin : your new password is somerealyeasytoguesspassword
me : ok
* me walks away and gets on with the IT lesson *

after the lesson you go back to the computer she was using and copy
the admin.pwl to your trusty floppy disk and go home fr the day. 
While you are at home you have set up this .pwl cracker to get the
pass. By the morning / 10 mins later you have the admins pass. you 
then go back to school and (ab)use the admin account. If you want 
some thing eveil to do with it, then if your school keeps all its 
infomation about stundents on computers try and get all that, thats 
the equavilent to a 192.com search on EVERYONE in your school and 
getting more infomation, now i am sure you can do some thing with 
this.

If you have a program called SIMS and you find an exploit in it 
then PLEASE tell me.
