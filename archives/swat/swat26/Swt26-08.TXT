Ok so this is my first artile for SWAT so it may be a little crap. 
First to get this out of the way:

touch us, bizitch d:) By reading this you accept the above.


Ok now for some info about us. Anarchy With Explosives (A.W.E) is a 
small group of Anarchist's that spent their teenage lives blowing 
shit up. Over the past three or four years we documented our designs
of weapons and explosives and then recently put them up on the net. 
Our first page "Home Artillery" WAS CRAP! So we took it down and made 
another one in the summer of '99. It was crap too. So then I made 
another which was an improvement of both of them but it is still crap. 
So hopefully soon there will be a better site up on Pirate City. 
(the only server SWAT deem the best for underground organisations) 
Ok as things go there are numourous amounts of designs that we have 
in storage and we will release them a bit at a time untill the site is
up. Each design, which ranges from artillery to plastic explosives, 
have detailed blueprints with the instructions. Hopefuly I'll be able
to let you download the pics with the instructions. Ok on to

Well that basically the active members. There are more but they 
don't have expertise in anything. They just like watching us blow the 
shit out of stuff. Well any-way I am going to write a couple of articals
for SWAT Magazine showing you how to make simple guns to mortar cannons.
They won't have any pics in unless FS wants to put them in. But you'll 
find them all at our new site once it's up. Ok thats all I could be 
botherd to write now so watch this space!
