This month has been fairly good for us all here at SWAT, we are finally
getting back on out feet after slacking a little.

Ok a few of the banners where removed from the site lately, and we are
currently looking for another sponsor, now i really don't want to end
up using a porn site as a sponsor since they make sites look tacky,
so depending on how well the current banners do and how well the SWAT
CD (see article 2) sells will depend on whether or not we go for it. 
If the CD sells fairly well then i will remove ALL web sponsor banners
from the site and stick purly to either group ad's (like THN and Krash)
as well as those banners that have been asked to host in return for
favors/services (like Piratecity and Can-Host).

So if you want to help us out, then either click on the dailyRadar
banner (guns, gore, girls one) or sign up for free e-mail stuff (that
dodgy blue banner), heh you don't have to sign yourself up for it...

Alternativly, await the arrival of the SWAT CD and purchase that, all
profit will get pumped into the web site and the group which you will
all ultimatly benefit from. So far what we make is hardly noticable,
with the exception of a few new graphics, which i must admit are pretty
cool.

Anyone notice what was missing from the last issue of SWAT Magazine?
yep that's right, the "SWAT Magazine information" page, heh sorry
about that, but i dunno where it got to. Anyway it's in this issue so
you can all have a nice read of it!

Ok now i'll point out about the Hex codes released last issue, ok round
about a week after the issue went out i was informed that they where
mostly bogus!! OMG, but we can't blame Smurf for getting them to me,
or TNC who got them originally - so credit goes to him for getting.
Now the guy who's codes they _where_ is Jonathan Rees, who is, by all
accounts, a con artist. Not unlike Cyberthill, so SWAT takes great
pleasure in releasing the article done on him by Delight of H/\ck
P/\YT

Ok so my compuer went fucko on the day of release (hence why this is a
day late), anyway i know that i've missed an article from CiD3r about
DVD encryption ,so i'm afraid that will be in SWAT27 i'm afraid.

Anyway have fun!
