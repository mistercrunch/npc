Ever heard of an ISP called Freenetname? They give you a free UK domain 
name (.org.uk or .co.uk) when you sign up with them as your free ISP. 
The only disadvantage is that you can only register 1 site per account. 
Needless to say, there is an easy way to get around their security which
prevents you from registering multiple sites. 

After you've signed up and registered your first site, go through thre 
online process again. It will probably tell you "you can only register 
one account with Freenetname". This is because it has scanned your 
connection to your ISP. e.g."luser@aol.com". To fool it into thinking 
you're a different person, just sign up with a different free ISP and 
connect to the site through that one. After you've gone through the 
process again and you get to the screen where it tells you to download 
the software, DON'T. It will override your existing Freenetname account 
and/or probably crash your browser. Instead, since you've already entered
a username and password, all you need is the dial-up settings, which you
can configure manually. They will be the same as your existing Freenetname
account, but in case of any problems, they are: 

Phone number: 0845 0796889 
POP3 mail (incoming): mail@freenetname.co.uk 
SMTP mail (outgoing): smtpmail@freenetname.co.uk 

Your account will be "whatever@freenetname.co.uk", and don't forget to 
name it something different to your existing Freenetname account. 

You will now be able to receive and send mail from both accounts by 
connecting to just one, and upload your website using the same connection. 

Repeat at will to get potentially unlimited domain names! 

The only catch is that to receive your mail from all your websites,
you still have to connect to one Freenetname account. But Freenetname is 
no worse than any other free ISP. 

BTW you can remove the other ISP you registered with now! 


NO HARM
