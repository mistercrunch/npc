Jonathan Rees UNCOVERED

By Delight of H/\CK P/\YT

With lots of help from MANNY from TNC

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
So who is Jonathan Rees?  Well, if you are a regular reader of alt.ph.uk
you probably know him better as Hac_K1ng or Hexmaster.  He's extrememly
easy to spot, all his webpages look the same.  They are all selling
things that don't exist for ridiculously high prices,
such as free calls on vodafone, ATM hacker, etc.  Now most of us folk
would see straight through him but there are unfortunately a few less
experienced people (and let's be fair to them, they didn't know any better)
who have lost hundreds of pounds to him.  I have heard from a
not-so-reliable source that he has made thousands scamming abroad as well
as here. A lot of people want him.  In the same sort of way SWAT are
finding paedophiles (damn right, too) me and a few other people are finding
scam artists.


Where you can find more info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will be releasing a website on him.  I'll post the details to
alt.ph.uk once it's finished.

Why he PISSES me off
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh, this guy pisses me off a LOT.  This is why I've decided to release
this file on him. The reason?  Basically that he never gives up.  He'll
make a website selling non-existant software for £600 or something,
advertise it on alt.ph.uk, maybe someone will buy something, and then
anyone with an IQ higher than their shoe size will point out that it's a
BLATANT scam, flame him to shite, and then he'll shut down his website,
and what do you know, in a month or so the wanker's back up again scamming!!!
What does he think, that people will have forgotten or something?  Prick!

How we got this info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This information was gained using entirely illegal means.  Heh.  While
portscanning his machine I realised some kind sole sent him a program with
a Netbus trojan attached.  Connected to that, the average number of people
in his machine I noticed was about 5 or 6 (All grabbing files? I bet
his internet connection was like treacle!).  Luckily nobody did anything
lame like playing with his CD-ROM open/close function so we were all able
to get anything we wanted.  Cached passwords didn't reveal anything out of
the ordinary, and I couldn't be arsed to trawl through his registry.
Call me a script kiddie or whatever but I rarely use trojans because they're
now so detectable, it's just the fact that there was one there running and
I didn't see the point in trying to gain access another way to avoid the
script-kiddie label when I might have limited time.

What he had on his computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
However, this guy is what most people would file under "fucking stupid".
He had scans of bank transactions, used outlook express (so reading inbox.mbx
revealed interesting stuff), copies of email in text files, all the hex
files he was supposedly selling, etc etc.  Below are some emails he has
recieved, with some names/addresses obliterated because it's not fair
on those people, they just wanted their cash back.

As you can see from his emails, he obviously does a lot of wheeling and
dealing abroad.

So What bank accounts does he use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of them is located at Alliance & Leicester.

Sort Code: 72-58-10
Account Owner: Mr J.W.Rees

He gives his account number as 00000000, this is obviously fake,
although he does have a Transaction Reference Number 204-005034-71.

Another one is set up under a fake name at Abbey National in Ealing.

Account Name: Fincham
Account Number: X1196364FIN
Sort Code: 20-67-19

Another one is located at Lloyds TSB in Penzance.

He has given his true name and address for this one (see below).

Has he refunded anyone any money?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, to the person in Hong Kong, because they had a right go at him.
The bank form with transfer details will be available for download at
the site when it is up.

Where does he live?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The last known address we had (after much searching with Infodisk and
enhancing the bank form to buggery):

Mr. J W Rees
The Anchorage
Sunny Corner Lane
Sennen
Penzance
TR19 7AX

(01736) 871 476

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY WHERE HE LIVES NOW.

There will be a lot more information posted on the site when it's up.

Greetz to:  SWAT (Fucking TOP mag, guys), Manny, Accelerator, Scallywag.
