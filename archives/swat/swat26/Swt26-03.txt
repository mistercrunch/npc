-INTRO

I will be unknown to most of you SWAT mag readers so I'll just introduce
myself.  I have been hacking for almost 2 years, but have studied the
old methods from ancient US text files which I find in time capsules
buried throughout the web.  I have been reading SWAT mag for quite a
while and decided that it was my turn to help contribute to this wealth
of information.

-ANONYMOUS ISP

Anyway, a lot of you will want to remain anonymous whilst surfing and
hacking, and the most popular way of doing this is by using a free connection
ISP such as freeserve and current bun, and entering fake info.  Another method
is to steal someone elses ISP account, but this can take a lot of time
(although useful for revenge!).  I have found an ISP which you don't need
to sign up for and a simple Dial-up adapter can be used into which you
can enter any info you like, simple.  The connection is called 'Connect Free'.

To make the adapter:

Win 95-
Use Start/Programs/Accesories/Dial-up Networking/Make New Connection/

Win 98-
Use Start/Programs/Accesories/Communications/Dial-up Networking/Make New Connection/

I'm unsure about Win NT or 2K, but it will be relatively simlar I assume.

When in the connection wizard you enter connect free if you want instead
of My Connection.  You then need to enter the phone number:

0845 6621006 - 33.6K or 28.8K
0845 6621106 - K56Flex
0845 6621206 - 56K X2
0845 6621306 - 64K ISDN
0845 6621406 - 128Kb ISDN
0845 6621506 - V90

(PS. I always put 141 before the numbers when dialing from the UK)

You can then enter any user name you like (eg. S00PER HaCK3R) accompanied
by a password if you like.  Now you can't be traced through your ISP.

If you want to sign up properly for a domain name goto:
www.connectfree.co.uk

-HOTMAIL EXPLOIT

As many readers will know hotmail has always had its security flaws, but
this one is plays on other people stupidity!  As hotmail gets more &
more secure (Although M$ security will always be a joke) you may want to
use a method which you don't have to do anything to get into other
peoples accounts.

All you need to do is create a web page (free at www.geocities.com) or
post a message in a web forum which convinces people that you know
a way of M$ to send them other peoples passwords.  Then you need to
setup a convincing email address up at www.hotmail.com so that people
think it belongs to M$, mine is pwd_return@hotmail.com.  My web page
says that I hacked into a hotmail supervisors account and discovered
that if you send an email to pwd_return@hotmail.com (password return)
with your account name and password, and the name of the account you
want to hack, you receive and email with their password.  This of
course is b*ll*cks, but just incase you don't understand, they send
you their password.  I thought that no-one would fall for it, but I am
having a 40% success rate for the visiter to my web page.  My web
address is www.geocities.com/pendulum_bob and you can feel free to
adapt the crap I have written in the page.  The beauty of geocities
for all you newbies is that you don't have to know HTML code!

OK I hope that you have found my first article interesting, even
though it is very basic.
