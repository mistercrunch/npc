Ok i've really been meaning to mention this for a while now, ok as time
goes by the SWATeam grow stronger, we assimilate more knowledge the
magazine grows and grows, and to be honest, the 7 man krew that keep
everything togeather sometimes needs a little help! Ok so i intend to
open up a new part of the SWATeam that will deal with the magazine,
nothing more, nothing less. Of course SWAT will still carry out masses
of kiddie porn site removal and wreak havoc upon paedophiles and
rapests around the world <g>, but for the more public side of the group
that is SWAT Magazine, we would like a little help.

Ok I think that a lot of you will agree that SWAT26 is probably the
best issue yet, it's certainly one of the biggest. 
What we want to do is to keep up this trend, that is release an issue
this big each month, improving in quality time and time again. That
is where we need your help. 

The new side of SWAT will consist of writers, anyone who knows how to
hack, phreak, code, blow shit up or anything else, is asked to join
and spread there knowledge. It's all quite simple, but rules are kinda
strict, since this side of the group is not as "active" as the others
in it, we do require people remain active.

Ok if you think that your up to it, here's what joining would entail.

At least 2 artciles a month- one should be atleast 4k in size!

Quality articles- that basically means no small articles that entail
the manufacture of gunpowder, how to red box, hax0r a Win95 box using
a trojan and such like.

Not send the same articles into other magazines. 

Not just rip articles and send them in - there are exceptions to this
though, and you should clear it with me first.

What i'm thinking of doing is keeping a kind of "score system" for
those who join the new section, it'll be a private thing and nobody
(not even you!) will know what it is, those who do well will be
rewarded in some way, those who do exceptionally well *may* be asked to
join the full time SWAT Members! - although if you beg us to join or
submit pants articles then we can always knock points off!

Other will perks are: you can put a plug in for your group at the 
bottom of your articles or your web address, your work will be read by
THOUSANDS (i don't care what anyone says, SWAT is easily the biggest UK
based e-zine), and it's possible that you can get a sneak preview pre-
release copy of the magazine!

Plus anything else that you can managed to squeeze out of writing for
SWAT. 

So if you think that your up to it, let us know, we don't have any 
trial period or anything like that for this, all you have to do is
send in an article and tell us that you want to be a regular writer and
that's it!

So, what are you waiting for? get writing :o)
