This idea has been on my mind for a while, also several people out there
have been asking me about this for a while, well i guess that in the
near future this dream will become a reality! Oh yeah, the SWAT CD-ROM
Volume I will soon be upon us!!!!

Ok so what is planned for this amazing CD? Well without giving away too
much (since most of it is in the design stages), here's a brief list of
what is planned:

Firewall software - a collection of firewall tools, for both the beginner
and the advanced user.

Scanner software - all kinds of scanners, from professional exploit testing
software that finds even the newest of exploits, to port scanners and CGI
scanners.

Text files - THOUSANDS of them, covering EVERYTHING underground related,

Cracking - Tools and tutorials to crack programs for both the beginner and
the experienced cracker.

Phreaking - All ya usual phreaker stuff, from war dialers to box plans and
tone generators, plus everything else we can dig out.

Encryption - Encryption programs and files for all of your needs.

Miniture linux distros - Trinux, Mlinux and as many more as we can find
for you to all play with!

Trojans - Yeah most of you say that they are lame, i agree, but what the
hell, there'll be a load on here, as well as numerous anti-trojan utilities
for you.

Virii - EVERYTHING needed for virii, compilers, construction kits, source
code. Plus a whole host of live "examples" for you.

Programming - Well every hacker needs to code, texts, tutorials, programming
utilities. 

Exploits - Need i say more? exploits for *nix and Win systems.

Carding - Loats and lots of carding stuff!

Password recovery tools - passwd crackers, ZIP crackers, Word crackers, yeah
if it can be passworded and we have a cracker then it'll be on here!

E-mail software - Re-mailer software. anonymous e-mailers and mail bombers.

E-Zines - How could we not get them on? lots and lots of E-Zines related to
the underground.

Serial numbers - If (like me) you occatioanlly loose your serial numbers
for some of your software, then this HUGE list will come as somewhat of a
relief :o)

Well that's the current list, it's most likely to grow in the near future
so we'll try and keep you posted as to updates.

Ok so how much will this CD retail for?
£10 - Yep ten UK pounds price will alter slightly for international orders
and such like, but not by much. Chances are that you'll either have to pay
by cash or cheque sent to a PO BOX. But anyhow, i hope that you'll all show
interest in the up and comming CD-ROM, should be with us SOON.
