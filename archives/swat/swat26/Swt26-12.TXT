To construct the 35mm Mortar canon you will need:

Quant:       Material:                    Size:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)          Steel Tube or pipe           30cm L x 3.5cm W(inside) x more than 3mm thick
(1)          Wooden rod                   5cm L x same width of inside of pipe
(1)          Steel Nut + Bolt             More than 4cm long and 6mm wide
(1)          Flat steel or Alloy          Approx. 3cm L x 2cm wide x 5mm thick
(1)          Party Popper 
(1)          Cardboard Tube		  30cm L x wide enough to fit neatly inside steel pipe.
(1)          Choice of explosive          Detailed later.
(1)          Woodscrew                    2cm long  

Toolz:
------
Drill with 2mm and 6mm bits.
Spaners for Nut + Bolt
Files (metal file) or an Angle Grinder!
Glue Expoy Resin or Areldite and masking tape
Bench Vice or some sort of clamps.
Saw (hack-saw will do)
Tape Measure 
Screw driver

Where to get it and other info:
-------------------------------
You can get most of this stuff from your local hardware store but if 
youre stuck try the garden centre for the steel tubing (thats where 
we got it from!). They use it for green houses and other things. 
Any-way the ones we got were galvanised so it won't rust but paint 
it afterwards any way if you get them like that. The wooden rod could
be a broom handle or something simalar as long as it fits tightly 
into the tube. The nut and bolt can be bought (or nicked) from your 
hardware store. It has to be long enough the go right through the 
width of the pipe. Flat steel or aluminium (<--thats why I put alloy
the first time cos I can't spell it right) hardware store again. You 
may be able to get away with a door hinge if it's cut right. You 
should know where to get a party popper from. This is used as a 
detonator but you can use an electronic one instead. Cardboard tube 
can be got from kitchen roll or tinfoil (not bog roll) as long as 
its strong but not too heavy. The choice of explosive depends on 
what you have handy I'll detail later on the amount and the best 
used stuff. 


Where to start:
---------------
1) Take your steel tube and cut it to the size you need. 30cm is 
the best for this scale of canon. Take your wooden rod and cut it 
to about 5cm long. Cover the sides of the rod with glue, what ever 
one you use and ram the rod up one end of the steel pipe. You'll 
have to bang it on the floor to make it go it properly. Now this is 
important: The rod has to be air tight which means there can't be 
any gaps around it what so ever. If there is beat it out and cover 
in masking tape and more glue and ram it in again. Leave it for 
awhile for the glue to set. If FS included the pics look at 
MORTAR.jpg but if he hasn't you'll just have to stick with ASCII:

        	 ==================== <-- Steel Tube
                 |*****|
Wooden Block --> |*****|
		 ==================== 

2) Now you have to drill the holes. Make a mark about 2cm to
2.5cm from the bottom of the pipe, on the end with the wooden
block in. Make sure the hole will go right through the wooden 
block. Drill a hole with the 6mm drill bit right through the 
pipe. Or if youve got a bigger bolt make the hole bigger. One 
thing to remember is that the hole has to be silghtly smaller 
than the bolt to ensure a tight fit. Once to hole is drilled 
spread a little glue down the hole and insert the bolt. Once 
the bolt is through the pipe screw on the nut and make sure 
it's tight.

                  ___  
        	 ==ƒ================= <-- Steel Tube
                 |*ƒ***|
Wooden Block --> |*ƒ***|
		 ==ƒ================= 
                  «ƒ» <--- Nut + Bolt

3) Get your flat steel or aluminuim and cut it to size. Drill
one 2mm hole 1cm from the end and cut a silt from the side 
about 5mm rom the other end. It should now look like this:
(From now on this will be known as the Plate. OK)


	 	 -------
  		 |  ==== <- slit
 		 |     |
 		 |     |
 		 |     |
 		 |  0  |                 0 = Hole
 		 -------                   

4) Now take your pipe and turn it so that the bolt is side
ways. Now mark a hole about 3cm away from the end (the end
with the block in) and drill it with the 2mm bit. Make 
sure it go's down in to the wood about 2cm. Now get your 
plate (peice of flat steel or alloy) and screw through the 
hole (that does NOT have the slit) into the hole in the 
pipe. Don't screw it to tight, just enough to let the plate
turn around. If you are confused at this point go to our 
website where the pics are and then you will understand.

            Screw --> _
                      |=== <-- Plate 
        	 ==================== <-- Steel Tube
                 |/ƒ\**|
Wooden Block --> |\ƒ/**|
		 ==================== 
                   ^--- Nut + Bolt

5) Next turn the plate till it faces the open end of the 
pipe. Then mark on the pipe where the slit is. Move the
flat steel away and drill the hole with the 2mm bit. This 
hole should go into the open part of the pipe as in near 
the wood but not in the wood.

There you have it the mortar cannon is made. Now what next.

A suitable stand:
-----------------

Depending on your situation the stand could be made out
of a number of differnt things but the design is basically
the same:

1) Make a X shape out of two lengths (about 20cm) of what
  ever you are using. Make it small at the top. Like this:

              \/
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /      \

Fix then together whatever way you want. You can then 
strap this to the mortar canon to give it a 
45 degree angle.

THE MORTAR!
-----------

This is the fun part. The mortar consists of three parts:

1)Detonator
2)Propellant
3)Grenade/Mortar



You can make these in any order you want. Here's 
the easiest first;

1) Detonater:
Can be either Fuse, Pull String or electronic detonation. 
Fuse: This is the easiest. Rip a fuse out of a firework
and stick it down the hole. Or you could make one. 
Remember to leave it long enough so you can get out of 
the way once it's lit!
Pull string: Take a party popper apart and remove the 
little white thing with the string. On the cannon, twist
the plate out of the way an insert pullstring thingy. 
Now twist the plate back round and thread the string 
through the slit. The plate holds the party popper thing
in place and when you pull the string it go's off.
Elecrontic Detonator: This can be any type that fits 
down the hole. You could make a Solar Ignitor that 
would fit down inside. Try not to make the hole any bigger
than 3mm cos the gasses will escape and blow the plate off
(this has happened to us!). The wires can be threaded
through the slit in the plate.

2) Propellant:
This is what sends the mortar fying out of the pipe. Its 
quite simple to make. First cut about 2cm of the cardboard
tube. Then with masking tape seal one end (you put a bit of
card in here if you want). In the open end of the cardboard
tube is where the explosive goes. Mix up your chioce of 
explosive and mix to a paste with a VERY small amount of 
meths or petrol. Once this is thick enough spread it around
inside the cardboard tube (small one). Don't make it to 
pasty make sure it is still quite powdery, just enough to 
stay inside of the tube.

Reffer to the following guidelines:

A) More explosive the further the mortar will travel
B) More explosive the better chance of blowing yourself
   up

So the best thing to do is use a low explosive that 
releases alot of gas or smoke (eg Flash powder). This is 
because the mortar will be in tight which means a build 
up of gasses will propell it quite far. We have done tests
using our homemade explosive. We managed to get the mortar
about 270 feet using a very low amount. So experiment and
you'll get it right. (Allways start with a low amount!) 
This is then inserted into the mortar after the detonatot.
Just pop it down the pipe untill it hits the bottom. It
should look like this:

            Screw --> _
                      |=1= <-- Plate 
        	 =======1================================= <-- Steel Tube
                 |/ƒ\**|1 |2|
Wooden Block --> |\ƒ/**|1 |2|
		 =========================================      1 = Detonator 2 = propellant	
                   ^--- Nut + Bolt
    

3) Grenade/Mortar

This is the projectile that is fired out of the cannon. 
There are a number of types:

A) Mortar: Non-explosive projectile that can be used for
   range testing or flares.  
B) Impact Mortar: Explosive projectile that explodes
   on impact on hard surface.
c) Grenade: Fuse timed explosive projectile. Depending 
   on time and distance will explode in    mid-air or 
   bouce then explode.
d) Impact Grenade: Fuse timed explosive projectile. 
   Depending on time and distance will explode in mid-air
   or explode on impact.

And guess what I'm only gona tell you how to make the 
first one HAHA! But don't worry there will be more files 
coming to SWAT and they will all be up on the site very 
shortly aswell.
Well here goes a simple Mortar:

1) From the left over wooden rod (the one use to block
   the end) cut to approx. 15cm. Then cut across twice
   on the bottom of it in a + pattern. Cut it to about
    2-3cm depth. Like this:

 			/---1---\
 1= Cut lines           |   1   |
		        |1111111|                
                        |   1   |
                        \---1---/


2) Now cut two 4cm x 6cm strips from sheet steel or 
   aluminum and cut half way up both and solt them 
   together. Insert into the wooden block. This makes 
   the fins to stablise the projectile in flight. 
   Alternativly use stiff card but it doesn't last very 
   long.


3) File down the end to a point if you want or stick
    a cone of card on top. A then paint it!

For the Finally!
----------------

Ok now you-ve got the stuff together time to test it.
First find your target:
Car, house, Caravan, Phone Box etc! Set up your mortar
in a secluded place. Now judge the distance accordingly
keeping in mind that 45 degrees gives the maximum 
height + maximum distance. Then way down your canon 
with a concrete block or some thing heavy (so it doesn't 
move!) Ok, now load your cannon in this order:

1) Insert your detonator, what ever one you use. And 
lay the string/wire accordingly. (Note that if you use 
a pull string and don't want to be standing right next 
to the cannon you'll need to put extra weight on it so 
when you pull the string it doesn't move and point at 
you (and again this has happened to us!!)

2) Next pop in your propellant, open end first. Make sure
   it goes all the way down to the bottom and is touching
   the detonator. Push it down with a stick or something.

3) Lastly in goes your mortar. Push it right down into the
   cannon. Make sure it's a tightish fit or it won't work 
   properly. (A good tip is to put rings of black tape 
   around the mortar, but only if it's too lose). Above 
   all don't make it too tight or it won't work at all.


4) Now take aim and pull that string (or push that button
   or light that fuse!) and delite in your first use of 
   the A.W.E 35mm Mortar Cannon. This type of mortar (the 
   dud one) in our tests can go right through a car 
   windscreen at 200 ft and leave a very big dent in the 
   body work at the same distance. Check our site for our 
   test results. (That is when the sites working!)



Additional Information:
-----------------------

Well thats it really. This mortar cannon will last you 
for quite awhile if you look after it. Just oil the inside
every now and then to stop it from rusting. And paint the
out side as well. This Mortar Canon will aid the everyday
anarchist in his plite against the government, the phone
companys and anyone else that stands in there way. That is
if you make one! This is for educational use only....
Isn't it? :-).


Look out for more of these files in SWAT magazine and at 
our website (that should be up soon!)
The next part will show you how to construct a number of 
the other mortars for this canon!

C-yall!
