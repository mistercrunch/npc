Hello readers, I hope you have read my "Harmless Revenge" article in 
SWAT 25. Well this got me thinking a bit more on the subject and decided
to do a follow up.

So here it starts. I think a lot of you have probably experienced some
dickhead sending taxis and piazzas round to your house (or know friends
that have had this), and you know who they are and where this dick lives.
Now to plot something they were NOT expecting!

This is so simple. Pick up your Yellow Pages book. Now to order large
amounts of scafolding to their house. You phone up a company, putting
141 before the number, and sounding frustrated saying that your house is
collapsing / sinking and it needs scafolding supports immediately. State
a certain time in the day, victims name and address. 
        The fun is far from over. Search for kid's party stuff. Large
bouncy castles are ideal! 141 again, but this time it is a last minute
party for a large crowd of kids, so the bouncy castle has to arrive
arround the same time as the scaffolding.
        So they sent you taxis did they? What they need are a couple of
coaches! So finding the number for the company, explain that there is a
scout trip leaving from the victims house, and the last company backed out
last minute and you need them for the same time as everything else that is
heading in the victims direction.
        Now I think they need a moderate amount of concrete. Yes! Those VERY
large trucks. You see, the victim is now relaying teir drive way...hehehe
        Now I could be here for days writing ideas from Yellow Pages but I
think you know what I'm getting at. Now you have probably blocked the street
with trucks coaches and other stuff, and the vast amount of chaos will teach
that fuckwit not to do it again.
        It is even better if nobody is home (monday morning about 11:00 when
everyone is @ work, college, or school). Now order the concrete, and stand
outside when it arrives and say that your dad has had an urgent phone call
from work and should be back in an hour to arrange the payment, meanwhile
they can concrete the drive, and say you're going out to have a haircut or
shopping or something...   
        To increase the terror phone the police from a phone box saying that
someone is terrorising your driveway (..well the victims drive). The police
will turn up to arrest the workmen, while they will get pissed off trying to
explain that they are working. I don't advise calling any other of the emergency
services - obvious reasons why.

I could go on but I'll leave this up to you. If anyone does this or tries
original ideas out then email me with your story: johnzbombz@yahoo.com
