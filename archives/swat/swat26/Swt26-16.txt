BISCUIT TIN BOMB:
*****************

	I have recently been involved in making a film with a few 
friends from college. For this, small fireball explosions are needed
so I had a few thoughts. Most possibly some sort of gas should be used!
Petrol? Confined space! One of my previous articles for SWAT magazine 
was a wheely bin bomb, but this was too big to conceal in a hole - unless
we spent a long time digging! Thats where the biscuit tin comes in handy.

Materials:

 - Biscuit tin
 - Masking tape (carpet tape)
 - 2+ deodorant cans
 - Small Pipe bomb
 - 2 Long wires
 - knife

Once your hole is dug in a field to fit the tin, make a small hole in 
the tin so that the wires just fit through. Fill a small copper tube 
with gun/flash powder and insert an ignitor. Attach the pipe bomb ignitor 
to the long wires. Now wrap the masking tape over the deodorant nozzles 
so spraying continuously. Throw a few of these in the tin and place the 
lid on. Finally wrap the tin THOROUGHLY with the tape to form a strong 
compression. Place the tin in the hole and reel the wires a suitable 
distance away. To detonate, connect the two wires to a battery. BOOM! 

Improvements :
  - Place / empty bags of flour over the tin which will semi atomise, 
    thus greater fireball
  - Using sandbags will greater the compression a create a larger blast.
  - Adding petrol and potassium permanganate to the tin will improve 
    results although I havent tried this. Lots of napalm around the area.
  - The longer you leave the tin to fill with gas the better the end 
    result. Just don't leave it TOO long.

Experiment & be careful !!!

MOVEMENT SENSOR BOOBY TRAP :
****************************

O.k, this idea came to while sat in the college canteen, looking
up @ a movement sensor. I noticed that on the front of this little 
thing are three LEDs. Green - being small amoounts of movement, Yellow - 
fair amount of movement, and of course, Red being a busy canteen.
	You can get them from most hardware shops, or steal from a canteen...
I would advise getting the ones with the small LEDs, not the big red
light ones. 

So how do you transform it into a booby trap? 
By replacing the yellow or red LED with a solar ignitor (rocket ignitor).
If this doesn't work then try using a step-up transformer for the current 
to light the ignitor. Don't use the green connection 'coz this thing will 
blow at the 
slightest movement - although it could be what you want it to do? Now 
the ignitor is inserted in a pipebomb, biscuit tin bomb, or a home-made 
weapon pointing in the same direction as the sensor at the victim. 
The ignitor could be extended to a more desireable place if need be. 
Alternatively, the ignitor could be inserted into a fuse to delay 
the trap. Use your imagination.

*NOTE* 
 - These things are intended for inside a victims home/building, not out 
   side.
 - Use a switch between the power source and the sensor, and have 
   the switch on a length of wire to a door so you can get out without 
   risk of killing yourself. Just flip the switch before leaving - now the
   device is armed.

Never attempt to make this.
