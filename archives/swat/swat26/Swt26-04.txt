While wasteing my life on the internet i decided to locate a copy of
the hacker ethics and compare them to my own form of hacker ethics,
well i found two lots of hacker ethics, one is old skool and the other
new skool. Ok first up the new skool of hacker ethics:

* Never intentionally delete or damage a file on a computer you hack
* Treat systems you hack as you would treat your own computer.
* Notify system administrators about any security breaches you encounter.
* Do not hack to steal money.
* Do not distribute or collect pirated software.
* Never take stupid risks - know your own abilities.
* Always be willing to freely share and teach your gained information 
  and methods.

Ok so those aren't the exact ethics but they to bottle down to the main
stem of it all. 

Now onto the old skool:

Access to computers - and anything which might teach you something about
the the world works - should be unlimited and total.  Always yeld to the
Hands-On Imperative

All information should be free

Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization

Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bougous criteria such  as
degrees, age, race, or posisjon

You can create art and beauty on a computer

Computers can change your life for the better


Well they are what i found anyway, i don't think that i'll bash the old
hacker ethics since they make a lot more sense to me and they actually
mean something. So i'll have a go at the current "ethics" of a hacker.

* Never intentionally delete or damage a file on a computer you hack

Ok speaking from personal experience, most of the systems that i
target to take down host child pornography, so if i'm going to
stick to these rules then i would leave them, i don't think so.
Deleteing the material from the server, thus removing it from the
internet and in some small way stemming the flow of such material
seems more "ethical" to me that just leaving it.


* Treat systems you hack as you would treat your own computer.

Well i'd follow this, if i found child porn on my computer and didn't
know how it got there, i'd Fdisk my hard drive!

* Notify system administrators about any security breaches you encounter.

And get a boyfriend called bubba? yeah some admins will appriciate you
telling them, other's don't. Feel free to run the risk of getting busted.
You might think that your doing them a favor, they don't always see it
that way.

* Do not hack to steal money.

Why not? capitalism has prayed on the weak for years. Now that we hold the
technological advantage over them, should we not take back what is ours?
Ok so that last statement sounds kinda dodgy, i wouldn't lift a load of
cash from a chairty or anything like that, but if u ever break into a
server with kiddie porn, steal the CC#'s and use the cards to death.

* Do not distribute or collect pirated software.

WTF? yeah i'll pay a few hundred for Win2k or NT server 4. So much for
the freedom of information. I'll leech warez from the net, i've
downloaded software that is useful and software that is crap, delete the
crap stuff and keep the good. Bare in mind that most of the stuff you
leech from the net will be programs like Adobe Photoshop or MS Office 2k,
products that cost hundreds of pounds, you walk into a college and see
HUNDREDS of machines running them, think of the cost! Those who
monopolise the computer software industry leeching millions from colleges
alone, money that could be put to good use. Pirate all you want, software
giants can go to hell, i hate capitalism in all it's forms and there's
nothing wrong with takeing from those that can afford it.

* Never take stupid risks - know your own abilities.

Yeah ok i agree with that one.

* Always be willing to freely share and teach your gained information 
  and methods.

Hmm, i kinda agree with that one. But ANYONE who e-mails me "teach me how
to hack" questions will not like my responce (or i'll just filter there
e-mail).

So what was my point to this article? well the point to it all is that
nobody should follow any specific ethics of hacking, everyone is
different and therefore there own beliefs should guide them to how they
behave in cyberspace. 

My attitude to a lot of it is "Fuck everyone", i'll leech pirate software,
i'll deface web sites, i'll destroy large ammounts on data on servers,
i'll keep to myself what i find on a server and let the clueless admin
sit happily at his desk while his network security crumbles around him.

My rules to it all would be (as in my personal rules):

* It is ok to damage a system IF it can be justified.
* It is ok to distribute paedophiles names, addresses and credit card
  numbers that you find on child porn sites.
* Leech from those that can afford it.
* Keep what you find to yourself and those that you trust.
* Cover your tracks well.


Well ok that's a few of them anyhow. If everyone out there made there
own rules, followed there own guide lines and was more of an individual
then the scene would be a lot better than it currently is. You see
people on newsgroups flaming the shit out of each other because somebody
doesn't follow the ethics that they do, does that make them more of a
sheep because they follow what "other people" do, or does it make them
some |<-rad h4x0r because they follow the so-called rules?
Those who show individuality are the ones that get my respect, ok so it
is lame to gain Admin over some innocent server and Fdisk the main
storage drive, everyone should agree with me that it's a lame thing to
do. But i'm sure that 95% of you out there would also agree that FDisk
being run on a server in Russia that hosts child porn is an ok thing
to do. SO out of that 95% how many of you call yourself hackers that
stick to the ethics? those of you who do are hypocrits. You'll say
that you stick to the rules yet insist that there are exceptions to
those rules. Fuck that. If your going to follow a set of rules then
at least make up your own and don't stray from them.

Oh well i hope that you've enjoyed my little rant.



TEmpest also submitted an article on hacker ethicss, so here is it:

					Ethics On Stuff


this little article is written on ethics. People always so that real
hackers has ethics and morals, But personaly i dont agree, not that 
to be a hacker you have to have morals but that is you have all ready
hacked into someones box then you have put the work in to show your a
hacker and not that u did not format his hardisk. I think this applies
to all things.
Ethics are OK for people that care and are realy bothered about what 
they are doing , well if they are like that then why are they phreaking
/ blowing stuff up / hacking / carding in the first place. Lets take
hacking as an example there are lots of diffrent reasons why people do
hack and iby no mean know all of the ones that i think people do it for.

1) They get a kick from it
Yes people do get a kick from hacking and it is these people who are 
less likly to kill someones comp.

2) They do it for revenge 
If these people hack into someones box because they dont like them / 
want revenge then they are hardley going to fix the holes in that 
persons comp and leave it alone. They arfe more likyly do slap a virus
/ lots of virii on it or format the hardisk.

3) people who do it as a challange 
These people are more likly to fix the problems with someones security
as it posses another challange.

4) people that do it to look cool
I just think these people are sad, i maen after u have spent all weekend
infront of you box you look like shit. And most people think of hackers
a little nerdy gits any way.

These are a few reasons. I realy need to calm down so i am of to get some
coke
