The Grand Debut Of The Doh-Boy!!!!!!!!!!!
With His Doh Bomb.

        Hey there phreakers, hackers, anarchists, and interested onlookers. Its
The Doh Boy here, a member of the SWATeam. The folowing is a useful bomb
which is ideal for anarchists because it has a reasonable exposive force
for quite cheap.

You need:

Car Petrol,
Potassium Permanganate,
A Polyethene bag,
A tin of SMA baby milk powder,
Some expandable insulation foam (in package).

Method:

        Empty your tin of SMA of its contents, but keep the contents somwhere
else. Put some car petrol into the container and turn the container to
coat the sides and let evaporate. Then add some potassium permanganate
into the container. Then place some of the baby milk powder into this
mixture. Making sure the polyethene bag has a larger volume than the SMA
tin place the cannister of insulation in the bag. Then place the bag and
its contents in the SMA tin. Make sure that the nozzle which you squeeze
to get the foam out just peeps over the tin, if it does not PROP IT UP.
Finally, take the contents to your target add the lid and
BOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!

How it works:

        Potassium permanganate is an oxidiser and so makes things burn
violently. The Petrol/PPM mixture is pressure sensitive and so when the
foam creates enough pressure on the wall of the tin the mixture
explodes, the SMA provides more energy for this reaction, making it
stronger.

Well thats all for the moment but who knows, we may meet again,
somewhere ................
