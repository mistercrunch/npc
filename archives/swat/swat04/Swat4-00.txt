Well April is a special time for SWAT, it is probably one of the only
times that most of the official members get together, to do some 
serious, Anarchy and Phreaking.  Another good thing is that I have had
an article submitted by, Doh-Boy it's number 9, it's very good and
is also his first contribution, let's hope that he will submit more
great articles.

On a bad point, ALL of the SWATeam members that do not hold a command
position have been suspended, more for security reasons also the SWATeam
database and file library has been encrypted.  You may want to know why?
well A SWATeam member has leaked information as to our activities and 
also given MY name to people, well basically a lot of people want us 
busted, luckily the police haven't been called in, but we don't know 
who has leaked, we only have suspicions, we'll keep you posted.
Just to clear things up, SWATeam keeps it's activities and members under
a secrecy policy, if I where to get arrested and the database seized
then ALL SWATeam members could be busted.  Don't worry, vengeance will
be extracted as well as there removal from the SWATeam.
