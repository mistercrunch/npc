 /\/\/_______________|????


This is simple to make, use it to set fire to bins ect.

YOU WILL NEED:
1 packet of king-sized rizla papers
1 box of matches
1 ciggy

Ok first of all break off about 20-30 match heads.

Break off about 1/3 of the ciggy (Tobacco part) and put it on one
side of a rizla paper.

Put all of the match heads into the other part.

Role the rizla as normal.

To use: Simply light the tobbaco at the end and discard it into a
bin, a few minutes later the bin goes up in flames.

Note: It's funny as fuck if you give it to somebody.
