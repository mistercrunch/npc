		LIST
By -=The Firestarter=-

Here is a list of lamers that I have encountered over my life time,
as well as reasons why they're lamers and a list of people that I
wish to thank for helping me out in fighting the lamers.

Lamer list:

Lee Goodwin, it's this lamers fault that I am as twisted as I am.
This lamer dosn't know when to quit, he's been beaten up, terrorised,
subscribed to every catalouge under the sun, phone phreaked for hours
on end (at night), I even had some people distarct him while I slipped
through the back door of his house made myself something to eat.
This cunt is cruel to his pets, I.E he finds it funny when his dad
flushes live gerbils down the toilet, and he hits his cat around the
kitchen with a squash racket.  I even sent him fake letters saying
that he'd be suspended from school. I've been carrying out "attacks"
on him for over 5 years now, and I moved away from that area over
3 years ago.
Lamer rating: 10/10 <-- The biggest dick around.

Julian Butler, This lamer is more of a mummies boy, he isn't hard
although he thinks he is, he didn't get elected as a prefect so he
wen crying to his head of year (litteraly) until she took pitty on
him and gave him a prefect badge.  Goose man phoned him up once and
said: "hello, Goodbye" and hung up on him, so what does this lamer do,
he phones the police. Hell if somebody did that to me I would just
tell them to fuck off.
Lamer rating: 7/10 <-- This guy gets off likely

Scott Bradbury, only for thinking he's cool.
Lamer rating: 2/10

Jon Shean, He has a huge nose, thinks he's smart and seems to think
that everybodys gay.
Lamer rating: 8/10

Alec Naylor, If you say to this lamer that he shags his dad he goes
mental.  He has a lisp so we call him "Alecth Nayorth thweet and thour
pork", he has no friends (literaly) and has never had a girl friend,
at lunch he used to stand near people and eat his packed lunch.
He was cunning when he did this, he would not stand too close but
close enough so that people from a distace would think that he had
friends.
Lamer rating: 9/10

Shane Skyte, Because he should grow up and stop acting like a 7 year
old.
Lamer rating: 9/10

Douglas rankin-moore, for being sad at times.
Lamer rating: 1/10

Ben lucus, because he's a cock sucking, gay fucking, house shagging
bender.
Lamer rating: 7/10

Mr. S Carrigan, because this stupid bastard didn't enter me for the
electronics exam dispite the fact that my predicted grade was a B,
this fucking lamer is thick as fuck.
Lamer rating: 10/10

John and Irene from the pub, because they banned us from the pub for
nicking the bog roll.
Lamer rating: 9/10

Craig wilson, because he sounds like a puff.
Lamer rating: 8/10

Peter pilchar, for trying to nick out booze, and being a fucking dick
head.  Only if he knew what was being planned...
Lamer rating: 9/10

Susan (fuck knows what), for thinking that she can fuck us over by
spreading rumors.
Lamer rating: 8/10

And a list of thaks goes out to the following:
(please note these are mostly alias's, if they're reading this then
they know who they are)

           as well being one of my first anarchist partners, and 
           for head-butting julian butler.

            as other stuff.

"Box head" - For helping out with the phreak calls to Lee Goodwin, as
