A "Manifesto" By -=The Firestarter=-

If you have read the past four issues you may have noticed that
I have said, well, phone boxes make good targets.  Well an
anarchists might agree, a phone phreaker on the other hand might
not.  Being a bit of both this comes as a bit of a dilema.
So to put it bluntly: If there is a phone box that you do not
phreak from, then destroy it, BT will replace it in about a week.
If you phreak from a phone box then leave it alone.  If like me,
you sometimes find that there is only one phone box for about 10
miles then DO NOT blow it up, instead use bins or bus shelters.
I unfortuatly cannot blow up bins or bus shelter in the small
village, which I call home (The city I'm living in at the moment is
mearly a place in which I take shelter, although it has it's
advantages) because eveybody will know it was me. Beside's I get
the blame for stuff I don't even do. I.E When I was living down south
some 200 miles away from the village somebody puts barb wire around
a local monument, now I hadn't been upto the village for a few weeks,
but the old biddys blamed me anyway, I'm just waiting for them to
confront me (directly) for something I didn't do just so that I can
have a real go at them for it. Well back to the main issue, heres
a few For and Against arguments I have come up with.

For:  B.T owns the phone boxes, and they charge too much.
      B.T don't allow free local calls.
      They are there
      It costs B.T money for every blown up phone box.
      It shows B.T that there multi-million pound investment against
       phone box security cannot withstand a petrol bomb or well made
       pipe bomb.
      B.T has to pay people to clean the mess off that you made with
       a paint bomb.

Against:
       If you blow up all of the phone boxes in the area then B.T might
        not replace them.
       B.T might make the phone boxes too secure, thus removing the
        old "free call with a screwdrive and pliars" trick impossible.

I'm sure you can come up with some other ideas.
