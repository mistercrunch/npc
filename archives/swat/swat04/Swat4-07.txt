	       FROM WEED KILLER

By -=The Firestarter=-, Shadow and Crisp

After years of using traditional shotgun shell powder in our pipe
bombs, we found a new cheaper way of making better and more powerful
explosives, why is it better I here you ask, well for a start it
smokes like hell, where as nitrocellulose (shotgun shell powder) does
not, it also burns for longer, making it a good incendrie, and we
managed to vaporise an empty coke can, so as you can see this is not
shit to mess about with.

Ok so now to make it:

You will need to get "Sodium Chlorate weed killer" you can't normally
buy it unless you 18, but they don't read the small print here.
while your getting that buy some sugar.

Simply mix the two at a 1:1 ratio, thats it.

Try putting some in a paper bag and lighting it. It burns for ages,
and gives off loads of smoke.  If you wanted you could mix it with
a flamable liquid.

You can make 1Kg of this stuff for about £2.06, you don't need to use
a lot in a smoke bomb and it's great fun.
Shadow put some in a pipe and made a roman candel, the pipe melted,
it was made from steel.  Crisp sealed some inside an empty 5.56 blank
casing and Shadow covered it in "weed killer charge", lit it and ran,
seconds later there was an almighty bang, pretty cool eh?

The only problem I know of is that it can be ignited with friction,
and it is a bit of an arse to ligh, you can get it going with a normal
flame from a lighter, but it takes a while to get going, a normal fuse
should light it, where as shoving a "just struck" match in it lights
it instantly.

Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder:

I have just managed to get this stuff to go properly.
You will need:
Sodium Chlorate weed killer (of course)
5 large pencils (or charcole)
some sulphur (nick it from school, I do)

Ok first off set fire to the pencils, yes you heard me, burn them until
they are charcole, and crush them up along with the sulphur and pencil
lead (graphite), now add some sodium chlorate and some water, mix until
it is universally black and leave to dry.
Ratio's
Sodium chlorate: 63%
Charcole and graphite: 22%
Sulphur: 13%
(these don't have to be exact)

Fuses:

Disolve some sugar and sodium chlorate in water and put either cotton
string or rolled up bog paper in it, take it out and leave to dry.

More to come as we have no adoppted it as our main explosive, so we 
shall be researching.
