Well issue 17's now over, i hope that you all enjoyed it. We even
managed to go through the whole issue without any refrence to what
Anti-Social magazine said in there last issue, I could go on to prove
my points, about how all of Dev Pac's articles are directly from the
Terrorists handbook, I could also go on to point out that the text
files in .dat format archives compress to 1/3 larger than then would
if they where in .zip archives. Mind you I couldn't help but laugh
when Armageddon said that two SWAT members e-mailed him, want to know
what the funny thing is? I couldn't give a fuck, i'm not going to
argue amoungst my fellow team mates over something so petty, to be 
honest I think he made the whole thing up, for some reason only known
to him. I could go on and on about it, but i won't.
Well anyway keep all of those sugestions comming in.
cya!
