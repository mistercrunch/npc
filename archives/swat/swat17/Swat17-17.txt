Anyone who's read the cookbook will no doubt be familiar with the fear
that the caller log, or CAMA, and ESS in general, had instilled. 
Fortunately in todays phreaking world it shouldn't be much of a 
problem, partly due to the techniques I outlined a few issues back for 
defeating the caller log, but also because its pretty inefficient over 
long periods of time.
The main reason for this is that, according to an inside informer, the 
numbers that have been called ar held for two days after they are 
registered and then passed to billing. Good news for those of us who 
make a lot of 0800 calls as these aren't billed and aren't passed on!
So this means that if you make a lot of calls to a PBX over a three 
month period, then they get the bill in, they have about 48 hours to 
get BT to shell the details of your 0800 calls to them, which isn't a 
long time in anyones eyes.
Also heartening is news of Euro legislation which will make it 
ILLEGAL!! for BT to hold details of your 0800 calls. This would make 
phreaking safer than walking accross the street!
