Ok here is some more basic NT stuff for all you newbies and for the majority
of Unix hackers that don't know shit about Windows NT.  Its time that you tried
learning about NT, its getting more and more popular. NT is getting big. You should
keep up with technology...  NT is widely used, even such places like the Pentagon and 
other military sites use it. <cough> easy to hack <cough> ( U reading this Firestarter? )

Lets get on with it...

Say you have an IP address that you want to try and get access to
you would do this...

Example for IP address: 194.8.235.73

Note: Use IP addresses because the name address sometimes wont work
      and the IP will so use IP addresses.
 
Open up a dos prompt, yes... you need to use windows to hack NT.Why? Because you should know that
if if your going to hack NT, you're best using the same type of computer...it you  all the necessary tools. 
Windows 95/98 will suffice for most things. But if you want to become serious about hacking NT then you need 
to run an NT box also


   c:\windows> nbtstat -A 194.8.235.73

          NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

      Name               Type         Status
   ---------------------------------------------
   MAILGATE       <00>  UNIQUE      Registered
   MAILGATE       <03>  UNIQUE      Registered
   MAILGATE       <1F>  UNIQUE      Registered
   MAILGATE       <20>  UNIQUE      Registered
   ..__MSBROWSE__.<01>  GROUP       Registered
   MIRAGE         <00>  GROUP       Registered
   MIRAGE         <1D>  UNIQUE      Registered
   MIRAGE         <1E>  GROUP       Registered

   MAC Address = 00-00-00-00-00-00

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   |Note: this will list the remote hosts name. The name is set in the | 
   |control pannel/networking/indentification/computername.            |
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have the computer name you need to tell windows the IP that
maps to that computer name.  So to do this you need to edit
\windows\lmhosts open it in notepad or whatever. It will look like this...

127.0.0.1       localhost
 

If you are in NT then the lmhosts file will be in
\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts

you want to add the ip 194.8.235.73 and then press tab and enter the
computer name. so the new hosts file will look like this. 

127.0.0.1       localhost
194.8.235.73	MAILGATE

This sets up a computer name mapping to the IP address of the computer
to try and get into its filesharing. Save this and then click your Start
Button then goto find, then computer, then enter the computer name and it
will connect to that computer name that you added into the hosts file.


It should show the computer as being found. Double click it and then if
your lucky it wont have a password but if you aren't you will be prompted
for a password which you will have to try and guess or use a brute force
cracking program.  What program you might ask???
Well you can use NAT, Netbios Auditing Tool.
I may perhaps cover using NAT in the near future, Check back on the SWAT site
and anywhere else that hosts my bug files...

If you are interested in hosting my files on your web server then please don't hesitate 
to mail me and we can discuss it.  What may you gain from this you may ask?
Well.. you will be hosting some excellent files.  You will also get me files in advance.
