Netbus.


If you decide to use netbus (1.7 or less) on someone, then there is a 
fair chance that they will be running netbuster, because its now fairly
common. Now, how do you tell if they are running netbuster, or you 
really have connected to the client?

Well, when people have been connected to, they like to send the 
messages straight away. If you dont get 1000 messages flashing up on 
screen, then thats good, because it gives you time to run this little 
exploit to crash the netbuster program. You should also try the sound 
record. If the volume controls go crazy, then they're using netbuster. 
When you are connected, you just have to run a scan. Then scan any 
range, (I use localhost - 127.0.0.1). If you get disconnected, then 
they were running netbuster, and you crashed it. If not, then you are 
connected to the client. Now, if you got disconneted, you should run 
netbus again on the same IP address. They might still have the netbus 
server in memory, and you can connect. If you cant connect this time, 
then you were hoaxed.


I'm guessing that the fact that netbuster users load the program to 
emulate the netbus program, is technically entrapement. Whatever 
evidence they gain of you doing dodgy things to their computer is null,
because it was gained unfairly/unlawfully (or whatever word describes 
this..)


Ænemia e-mail express ICQ


If you have bombed someone's e-mail address to the stage that they dont
use it anymore, you might like to employ Ænemia to do the same to his 
ICQ account. If you know his ICQ number, then set up Ænemia to bomb....


<ICQ number>@pager.mirabilis.com

then send about 10000, using clones and things.

You could set up an oroborous e-mail account to forward all mail to 
this guys pager (SWAT issue 9 - www.swateam.org). Then sign the account
up to receive loads of offers and porn subscriptions each day, then 
you could sit back and watch, as the guy gets flooded with paged e-mail
every day, until you decide to stop them. Which of course, you wont. 
ever.

If you dont have the luxury of ICQ, then you can talk to your target on
his ICQ homepage. Everyones got one. You can swear at him from there, 
and mabye even social engineer some passwords off him. 

Go to  -  http://wwp.mirabilis.com/<ICQ number>

and its definetley wwp, *not* www.


*remember, mailbombing is considered lame, so dont tell anyone that you
did it, and keep up your image as an 31337 H4X0R*


Here's some numbers to bomb if you're stuck.

Vampyre95 - 35404406 (if he thought my 500 were bad, just wait till he
gets yours....)

vampyre95@yahoo.com  -  oroborise the prick
vampyre95@hotmail.com

not that I want you to bomb the guy, or anything.


Not the best text document, I know, but it is my first.....
