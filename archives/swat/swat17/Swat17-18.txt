OK, this will sound nuts, but BT are giving us free calls. No, not by 
their crapy loopholes in their system, but legit!!!
They recently announced plans to launch an advertising funded telephone 
calls scheme. It is to be called BT Freetime.
Trials are currently in Tyne and Weir and the north west of England. 
Any phreaks in the area willing to get in contact with me if they are 
offered a trial will be rewarded with something (I'll send you a 20ukp 
fonecard courtesy of BT! and be eternally greatful, and put your 
name/handle on the review of the service for SWAT!)
On the BT website (its on their!) it says that the service should 
appeal to young people and students who don't havea lot of cash to 
spend on fone calls. I suppose its handy for when you run out of PBXes 
and cant stand paying BT for anything.
One way that I feel this is a shrewd move by BT is that it will reduce 
a lot of their losses from fraudsters like us. Not a lot of newbies 
will come into the scene because they can quite easily get a free call
from BT. The phreak scene will probably end up as a lot of people 
interested in the fone system in general and those who still want to 
see BT dead (I suppose I fit both those categories)
I look forward to seeing this however, and I'll keep you posted as to 
the progress.
