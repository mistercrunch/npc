This article is written by Unknown Guest the new member to SWATeam so
if it is a bit shit you'll know why. Now i want to tell/inform you 
about the ADSL. Now ADSL was "probably" brought out to combat the 
failiure of Home Highway. Home Highway was BT's attempt to make ISDN a 
home useage. Home Highway failed because it defeated the  object of 
having an ISDN line. 
What is the object of having an ISDN line??
Well, ISDN uses normally fibre optics to obtain the fast (relatively 
fast connection compared to a modem) data connection it has. But with 
home highway the connection uses some shit copper wiring connection 
same as the usual telephone wire stuff. A bit shit.
If you dont know what ADSL (Asymettric Digital Subscribers Line) 
is, well it is a new technology launched by BT about 4 months ago and 
is currently on trial in London (west). The ADSL trial requires a  BT 
engineer to come round to install the equiptment and then another 
engineer comes round to install the 10mbs network card 
(NE2000 compatible) and the software. Now the hardware engineer install
a ADSL modem, a router and some other box not too sure what is does 
yet. The router is connected directly upto a coaxial cable which runs 
down the side of the house and into the main BT personnal box. The 
router is also connected upto the main telephone number in my case 
0181-xxx-xxx. The router is present to direct the calls so you dont get
a engaged tone when someone decides to call your telephone number. 
Well the router inside you house is directly connected to the modem 
using a RJ45 cable. Then the modem is connected upto your NE2000 card 
using another RJ45 cable but this time the cable is crossed over on pin
 8 from 1 i think. 
The technology looks a bit like this layed out:
                    
----               --------  
-PC-_____------____- MAIN -___-------___-------_______-----
----     ------    --------   -VIDEO-   -CACHE-       -WWW-
                              -------   -------       -----

PC>ADSL MODEM>MAIN MAIN TERMINAL>VIDEO SERVER>CACHE> WWW


What type of speeds do i get with ADSL??
Well on a good day and a good server i am able to download (downstream)
speeds of upto 300k/sec, sorry that is a bit of an exageration. 
I ONLY get about 250k/sec. And when recieving data from a webpage 
through port 80 i get about 2Mbps. These speeds do fluctate hurgely: 
"the connection is only as fast as the computer you are connected to"
As the saying goes!!
Now ADSL is so fast due to the special cache using a remote server 
where it stores all the previously visited webpaged. This brings fast 
access to all of the users. There are also lots of different servers 
including video,push,gaming. All of these bring the large speed 
increase to ADSL.
Another advantage with the ADSL connection is that there are no call 
charges yes the £200/month phone bills have gone. For £30/month you get
the highspeed connection and the unlimited calls but BT might start to 
monitor the number of megs you download. Now if youre thinking that is 
ok i dont download many megs during the month anyway well this limit 
includes the number of megs you download from the webserver. So this 
will severely limit the point of ADSL. Now those are the advantages of
ADSL now for the disadvantages. Now i was slightly pissed off that the
BT engineer took 2 months to come round to my house but i have to say 
it was worth it. Plus the other BT engineer took 3 months to come round
and install the software and network card that i could have done 
myself. 
Basically the settings go along the lines of:
DNS server
Client IP
Gateway iP
Proxy Pac
etc..
BT said people using a different OS apart from win9x will be infringing
the trial bounddaries and could be chucked off, they also said that 
ADSL wont work on any other OS anyway. Well thats a load of Bolllocks 
isnt it. I am currently using it on WinNT server and Linux. I havent 
got it to work with FREEBSD yet but i am fucking close. So BT fuck you.

If you live in London (West) you should consider getting it. For more
info on it. go to:

If youre a yank and you want to know more about the hardware and stuff,

Other new connections are cable modems. More info on them soon.

m adding this end section onto the article cause a week ago before this
article was published i found out what the prices are likely to be 
for ADSL. Well, BT said that there would be a one off fee probably in 
the range of £600-1000! then the cost will be about £40-45 per month 
for the usage

If anyone has any knowledge about C programming it would be much 
appreciated. I am currently trying to recompile the NAT program to work
with a list of hosts.
