Yet another fuse for you all to make, why? 'cause fuses are a bitch to
get hold of a lot of the time.
This fuse is handy for larger devices, not things like fireworks or
hand grenades.

Materials
1 Cigarette
A few boxes of matches
Smarties tube
Knife
Tape
(optional, but recommened) Sodium Chlorate and Sugar mix

(1) Cut off all of the match heads and save them somewhere (in the
    match box is a good idea).

(2) Punch some small holes into the top half of the smarties tube
    (about 10 holes in random places in the top half should do it).

(3) Fill about 1/3 of the tube with Sodium Chlorate and sugar mix top 
    it up with match heads, if you don't have any sodium chlorate and
    sugar mix, then use loads of match heads instead.

(5) Cut a few "vents" near the bottom of the smarties tube, make sure
    that the contents of the tube don't spill out everywhere.

(6) Push a cigarette into the match heads, try to get it about 1/4 into
    them, so when it burns down it will ignite the matches.

To use:

Push the tube into your explosive mixture (or place it into half a
bottle of petrol for an incendiary) and remove the cigarette.
Light the cigarette in the normal fashion and put it back into the
smarties tube (break the filter off for added reliability), don't be
a fuckwit and place it "lit end in first" unless you wish to kill
yourself.
Now once the ciggy burns away it will ignite the match heads, which
will burn away and ignite the sodium chlorate mixture, this in turn
will ingite anything that it's inserted into. The vents ensure that
more flames and heat escape the tube to ignite stuff, the holes in
the top half of the tube allow air to circulate around the ciggy so
that it doesn't go out.

Timing will depend on the ciggy, so experiment with your chosen brand.

What happens if you stick the fuse into the neck of half a bottle of
petrol? well the petrol ignites and burns away the bottle (assuming
that you used a plastic bottle, not too sure what will happen if you
use a glass bottle, possibly shatter, but i haven't tested it with
glass just yet), and then burn everything around it, yeah very simple,
but i thought that some of you might want a little explination as to
how it works!
