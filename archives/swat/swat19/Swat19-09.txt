Biological Weapons are thought to be the future of warfare, with the 
exception of cyber-war. It is also most probably the destructive war 
that can happen alongside nuclear war.
One of the most likely sources of it are from Saddam Hussein, as we are
all aware about after watching the Panorama about it. The potential 
biological warfare has is so destructive only genuine madmen would 
consider it.

Now let's learn how to make it!

Warning: if you do decide to make this stuff, I TAKE ABSOLOUTLEY NO 
responsability for the damages caused, injuries etc. Manufacture at 
your own risk! This text is purely for educational purposes. Only a 
complete MADMAN would do this without even thinking of the 
consequences. IE your victim does DIE or suffer disability, or catches 
AIDS. Just think.

Requirements:

1x   Empty Coffee Jar
1x   Plastic Bowl
100s Plastic gloves
1x   Bag of Sugar
A small amount of bleach
Big Spoon or other utable collector
Wooden Spoon or other tool to help mixing
Dust Masks (Incase the stuff gets airborne, you'll have some defence)
Plastic Bags and elastic bands
A nice warm, dark place (aka a boiler) to help the frementing process
Time, and lots of it

Precautions to take throughout the production of this stuff:

Wear gloves, all the time. Never use the same pair more then once. Bin
and wash your hands immediatley after use. Use the dust mask to 
protective you from the smell and possible airborne infections. 
BIG NOT: destroy everything after use, good way is putting in a sealed 
bag and giving to the garbageman to dispose of of (Its their fucking 
job).

Ok, if you've got the above kit, then we can begin. Use the scoop to
get a sample of some good, smelly rotten bacteria (I don't want to 
know where it came, bogs, rotten food, where ever) and place it in the 
plastic bowl. With the bacterium culture in the bowl, feed it with the 
sugar and if you are feeling adventurous, add watered down amounts of 
bleach (This will help make the bacteria resistant to it and many other
disenfectants!).

Stir the mixture in nice and thick, add water if it is too viscous, 
aslong as you can pour it into the coffee jar, your ok. When the 
culture is now and mixed, pour it into the coffee jar and seal it with 
the lid. and about 2 or 3 plastic bags to help make this baby air 
tight. Now place this in a nice warm dark place (next to a boiler is 
good) and leave for a week or two.

Feed the culture regularly, add more culture if needbe or bleach until
you think it has fremented long enough (tell tale signs are smells, 
change in colour, shit like that).

Usage:

If you are ready to use this shit, be prepared to be charged with 
somethink like GBH or ABH or maybe even attempted murder! Apply some of
the culture to a surface you chosen victim is likely to touch 
(door handles, mice, etc.) and when he eats... now you know why mom
made you wash your hands before you ate!

You can even try dissolving it into a drink or water supply, since we 
never expect to catch something like this from a can of coke.

Depending on the bacterium used and frementing, governs the strength, 
side effects, whether the person will catch cholera or diptheria like.



Truly for the MadMan!
