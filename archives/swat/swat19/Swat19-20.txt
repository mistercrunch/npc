This is my first article for SWAT magazine, in past issues of SWAT 
(which I have been reading for some time now) I noticed that the Warez 
scene has been neglected, so, I will use my article to provide monthly
news, reviews and anything else I can think of in relation to the UK 
warez scene.

News.

Those off you who have come into contact with Jurrasic 10, will know 
that there was a message on the disk from Raptor, stating that this was
to be the final Jurrasic Utils, this was a real blow, as the Jurrasic 
utils series were fantastic, always combining hot off the shelf 
products with must have utilities, making the discs essential, well, 
it seems Jurrasic just couldn't stay away, and recently announced 
Jurrasic utils 11.
As I'm writing this, the disc is not available, but by next month I 
should have a full review, but, with the normal Jurrasic standard and a
little help from Dragon, I'm sure this release will be another must 
have.
If you would like to get involved in this new release, then mail me 
and I'll try to point you in the right direction, Raptor in his own 
words is looking for 'Couriers, site owners, ftp leechers, suppliers 
and anyone who thinks they can contribute to keeping the Jurassic 
releases alive again!' 
He continues 'I thought this might be a good idea because there's too 
many groups out there who are just stuck up their own arse with self 
importance - I want ALL jurassic fans to be a part of every release - 
not just a couple of lines of text on a greets file'.

So get in touch if you think you can help, my email is at the end of 
this article.

The thought that has gone into this cd has resulted in a cleverly 
chosen set of applications and where as some Warez disks comprise of a 
random selection of utilities (usually chosen for there value and not 
there usefulness) this is not the case with Dragon 2000. 
The only thing not on this set of cd is a good cd-r program, such as 
Nero or CD-R win, but this aside, the content is flawless.
Another strong point with Dragon 2000 is that you will be left wanting 
for nothing, you will have the latest OS from Microsoft, a high end 
version of the best office suite, and other high quality program, but 
also the convenients of Go! Zilla, Win Zip, Win amp and the like.
It's not just the content of the cd that's first class, the menu 
system is easy to navigate and has a self-installer so you just click 
and watch, it doesn't look particularly impressive, but it is 
functional and does the job.
The first cd is bootable, if you are comfortable changing the boot 
sequence on your BIOS.
Overall, with such a well chosen set of utils, even if you own one or 
two of the program on this set of cd's, the rest still justifying 
getting your hands on it.

Rating - Go get it.    9/10

If you want to know where to get a copy of Dragon 2000, give me a
shout.


Over on the games scene, RedHot have released Redhot games 32, most of
the games on this disk are excellent, such as the great Respect Inc 
but, there is no point in properly reviewing this disk as it's very 
much down to personal taste, if you like the games on this disk, get 
it.
