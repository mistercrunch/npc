Hey all, lets imagine this, you've made the perfect explosive and you
need a quick and easy way for that unsuspecting/suspecting person to 
experience it.  why dont u make an easy trip wire? what a good 
question, i mean there cheap as shit, piss easy to make and do a damm
good job.

This will be a 3 part series with the content as follows
Issue 1:  Basic tripwires (this issue)
Issue 2:  Moderate Tripwires (electronic detonation)
Issue 3:  Applying techniques to landmines (make sure u get this one)

This issue will deal with trip wires that ignite an explosive that can 
be set off by a fuse.  Ideas for this are pipe bombs (look at my KNO3 
fun phile), smoke bombs, gun powder etc.

Apparatus
---------
Explosive (one that can be set off by fuse)
9V battery
Solar Ignitor/Fuse wire (solar wire prefably)
Spst switch
Wire
Fishing line (about 20 Lb line should work fine)


Method
------

1.  Buy all required parts
2.  Affix parts as shown in schematics below

  :==:---  <--fuse       \
       ||                /
       ---- spst switch--\


Operation and Use
-----------------

1.  Put explosive on fuse wire / steel wool.
2.  Affix fishing line to spst switch and the other side across the
    path to a solid object.
3.  Bury explosive if desired


Conclusion and Theory
---------------------

The theory behind this is real simple, when the line is pulled the 
switch should move to the on position thus allowing the electrical 
current to travel through to the fuse wire causing the explosive to 
ignite.
For alternate methods one could use a resistor/s to slow down the 
ignition time, or could wire it to set off many explosives at once.
