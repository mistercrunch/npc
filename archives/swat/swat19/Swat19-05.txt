Hail boys and girls out there in SWAT land,tis I gorecarrion your 
(un)friendly neighborhood sociopath coming at ya with part two of my 
Kronicles of Kaos. So sit back krank the music up loud and enjoy!

Part 1: Improvised anti personal weapons,

weirdly even in this day and age of violence,rape,muggings ect. Our 
goverment still wont let us carry blades,tasers,mace ect so I'm going 
to show you how to make various self defence gadjects that look totally
inconspicous.

1:Go round your bedroom and scrounge up all the loose change from the 
bottom of your drawers, under the bed ect,sort them into individual 
piles then glue them together and wrap with electrical tape. bingo! a 
handy cosh and even the dumbest pig won't arrest someone with a roll
of pennys in there pocket hahahahaha.

2:get a pencil with a decent thick lead (eyebrow pencils good) then 
using a pin drill carefully drill out the lead then,find a piece of 
metal that will fit down the hole (Try beatties or a model shop) Epoxy 
it in and sharpen the end. then you have a handly ice pick that does a
great job on tyres,eyes ect.

3:Keep these AOHell cds that they send, then when time dictates snap 
it in half and go for the throat.(Thanx to Firestarter for this one.)

4:Full finger rings can easyly be sharped to a nice sharp tip,
Ironically the cheaper ones are better for this as they have more steel
in.

5:The gadget shop sells these little perfume sprayers that you can fill
yourself, Ive found ammonia is the best thing to keep in these, as it
does a good job on the eyes and the fumes can cause people to pass out


Part 2: Shoplifting

Shoplifting is THE easyest crime to get away with and even with more 
and more shops using magnetic tags,cameras ect its easy to get away 
with, I've found the best way to get away with shoplifting is enlist a 
couple of friends and do it as a group.
example 
Last week me and a couple mates decided to hit the hmv in Birmingham as
they had just stocked up on the metal section.

Each of us was assigned a role I was the thief, ANARKY was the main 
destractor and Torak was the handoff, we entered causing a row and a 
comotion so the staff would look at us then whilst torak browsed the 
hip hop section I tipped the nod to ANARKY who lit up a "strange" 
smelling fag and lurched around swearing at imagenary people, whilst 
he was being thrown out I snagged the CDs we'd chosen and headed to the
top floor, passing them to Torak on the way, as expected I was stopped 
by the guard as I was walking out and I kicked up a fuss 

"Hey man why do you assume Im a thief cos Ive got long hair, look at 
them fuckin ravers over there, they fuckin get all there cash from 
dealing extasy but you dont stop them ya fucker"

This got the ravers involved and in the confusion torak just legged to
the meet,and bingo a ton of free cds plus we got into a nice little 
fight with the ravers I insulted hahahaahahaha
(I know I could have done the brittannia scam I detailed last month 
but they only sell wank music and I need the new deicide album,I ve got
it on now and its ace,oh if theres any ravers reading this its not 
personal,I dont hate you as a person more as an institution,if you 
thought for yourself and stopped judging on apperance then I might 
start respecting you)


Remember the three points of the anarchistic and apolitical manifesto

1: Open your eyes. and see what the politicians are doing to our world
2: Open your mouths. protest one voice can start an avalance
3: Close your hand and make a fist. strike back at those who try to 
   keep us pinned down.


Right I cant be arsed to write any more so you'll have to wait til 
next time kiddies
