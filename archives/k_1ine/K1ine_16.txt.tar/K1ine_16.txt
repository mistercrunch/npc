Jimmy Castrillo:

         I write to you this letter in concerns to the tech pay owed to me.
I would very much like to express my feelings on this matter, since so much
time has passed and I have already lost what ever bit of patience and
capalities of reasoning with this matter. I consider and always have a very
hard and devoted worker. Have also been very proud of the fact that many
corporations I've worked for have told me, expressed and shown me what a
great addition and what a valuable asset I am to them. At the beginning of
my employment here at TracFone, I was sure this would be where I would
retire from. Thats not the case, I've grown to hate this place and was not
surprised at the fact that I'm not alone. TracFone demands so much from us
on a daily basis, but doesn't show concern from our hard work. I've always
believed in that a happy employee is a productive employee and that is so
true. You can double my hourly wages and still will feel the same. There is
something in taking pride from what you do and even more where you can stand
behind the product you represent.  I went through CSR training and went on
to the floor and worked very hard to learn and do a great job. Was more
excited to get to Tech Training, so that I could be a bonified tech with a
raise. That was four months ago and still yet no tech pay for my hard work
at training and on phones with irate customers which I have been able to
control peacefully and ended call with a satisfied customer. Motivation has
not existed for a long , long time now. The only thing I keep doing is
making sure I dont take it out on the customer for its not their fault. If I
didn't need money, I would not be working. But since I do need money to
survive , just like you, Paul and FJ,I have to work. For a person(s) to say
to me they sympathize with me is to say hipocrit. A person who can actually
sympathize would have had my money the first paycheck after tech training. I
am not aiming this at you, but am at Paul, FJ, Debra, Nancy and all in
payroll and anyone else who has told me in my face they sympathize,
basically, TracFone. Since I've not been payed tech, which by the way was
supposed to compensate for the 401K deduction that TracFone so insisted was
a good idea, I've had one hundred twenty dollars worth of NSF check charges
at bank, late fees,late in rent and not to say what's  doing to my credit
and my health because of stress. If anyone thinks managing my money wrong is
the problem, then my answer is , who is to tell me what I do with my money.
That is still no reason to hold my money. By the way, from information that
was told to me, no employer has the right to withhold wages of an employee
beyond fifteen days, its illegal and have verified it. This includes the two
days which are being held this month for the next following check. It is
said that the # 1 prepaid cellular company is # 1 at defrauding their
employees. When you keep money from me, you affect my livelyhood. I have
feelings, emotions, and I have a life which I've so long have tried to get
together like my credit, which is going down hill because of TracFone.
I have grown tired of this and not you personally Jimmy, TracFone, I'm
beginning to see the actual truth and its been ugly. This paycheck I have
car payment, past due car insurance credit cards, cell phone, gas , food,
and  rent, which I dont have in full. Only in Florida can a fraudulent
company can become succesfull, since the first thing a company can benefit
from is ripping the employee off. Except for this one, for the law is on my
side. I've also had to visit my doctor, since I've been feeling out of the
norm and found that is due to my stress, caused by TracFone. Where is my
motivation to keep doing a good job, none. Its not there and I still do it.
I would like my money , not next pay period , but ASAP and should re-think
on the two days short this week as well for I am going to be getting in
contact with an attorney, Dept. of Labor, news media and many other
resources at my disposal. I have lost money which I am very upset about
because of all this. I believe I have been as respectful with this letter as
I can or should be. I expect something done like last week on this matter
before I begin with what I have to do.

Sincerely yours,

Nestor L Rodriguez

Introduction

	Imagine a world where the government, doctors, and police can 
determine your future from a simple drop of blood. Imagine that they can 
figure out whether you'll have cancer, whether you'll be weak, or strong,
or big, or small. How about if from birth they decide exactly how your life
will turn out, how long you'll live, and what type of lifestyle you will be 
living in. What if you where denied a job because of a simple gene so small 
the human eye cannot see it, and so mysterious doctors have still much to 
learn about it?

	Throughout this research paper, you will learn of Canada's National 
DNA Databank, the legislation related to it, it's history, and other issues 
which privacy advocates world wide have brought up regarding the use of this 
new technology in the databank.
					
	The technology to do the things mentioned in the first paragraph is 
being developed as we speak, some of it has already been developed. Currently
 scientists are isolating genes in the human DNA which indicate a person 
being prone to sickness, mental illness, being prone to become a criminal, 
or to be a violent person. Genes which allow a person to determine your past,
 present, and future. Even your lineage, and sexual preference will be able 
to be gained from a small drop of blood, a flake of skin, or even a 
fingerprint in the not so distant future.

	In fact, several governments worldwide are creating a method in 
which to store DNA information for the nations citizens. One of the 
countries which are currently and already have developed one of these DNA 
storage centers is our very own Canada.

	The following paper will discuss these issues and many, many more 
which have been brought up by scientists, privacy advocates, and politicians
world wide, as well as in our own backyard in Canada. Although this issue is 
one of world wide importance, this paper will be focused on discussing what 
is currently happening throughout Canada, and what could happen in the future
, pertaining to the DNA Databank.

Overview of Canada's DNA Databank

	Canada's DNA Data Bank has two components. The first is a Crime Scene
Index. The CSI contains DNA information obtained from unsolved crime scenes. 
The second is the Convicted Offenders Index. The COI contains DNA profiles 
of both adult and young offenders convicted of serious offences such as rape,
 violent crimes, child pornography etc. All of this DNA data is stored and 
cross-referenced to decrease the time to solve a serious crime anywhere in 
the country. It is said that it will help police to quickly apprehend those 
repeat and violent sex offenders.

	Canada is one of only a few countries in the world to have a DNA 
Data Bank system, but many are looking at adopting it's technology. 

	This all sounds amazing from a government propaganda standpoint. 
However, read on and we may see a seriously different picture for the future.

History of DNA Legislation In Canada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The first use of DNA as forensic evidence in a Canadian Court was in 
April of 1989 in Ottawa, Ontario. The RCMP used DNA analysis in an 
investigation where a suspect denied involvement in a sexual assault, 
however, the victim identified him as her attacker. The DNA analysis 
confirmed the suspect was the perpetrator. When confronted with the DNA 
results, the suspect changed his plea to guilty. Since then, thousands of 
people have been convicted of violent crimes, and even cleared of charges. 
It has also allowed the exoneration and release of innocent people from 
wrongful convictions.

	It wasn't until July 1995, however, that anything related to DNA 
testing and evidence was put into the legislation by Bill C-104. This bill 
amended the Criminal Code and Young Offenders Act to allow a court judge to 
issue a warrant to obtain DNA samples from a suspect. This was, really, the 
first step towards the DNA Data Bank of today. In fact, this event was 
actually the first stage of Canada's DNA strategy. It allowed the government 
to have a legal underpinning for the collection and use of DNA evidence in 
the court system.

	Now that a legal method of obtaining DNA samples, and the more common
use of DNA as evidence in legal proceedings, the government decided to begin 
moving onto bigger things with DNA. In December of 1998, the DNA 
Identification Act (Bill C-3) was passed into law. This act is what actually 
creates the DNA Databank itself. Bill C-3 is discussed in further detail 
later in this paper.

	In late 1999 the International Police Chiefs Association (IPCA) was 
urging legislatures world wide to pass laws which require that a DNA sample 
be taken from anyone arrested under any charge. By any charge, that would 
include everything from not paying parking tickets, shoplifting, murder, or 
impaired driving. The IPCA was supported by the Canadian Police Association 
(CPA). The CPA used their support for the government's gun control laws to 
leverage to get what they, and the IPCA wanted. A threatening letter was 
sent from the CPA to several government officials that the CPA would revoke 
their support of the upcoming gun control laws, if their DNA demands were 
not met. The CPA also threatened to release a public announcement that the 
DNA Data Bank is a "hoax", which would kill the public support the government
 needed to convince the nation that the data base is a great crime fighting 
tool and would contribute to the overall public safety, and lower crime 
rates.

	The second phase, which we're currently in, is that of the DNA Data 
Bank which this paper is all about. This phase came into effect on June 30, 
2000.


	Bill C-3
	~~~~~~~~

	Bill C-3 was established to create the National DNA Databank itself, 
which is to be maintained by the RCMP. It basically allows the police and 
government to collect DNA samples from criminals, past, present, and future.

	While it is almost always argued that any DNA Databank is better than
 none at all, Bill C-3 still has some very serious problems. This is highly 
evident when one looks at the time and money spent to simply get up to the 
point of entering Bill C-3 into legislation, it is quite obvious that this 
bill should be written right, not the third or even second time, but the 
first time, to be both cost and operationally effective.

	One section of Bill C-3 indicates the conditions by which samples 
can be taken from offenders whom are already serving a sentence. The ability 
to obtain samples in this case are limited to three types of offenders. The 
three are;

 -	A person whom has been declared a Dangerous Offender by the courts
 -	A person whom has been convicted of murdering more than one person 
		on different days
- 	A person whom has been convicted of 2 or more sexual offences, 
		currently serving a sentence of 2 or more years

	Section 10 of Bill C-3 deals with the actual storage of the blood, 
saliva, or hair samples taken from people. This section is one of the most 
controversial issues which surrounds the creation of the DNA Databank. The 
big question is whether to keep or destroy samples once they have been 
processed into the computers and databank system. There is, of course, good 
reasons for both. Because DNA technology is changing at an ever increasing 
rate, the experts predict that the methods which are used to create the 
profiles today, will be incompatible with the methods of the future. Much 
like trying to use old computer punch-cards in one of today's high speed 1 
Ghz computers, it just doesn't work that way.

	Bill C-3 Section 10(1) allows for the retention of "the portions of 
samples of the bodily substances that the Commissioner considers appropriate."
Section 10(2) then continues to allow the Commissioner to do further testing 
if the technology advance was significant enough to justify further analysis.

	Section 11 then sets out the penalties for those who may decide to 
misuse the information or communicate the information to those who do not 
have the proper authority to receive it. This section is definitely a good 
thing, and may hold privacy advocates at bay with regards to the abuse of 
DNA information, obtained by the government. 

	Appendix B lists several recommendations made by the Canadian 
Resource Center for Victims of Crime and The National Justice Network for 
Bill C-3.


	Bill C-104

	Bill C-104 was unanimously passed in 1995. Bill C-104 was created to 
give police the right to seek a warrant to obtain a DNA sample from a suspect
of a crime.

	This bill specifies the criminal offences and guidelines which allow 
DNA samples to be collected from an individual. These criminal offences are, 
specifically;

	 	Piratical Acts
	 	Hijacking
	 	Endangering safety of aircraft or airport
	 	Seizing control of ship or fixed platform
	 	Using explosives
	 	Sexual interference
	 	Invitation to sexual touching
	 	Incest
	 	Offence in relation to juvenile prostitution
	 	Causing death by criminal negligence
	 	Causing bodily harm by criminal negligence
	 	Murder

	If any of the preceding offences have been committed, bodily 
substances have been found at scene of crime, and if the court has any other
reasons to believe the person to be a suspect, the court may issue a warrant 
to retrieve blood samples for DNA analysis and comparison.

	Bill C-104 then goes into the appropriate use of DNA samples and 
analysis within an investigation. It states that the DNA samples and 
analysis are not to be used except for within the specified investigation 
for which the sample was taken. If it turns out that the suspects DNA does 
not match that of the evidence found at the crime scene, the samples will be 
immediately destroyed. They will also be destroyed if a person is acquitted 
of the designated offence, unless it is due to an insanity plea, or any other
mental disorder.

	Within the bill are also a few amendments to the Young Offenders Act,
which allow the police and courts to take and do a forensic analysis on a 
young offenders bodily substance, for the purpose to convict them of a crime.
					

DNA Discrimination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	There is a common fear among both DNA researches and privacy 
advocates world wide. While the researches are working hard to develop an 
outline of the human genome, it is feared that isolating genetic diseases 
and sicknesses will eventually lead to discrimination according to these 
genes. A good example of this issue was demonstrated in the United States 
when a fourty-year-old woman was tested positive for the breast cancer gene. 
After undergoing preventive surgery to remove her ovaries and breasts, she 
lost her on-job insurance, and eventually her job because of it.

	As the number of people being genetically tested in both North 
America, and World wide, the chance of a situation like this happening to 
the average person increases a great deal.

	In the near future it will be possible to determine your approximate 
life span, sexual preferences, physical development, mental development, and 
possibly even likes and dislikes. Basically, at birth your life will already 
be known to a certain extent. Imagine knowing from birth that your child is 
gay, or is going to be very sick, or live a short life. How would you feel? 
Would you be able to treat that child the same as if it was a normal child? 
How would society deal with these sudden predispositions about a persons 
future?

	It is feared among many that we will end up reverting back to a 
segmented society, much like the early Americas when the blacks and whites 
were segmented. You could be hired onto a great job because of your genes, 
or you could be fired, or not considered in the first place. The biggest 
problem with this is that you cannot change your genetic make up. You cannot 
change what your DNA tells people, whereas your skills can change, but the 
hiring process may only base a small portion of its deciding factors on your 
actual skills. It is more likely than not that a computer will take the DNA 
data of all the applicants, and filter out anyone who is prone to sickness 
or diseases, who is genetically less likely to be on time for work every day,
 day in day out, and any other traits which they do not wish to have in an 
applicant. The other traits could include discrimination against a specific 
lineage, or racial/ethnic background. Once this data has been filtered out, 
the computer would then, most likely, score each applicant not filtered out, 
according to the number of positive traits the company wants. Already the 
company hasn't even seen anything close to an application from a majority of 
the applicants, and will only see a good 5% of the top of the genetic "pool".


	


Corporate Purchase/Use of DNA Samples and Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Uses for Corporations/Employers
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Samples of DNA and the data which they are then converted to, could be 
of great use to many businesses. As discussed earlier in the DNA Discrimination 
section, it would be possible for a company to filter out any people with genetic
"deficiencies", or who, genetically, are not suitable to what the position that 
they require to fill entails.

	Imagine, for example, a company is looking for a new security guard. Any 
companies ideal security guard would be someone who is well built, quick thinking, 
relatively intelligent, and able to adapt to new environments/situations quickly. 
They would not, however, want a small, out of shape, idiot who would fold under 
any kind of pressure, and isn't too bright. Although they have this requirement, 
every successful company out there realizes that time is money. If a large 
corporation posts a job opening for a security guard, they're likely to get 
thousands of applications, in a large city. Many of the applicants are nowhere 
near suitable for the job. To reduce the time of searching through applications 
forms, resumes, and doing interviews, they could very well, require that a DNA 
sample be given.

	Using this DNA sample, the company would be able to dynamically filter 
out the candidates who do not have genes which promote the needed traits. The 
computer would then only send the remaining applications and resumes to the 
human resources department, which would then save the company a lot of time.

	These DNA samples can then also be used to create mental profiles of 
the companies employees, which would allow the company to decide who is most 
suitable for what promotions, jobs, etc., according to the mental needs of that 
job.


	How DNA Sample Purchase/Use by the Private Sector is Possible
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	By creating a national DNA databank, we are creating profiles and 
information on thousands of people. Imagine, again, that a company does in fact 
request that DNA samples be taken upon application for a job.

	As we discussed in the previous section, companies love to make as much 
money as possible. What is preventing these companies, then, from selling this 
data to a private centralized DNA Databank, much like the national one, but run 
by a group of capitalists who would then go around and sell this data back to the 
private sector.

	This group could use the technology and techniques developed, and freely 
accessible, by the RCMP for their National DNA Databank program. It is also 
possible, considering the age we're living in, that this company could in fact 
steal the information from the DNA Databank, and then sell it to the private 
sector. The private sector could then use this data as a sort of head hunting 
service. Where, they grab the data of a specific genetic group of people, then 
filter out the traits they don't want, and get the few people who have the exact 
genetic traits which they require. This could allow some people to get amazing jobs, 
while others may have equal, if not superior skills, but will not get the job because 
they do not "fit" the "genetic profile" of the company in question.


Re-Writing History: Nazi Germany with DNA Databank
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are very few people who don't  know about the mass killings, torturous experiments 
and racial discrimination carried out during the Nazi reign in Germany during World War II. 

	Thousands of people where executed, gassed, or put to use in experiments during 
World War II, simply because of their religious beliefs or any imperfections which the 
government did not want.

	The biggest number of casualties within this time period was of the Jewish 
population of Germany. The other large number of casualties was of people with disabilities 
etc..

	Some people during this time where able to escape detection by pretending to not 
be Jewish, or hiding their disabilities.

	Now, imagine if the German nation had created a national DNA databank before 
World War II, and the technology had been there to differentiate between ethnic backgrounds, 
and other physical/mental traits according to a persons DNA. The Nazis would have had the 
ability to track down every last Jew, every last person with a disability, and even be 
pickier about what they would and would not allow in a living human in their nation. Hitler's 
ideal human was a German, male, with blue eyes, tall, and blonde hair. He detested people 
with brown eyes, dark hair, and whom were short. With this DNA databank and his criteria, 
he could easily create a list of people who did not fit his ideal genetic profile, and have 
the army and/or the SS terminate anyone whom was on that list.

	Imagine the devastation this would have caused, the thousands of lives who may have 
been killed on top of those whom already where. Is this the kind of technology you want a 
nation, no matter how peaceful or passive at the time, to have? Many say not, as it is quite 
a scary thought.





Future of Canada's DNA Databank
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Although it is clear that the creation of this massive database of DNA for all of 
Canada is a sure thing, what is not so clear is the future of this controversial crime 
fighting mechanism. The biggest question is raised with privacy issues, and worries of ill
use of this information

	The future of this DNA Databank will, ultimately, be determined by the public 
response to such a tool, as well as the recommendations of the Privacy Commissioner of 
Canada. It has been recommended by government consultants and privacy advocates that the 
government allow changes and revisions to be made on DNA legislation according to the 
recommendations which the Privacy Commissioner issues in his/her yearly report. This, some 
say, would allow the privacy advocates some safe keeping in knowing that someone is on their 
side within the government itself, and does have the power to change things.

	The ultimate question, however, is whether or not the DNA Databank will stay with 
us into the distant future. Many think, more hope, that this is not the case. Unfortunately, 
not enough people know about the DNA Databank. The key goal to determining the databank's 
life span will be the public opinion of it. If the public approves of it, or doesn't know 
about it at all, then the government will have no problems with it's further use. However, 
if the general public does learn about it, and does not approve of it, it is almost assured 
that the government will abolish the system.


	Conclusion

	Throughout this paper, the history and general overview of the DNA databank, it's 
related legislation, and  several issues and view points have been brought up. There is 
certainly advantages to the DNA Databank, however, do the advantages really outweigh the 
disadvantages? At this point in time, many are of the opinion that the legislation was rushed 
through the system much too quickly, and due to that, there are several inherent issues with 
the legislation, as well as the base premise for the creation of such a system, not to mention 
its potential uses.

	When one looks at all the information presented in this paper, it is very difficult 
to disagree that the databank has it's advantages. However, on the flip side, it is also 
very difficult to disagree that there is definitely major problems, and issues with this 
relatively new area of technology, and the privacy concerns which it creates.

	Many people are afraid of the implications of such a database, and the discrimination 
which it can cause. When one looks back to the Nazi example given in this paper, it is quite 
scary what this technology could create within our society.

	Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? Or do the disadvantages outweigh the 
advantages, with our current technology, our current legislation, and at this point in time? 
The decision is ultimately the readers.

Canada's DNA Database: Privacy's last stronghold destroyed

     DangerBoy
     July 21, 2000 

     Imagine a society where the government had samples of tissue and fluid from the entire 
community on file and a computerized databank of each individual's DNA profile. Imagine then 
that not only law enforcement officials, but insurance companies, employers, schools, adoption 
agencies, and many other organizations could gain access to those files on a "need to know" 
basis or on a showing that access is "in the public interest." Imagine then that an individual 
could be turned down for jobs, insurance, adoption, health care, and other social services and 
benefits on the basis of information contained in her DNA profile, such as genetic disease, 
heritage, or someone else's subjective idea of a genetic "flaw." Janet C. Hoeffel, "The Dark 
Side of DNA Profiling: Unreliable Scientific Evidence Meets the Criminal Defendant",
42 Stanford Law Review 465 at 533-34 (1990).

     Stop imagining. This is the reality you are being forced into. The Canadian government 
unveiled this month what it says is the world's most automated and sophisticated DNA database, 
capable of automatically identifying persons through analysis of minute amounts of blood, semen, 
or skin cells.

     DNA as forensic evidence was first used in Canada in 1988. By 1995 it was amended into the 
Criminal Code by Parliament that law enforcement officers could take DNA samples from Canadian 
citizens. If you do the math you will realize that they already have 5 years of DNA samples to 
put into their database. This amendment was created with the database already in mind. The big 
goal reached by baby steps.

     Two years later in December of 1998 The DNA Identification Act passed into law. By late 
1999, the International Association of Police Chiefs, which represents police agencies in 112 
countries, urged legislatures around the globe to pass laws requiring DNA samples from anyone 
arrested on any charge, whether the charge was murder, impaired driving, or shoplifting. The 
International Association of Police Chiefs was in turn supported by our own Canadian Police 
Association (CPA) which sent a letter threatening to withdraw their endorsement of the 
government's gun-control law unless they got what they wanted, which in turn was what the 
International Association of Police Chiefs wanted. The CPA also threatened to mount a public 
campaign denouncing the DNA bank as a "hoax." The government needed the support of the public 
in their belief that the database would be a major crime-fighting tool and contribute to public 
safety to have the DNA Identification Act passed into law unchallenged. The Reform Party, and 
some well-known elected officials side with the view of the International Association of Police 
Chiefs. This is the future they are fighting for.

     With blood being taken from every child at birth, and five years of legislated DNA 
collection already behind them, just how long will it take before the entire population is 
catalogued by the Canadian government? My guess would be that the task is already completed or 
nearly so. DNA collection is frighteningly convenient, and less than 1/10 of a pinhead-sized 
piece of you is required to garner a DNA sample. A piece of hair, a drop a blood, a flake of 
dead skin... in fact, machines which can suck a DNA sample off of you from a distance are 
already available. The technology to take DNA from a fingerprint is close to being perfected.

     Also surprising is the fact that DNA databanks are already widely prevalent in other parts 
of the world; The United States, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark, just 
to note a few.

     In the United States, the International Association of Police Chiefs has also asked the 
U.S Congress to consider requiring DNA samples from anyone arrested. Rudolph Giuliani, New 
York City's mayor supports this requirement and is asking to take it one step further. Mr. 
Giuliani has requested that the state legislature require DNA samples from every newborn baby!

     In Britain and Scotland already, there is a program of genetic sampling of people charged 
with any offence, including routine traffic violations. On September 1 1999, a law in Louisiana
took effect that required DNA to be taken from people arrested, but not necessarily convicted, 
of a violent crime.

     Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Clearly, the International Association of Police Chiefs 
mandate is the construction of an international database to track every individual on the 
planet. Canada is already negotiating with other nations that possess DNA databanks to set up 
a system whereby genetic information can be exchanged.

     One question to ask is: Why are we expected to trust elected officials and law enforcement 
with this type of information. The information which is the genetic code of our being. When the 
future they are fighting for is to make us individuals considered 'guilty' at birth. Not to be 
given the same benefit of the doubt we are supposed to grant them.

     Now, I am not saying that the databank is wholly a bad idea. It has a lot of good premises. 
DNA evidence has been proven effective in past cases. I have no problem with the fact that 
'violent' (and violent needs a very clear definition) criminals should have their DNA taken. 
My worry is that present evidence points to these first steps as only the beginning of global 
oppression. The Canadian Police Association, the Reform Party and others want us to become like 
Scotland and Britain.

     In his annual report, Canada's Privacy Commissioner, Bruce Phillips, warns us of the danger
this database poses. "Unique personal identifiers and powerful technologies may appear to solve 
immediate administrative problems but they pose long-term threats to individuals' privacy, a 
fundamental value in a democratic society".

     "The greatest danger of a forensic DNA data bank is its potential to engulf a significant 
part of the population and become a genetic population register. Recovering abducted children, 
assisting adults with amnesia, providing security for Alzheimer's patients: all could be offered 
as justification for extending genetic sampling--and would blur the line between forensic and 
non-forensic uses."

     Categorical discrimination based on genetic make-up is a realistic concern. As our 
understanding of the human genome improves the danger becomes greater. "This child has the 
criminal gene (or the gay gene), write'em off." Genetic discrimination, it's the next great 
frontier. Our government has already stated that samples will be kept permanently on file so 
that they can be processed again once more advanced technology becomes available.

     You may say to yourself, "Go ahead, take my DNA, I have nothing to hide," but the premise 
that justice supposedly stands on is that we are all 'Innocent until proven guilty.' You 
shouldn't have to defend yourself when you are not accused of a crime. You shouldn't have to 
be concerned that you may be implicated in a crime simply based on where you happen to leave a 
DNA trail. Which just so happens to be *everywhere* you go. Credit Cards and cellular telephones
are mere toys of Big Brother compared to DNA tracking.

     What can you do to stop this? Nothing. You can kick and scream and write your MP and your 
Prime Minister, but the fact is, the deed has been done and it's full steam ahead. 1984 by 2004.

     The implications of this database being used for non-forensic purposes conjures up scary 
images of an Orwellian nightmare where everyone's DNA exists to serve the controlling elect, 
just as barcodes would a grocery store owner. And you thought Nazi Germany was a thing of the 
past.

APPENDIX B

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Time when samples are taken: Section 487.051 sets out that
samples are to be taken when an accused is found guilty, unlike
fingerprints that are taken at the time of arrest. We believe, and would
suggest that most Canadians would agree, that samples should be
taken at the time of arrest just as fingerprints are. Not to do so is to
seriously under use the potential value of DNA evidence. We are simply
unable to accept that there is a significant difference between the
taking of fingerprints and DNA samples whether it be a spot of blood, a
piece of hair, or a sample of saliva.

It leaves a huge hole in the system that may allow serial offenders to
escape detection. Consider a scenario similar to the one the Canadian
Police Association has outlined in the past: The police arrest an
individual for a break and enter and released him on bail. What the
police do not know is that this individual is responsible for a sexual
assault/murder. He knows that if he is convicted of the sexual assault,
police will take his DNA, run it through the bank and possibly come up
with a match for the murder. If he is implicated in the murder, he gets
an automatic life sentence. This individual has two choices hope for an
acquittal or flee. Not only is society denied the knowledge that a murder
has been solved, they are at risk of another murder being committed.
We think that is wrong.

While this above scenario may appear dramatic, it could become a
reality of the system if C-3 remains unchanged. Given that most
suspects are released on bail, and we have a serious problem in this
country of suspects on bail fleeing, it is not that hard to envision. This
problem is compounded with the fact that if picked up in another
province, the suspect may not be returned to face the criminal charges
due to cost.

Concerns have been raised by some that the taking of samples at the
time of arrest will violate the suspect's right to be presumed innocent.
The same argument was no doubt made when fingerprints and
breathalyzers were first used. Both have withstood Charter challenges,
and there is no reason to expect that DNA samples would not also
withstand such a challenge.

Both the CPA and the Department of Justice have obtained legal
opinions that support their respective positions. First of all, we all know
that the only opinions that matter in this country belong to the Supreme
Court Justices. And second, after reviewing all four legal opinions, it
struck me that the former justices who wrote the opinions for the
Government were unaware of why the police needed this power.
Therefore, their opinions, like this legislation, are flawed.

Recommendation #1: That s.487.051 be amended to allow for the
taking of samples upon arrest.

2. Exemption from order to provide sample - Section 487.051(1)(a)
states that a court shall make an order if the offender is convicted of an
offence found in the primary designated offence list. Section
487.051(1)(b) states that a court may make an order if the offender is
convicted of an offence on the secondary designated offence list.
However, subsection (2) and (3) allow for exemptions from (1)(a) and
(b) respectively if the court is satisfied that the offender has
established that the impact of the order on the person's privacy or
security of the person would be "grossly disproportionate to the public
interest in the protection of society and the proper administration of
justice, to be achieved through the early detection, arrest and conviction
of offenders."

When asked to provide a set of facts that would justify such exclusion,
the Minster was unable to do so except to say it was there for
exceptional circumstances. What these exceptional circumstances could
be is a mystery. Either we accept the fact that people convicted of
certain crimes must be in the databank, or we do not. If there is no
clear reason to allow for the exemption, it should be removed as it will
simple occupy valuable court time. It is also a danger to open the door
for the court to define such exceptional circumstances for us. That is the
role of Parliament, and frankly the courts have been doing more and
more of Parliament's job for some time.

Recommendation #2: That s.487.051(2) be removed.

3. Offenders already serving a sentence Section 487.055 deals with
offenders already serving sentences. Subsections (1)(a) and (b) limit the
taking of samples to those offenders who have been (a) declared a
dangerous offender (b) those who have murdered more than one person
at different times, and (c) those who have been convicted more than
once of one or more sexual offences and are serving a sentence of more
than two years.

If there is a justification for taking the samples of Dangerous Offenders
and repeat sex offenders, then there is no logical reason that the
justification should not extend to all offenders convicted of the
designated offences. They have all committed serious offences and their
privacy rights should not override potential public safety concerns. In his
opening remarks, the Minister said, "Biological samples are most likely
to be found at crime scene in these cases (most serious violent
offences), for example, a murder or sexual assault." If DNA evidence is
most common in serious violent cases, why exclude the most serious
violent offenders (murderers) and why limit it to two-time convicted sex
offenders?

Consider the number of unsolved murders we have in this country. Is it
so inconceivable that there are killers sitting in prison responsible for
unsolved murders that DNA may be a factor in? There are hundreds of
unsolved murders in BC alone does anyone truly doubt the fact that
some of those killers are currently in jail, or on parole?

Recommendation #3 expand s.487.055 to include those convicted of
offences under the primary designated offence list.

4. Offenders on parole Section 487.055(4) states that offenders on
parole (Dangerous Offenders, serial killers and repeat sex offenders)
shall be summoned to appear at a designated place to provide a
sample. It would make more sense to simply detain the parolee and
take the sample. The same logic applies to the scenario above. If an
offender on parole receives a summons to appear to give a DNA sample
and is responsible for more crimes than the authorities know about, he
may flee.

Recommendation #4 - That s.487.055(4) be amended to allow for
simple detention of the parolee for the purposes of taking a sample.

5. Prosecutorial exemption  Section 487.053(a) states a prosecutor
can determine that a DNA profile is not necessary. We have concerns
that this may be used during plea bargaining negotiations.

Recommendation #5 - That s.487.053(a) be repealed.

  intro: This document has been written to point out another payphone
         vulnerability that I recently discovered while experimenting
         with two types of COCOTs: the Canada Payphone Corporation / AT&T
         'Elcotel Eclipse', and the Paytel Canada 'Protel'.


  documentation;

 For over two decades, payphone companies have been working ways to make
their payphones more profitable, user-friendly, and secure both in the area
of physical security (to protect from vandals) and line-security (to protect
from phone phreakers).

Starting in the late nineteen-eighties, payphone companies have started to be
successful in stopping the exploitation of their phones by people using
blueboxes, redboxes, beige boxes, and more recently NOS (not in service) 
INWATS numbers for unrestricted line dropping.

In western Canada, where Telus has a monopoly over the payphone market, Telus
has successfully been able to patch the unrestricted line problem. For example:
you pick up the receiver on a Telus payphone, dial a toll free number (800)
and the number you dialed happens to be out of service and hangs up on you;
the payphone will automatically recognize this and seize the phone line.
 
However, I've found that in the last two years that certain COCOTs have been
vulnerable to line seizing exploitation. In March of 2000, I found that a large
portion of the older AT&T Elcotel model 9520c's tend to have a lot of problems
with seizing not-in-service calls. Line seizing exploitation on Elcotel 9520C's
now looks as though it is virtually extinct because a majority of the older and
all of the newer 9520C's have now been fixed by Canada Payphone Corporation
(its Canadian distributor).

"Just when AT&T, Elcotel, Canada Payphone Corporation, and Paytel Canada 
        thought the days of line seizing exploitation was over..."

1. In order to make this particular exploit work, you need to call an 
   out-of-service number such as this one: 1-800-909-0261.

2. After the call connects, you will hear the line hang for approximately
   15 seconds.

3. Now wait for another 5-10 seconds, and the line you called will hang up.

4. At this point the vulnerable phone you are on will try to seize the line
   and make you redial the number. Instead, you will get a normal dial tone.

5. Immediately after getting the dialtone on the phone, enter your area code
   and any local number you wish to call.

6. Your call will connect as if you had placed 25 cents into the payphone,
   and directly dialed the number.

 Q: "What does my caller identification information
     show on the received party's CID display?"
   
 A: If you called from any Paytel Canada COCOT, your CID info will show
    "Paytel Canada" and its assigned phone number. If you call from an
    Elcotel Eclipse COCOT, your CID information will show "Unknown Name"
    and its assigned phone number.

outro:

This file just goes to prove that one of the many exploits
that worked on the payphones of yesterday DO still work on
newer payphones of today, and likely tomorrow if COCOT manu-
facturing and distribution companies don't get a clue as to
how their own payphone equipment works. 

How long is it going to be before these telecom companies
start adopting some sort of a standard for properly securing
POTS-copper lines? Until then, phreaks around the nation will
continue to exploit this ancient form of toll-fraud that hurts
these companies revenues by millions of dollars each fookin' year!

   Introduction --

   
  Over the past 100 years, the public telecommunications industry, more
 commonly known as "payphones", has evolved into one of the most 
 easy-to-use and widely accepted communications networks.  The core
 device in public communications - the payphone - literally has made
 "on the go" communications possible for millions of people daily.

 In recent years, however, unprecedented technological, competitive and
 regulatory changes within the telecommunications industry create an
 equally unprecedented challenge for the public communications sector.
 
 A decade ago, the payphone was the only way most people on the go kept
 connected to home or office.  Talking on the phone while walking down
 the street or through a busy airport was still a concept out of Star
 Trek.  Today, however, wireless phones keep everyone -- from high
 school students to housewives to business travelers -- in touch while
 on the go.

 The Internet likewise has revolutionized how people communicate by
 replacing cards and letters with e-mail, how they shop using e-commerce
 and how they access news, information and services through personalized
 portals.  As a result, telecommunications today is about personal
 connectivity on a 24/7 basis.  Consumers increasingly demand access to
 "content" anytime, anywhere, not just the voice communications provided
 by wireline or wireless phones. Content equals information, ranging from
 voice calls to local news, mapped directions and investments updates to
 e-commerce transactions, e-mail and connectivity with the home, office
 and web-based information.

 Think of a time when all local events, local transportation contacts, local
 maps and weather, sports results, and stock performance information can be
 retrieved by any consumer simply by going to the closest public phone terminal.

 Envision downloading or uploading e-mail from a Palm Pilot or a high-capacity
 smart card at a public phone terminal through the phone's infrared dataport or
 reading and responding to messages on the phone's color screen.      

 Imagine a point-of-sale phone terminal for e-commerce transactions, with an
 ATM-like capability for funds transfer and electronic banking. Speed dial buttons
 linking advertisers and consumers directly enable immediate purchase of anything
 from airline or concert tickets to flowers delivered to your mother for her birthday.

 Think of a medium where all advertising can be delivered to the consumer on a
 terminal-by-terminal, time-of-day and interactive basis in any indoor environment.
 Advertisements can be changed selectively, one by one, on any terminal at any time.
 Product launches, specials, sales promotions, targeted messages, and local services
 can be location specific. This flexibility has no comparison in the advertising world.

 Imagine having airline and train schedules, convention agendas, weekly specials and
 sales promotions, public service information, local transportation numbers, event
 schedules, and local directions to nearby sites - all available from a public phone.

 Now imagine that this technology is already available... because it is.

  Physical Overview -


 (Image: http://www.nettwerked.net/grapevine.jpg)


 		Speed-dial Buttons
                ------------------

There are eight black speed-dial buttons down the middle of the Grapevine.
The top button is labelled "Collect Call", the second one says "Send Flowers".
The remaining three are "Repair", "Data Jack", and "Language". As well, you
will likely notice an Infrared Data Access (IrDA) - used for transfering data
such as electronic mail to your PDA (Palm, Visor).

Collect Call - This connects you to the local AT&T operator    

Send Flowers - This allows you to send flowers to your loved ones with a
               credit card via 1-800-FLOWERS

Repair - Press this button if the Grapevine you are operating is not working
         properly. You will be directly connected to a Canada Payphone Corp
         (the distributors who are 20% owned by AT&T), AT&T or private contract
         repairman.

Data Jack - Press this button if you plan to insert a phone jack into the
            RJ-11 data jack to dial up the toll-free number to your ISP.
            The Grapevine does not allow long-distance or local exchange
            dialing for data transfers. Though you are connected at 33.6/kbps.

Language - Press this button to switch the words on the screen from English
           to French.

		Softouch Buttons
                ----------------

There are five more black oval buttons along the button of the screen on the
Grapevine known as 'Softouch Buttons'. The buttons are labelled the following:
"Info", "E-com", "Mail", "Data", and "Help". Press 1 and you get a message
saying: "This key is not yet operational". When implemented, it will provide
some important information designed for travellers. The INFOS screens will
offer maps, weather, financial news, and sports scores -- all at the simple
touch of a button. If you press the "help" key you will get: "You have pressed
the HELP key. Context-sensitive online help is available for the Grapevine
Cashless ATM and E-Commerce functions. If you need additional information,
press the HELP key." You have pressed the help key. If you need additional
information, press the help key. Obviously this is a glitch in the Grapevine.

	        Grapevine Display
                -----------------

On the Grapevine smart-phone, the first thing you will likely notice is the
rotating ads for 'CBC', 'Best Western Hotels', 'Esso', and 'FTD' - all of which
are either corporate sponsors or location hosts. The display on the Grapevine
smart-phone is a simple 5 1/4" VGA screen.


		Physical Administration
	        -----------------------

Physical administration on the Grapevine smart-phone is done much the same
way as physical administration is done on the Eclipse and 9520C model Elcotel
COCOTs - with total lack of respect for security. ;)

-= PIN ADMIN =-
The benefit of Physical Administration over Remote Administration is that you
are not required to enter an ID of some sort before entering the PIN.
The physical administration PIN scheme on the Grapevine phone is exactly the
same as the PIN scheme for the Eclipse / 9520C models...

1. Press # (8 digit default pin).

2. After entering the physical admin PIN the display on the Grapevine
   will say 'thank you'.

3. Now enter series of 3 digit flags: the flags are from 000-999.
   For example: 999 - resets the phone, 998 - is a memory test.

If you enter the correct 3 digit flag, you will have the ability to:

- empty out the cash box

- change screen messages

- administrate rate tables

- see how many calls were made with the phone in a given time period

- see how many days the phone has not been in use

- debit card information

- several security parameters

- etcetera 

Just so you know, every time you administrate (or attempt to bruteforce
the physical admin PIN) the Grapevine will send the statistics to CPC
(Canada Payphone Corp) for updating... (604)-717-6532. If CPC notices a
strange pattern in the number of times the Grapevine was administrated,
then they will start to pay attention to that particular phone, and will
likely wait for you return. When you're caught, CPC will grab you buy your
throat and cut off your hands... so you may never again wreck havoc on with
their equipment again!

		Alarm PIN Information
		---------------------

Disabling the alarm on the Elcotel Grapevine is relatively simple.
What you are required to enter is a three digit PIN, which if correctly
entered, will turn off the local alarm in the phone. This means that the
static connection from the phone to Canada Payphone's NCC computer in Burnaby
British Columbia will be severed. However, if you enter an incorrect alarm
PIN on the Grapevine, you'll get an error message on the display.

Q: How do I disable the alarm?

A: By picking up the receiver on the phone, pressing #,
   and entering the three digit PIN.

Q: How do I know I'm doing it correctly?
A: You'll know you're doing it correctly when you see ### on the display...
   the ### represent the PIN. If you entered the right PIN, the display
   message will say "OK".

Q: How do I enable the alarm again?
A: - Pick up the receiver (if it was hung up) and type #CPC.
   - Hang up the receiver and wait for approximately twenty seconds for
     the phone to reconfigure itself. (You'll know you can use the phone
     again when you hear the components in the Elcotel Grapevine) shifting.

Note: Just like physical PIN administration, fucking with the alarm PIN
      will cause the Grapevine to send statistical information to CPC HQ.

  Remote Overview -

Remote administration of the Grapevine payphone is simple:

With a computer a modem, and the proper remote administration software,
dial the local or long distance phone number of belonging to a particular
Grapevine phone. If you successfully connected (2400 baud), you will be
prompted for your ID - the ID ranges from 8000 and up. Knowing this, we can
presumably say that all ID's are programmed to be four digits - or at least
four digits by default. Next is the PIN; the remote administration PIN by
default is 8 digits long using the same number: i.e. 11111111, 22222222, etc.

Remote Administration Software to look for:

* PollQuest (aka 'International Payphone Network Management System')

* Coin Net

* Expressnet

* PNMPLUS Lite

* Pronet

  Conclusion -

The payphone of the 21st century isn't phone at all; it's a "high-tech
information station" offering "controlled Web content to customers who
are hungry for it." The people who make payphones, and the people who
use expressions like "high-tech information stations" say there's a para-
digm shift going on in this industry. People like myself look at the
Grapevine smart-phone as a huge technological progression in the telecom-
munications industry... just another toy to phreak. :)

			  -= Random Thoughts =-

  He that walks through his life with blood-shot eyes, does not see the
   disturbing reality of this grim hell-hole that we are forced to like
   in. Normal is the sight of blood stained floors & streets. Used to 
   the stench of death. Flying high but sinking lower, cracked out and 
   sucked in. We are the kids that no one wants to be. We ARE that dist-
   urbing reality. Succumbed into swallowing that fake happiness that 
   gives us the feelings of belong. That gap in the space between failure 
   and accomplishment is our home. We live there blind. Wanting to be
   successful, too fucked to try. Sinking deeper into the realms of
   un-forgiveness- we cannot control. We are the future of something we
   have come to fear. Love and peace are merely words we use to hide the
   hate and destruction in our lives. We are numb to our surroundings,
   pretending not to see the hell that we are burdened with hell; As I 
   take my last breath, I know that I'll be happy. I've lived my life the 
   way I wanted to. I spoke my mind and I was heard. I never let anything 
   get in my way of what I wanted. I had rough times and things that will 
   never leave my mind, but I overcame them. I didn't let the sorrows get 
   me down too much. When I die I won't be afraid or regret anything. We 
   live our lives and those afraid to die are the people who aren't doing 
   what they want to do. They are afraid that they won't be able to do all
   the things they want to do but they aren't doing anything to accomplish
   them. I'm glad I'm not one of those people. I welcome the end but I'm 
   happy living every day. I don't want to leave but if I had to then I 
   would finally be complete. We improve on everyday and make our lives how
   we want to live. It's our choice on what path we take. I want the path 
   that leads me to a future that I can be happy with. I'll die knowing 
   that I had the best life I let myself have, and to me that is as good 
   as it can be. I won't resent anything I've done because blaming yourself
   and feeling sorry for yourself won't change the past. It just wastes your time.

	Primitive Model 170 Card Reader Reverse Engineering
	---------------------------------------------------


Introduction:
-------------

Recently I, *ahem*, acquired an American Magnetics model 170 card
reader. Originally, I thought I was getting a 171, which have various
SDKs and even an RS-232 jack on the back of them, which would have
made it very easy to produce some software for it.

But in an effort to always look on the bright side of things, I've
embarked on a small effort to find a method of interfacing one of
these things with a PC, but thanks to the inaccurate documentation
available, it's turning out to be a bit of a struggle. If you have any
info on these card readers, I'd love to hear about it.



Official Specs:
---------------

These card readers are supposed to support reading from magstripes,
and reading/writing to smart cards. They are supposed to be incredibly
durable little machines, specifically tuned toward fraud protection.
They apparently have an anti fraud censor that will be able to detect
any wires attached to an inserted card which is supposed to defeat a
common smart card attack. It's supposed to operate comfortably between
-25 and 70 degrees celcius, and is guaranteed for at least .5 million
card insertions.

It is supposed to come with a 26 pin, right angle, mount header with
a Molex part number of 87049-2616, and has an option for a latch
motor inside of it.



Actual Specs:
-------------

The one that I got is quite a bit different. All of the physical
specs seem to coincide with the published details. The pictures
match up, and mine even says "170 TDA,HD UP,FLG,SM,NT" on it,
whatever the fuck that means. It also has "P/N 509892-002C REV:C"
below that. I assume that means Part number and Revision. It also
has an S/N on it, which I assume stands for serial number.

It has 2 cool insertion detection mechanisms on it. It has the
very cool smart card thingies on it, and an even cooler magnetic
read head on it, but no latch motor, unfortunatley.

By the way, it's got the cool American Magnetics Eagle logo on it, 
a bar code, and, if you were wondering, American Magnetics has their
products made in China. A little ironic, hm?

But that's where the similarities stop. Mine has an unlabeled ribbon
cable connector with only 14 pins on it, making their pin listings
in their PDF completely useless to me. Oh well.




Reverse Engineering:
--------------------

So, what do you do if you've got a piece of undocumented hardware that
you desperatley want to interface with a PC? Good old mind numbing,
painstakingly tedious reverse engineering.

What I've done so far is measure the resistance between every pin while
there is no current flowing in the circuit at all, and while the
card reader was in 3 different states: Empty, Card partially inserted,
and Card fully inserted. Here's my results:


Resistance between pins:

2 and 4 - Norm: Low resitance. Once fully inserted, jumps to high resistance.

2 and 6 - Norm: Medium resistance. Seems to be slight changes in resistance
                as card is inserted.

2 and 9 - Norm: Low resistance. Jumps to high when card is partially
          inserted.

2 and 12 - Same as 2 and 4.

4 and 6 - Norm: Medium resistance. Slight change when card inserted.

4 and 9 - Same as 2 and 4.

4 and 10 - Same as 2 and 4 with more subtle jumps in resistance.

4 and 11 - Same as 2 and 4.

6 and 9 - Same as 2 and 4.

6 and 11 - Medium, unchanging resistance.

6 and 12 - Same as 2 and 4.

9 and 11 - Same as 2 and 4.

9 and 12 - Same as 2 and 4.

11 and 12 - Medium, unchanging resistance.


Note: All combinations not mentioned didn't permit electrical flow between
them.


Smart card connections:

Ok, another thing I've done is check the conductivity between the
smart card contacts and the pins on the ribbon cable.

Ok, I'm not exactly sure about wether there is some sort of convention
about calling the card contacts certain numbers, so I'll just give you
some ASCII art:

Here's your card:        Here's my numbering scheme:
/-------------\            /-------------\
|             |            |             |
|   O O O O   |            |   1 2 3 4   |
|   O O O O   |            |   5 6 7 8   |
|             |            |             |
|             |            |             |
|             |            |             |
|             |            |             |
\-------------/            \-------------/

As you can see, the one towards the end of the reader is the first row.
Anyways, it turns out there is a direct path between the contacts on
the card reader and the pins on the ribbon cable. Here they are:

Contact      Pin
   1.........10
   2.........7
   3.........2
   4.........5
   5.........13
   6.........8
   7.........14
   8.........3

I can't really see any pattern. Hmm... No bother.



Summary:
--------

So, what does this tell us? Not much, unfortunatley. However, knowledge of
these pins will be essential in the final software, I imagine.

However, it would be concievable that somebody would want to make a short
little program than once hooked up to the card reader would tell you
on your monitor wether there was a card inside it or not. I think I'll
try to make this as soon as I can get enough time to hack around with
a serial port, or go buy a bi-directional parallel cable...

The smart card can concievably be much more useful. You could directly
connect it to a parallel port and run software directly from that. See the
references section at the bottom for more info. Eventually, I'd like the
software set that I hope to produce to be able to support smart cards
in full.

Eventually I would like to see a full software set with all the bells and
whistles available for it, so everyone can see what exactly is stored on
their magstripes or smart cards. Let me know if you would like to help
out with this project.

     I am Cenobyte,
     I'm fucked up to the core.
     I take it up the ass,
     Just like my daddy's whore.
     I whine and complain,
     From the morning to the night.
     I can't take any hints,
     Just can't do anything right.
     I have no artistic talent,
     Even though I think I'm a Van Gogh.
     And when I try creating something,
     Everybody tells me where to go.
     If you think this poem is done,
     Your right from the very start.
     Cenobyte is not that bad,
     If you enjoy smelling people fart.
