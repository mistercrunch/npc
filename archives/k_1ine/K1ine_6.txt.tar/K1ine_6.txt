			_-_ FAX Fiasco _-_


Written by: Ethan 
August 8, 2000

			     

"Is there an electrical engineer in the house?" asked Phyllis.

"Does sticking you finger in the electrical socket one too many times
count?  What's the problem?"

"The FAX machine is broken."

Indeed.  Every time a FAX would come in, the blinkin' lights would flash and
the speaker would show: PAPER JAM.  Upon careful examination, it appeared
that the paper feeder mechanism wasn't working.  Whipping out the trusty
set of office tools, I quickly peeled the case off so I could get to the
whirring bits...   

Behind a couple of PCBs lay the feeder mechanism, which consisted of a bar
with a rubber roller attached to a special slip gear.

The slip gear was a two part assembly.  The first part was the main drive
gear driven by the motor.  It was not directly attached to the feeder shaft
and could spin freely if the shaft were stuck.  The second part was a
sleeve with a coil of wire around it that was directly attached to the
shaft via a face plate at the end.  Parallel to this sleeve was a metal
plate with a solenoid behind it.  It looked something like this:


                    Main Gear

                        ---  Sleeve with
                        ---    Coil
                        --- ||||||||||# 

                        --- ||||||||||#
           ============ --- ||||||||||-
                        --- ||||||||||#
       Feeder Bar       --- ||||||||||#
                        --- j
                        --- ===========
                                        |         |
                            |         |
                            -----------

                             Metal Plate
                                                         with Solenoid
                                                         (not pictured)


The coil had a small hook in it at one end which would catch against the
metal plate when the solenoid was off.  This allowed the drive gear to spin
when the motor started without feeding a sheet of paper.  As soon as the
timing were correct, the solenoid was supposed to fire and pull the plate
out of the way to allow the shaft to turn.  The problem was, it wasn't.

My first thought was to test the solenoid.  Being multimeter free, this was
going to be a challenge.  Seeing a transformer at the rear of the unit, I
figured the voltage might be stepped down a bit, so I pulled the 5VDC
power supply off my Personal Jukebox MP3 player[1] and grabbed some
staples.  Removing the solenoid connector from the PCB, I put the staples
in the connector holes and touched the staples to jack on the power supply.

Nothing.

Well, the voltage might be too low, so I needed another plan.  What I
really needed was an LED.  Scrounging around in the parts bin turned up 
nothing, though, so I was starting to run out of options.

Then I remembered Tony had an X-Files key-chain light that I knew had an LED
in it.  So, I grabbed it off his desk and cracked that sucker open.  Now,
this was one of those "squeeze till it lights" key-chains with the batteries
inside, so I left the key-chain as intact as I could; that way I could use
the batteries and the light to test the solenoid.  I put the staples back
in the solenoid connector and touched them to the batteries to copulate the
circuit.

Lo! and Behold! the light was green!  Continuity of the solenoid was good,
so this must mean there was some other problem.

After fiddling around with the thing for a while, doing some trial an error
experiments, it turned out that the screws holding the face-plate to the
feeder bar had worked loose and allowed the sleeve to twist out of position
on the shaft.  This meant that the timing of the solenoid was off, so by
the time solenoid actually fired to pull the plate out of the way, things
had gotten wound up so tight that the metal plate wouldn't budge, thus
causing a simulated paper jam.  Twisting the faceplate back into position
and tightening the screws was all it took.

      away from the inside of the lower housing.

Step 3 - Removing the Coin Acceptor

   1. Remove the coin reject chute from the coin acceptor by loosening the
      screw that attaches them together.
   2. Loosen the slotted nut at the top rear of the coin acceptor.
   3. Remove the coin acceptor.

Step 4 - Removing the Coin Box

   1. Insert the lower housing key into the lock on the left side of the
      lower housing & turn it 90º backwards.
   2. Insert the T-Key into the hole in the vault door & turn it ¼ turn to
      the right.
   3. Remove the vault door & the coin box from the vault area.

Step 5 - Securing the Lower Housing to the Mounting Surface

   1. Insert the telephone line wire through the line wire entrance hole.
   2. Secure the payphone to the mounting surface using ¼ - 20
      mounting screws, (try to avoid optional hole.)

Step 6 - Reinstalling the Coin Box

   1. Install the coin box
   2. Make sure lower housing key is in unlock position
   3. Insert the T-Key into the vault door & secure the vault door
      by turning the T-Key ¼ turn to the left.

Step 7 - Reinstalling the Coin Acceptor

   1. Before installing the coin acceptor, make sure the
      trigger switch (part beneath coin acceptor,) is secured.
   2. Guide the tab at the bottom rear of coin acceptor into the
      rear slot of trigger switch.
   3. Position coin acceptor bracket on rear lip of the slotted nut 
      & then tighten nut.
   4. Reinstall coin reject chute making sure it is properly attached to
      the side of coin hopper.

Step 8 - Reinstalling the Circuit Board Chassis

   1. Install the circuit board chassis by guiding the tab at the
      top rear of the chassis into the slot at the top, left side of the
      lower housing. As you position tab, guide the chassiss slotted nut
      onto the mounting stud of the lower left side of the housing & then 
      tighten it.
   
   2. Connect the trigger switch to the 4-pronged socket.
   
   3. Connect the relay to the 3-pronged socket.
   
   4. Connect the RJ11 modular plug to the incoming RJ11 outlet of
      the circuit board.
   
   5. Connect the ground strap to the middle right screw of the terminal
      block.
   
   6. Connect the battery connector. (Note: To prevent battery
      draining, leave the battery unplugged if the telephone line is
      not to be connected shortly after installing the phone.)

Step 9 - Connecting the Telephone Line

   A minimum of 22ma (or 44 VDC) loop current must be provided to the
   phone from the Telephone Companys Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. It is
   recommended that the loop current level at the phone be tested at this
   time to ensure that the required loop current level is present.

    1. Connect the tip wire to the terminal block screw across
       from the green pigtail cable.
    
    2. Connect the ring wire to the terminal block screw across
       from the red pigtail cable.
    
    3. Connect an incoming ground wire to the left middle terminal
       block screw to insure safe operation.

   OPTIONAL: If using a line cord with a modular RJ11 plug, simply
   unplug the incoming RJ11 pigtail connector from the surge protector
   & insert the modular RJ11 plug in its place, bypassing the terminal
   block.         

Step 10 - Connecting the Upper & Lower Housings

    1. Carefully rest the upper housing on the ledge of the lower housing.
    
    2. Plug in the 25-pin ribbon cable male plug to the 25-pin female
       socket of the circuit board chassis.
    
    3. Reference the initialization procedure before completely
       securing the upper & lower housing.


Step 11 - Inserting the Instruction Card & Windows

    1. Insert the lower portion of the upper instruction card (the
       smaller card) into the lower portion of the upper faceplate cutout,
       (the smaller cutout.)
    
    2. Insert the top, right corner of the card into the top, right
       corner of the upper faceplate cutout & guide the remaining portion
       of the card into the faceplate from right to left, using a
       flat-head screwdriver.
   
    3. Repeat the previous 2 steps to insert the lower instruction card.
   
    4. Remove the plastic wrap from the plastic windows & then use
       the same method used to insert the instruction cards to insert the
       upper & lower plastic windows in front of the instruction cards.
       Press against any portions of the windows that appear to be bulging
       out to make them flush against the instruction cards.

Quick Programming Reference

       All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.

   Entering the Program Mode

    Step 1 - Push & hold the black program button (located on left side of
             circuit board, towards the top)
    Step 2 - Pick up the handset. When you hear a single beep, release the
             program button.

   Note: One beep is a completed entry. Three beeps is an error. To start
   an entry over, press the # key & wait for three beeps to be heard. All
   program entries can be done in one session in no specific order except
   for the initialization being done first. To set the CTR-201 back to
   the factory pre-settings, re-initialize the phone.

Initializing the CTR-201

   Enter the program mode & type in the following entries.

   Step 1 - 00 HAC NXX XXXX * (Home Area Code & Telephone # of the Payphone)

   Step 2 - 47111 *

Changing or Establishing Rates

The following is the format necessary to change or add rates. Xs represent
where a digit, (according to your application), must be filled in. 

                        6xxx xxxx xxxx xxx xx 0008 *
                               ñ  ñ ñ ñ ñ ñ ñ
    1.Call Type Rate Band 2.Initial Charge 3.Additional Charge 4.Initial
    Time Limit 5.Additional Time Limit 6.Keypad Activity 7.Completes the
                                   Entry

     Example:    

 6000    0035   0010   015     05    0008     *

   The above entry would make Call Type Rate Band 6000 (7-digit calls,
   non-specific) $. 35 the first 15 minutes and $ .10 each additional 5
   minutes.

  Step 1 - Enter the 4-digit Call Type Rate Band, (see list on page 5.)
   
  Step 2 - Enter the 4-digit Initial Charge of the call. ie. 0035 = $.35
   
  Step 3 - Enter the 4-digit Additional Charge of the call. ie. 0010 = $.10
   
  Step 4 - Enter the 3-digit Initial Time Limit of the call. ie. 015 = 15 mins
   
  Step 5 - Enter the 2-digit Additional Time Limit of the call. ie. 05 = 5 mins
   
  Step 6 - Enter the 4-digit Keypad Activity. ie. 0008 = open keypad during the
           call

  Step 7 - Press the * key to complete the entry. 

** To program a call to have no time limit: 
 
   - set the additional charge at 0000, 
   - set the initial time limit at 255
   - set the additional time limit at 01.

** To disallow keypad use during a call:

   - Set the keypad activity to 0001.
 
 (All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.)


Programming Area Codes

   Special Note:  The CTR-201 is pre-set with all original North American
   area codes, (area codes containing a 0 or 1 as the center digit.) Due
   to an expanding North American Numbering Plan, there have been several
   new area codes added. These area codes are defined by not containing a
   0 or a 1 as the center digit & should be added to the CTR-201. You can

   rate when the caller must dial 1+ the area code & phone number to call
   a surrounding local area code.

   For Area Codes Containing a 0 or 1 as the Center Digit

   Step 1 - Set up Rate Band 6072 as the rate for the surrounding area
            code(s) with a 0 or 1 as the center digit. 
            (see Establishing Rates)
   
   Step 2 - Enter the actual area code(s) under Code Band 5072. (see

   Example Entry: 6072 0025 0025 003 03 0008 *  5072 212 * 718 * 917 * *
   would make area codes 212,718,& 917 $.25 every 3 minutes.

    
For Area Codes Not Containing a 0 or 1 as the Center Digit:

   Step 1 - Set up Rate Band 6058 as the rate for the surrounding area
            code(s) without a 0 or 1 as the center digit. 
            (see Establishing Rates)
   
   Step 2 - Enter the actual area code(s) under Code Band 5058. (see
            Adding Area Codes)

   Example Entry: 6058 0025 0025 003 03 0008 * 5058 630 * 773 * 847 * *
   would make area codes 630,773, & 847 $.25 every 3 minutes

Separating Local &Toll 7-Digit Calls

In certain area codes, 7-digit calls can be local or a per-minute toll
charge. The following procedure shows the steps necessary to distinguish the
rate for local & toll 7-digit calls, (a prefix is the first 3-digits of a
7-digit number.)              

   Step 1 - Determine whether there are more local or toll prefixes from
            your location.

   Step 2 - Set up Call Type Rate Band 6000 (non-specific 7-digit calls)
            as the rate for the majority of prefixes (local or toll) in
            your area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Step 3 - Set up Call Type Rate Band 6001 (special 7-digit calls) as the
            rate for the prefixes that there are fewer of (local or toll)
            in your area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Step 4 - Enter each of the prefixes that there are fewer of in Call
            Type Code Band 5001. (see  Adding Area Codes) These prefixes
            will be charged at the rate established under Call Type Rate
            Band 6001.

   Example Entry: 6000 0075 0075 002 02 0008 * 6001 0035 0000 255 01 0008
   * 5001 550 * 556 * 578 * * would make prefixes 550,556, & 578 $.35 &
   all other 7-digit calls $.75 every 2 minutes

   Adding 1-888 & 1-877 Toll Free Service

    Step 1 - Enter 6063 0000 0000 255 01 0008 *

    Step 2 - Enter 5063 888 * 877 * *

   Example Entry : 6063 0000 0000 255 01 0008 * 5063 888 * 877 * * will

   enable 1-888 & 1-877 calls.
   All program entries are done in the program mode, using the keypad.

Separating 10-Digit & 1+ 10-Digit Calls

   In certain area codes, 10 digit calls (area code + the 7-digit phone
   number,) are local calls & 1+10 digit calls are long distance. The
   following procedure shows the steps necessary to distinguish the rate
   of the two types of calls.

   Note: - The 1+ 10-digit calls will remain in Call Type Rate Band 6008.
   Straight 10-digit calls within the area code being programmed for will
   be assigned to Rate Band 6089 after using the following procedure.

  Step 1 - Enter 311
 
  Step 2 - Enter the Area Code your programming for.

  Step 3 - Hold down the program button & press the # key 7 times,
           release pgm. button & press the * key.
 
  Step 4 - Set up Rate Band 6089 as the rate for the 10-digit calls of
           the area code. (see Establishing Rates)

   Ex. Entry: 311 281 (pgm. button down & # key 7 times) * 6089 0035 0000

   255 01 0008 *

   The above entry would make calls dialed 281 xxx xxxx $.35 & calls
   dialed 1+ 281 xxx xxxx long distance.

Programming a 211 Repair Number

  Step 1 - Enter 6080 0000 0000 255 01 000801 *
    
  Step 2 - Enter 22 & then the number you want called in case of repair
           needed. (Enter a 1 & or Area Code if required when calling the
           reporting number from the payphone.)

   Example Entry: 6080 0000 0000 255 01 000801 * 22 550 5592 would make
   the payphone call 550 5592 anytime 211 is dialed

Programming the Coin Box Amount Security Code

   Step 1 - Enter 293
   
   Step 2 - Enter a four digit security code of your choice.
   
   Step 3 - Press the * key to complete the entry.
   
   Step 4 - Reset the current amount to zero. (see Resetting the Coin Box
            Amount to Zero)       

    Example Entry: 293 1111 * would set the Coin Box Amount Security Code
                   to 1111
   

Re-Setting the Coin Box Amount to Zero(Not done in program mode)

   - Make sure youre not in the Program Mode.
   - Pick up handset & listen for dial tone.
   - Dial * # 5 followed by your 4-digit Coin Box Amount Security Code.

   Example: * # 5  1111 would reset the Coin Box Amount to Zero

Determining the Coin Box Amount (Not done in the program mode)

   - Make sure youre not in the Program Mode.
   - Pick up the handset & listen for dial tone.
   - Dial * # 4 followed by your 4-digit Coin Box Amount Security Code.

   Example: * # 4 1111 would prompt the phone to give the Coin Box Amount
            Security Code

   - The phone will give a 5-digit voice prompt. 
     (Note: zeros will sound like an O.)            

   First Digit = Hundreds / Second Digit = Tens / Third Digit = Ones /
   Fourth Digit = Tenths / Fifth Digit = Hundredths

   Example 1: O 1 1 2 5  would = $11.25 in the coin box

   Example 2: 1 3 4 7 O would = $ 134.70 in the coin box



Testing the Loop Current Level

   A minimum of 22ma (or 44VDC) loop current must be provided to the
   phone from the Telephone Companys Central Office. In certain
   situations, due to the distance between the Central Office and the
   phone site, the loop current may not meet the required level of 22ma.
   If the loop current is below 22ma, dial tone may not occur or the
   phone may experience only momentary burst of dial tone. If the loop
   current level is below 22ma, you should contact your Local Telephone
   Co.         

    ** You will need a current meter to test the loop current level. Set
   the meter to Amps.

  Step 1 - Make sure the incoming tip wire is connected to the terminal
           block inside the lower housing. This wire should be connected
           directly across from the green wire of the pigtail cable.
  
  Step 2 - Make sure the incoming ring wire is disconnected from the
           terminal block inside the lower housing.
   
  Step 3 -  Make sure the incoming ground wire is connected to the
            center terminal screw of the terminal block inside the lower
            housing.

     (Note: Use standard grounding procedures to ensure that the ground
            wire is at the earth ground potential.)

  Step 4 - Disconnect the ring wire (red) of the pigtail cable from the
           terminal block & connect one lead of the current meter to it.
   
  Step 5 - Connect the other lead of the current meter to the
           disconnected incoming ring wire.
   
  Step 6 - Lift the handset off hook and record the loop current level
           shown on the meter. Verify that the reading is greater than
           22ma. 

Problem: No Dial Tone

   Probable Cause: Telephone line dead or improperly connected
   Solution: Check line for dial tone & check terminal block
             for proper connections

   Probable Cause: Battery not plugged in or battery below 3.5 Volts
   Solution: Plug in battery or test with meter for proper voltage (4.8VDC)

   Probable Cause: Stuck coin in trigger switch assembly
   Solution: Remove coin acceptor & trigger switch to find & remove stuck
             coins

   Probable Cause: Handset is miswired or defective
   Solution: Try the following patterns, depending on what color handset
             wires you have:

   Original Handset (Protel): R1 = black  R2 = yellow  T1= green  T2 = red

   Universal Replacement: R1 = green  R2 = yellow  T1 = black  T2 = red

   Universal Replacement: R1 = white  R2 = white  T1=black  T2 = red


   Probable Cause: Hook switch contacts are shorted
   Solution: Set a meter on ohms & disconnect one hook switch wire & put
             one lead of meter on connected wire & one lead of meter on
             disconnected wire. You should have a reading of infinity
             while on- hook & a reading of apx. 00 when off-hook.

   Probable Cause: Upper housing ribbon cable cut or damaged
   Solution: Replace keypad assembly.

   Problem: No disconnect after hanging up
   
   Probable Cause: Hook switch contacts are shorted  
   Solution: Set a meter on ohms & disconnect one hook
   switch wire & put one lead of meter on connected wire & one lead of
   meter on disconnected wire. You should have a reading of infinity
   while on - hook and a reading of apx.00 when off-hook.

   Probable Cause: Telephone line improperly connected
   Solution: Check for proper line installation (see step 9 of installation)

   Problem: Warble Tone

   Probable Cause: Phone needs to be initialized
   Solution: Initialize phone (see initialization procedure)

   Solution: Replace clock chip

   Problem: Will not detect coins

   Probable Cause: Trigger switch contacts are bent too far apart or are
                   dirty.
   Solution: Make sure all T/S contacts are clean & make
             contact when coin falls through each slot.

   Probable Cause: Coin acceptor rejecting coins
   Solution: Clean inside of coin acceptor with damp, soapy rag.

   Problem Constant Beeping / Relay fires 3 times in a row:

   Probable Cause: Stuck coin in trigger switch.
   Solution: Remove coin acceptor & trigger switch to find &
             remove stuck coins.

   Probable Cause: Bent contact E on relay
   Solution: Remove relay by unscrewing left & right thumb screws & top
             middle screw. Locate contact E & carefully straighten by
             using a pair of needle nose pliers.
 
   Probable Cause: Coin hopper door stuck open
   Solution: Remove relay by unscrewing left & right thumb screws & top
             middle screw. Make sure both hopper levers are in up position.

   Problem: Will not accept coins

              The Primary InterLATA Carrier (PIC) Code Guide


Date: Thursday August 10, 2000
By: The Clone
	

Introduction:

Every single long distance carrier has a unique identificatication number
known as a 10-XXX number (10 followed by the particular network's 3 digit 
access code).


Q: "FIRST, JUST WHAT IS "10XXX" DIALING AND NOW 10-10-XXX DIALING?"
   "Wait, wait, wait a minute! Just what is a PIC code?" 

A: A PIC code is acronym for Primary IntraLata Carrier (PIC) Code. 


Okay, that's better, now on with the 10-10XXX discussion!

The way this works is that this code accompanies each number you dial
from a phone and is then routed by the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC -
i.e., your local phone company) and provides information on the carrier
as well as the number called.

Most telephones uses do not need to dial 10-10-XXX for the long distance 
company that you have chosen to use, because it is programmed by the LEC 
to automatically attach itself to the number being called.

For example, if your carrier is Sprint, their code is 10-10333, and you
dial 760-944-6200, the 10-10333 will tell the call to route over the
Sprint network and provide an identification for the LEC to bill the
appropriate carrier. 

Again, you don't have to dial the 10-10333 PIC code as this is automatically
done for you by the LEC. If you are a Sprint customer and want to place a 
call over, say MCI, you would now have to dial 10-10222 1-760 944-6200 
(Notice: you dial the 1 before the area code, even in your call is going to
the same area code), to force the call off of the Sprint network and onto 
the MCI network. 

(The same holds true for AT&T or WorldCom, 
or the other major 10-10-XXX carriers.)

  " NOW WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO USE A DIFFERENT PIC CODE, 
  EXCEPT FOR THE ONE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR LONG DISTANCE CARRIER? "

(Ever hear of Least Cost Routing (LCR)?) You can have multiple carriers 
approved for an individual line(s) and by knowing the rates associated 
with each, you can have your phone system dial the PIC code that has the 
least expensive rate. 

By the way, if you have a dialer, a PBX with LCR or even if you dial-around
your carrier, you will start having to have 7 digits, instead of 5. 
And should of been completed prior to June 30, 1998, because as of July 1, 1998
your 5 digit PIC or CIC code will not work.

"WELL, WHAT WERE ONCE 5 DIGIT PIC CODES, NOW ARE 7 DIGIT PIC CODES. GOTCHA!"

The FCC was pretty innovative about how they handled the PIC CODE problem; 
they simply put another 10 in front of the existing 10XXX PIC code, 
so a company like ATX Telecommunications Services which was once 10-004 is
now 10-10-004.

   The nomenclature is diverse but it can be simply be referred to as:
10-10 ###, pronounced "ten triple 'ecks". Anywho, here we are with the
updated list of carriers with their new PIC codes. Now folks, I believe
this list to be somewhat accurate, but please note that I do reserve the
right to make an error or two. If in doubt, call the destined carrier
                and ask what their PIC or CIC code is.

 Now on with the list! :)

Conclusion:

Well there you have it!

I hope this document has helped you understand the basic fundamentals
of the Primary InterLATA Carrier code system, as well I hope that the
PIC compilation has saved you some time by making available the codes
you may have been inquiring about. 

If you have some 10-10-XXX carrier codes to share, feel free to shoot me
an e-mail and I'll be more than glad to add them.
