	Stupid E-mail Part: II is a follow up from the
'Do You need good sex? Matt Ward has the answer' that was on
K-1ine issue number one. If you haven't already figured it out,
I only make these pointless articles to get my mind away from 
the pressures of my other projects. Here it is, the stupid e-mail...

- Hmm... what does this look like to you people? Was oml@d2dse.d2d.com.tw
trying to communicate with me? Or was he trying to encode in some strange
language? Spam is my only assumption. 

Look at the e-mail address... '.tw'. Where the hell is this?
I couldn't seem to find out. I viewed the headers and it showed the 
mysterious '.tw'. Odd to say the least.  
If anyone has some idea to where in the world this may have came from, 
please e-mail me at: theclone@code.penguinpowered.com

	It looks like the end is here once again. Depressing isn't it?
At any rate, I was quite pleased with the positive feedback I received
with K-1ine issue one. I only hope I get the same kind of response with
this issue. 

Wow, It's only the middle of summer and already I've done so much.
One of the major highlights of Summer '99 would have to be going to
DEFCON 7.0 and meeting some really great people. I wish I would have
finished my DEFCON file by now so I could put it in this issue of K-1ine.
Unfortunately due to lack of time that won't be happening. 

By August the Hack Canada crew and I should have our DEFCON files
completed, compiled into one, and posted on the Hack Canada web-site
(www.hackcanada.com).

Now then, what should you look for in the next issue of K-1ine if I ever
get around to it (which may be never if you take a look at my schedual)...


[UPCOMING STUFF]

* More Grande Cache files/skans  - Everyone asks me "Why do you write so
				   much about Grande Cache?" Why not?
				   It's small, it's vulnerable... and
				   dammit I have fun writing crap about it.
				
* Skans - Ahh yes wonderful wonderful skanning. Such a pain in the ass.
	  So fucking boring. What do I get out of it? Sore fingers and
	  a boring life. Besides that I find inspiration from it. 
	  There are systems out there that no one but the people who 
	  maintain it have ever played with or even heard of before.
	  If I can exploit them or even just mess around on them, they
	  make way for excitment and another file to write about.

* ASCII ART - I know I know, you ASCII art people are probably all wondering
	      to yourself "Why oh why is there no art on your zine?"
	      Simple; I just can't seem to find any ASCII ARTISTS.
	      You want to do art for my next zine? You want to help
	      poor 'ol Clonie out? 
 		E-mail me: theclone@code.penguinpowered.com

* MISC - Gosh golly, I do need more misc shit don't I? Hmm... I'll keep
	 that in mind for K-1ine III.


		
		MY FANS MUST BE WONDERING TO THEMSELVES:
			"When is your next issue coming out?"

		THE ANSWER: "Whenever I damn well feel like releasing one!"


	On with the shouts....


There are people I would like to give personal shoutouts to because
dammit you're cool.


				Firstly to:		
		My crew @ Hack Canada - www.hackcanada.com
		"j0j0j0 my homeboys from 780. I'm down wit j00 j0!"
	        
			The HC cr3w consists of: 
		CYB0RG/ASM, The Question, Wizbone, Hex_Edit, Wildman, 
			Renderman, and I (The Clone).    


		Everyone else;
	
Mark: A telecommunications guy.
Phil: [same as above]

Lord Narayana (poz.8m.com): a phone guy.

Pinguino: (www.penguinpalace.com): Pingi!!!@!! Cool dud3tt3 I've
	  known for quite some time now. Check her page... it rules.

Rhino9 Security Team: These guys are one of the most incredible computer
 		      security professionals I've ever known about.
		      Hex_Edit of Hack Canada has some connections to them.
		      Unfortunately they no longer exist. The team broke up.
		      Too bad. ;(

Dr.Mudge (www.l0pht.com): It was an honor to meet you at DEFCON 7.0.
			  I had a nice conversation with you. Good to
			  know that the L0pht and Hack Canada crew are
			  becoming a tighter unit.

Space Rogue (www.hackernews.com), 
	       (www.l0pht.com):   Too bad I didn't get a chance to
				  speak with you at DEFCON this year.
				  Renderman did get a nice shot of you
		 				though. 	
			(see: http://nettwerk.hypermart.net/defconpics)
				   
				  

	Well this is it. Hope you enjoyed the second issue
		 	  of K-1ine. 
		      	
		I will now leave you with a message:

"Don't be such file whores. Try to read and understand the work involved 
in computer security and H/P web-sites. I don't mean lame ones
with stolen information or media whore sites (see: http://hack-net.com). 
Put something back into the hacker community. Create something. 
Research a topic, learn about it, find ways of exploiting it to a 
	 	   reasonable degree, and write about it."
