-- Introduction


  The winter of 2000 is now finally among us. It's hard to believe that the
 year is almost over, it felt like just yesterday when the world was preparing
 for the Y2K crisis. This year was quite the year for myself and my colleagues
 as a lot happened that I would like to quickly go over. In the beginning of
 the year, several of us from the January 2600 meeting were involved in the
 "STOP THE MPAA" leafletting campaign which in my humble opinion was a complete
 success (read our story at: http://www.2600.net/news/2000/0207.html).

 In the months following, I received an emmense amount of e-mail from visitors
 of my web-site who all asked the same question "what happened to K-1ine and
 when are you coming out with more issues?" The original reason why I stopped
 writing the issues that I started in the spring of 1999 was because I wasn't
 receiving enough feedback and contributions so I felt like, in a sense, I was
 wasting my time.
 
 By April, the e-mail had been building up and the demand for K-1ine was beyond
 anything I had ever expected so I decided to do the right thing and release 
 the third issue. From then on the 15th day of the month, every month, I was
 to release a new issue of K-1ine. Now I'm in my 10th issue, and I can't tell
 you how happy I am with all the people who have contributed articles, codes,
 and poetry to me to place in the e-zine issues. It really is a joy to see 
 that people really do care about the underground h/p scene... which brings
 me to my next subject; CPU.

 After attending my second Def Con convention this summer in Las Vegas (which
 by the way was incredible! Pics available: http://www.hackcanada.com/cons/)
 the inspiration I got from the wonderful people I spoke (shouts to: Stevyn,
 The Prophet) with persuaded a force inside of me to do more for phreaking
 scene than I already have been doing (yeah a lot). So around mid-September,
 the Canadian Phreakers Union was founded by BenCode and myself.
 
 The Canadian Phreakers Union is a loose-knit organization dedicated to unify-
 ing the Canadian phreaking scene in Canada. The reason we started CPU is 
 because we felt that the people involved in phone phreaking throughout 
 Canada are just too scattered out and no one seemed to want to do anything
 about it. We all meet up on IRC on the server irc.at0mix.net in the locked
 channel #cpu and discuss everything and anything that involves phones and
 telecommunications technology, have voice-conferences, and just have fun!
 Since September, CPU has grown substantially... we have group projects going
 on (www.nettwerked.net/TFA/projects.html) as well as semi-private projects
 such as 'OpenTelco' and G.U.T.S.C.I (Global Underground Technology Secure  
 Communication Infrastructure). 

 What is coming up in the New Year of 2001?

 			
			  [ H C - T V ]
	   
 Tune out the mass-media propaganda of television programming, and tune into
 the 100% webcast net-show; HC-TV. HC-TV is Hack Canada's very first 
 international coast-to-coast premier. We will focus on h/p, culture, politics,
 humour sketches, and all the stuff that mainstream news outlets won't show
 you. We are the new MEDIA players in da house and we DO plan to take over 
    your conscious, subconscious and unconscious minds, so be prepared!

		 "Xandor Speaks: MIND KONTROL ULTRA"	


Date: 11.29.00

[Featured on end page: 'Mondo 2000' Issue 11, (c)1993]



DEAR DEHUMANIZED DIGITAL DILETTANTES:

 Hello, hello, are we asleep again? Are we nodding off at the wheel
 as we trundle down the data superhighway? As CompuServe hails a 
 "New World Order" of "altered ideologies" and ecofascist Al Gore unveils
 his Trojan Horse data superhighway designed to trap millions of cognitive
 dissidents into revealing their interests and knowledge online to NSA 
 digital snoops. Don't you realize PGP really means Pretty Good Prison? 
 That deep-cover NSA datacops have been behind it all along? We live in 
 interesting times. Did you know that the mars Observer was shut down when
 it sent back pictures of pyramids and cities? Or that Comet Shoemaker-Levy
 9, scheduled to impact Jupiter on July 22, 1994 is really the ultimate 
 doomsday "Alternative 3" scenario of the New World Order? And if that
 doesn't fry your synapses how about the Office of Naval Intelligence and
 the DIA's massive cover ELF weather-and mind-control war amongst Russia,
 Japan, France, and Israel, creating massive floods, earthquakes, cancer, 
 AIDS, and other plagues in the process?

  Remember, when you wake up agitated at 3:00 in the morning, that's when
 they're running ELF transmitters to program your dreams. It's also the time
 when most UFOs appear - quelle coincidence! Let me explain: They send out
 subliminal signals over all radio and TV channels and use microwave antennas
 to beam instructions via ELF modulation into your heads to reinforce hypnotic
 screen memories of alien doctors in spaceships, when they're actually Franken-
 steinian Nazi scientists running bizarre eugenics experiments in underground
 tunnels created by massive subterreaning machines which are the cause of the 
 slowly moving hum you hear underground in Taos and other parts of the South-
 west.

  But you don't have to have an intranasal brain implant to be under their
 control. Hemisync tone sequences, subliminal instructions, reverse-speech
 hidden messages, magnetic signals, infrasonics, ultrasonics (like Hitler) 
 are all part of the total panoply. And throw away your Synchro-Energizer: 
 the CIA programs mind-machine circuitry to create zombie automatons. In-
 fact, the entire candybrain New Age movement, invented by LSD-monger Willis
 Harman under directions from the British Tavistock Institute in London, is a
 massive MI6-controlled deception operation designed to hypnotize millions
 and convert them into slaves to the New World Order. Gurus are operatives 
 duped by hypnosis and taught occult magic tricks by the Illuminati who 
 formed the Thule Society which programmed Hitler and the Nazi Star Wars 
 Dr.Stranglelove Wernher von Braun and psychofascist Werner Erhard and Oscar
 Ichazo. Incidentally, Oscar's daddy was Brazil's war minister and Oscar used 
 Arica mind-control techniques to convert Esalen into a New World Order 
 training camp, working with Willis Harman of the notorious Stanford Research
 Institute (which runs the Internet). Chief propagandist for the Aquarian 
 Conspiracy, he proclaimed in Global Mind Change that "the only way for the 
 U.S. to regain moral leadership" was to focus on the Illuminati-designed 
 Great Seal (on all U.S. paper money). By these signs shall ye know them: 
 the Orb and Compass, the Eye and Pyramid.

 Have you figured it out yet? OK, let me spell it out for all you pathetic 
 autists: They know exactly which ELF frequencies, waveforms, and code 
 sequences (brainwave-frequency region pulse-code modulation superimposed 
 widely on power lines, radio, TV, and microwave transmissions) to use and 
 can create any emotion or pathology they please. You don't. And you probably
 down own a real ELF detector! You poor bleating sheep don't even know they're
 ALREADY using ELF generators in malls, restaurants, and bars to maximize 
 throughput and revenues - even magnetizing fans in air conditioners and 
 refrigerators to create pulsed ELF waves to zap you. It will all be duly 
 captured by Hillary's SmartCard which will store your brainwaves and monitor
 all transactions everywhere you go, so the Thought Police can download it any
 old time via the data superhighway and issue the ultimate ACCESS DENIED. 
 By the way, you can't escape ELF - there's no way to shield low-frequency 
 magnetic waves - but I'll reveal secret techniques for defending yourself 
 in the next MONDO... unless they get to me first.

A model of the brain in eight circuits

according to Robert Anton Wilson and Timothy Leary

THE EIGHT CIRCUITS:

  1.  Bio-Survival
  2.  Enotional-Territorial
  3.  Laryngeal-Manual
  4.  Socio-Sexual
  5.  Neurosomatic
  6.  Neuro-Electric
  7.  Neurogenetic
  8.  Neuro-Atomic

BIO-SURVIVAL

(Autonomic) (physical Intelligence)

      Level of Reality: Invertebrate
      Drug Trigger: Opiates
      Function: Mother-Child bonding
      Circuit #:384
      Gurdjieff Center: Movement Center
      Life form: Uni-cellular
      Dimension: forward-back
      Description: "baby-brain"; fight-or-flight
      [Instincts:] Passivity, safety, nourishment
      Medium: the organism (Bios)

     Some humans never become aware of any level of reality beyond
     this one. There is no reason to call them human.

EMOTIONAL-TERRITORIAL

(Power) (emotional intelligence)

      Level of Reality: mammalian
      Drug Trigger: alcohol
      Function: fighting, politics, pack-forming
      Circuit#:192
      Gurdjieff Center: False Emotional
      Life form: vertebrates
      Dimension: right-left
      Description: "toddler brain"; rule-or-be-ruled
      [Bias:] self-expression, status, power
      Medium: belief systems (memes)

     Some humans (ideologues and fanatics) see this as the supreme
     level of reality. It is the most attained by most politicians and
     military leaders.

LARYNGEAL-MANUAL

(Semantic, Dextero-Symbolic) (conceptual intelligence)

      Level of Reality: paleolithic
      Drug Trigger: cocaine
      Function: learning, skill, creativity
      Circuit#: 96
      Gurdjieff Center: False Intellectual
      Life Form: hominids
      Dimension: up-down
      Description: "ego status"; tool-making, problem-solving
      [Worldview:] paying attention, mapmaking, naming, articulation
      Medium: conceptual frameworks (paradigms, metamemes)

     This is the level of reality at which most academics and
     intellectuals operate. Reality consists of nails; we must find
     the right hammers.

SOCIO-SEXUAL

(Domestic) (social intelligence)

      Level of Reality: civilized
      Drug Trigger: norepinephrine
      Function: hive-unity, society, parenting
      Circuit#: 48
      Gudjieff Center: False Personality
      Life Form: Humankind
      Dimension: past-future
      Description: "social self"; transmission of culture
      [Ethos:] adolescence/individuation; adulthood/maturation;
     collectivization/socialization
      Medium: code of ethics (ethos)

     Attained eight thousand years ago, this level of reality
     ("culture") may be the one at which humanity is stuck, unaware
     anything lies beyond...

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Here lies the CHAPEL PERILOUS. Beyond here you may have to SMI2LE.
Because if you do not escape the gravity well of the planet, use your HEAD,
and extend your life, you may not be able to activate the higher four
circuits.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


NEUROSOMATIC

(Hedonic) (Sensory intelligence)

      Level of Reality: hedonic
      Drug Trigger: marijuana
      Function: hedonic engineering: Tantra, Yoga, etc.
      Circuit#: 24
      Gurdjieff Center: Magnetic center
      Life Form: Free-fall (cosmic migration)
      Dimension: Linear-cyclic
      Description: "free floating"; the turn-on
      [Pleasures:] Rapture, ritual, charisma
      Medium: the five senses

     Aesthetes, epicureans, space travellers, and libertines discover
     the awakened possibilites of the higher circuits - but then often
     forget that such pleasures are a means, and not an end.

NEURO-ELECTRIC

(Metaprogramming, Psychotronic) (Psychic Intelligence)

      Level of Reality: Psionic
      Drug Trigger: peyote
      Function: neurologic: precognition, ESP
      Circuit#: 12
      Gurdjieff Center: True Emotional
      Life Form: I squared (intelligence exponentiated)
      Dimension: here-there
      Description: "metaprogramming"; awareness of possibilities
      [Perspectives:] clairvoyance, reality selection, precognition
      Medium: CNS (central nervous system)

     People attaining this level of reality may become aware of the
     contingency of their particular reality-tunnels; but may not see
     the way OUT. Knowing that reality is a Glass Bead Game, they may
     lose their vision in the sparkle of the beads.

NEUROGENETIC

(Evolutionary) (Mythic intelligence)

      Level of Reality: Immortal
      Drug Trigger: LSD
      Function: DNA awareness, ecological symbiosis
      Circuit#: 6
      Gurdjieff Center: True Intellectual
      Life Form: Immortality
      Dimension: life-death
      Description: "collective unconscious"; species-memory
      [Collective unconscious:] synchronicity, alchemy, astrology
      Medium: DNA & Gaia (the Planet)

     At this level, one becomes aware of Intelligences besides their
     own. Such Intelligences may be Higher or Lower; but they are
     certain to be Alien. Synchronicity begins to overcome the Law of
     Accident. Planetary noosphere becomes visible.

NEURO-ATOMIC

(Metaphysiological) (Spiritual intelligence)

      Level of Reality: Cosmic
      Drug Trigger: Katamine
      Function: cosmic engineering
      Circuit#: 3
      Gurdjieff Center: The Essence
      Life Form: Cosmic union
      Dimension: microcosm-macrocosm
      Description: "extraterrestrial unconscious"; cosmic mind
      [Being:] Paradox, dreaming, factor 'X'
      Medium: subatomic mysteries (quantum reality)

     This is the level of the Bodhisattva and the Taoist Immortal, and
     of it, only they can speak.

It is said by Antero Alli that this system provides the basis for Angel
Tech. The left hemisphere is tech and the right hemisphere is the Holy
Guardian Angel. Under such a system, each circuit is also a grade, and the
goal of each student is to have Absorbed, Organized, and Communicated each
grade. This is why Schools exist.

        This tiny room with a feeling of dark and lost and a tiny light
lighting and a tiny computer humming and i just want to be back beneath
the covers and of course i want everything right now, and i can see that
the oxygen masks aren't working, it's like a placebo... you only think
you're breathing you only need to think you're breathing. you don't need
to breathe to live. you don't need to live to breathe.
        slow down, slow down

        I don't want to be figuring out nested brackets, I don't want
these interpolations to deal with and I can see how your car door isn'
really closed and i can see the waves building up behind you, they don't
come from anywhere = they just wash over you and they try to take you
back, back to nowhere.

        slow down, back to nowhere
        I don't want it here, in me i want it there in me
        in me

        I can't spark, but i'm sparking the same way as this machine
        i just like telling stories
        that's the only difference
        the machine can't tell stories of it's own
        but the machine knows me better than I know myself

        I can lie, but I try not to,
        I can add but I stay away from math

        Numbers just wash over you, take you back to nowhere.

Keywords: ESN, MIN, Cellular, PCS, Telus, Clearnet, flaw, exploit, hijack, DoS, fraud, security

Synopsis: A flaw in the ESN/MIN tracking creates opportunities for hijacking
	and denial of service attacks.

Overview: Since Time Immemorial, customers of telcos have made determined
	efforts to improve their cost-to-service ratio, through means such as
	switching carriers, upgrading equipment, and possibly attacking the
	network itself. To protect their "commitment to shareholder value",
	(translation: too cheap to give you vaseline before the shafting) the
	telcos have implemented various security systems to prevent or at least
	minimize the effects of toll fraud.

	Cellular systems are prime targets for fraudulent use, since a given
	Mobile Terminal can be quite difficult to locate once deployed, and
	when used to commit fraud, the guilty party can be very difficult to
	locate. Since cellular and PCS/GSM MTs necessarily broadcast their
	credentials, a window of opportunity is created. It is my cynical guess
	that about 15 minutes after the first cell phone was demonstrated, the
	first ESN/MIN snarfer was designed, and 15 minutes after the first cell
	phone was purchased, the first cloned cell phones were available. With
	the current price of airtime, there's not much of a reason to doubt the
	lack of incentive to send your cell bill to someone else every month.
	Of course, Ma Bell hates it when we say "Suck it down, bitch!" so she's
	cleverly come up with ways to suck on her own terms.

	Being Ma Bell though, she's a history of making mistakes, and we have
	no reason that today's the day she gets a clue. Today's problem lies
	with the notion that a system that will "fail safe" ... well, will, at
	some point, fail. And anything that can fail, can at least become some
	kind of denial of service attack. The interesting part about this attack
	is the fact that it's a remote attack and that there are possibilities
	for unauthorized intercepts, even on supposedly secure digital networks.

	"A remote denial of service and a remote intercept," you say? "Gosh, I'd
	hate for that to happen to me." Yes, this isn't a nice thing to do. You
	probably don't want to reproduce this attack at all, nevermind while out
	in front of the local telco's building, lest they become sufficiently
	peeved and get the notion of shoving your phone up your ass, sideways.

Reference: We shall consider this attack from two perspectives: what the MSSC
	thinks, and also from the perspective of an IP/MAC conflict.

	In order to prevent fraudulent use, the MSSC (Mobile Services Switching
	Center) keeps a record (as entered by the operator) of what MIN is
	assigned to a given ESN and in what cell a given mobile terminal is
	found. This is also necessary to allow features such as automatic call
	delivery (the fact that your phone rings when you call it). Obviously
	this database is a prime target for all sorts of attacks, and the
	designers of cellular telephony infrastructure, as well as the carriers
	who deploy it have chosen a failsafe model of operation. Granted, "safe"
	is is define by the implementors of a system, and as such failsafe may
	not be operational at all, but rather a known-stable configuration under
	adverse circumstances.

	Contrast this behaviour with the more permissive actions of ARP and IP
	whereby most IP stacks will accept hostile ARP broadcasts. When a phone
	powers up and registers its presence on the network, part of that login
	sequence is the MIN (known as MSISDN to GSM fans). This is similar to an
	xterm making a bootp request to get its IP address based on its hardware
	address. After the bootp exchange, most of the hosts on the network now
	have a valid mapping between IP and MAC address. If another host claims
	to have the same IP address, many IP stacks will issue a warning about
	an address conflict ("ARP info for A.B.D.C overwritten by c:0:f:f:e:e")
	but will continue to accept packets from these conflicting hosts. This
	allows both hosts to continue communicating, albeit incredibly slowly.

	Cellular switching systems respond to this threat by delivering paging
	information to only one terminal at a time. It seems that the only time
	the switch system will accept a new ESN/MIN pair is when a handset
	enters a service area. It also seems that switch systems do not like it
	when a given ESN changes its MIN on the fly without direction from an
	operator's console (read: this sets off loud alarms and you should get
	ready to run from the hounds of hell.) It seems a reasonable thing to
	do, on the assumption that a Revenue Unit (shafted customer) will only
	be on one physical handset at a time. At this point the network knows
	that it is to send messages for "A.B.C.D" to ESN c:0:f:f:e:e, and it
	obligingly does so. Once a page gets sent to the attacking handset, it
	might need to reply. It is this reply that will actually trigger the
	DoS, since this is what notifies the switch that the address has
	changed. And it is this change that causes the fraud detection code to
	trigger and disable outgoing calls from the attacking handset. This does
	nothing for the victim who is now unable to receive calls since his MIN
	is now registerered to someone else's ESN.

Exploit: There are two ways to make this attack work. One takes a little bit of
	big-blue-room detective work, the other takes some luck. The end result
	is the same though; the victim's phone does not receive any incoming
	calls, SMS notices or system broadcasts, even though it is able to make
	calls. As an added bonus, there's a better than even chance that this
	particular attack session will cause the victim's messages to be sent to
	the attacker's handset. This can add quite a bit of confusion for the
	victim who "knows" everything is OK because he can make calls. He finds
	it odd though that he hasn't got a single text message or phone call or
	voicemail alert for days. And no telco I know of makes any guarantees
	about the performance of their network. Furthermore, it's not likely to
	be a really huge issue meaning that it will be a long time before an
	analyst ever gets around to checking the problem out.

	You will need, for each victim either the handset they previously had
	activated on that account, or a handset which uses the same radio
	interface (CDMA, TDMA, GSM) and has a modifiable MIN.

	1) Wait for the victim to power up his phone and log on to the network.
	It's probably a safe bet to assume that the phone is on and vulnerable.
	Why would someone have a cell phone if they weren't going to use it?

	2) Ensure that the attacking phone has the same MIN as the victim phone.
	You can do this by going trashing (to find a slip of paper with the MIN
	and ESN on it), by buying the victim's old cell phone with that MIN (not
	really wise; people will ask questions) or by programming the same MIN
	into another handset enabled on the victim's network. This is best done
	while out of coverage areas (ie. subway stations or parkades)

	3) Turn on the attacking phone, and wait for a digital signal to be
	acquired. Make sure you have a relatively strong signal - the victim and
	attacker phones will be getting into a virtual shouting match, and it is
	important that the attacking phone wins.

	4) dial *228 or *2280? (where ?=[0-9]). *228 spells '*ACT' which is, of
	course a call to activate the phone. Clearnet and Telus don't support
	this feature; trying this from a deactivated phone will get you a fast
	busy, other phones will give you a message saying that you should call
	customer service to have your phone activated.

	5) leave the phone on for as long as you want the attack to continue. I
	have seen this attack persist over eight hours, and several reboots of
	the victim phone. Once the attacker goes away, either another reboot of
	the victim phone is needed or a delay of at least $LocUpdate. $LocUpdate
	is a network parameter which controls how often a phone rebroadcasts its
	presence on the network.

	You now have a phone that is capable of intercepting messages bound for
	your victim's handset. Enjoy! Personally, I don't recommend doing this
	much if at all. It sucks when your phone goes out of service, and you
	also break a number of laws regarding telecommunications security, and
	risk stiff penalties. Consider yourself warned.

Millennium Payphone - Power Out Exploit V2.0 - By PsychoSpy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new in V2.0....

Added a section on how to turn the power out without 
cutting lines. This was one of the most common questions
people have had after I originally wrote this file.


Intro/Story....

Recently while carousing the halls at my local educational 
facility, I noticed that the LCD Displays on the phone had
gone completely blank. I couldn't believe my eyes! The
power on the phones had gone out! Can we say damn lucky?!?
I then walked up to the phone and picked it up, as I put my
ear to the slightly chilly earpeice, I heard the distinct
noise of the dial tone. You may say "Well hey! What else
do you expect to hear when you pick up the phone?!? You
forgot something you psycho! The Millennium dial tones are
all pre-recorded." Well, that's right, the dial tones ARE
pre-recorded, however, with the power out, the recorded
dial tone isn't played due to lack of power. In fact, you
can hear the physical switch inside the Millennium switch
over. This my friend is a REAL DIAL TONE!! WOOO!!

I then proceeded to try to dial a well known number 
(Clones pager). The damn payphone wouldn't let me though.
It turns out that when the power goes out, the payphone
initializes a failsafe mode which dissables the dialing
of ANY numbers on the key-pad until the 1 and 8 have been
pressed first. This is meant to make it so that you cannot
dial any numbers other than 800, which you could do when
the power was on anyways.

Onto the exploits....

First what you have to do is either cut the power to the 
Millennium, or find one with the power out. The first option
is the most likely of the two. It was out of pure luck that
I found the payphones with the power out. Just be VERY VERY
careful when snipping the power. Make sure you've got rubber
gloves, the wire cutters have rubber handles etc. If you fry
yourself because of this, IT'S YOUR OWN DAMN FAULT!! DON'T
COME CRYING TO ME!!


Now for the real exploit stuff....

The numbers are only dissabled on the physical key-pad. This 
means that we can pull out our trusty tone dialer, and dial 
away any number we please. I actually didn't have a tone 
dialer with me, so I used a mini-audio recorder. To use the 
audio recorder, you just dial 18 and then press record, and 
dial the rest of the numbers with the mic up to the ear piece. 
Then, hang-up, and play the tones back into the phone.

NOTE: The tones must be played as fast as possible. This is
due to the dial-tone going dead in around 10 to 15 seconds.

The second exploit is based on the line seizing exploit on 
the Protel's which The Clone found awhile back. With the power
out, the Millennium no longer protects against this attack.
This means that you can dial a 800 number that will drop you 
to a dial-tone, and will be able to use it. You can also 
try phoning up the operator and pissing her off so much that
she hangs up, therefor giving you an unlimited dial-tone once
again. Once you get this dial-tone, you can dial any number
your little heart desires.


How exactly do I turn the power off without cutting lines?....

This was the most common question after originally writing
this file. I found the answer to this from Kybo_Ren and I 
would like to thank him for it.

Here's the solution for the phones on pedestals and in booths.
Walk up to the phone. See that nice little Bell sign at the 
top? The one that lights up at night? Pry that off. Behind
that there is a little breaker switch. Flip the switch and
voila, the power is out, and you can carry out this exploit.


Outro/Shouts/To Come....

Well, that's it kiddies! Have fun! This is only the FIRST of
MANY files to come in the near future on the Millennium Pay-
phones which have spread across Canada like a technological
plague. Kinda interesting new frontier of phones though. The
Telcos are actually getting somewhat smarter. Who'd of ever 
thought?!!?

Shouts out to The Clone, Cyb0rg/asm, Semtex, Kybo_Ren,
and Niteshade.

      'Millennium Desktop Payphone; A How-to Guide on Circuit Frying'


 -[Date: 12/01/00]- 
-[Handle: The Clone]- 
-[Type: Millennium Desktop Article]-

-[EMAIL: theclone@hackcanada.com]- 
-[URL: http://www.nettwerked.net]-


Introduction;

 This paper is a progressive follow-up to the recent Millennium file
('Millennium Payphone - Power Out Exploit V2.0') by my associate PsychoSpy
which exposed some major flaws in the so-called "secure payphone". The 
reason why the Millennium has been thought of as secure is because it has
been relatively successful in stopping phreakers who attempt to use older
well known payphone vulnerabilities against it. In order for phreakers to
keep steps ahead of telecom carriers they must be willing to learn the
architecture, use their creativity in a constructive manner, inspire and 
become inspired by those who posess similar interests. 

This guide is here for like-minded audiences to learn about the latest
of many Millennium "sploit's" to come. Although I don't consider this file
a true exploit guide, keeping this potentially damaging (for Nortel and LECs)
information from the public would more or less make me an STO advocate.
Information wants to be free... so as a provider of open Enterprise and 
Carrier-class telecommunications security solutions, with great honor
I present to you (more or less) my guide to frying Millennium Desktop 
Circuits.

-

What do Millennium Desktop Payphones look like?
-----------------------------------------------

The Millennium Desktop's are easy enough to spot *IF* you know what to 
look for. You'll never be confused between a 'Universal', 'Card Phone', and
'Desktop' again if you look for these distinguishing physical traits:

* Desktop's look similar to the Nortel Vista 3000 phone (used for small
  business and residential land-line customers)

* Desktop's have an RJ-11 data jack on the side of it so that users can
  plug their laptop's into it.


Where are Millennium Desktop Payphones present?
-----------------------------------------------

* Airports 
* Hotel Lobbies
* Convention Centers 

and other locations where business travelers require access to a device
with an RJ-11 data jack, which is a powerful option that lets them
connect their laptop computer and access network services
(such as electronic mail, the Internet, or information services.)

Tools needed to exert angst on NorHell Desktops
-----------------------------------------------

* 1 Screwdriver - every phreakers tool for surgical procedures

* 1 Camera - for taking pictures of the random acts of 'fone-terrorism'
             that you can show your girlfriend, boyfriend, children, 
             or defense lawyer.

* A desire to commit a criminal act


The Procedure, Step-By-Step
---------------------------

Step 1 - Find the target Millennium Desktop, and be sure to check around
         for nearby authoritative figures and security cameras.

Step 2 - Sit in front of the Millennium Desktop, and look for a little
         4cm by 7cm metal panel underneath the phone.

Step 3 - Using your screwdriver you should be able to, with ease, pop it
         off.

Step 4 - At this point you'll see the circuit board with various leads.
         Now with your screwdriver in hand, begin to touch it to the
         leads on the circuit board. Also, try touching an IC555 lead 
         to a resistor lead. 

Step 5 - If you followed Step 4 properly the circuit board should be 
         shorted out. Approximately 5-10 seconds later (if not earlier) 
         the phone will set off its internal alarm that plays at half-second
         intervals... "beedley-boop-beedley-boop". 

Step 6 - Now you can either leave the premises immediately (recommended),
         or you can be a real phone-ninja and attempt to shut the alarm up.
         To shut off the alarm what you'll have to do is look for a wire-mesh
         cord that is covering the phone line, pull it as hard as you can
         (because it's anchored to the wall), and within 5 hard tugs the cord
         will break and the alarm will shut off.

Step 7 - Leave the premises.



Closing Words
-------------
 
    Now that you've read this, I advise that you use extreme caution when 
      performing RAFT (Random Acts of Fone Terrorism). RAFT can get you 
     arrested, kicked out of school. No colleges will take you, No future! 
		Exiled from everything and everyone you love!

Norstar Companion basics -


 Your Companion portable telephone allows you toleave your
desk without missing important telephone calls. You can
carry it with you to make and receive calls on the Norstar system.
The portable telephones can access most Norstar business
features such as call forward, call transfer, conferencing, and voice 
mail. Companion on Norstar consists of four main components:

ICS and Norstar XC software - Modular ICS XC software manages the telephone
traffic between Companion Base Stations and portable telephones. Base Stations
are connected to the ICS in the sameway that Norstar sets are. Companion
portable telephones are registered on the system and do not take up any
ports on the system. Up to 60 portable telephone and up to 32 Base Stations
(32 cells) can be connected to the system.

Companion Base Stations - Base Stations are positioned throughout the coverage
area to send and receive calls between the portable telephones and the ICS.
The Base Stations use advanced digital radio technology and support handoff and
roaming within the coverage area which can be up to 160,000 square meters 
(three million square feet) when using the maximum number of Base Stations.

Companion portable telephones - The portable telephones used with Companion
are small, lightweight units with fully digital performance to provide clear
voice quality. Companion portable telephones feature a two line, 16-character,
alphanumeric display. For more information on portable used with your MICS
XC system, refer to the Companion Portable Telephone User Guide that is supplied
with it.

Administration and Maintenance Tools - Programming of the Companion system
is easily and quickly done through a M7310 or M7324 digital telephone set.
You can assign portable telephones to the system, check Base Station para-
meters, and enable and disable registration through programming.

Companion Diagnostic Software allows you to run diagnostics on the wireless
system. This can be done either locally or remotely using a personal computer (PC).


New features in Norstar Companion -

 Norstar introduces Hunt Groups capability plus two new features including two
wireless call pickup features, Directed Call Pickup and Group Pickup, and
wireless Portable Language Selection. Enhancements have been made to wireless
Call Forward No Answer and wireless Twinning.

For a complete list of other features supported on Companion portables refer
to "System programming" on page 19.


Hunt Groups

 Your Norstar system now allows you to establish Hunt Groups in your system.
Hunt Groups are a group of Norstar sets that can be called by a single direc-
tory number. The Hunt Groups feature ensures calls are easily routed to the 
appropriate people. For more information about which features are affected 
by Hunt Groups see "System programming" on page 19.

For information on how to program Hunt Groups see the Modular ICS System 
Coordinator Guide.


Wireless call pickup features -

 The wireless call pickup features allow portable handset users to use a feature
to use a feature code to answer internal or external calls which are ringing
at other sets. Two types of wireless call pickup are supported:

 Direct Call Pickup

 Directed Call Pickup allows you to answer any telephone that is ringing in your
 Norstar system by entering a feature code and specifying that set's DN. For more
 information see "Directed Call Pickup" on page 27.

 Group Pickup

 Group Pickup allows the portable user to answer a call ringing on another set
 in the same pickup group by entering a feature code. For more information see
 "Group Pickup" on page 28.


Wireless Portable Language Selection -

 This feature allows you to change the language of the prompts controlled by
 the ICS as they appear on the portable's display, including both the display
 prompts and voice prompts from voice mail.

 Norstar supports English, French and Spanish. For more information see
 "Wireless Portable Language Selection" on page 28.


Wireless Call Forward No Answer enhancement -

 This enhancement stops the Companion portable from ringing when the call has
 been forwarded to its new destination. The portable user can still answer
 the call, but it does not ring. For more information see "Wireless Call Forward
 No Answer enhancement" on page 29.


Wireless Twinning enhancement -

 Wireless twinning is improved now that up to eight Answer Keys can be assigned
 to each portable telephone. In addition, more types of calls can be received
 on the Answer Keys, depending on their programming. For more information see
 "Twinning between Companion portables and Norstar wireline telephones" on page
 20.


		PROGRAMMING -

  
  Tip - With the addition of Hunt Groups some features may be affected.
  See "Features supported by Companion for Norstar" on page 25.

  For information on how to program Hunt Groups refer to Modular ICS System
  Coordinator Guide.


For general programming intructions, please refer to the "Getting Started"
section in the Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide.

		[Useless Diagram Omitted]


                PROGRAMMING TOOLS -

A Norstar telephone

 Programming is done at an M7310 or M7324 telephone. Use the buttons on the
telephone to program a setting or to request a specific programming action.
Norstar guides you with step-by-step instructions on the telephone display
while you are programming.

The indicators ( > ) on the M7310 or M7324 telephone show which buttons can
be used at that programming step. The functions on these buttons allow you to
move through the headings and subheadings of Norstar programming.


[ Heading ] moves to a higher level in the hierarchy of headings and subheadings.

[ Show ] moves to a lower level in the hierarchy of headings and subheadings,
         or begins programming for a heading or subheading.

[ Next ] moves forward at the same level in the hierarchy of headings and
         subheadings.

[ Back ] moves backward at the same level in the hierarchy of headings and
         subheadings.

The Norstar display buttons -

 Display buttons on the M7310 and M7324 telephones perform many functions.
 One, two, or three display buttons may be available at any one time depending
 on where you are in programming. Press one of the display buttons to select
 the function that you want.

  [Useless Diagram Omitted]

Special characters on the display -

When a triangle ( > ) is at the end of a programming heading or subheading,
it means you can press [ Show ] to see settings.

When an ellipsis (...) is at the end of a heading or subheading, is means
you can press [ Show ] to see the setting for that heading.


The Norstar Programming Record -

 The Programming Record provides a convenient way to record what you have
 programmed. It also helps you to plan your programming.

 You may photocopy pages from the record as necessary for programming many
 telephones or lines.

Exiting programming -

 Norstar stores your changes automatically as soon as you alter any settings;
 you do not need to "save" your changes.

 Press [ Rls ]. The display briefly reads 'End of session'.


The update display -

 If any of the changes you have made to programming have not immediately
taken effect, you see an UPDATE display button when you leave programming.
The display shows you how many telephones have no been currently updated due
to the system being busy with other programming or the telephone is in use.

 Press DNs to see the specific sets where programming changes have no been
updated. Items disappear from the list as they are updated, and UPDATE
disappears once all changes are complete.


Entering numbers -

 Enter numbers from the Norstar telephone dial pad. The backspace display
button may be used to edit the number.

A line number must always be entered as a three-digit number. Line numbers
from 10 to 99 must be entered with a leading zero (line 020, or example).
Similarly, line numbers less than 10 must be entered with two leading zeros
(line 002, for example).

Internal telephone numbers, also reffered to as directory numbers (DNs),
can be three to seven digits long. The DN length can be changed in programming.

Programming headings

 Programming specific to Norstar Companion System Coordinators is covered
 in this guide. Refer to Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide for all other
 System Coordinator programming.

 After pressing [ Feature ] * * C O N F I G and entering the password (the
 default password is A D M I N or 2 3 6 4 6), you see the following programming
 headings.


 Terminal&Sets  Terminals and sets - Customize the many features used by
                telephones. You can change where a call is forwarded, give
                a telephone a name, or allow certain features to be used
                at a telephone. You can also change the button programming
                on any telephone on the system.

 Lines          Lines - Program names for each line.

 Services       Services - Turn services on or off. Services include Ringing
                service (often called night service) that allows additional
                telephones to ring, Restriction service that blocks certain
                kinds of calls and Routing Service that decides what lines a
                call uses.

Sys speed dial  System speed dial - Program up to 70 different telephone
		numbers so that people in your office can dial them with a
                two-digit code.

Passwords	Passwords - Change the password you use for programming, or
   		erase a Call log password. On a XC system, you can also change
		the password for Companion portable telephone registration.

Time&Date	Time and date - Change the time, date, or both.

System PrGrming System programming - On a XC system, you can
		enable or disable registration for Companion
		portable telephones.



Registration Password -


 The portable telephones must be registered with the Norstar 
 system before they can be used. The recommended steps are as follows:

 1. Change the registration password for your system.
 2. Enable registration for the system.
 3. Confirm the availability of directory numbers (DNs) for each Companion
    portable telephone.
 4. Individually register each Companion portable telephone.
 5. Disable registration for the system.

 
Changing the Registration password -

 To ensure unauthorized portables are not registered to your system,
 a separate level of password access is provided. You can, and should,
 set your own password to prevent unauthorized handsets from registering
 on your system. You can change the Registration password under the Passwords
 heading in programming.

_____________________________________________________________________

WARNING: Change password to avoid incorrect registration.

To ensure accurate registration, change the Registration
password before registering any portables. If there is another
wireless system in radio range, and both systems have the same
Registration password and registration enabled, you may accidentally
      register on the other system instead of your own.
______________________________________________________________________
 
   The default Registration password is RADIO
   ( 7 2 3 4 6 ).

   Use CHANGE, the dial pad and OK to program the Registration password.

   Record the password in the Programming Record.

   Tip - You can choose any combination of one to six digits. It is easier
   to remember the password if the digits spell a word. Provide this password
   only to selected personnel to prevent unauthorized access to programming.
   The implications of such access may include the rearrangement of line
   assignments, which could affect the operation of the Norstar system.


Companion programming -
 
 Perform Companion programming in System programming.


 Registration

_________________________________________________________________________

WARNING - 

Software Keys are required to activate wireless capabilities (U.S. only)

 To take advantage of the wireless capabilities available to your Norstar
 sytem, you must first enable a certain number of portable credits using
 Software Keys purchased through Northern Telecom. Keys are obtained and
 entered into the system by the installer. For more detailed information
 on enabling Norstar Companion, see the Norstar-Companion MICS-XC Installer
 Guide.
_________________________________________________________________________


You must enable registration for the entire Norstar system to allow regist-
ation of individual portables. The options are Yes (Y) and No (N). Yes
indicates that Registration is enabled. No is the default and indicates
that Registration is not enabled.

Use [ Show ] and CHANGE to enable or disable registration.


____________________________________________________________________

WARNING -

Registration should normally be disabled.

 For security reasons, and to prevent unauthorized users from being
 registered to your system, set registration to N when you have
 finished registering the portables.
____________________________________________________________________


Portable DNs

 Once registration is enabled for your Norstar Companion system, a series
 of extension numbers (637 to 696) automatically becomes available for
 registration. Check that an extension number is available before register-
 ing a portable telephone to it.

 If the extension number shows a status of Available, it is ready for regis-
 tering a Companion portable telephone.

 If the extension number shows a status of Registered, a Companion portable
 telephone is already registered to that extension number. In this case, you
 can either pick a different extension number, or deregister the current port-
 able telephone. You must perform deregistration both at the portable and dur-
 ing either an Installer or System Coordinator programming session.

 Press [ Show ] to view registered and available DNs.


Note: The DN range 637 to 696 can be used by either portable telephones or
IDSN S loops. You can assign all 60 of the DNs to S loops and non to portable
telephones. You can assign up to 30 DNs to portable telephones, leaving 30 for
S loops. Within these two limits you can choose a combination of ISDN and
portable telephone DNs. For more information, refer to Modular ICS Installer 
Guide.


Deregistering a portable -

Deregister an extension number when:

* you must replace the portable due to loss or breakage

* you want to assign the handset to someone with a different
  telephone number than the previous user.

Press [ Show ] and DEREG to deregister a DN.



  Tip - This procedure does not clear the registration data in the
        portable. You must also deregister from the portable telephone
        ("on-the-air" deregistration). For intructions, see the Portable
        Telephone Registration Instructions that is supplied with the
        portable.



Radio data -


 Re-evaluation -

 Re-evaluation automatically assigns Base Station radios to cells and
 determines which cells are neighbors. When adding or removing Base
 Stations, Re-evaluation must be applied to the system.


 Re-evaluation Status -

 Press [ Show ] to see the Re-evaluation status. If the display reads
 required, you can carry out the re-evaluation by pressing CONTINUE and
 following the prompts.


 Radios -

 Radio programming settings apply to Base Stations.

 
 Cell assignment -

 A cell is the area covered by one or more radios in close proximity.
 As you move around your office while on a call with your portable,
 the call is handed off from one cell to another. A call on a portable
 can be handed off from one cell to another only if those cells are
 programmed as neighbors. The Norstar system automatically assigns cell
 neighbors and re-evaluates the cell-to-cell configuration when Base
 Stations are added or removed.

 The cell assignment setting allows you to see if a Base Station radio
 is assigned to a cell in the Companion system.

 Press [ Show ] and enter the 5-digit radio number to see the setting:
 Assigned or Unassigned or select LIST to see all radios in sequence.

 Cells -

 Cell programming allows you to examine the cell radio, cell neighbor,
 and cell radio neighbor configurations. Choose the cell you want to
 examine by pressing [ Show ] and the cell number (01 to 32) or select
 LIST to see all in sequence. When in the list mode, there is a softkey
 that allows you to FIND a specific cell number. Then select [ Show ] to
 see all Cell radios, Cell neighbors and Cell radio neighbors.

 Cell radios -

 This subheading allows you to view the 5-digit number of any radios assi-
 gned to this cell. For example, if radio 07012 asgned. Press [ Show ] and
 enter the 5-digit radio number to view the setting:

 Assigned or Unassigned. Select LIST to see all in sequence. Select SCAN to
 go to the list or next radio with a setting "Assigned".


 Cell nghbrs -

 This subheading allows you to view the 2-digit number of any cells that
 border a particular cell in a system. Press [ Show ] and enter the cell
 number to see the settings: Assigned or Unassigned. Select LIST to see
 each neighbor in sequence. Select SCAN to see the first/next cell "Assi-
 gned."

 For example cell 01, the display shows Nghbr:03 and Nghbr:04. This means
 that cells 03 and 04 have been assigned as cell neighbors.


 Cell rad nghbrs -

 This subheading allows you to view the 2-digit number of any cells that
 border a particular cell in a system (the cell neighbors) plus any cells
 that border the cell neighbors. Press [ Show ] and enter the cell number
 to see the settings: Assigned or Unassigned. Select LIST to see each neig-
 bor in sequence. Select SCAN to see the first/next cell "Assigned".

 For example cell 01, the display shows Rad nghbr:03, Rad nghbr:04, and
 Rad nghbr:11. Cell 11 does not appear as a cell neighbor (see the example
 under Cell nghbr), therefore it must be a neighbor of a cell 03 or 04.


 Registering individual portables -

 You must do two things to register each portable with the Norstar system:

 * Register the portables by entering the Registration password on each one.
 
 * Verify that the portable operates properly.

 For instructions on registering and verifying each Norstar Companion port-
 able with the Norstar-PLUS Modular ICS system, refer to MICS-XC Norstar-
 Companion Installer Guide.

 For instructions on operating a Norstar Companion portable, see the Compan-
 ion Portable Telephone User Guide that is supplied with the portable.

 When you distribute the portables, tell the users that the portables are
 registered and give them the corresponding extension numbers.

 
 Tip - You can register a portable to more than one system. You cannot regi-
 ster a portable to more than one extension number per system. You cannot
 register more than one portable to one extension number.

 If a portable telephone is to be used in more than one Norstar or Companion
 system, its owner must know which registration slot number was used to reg-
 ister the portable telephone with each system. (It is preferable that each
 user have the system they used most often registered in slot 1.)

 If a portable telephone is lost or broken, deregister it from the system
 before replacing it with another portable telephone.


 System programming -


  Once the registration process is complete, portable telephone programming
 is much the same as it is for Norstar desk telephones. Some of the program-
 ming settings do not affect the operation of the portable.

 See your Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide for detailed instructions
 on how to program your Norstar system.

 The following table shows the recommended settings for your Norstar system:

 Twinning between Companion portables and Norstar wireline telephones -

 
  Using Answer DNs -

  If you have both a wireline (desk) telephone and Companion portable
  telephone you can answer calls from either device by using Norstar's
  Answer DN feature. Any call that normally rings at your desk can also
  appear and ring at your portable if it is assigned the desk telephone
  DN as an Answer DN. This arrangement is called twinning. 


  It is also possible to have calls to the portable appear on the desk
  telephone as an Answer DN.

  An Answer DN for a desk telephone and portable is programming exactly
  the same way as for two desk telephones. An installer or customer
  service representative programs Answer DNs.

  You can have up to eight Answer Keys assigned to your portable.

  The types of calls that your portable's Answer Keys receive are program-
  mable. See the Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide for more information.

  
  Tip - Hunt Group calls cannot be forwarded using the Call Forward features.

  Tip - An Answer DN is the recommended method for twinning a portable with a
  desk set. This ensures that all calls arriving at the desk telephone appear
  and ring at the portable. A twinned portable using An Answer DN does not
  ring for an incoming call if it is currently on another call.

  
  Norstar Voice Mail message waiting indication occurs on the twinned port-
  able only if it has been assigned a voice mail box.

  If your Norstar Voice Mail box has been assigned to your desk set, log
  on using the desk set DN when accessing the voice mail box from the
  twinned portable.

For more detailed information on how to access Norstar Voice Mail using your
Norstar Companion portable, refer to Portable Telephone Feature Card that
is supplied with the portable telephone.



 Using taget lines -

 Wireline and wireless telephones can be twinned using target lines.
The line for the desk telephone can be configured to appear on the
portable, or the line for the portable can appear on the desk telephone.
Incoming external calls ring at both.

When you twin wireline and wireless telephones using line assignments,
each telephone has its own internal DN. When someone wants to call you
or forwards a call to you internally, they must choose between the
desk telephone and the portable DN. The call appears and rings only at
the internal DN that was dialed.

 Tip - A portable can have an Answer DN and share a line assignment
       with a desk telephone.


Using your portable telephone

 You Companion portable telephone communicates with the Norstar system
using radio waves. The radio tranceivers for the system are located in
the Companion Base Stations installed around your office. Each Base Station
contains two radio transceivers and can handle two portable telephone calls
at once.

Your portable telephone is truly portable. Not only can you start a telephone
conversation anywhere in the office, you can continue that conversation while
you walk through the building. As you move from one part of your office to
another, you call is handed off from one Base Station to another.

If you notice a decrease in voice quality while moving with 
a portable telephone, you are moving out of range of your system's Base 
Stations. There are three possible reasons for this:


* The Base Stations that cover the area you are moving into may already be
  busy and therefore cannot pick up your call.

* Large pieces of furniture or movable partitions may have been moved into
  a position that blocks the signal between you and the Base Station.

* You may have moved out of the area covered by your Companion system.
  (Retrace your steps until you are back in range.)

In rare instances, during a Norstar Voice Mail session, softkey display
prompts on your portable may disappear. This is a normal condition and
is minimized by staying within the Companion coverage area.

While moving within a Companion coverage area, a slight "clipping" may be
heard during a call. This indicates that your call has been "handed off"
from one radio cell to the next.

Problems with lost connections are rare, but if you notice an increase of
such incidents after making large changes in the layout of your office,
your Base Stations may need to  be moved or reprogrammed to accommodate the
new arrangement. In this case, contact your installer or customer service
representative to change the Base Station configuration. (In the U.S. you
need to obtain UTAM Inc. approval before making changes to the system config-
uration.) Refer to MICS-XC Norstar-Companion Installer Guide for more infor-
mation.

 Tip - If you try to send a message from a desk telephone to a portable tele-
       phone, the display of the desk telephone shows Can't send msg.


Using Norstar features -

 It is possible to use many of the same Norstar features available to a Norstar
telephone on your portable telephone. The table below lists which features are
available for use on your portable telephone. For additional information on fe-
atures and the special key sequences required to use them, refer to the 
feature card that is supplied with your portable telephone.

Wireless Portable Language Selection -

 This feature allows you to change the language of the prompts controlled by
 the ICS as they appear on the portable's display, including both the display
 prompts and voice prompts from voice mail.

 Norstar supports English, French and Spanish.

 See the Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide for more information about
 choosing a language for the display.


Wireless Call Forward No Answer enhancement -

 This improvement stops the Companion portable from ringing when the call
 has been forwarded to its new destination. The portable user can still
 answer the call, but it does not ring. 

 The settings for Call Forward No Answer are found under Terminals & Sets
 in ICS programming. See the Modular ICS System Coordinator Guide for more
 information.


Supporting additional features for Companion portables -

 Two additional Norstar features can be used with a portable if lines and
 hardware (an analog terminal adapter (ATA)) are specifically configured
 to support them:

 * Voice Call ([*][6][6])

 * Priority Call ([*][6][9])

 Your installer or customer service representative can set up and program
 your system to support these features.

 Refer to the Portable Telephone Feature Card that is supplied with the port-
 able for the special key sequence required to use this set of features.

 
 Troubleshooting -

 When there is a problem with a portable, follow these steps:

 1. Make sure the portable is compatible with the Norstar software version.

 2. Verify that the portable is ON and that the battery is not low.

 3. Establish a radio connection to get a dial tone.

 If no dial tone is present:

 * Verify that dial tone is available from the ICS.

 * The portable may not be registered. Try to register the portable again.
   For more information, refer to the "Registering individual portables" on
   page 17.

 * Check that the portable is using the correct registration slot.

 * Verify that the portable has been assigned the correct internal number
   by calling it from another telephone.
