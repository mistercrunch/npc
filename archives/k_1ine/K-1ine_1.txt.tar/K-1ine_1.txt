Welcome to the first issue of K-1ine zine! Wow who would of thought that me,
The Clone would ever bother to write a 'zine and actually get it published!?

Yes, it is true my friends. Are YOU ready for the latest hacking, phreaking
and political based information from some of the best people in the scene?
Do you want to see this baby take off and last for years? Well maybe that's
taking it a bit far... who knows, we'll see if it lasts. I know that with
the help from a few good men (and women) across the Internet, we'll be able
to go places with this thing, this monster... this creation of e-freedom! :)

   AK-47 (Avtomat Kalashnikova, Model 1947)        Rounds/minute: 600+
 _____________________________________________________________________________

   Semi-automatic AK-47's were available for purchase in Canada with
   nothing more than an FAC (Firearm Aquisition Certificate) up until
   1992. This was the year a fascist hag named Kim Campbell was used as
   a sacrificial cow to railroad freedom-robbing gun legislation (Bill
   C-17) into place. Legislation which--among other things--took away the
   average citizens right to own a semi-automatic rifle which fell under
   their guidelines for an "assault rifle." You can still aquire an AK-47
   if you have a "restricted weapons permit." However, it's not always
   easy or even possible to obtain the permit, and once you register a
   restricted weapon you are also inviting the RCMP into your life. They
   have the right to come and "inspect" the rifle whenever they want. Not
   that they can't just enter your house anyway, but now you will have
   agreed to it on paper. Anway, it's all going to get worse and you can
   forget about it getting better.

   So, for those of you who still possess one of these fun assault rifles,
   here is how you can have even more fun with it before they come to take
   it away. Converting a semi-automatic AK-47 to fully-automatic.
   600 rounds per minute... ohhh yes.


   Materials Needed:

      1 AK-47
      1 twist-tie
      and lots of ammunition


   How it Works:

      Stages of action in a semi-automatic AK-47:

         1. Cock the rifle - The trigger Sear (the sear is the "catch")
            holds the Bolt-Carrier in a ready-to-fire position.

         2. Pull the trigger - The bolt is released causing the firing pin
            to strike the shells primer thereby firing the bullet.

         3. Piston comes back - Due to the pressure of the shells powder
            exploding the "gas" piston is forced back moving the bolt-
            carrier assembly along with it to re-cock the rifle.

         4. Missing the trigger sear - If you are still holding the
            trigger, the bolt carrier will miss the trigger sear and get
            caught by a second sear behind the trigger sear. If you weren't
            still holding the trigger the bolt-carrier would catch on the
            trigger sear so you would have to pull the trigger again.

         5. Release the trigger - The trigger mechanism causes the second
            sear to release and the bolt-carrier moves forward stopping on
            the trigger sear.

         6. Now the process repeats at stage 2.

      That's semi-automatic. Hmmm, if that second sear wasn't there
      wouldn't the bolt-carrier just miss the trigger sear and if you held
      the trigger it would just keep firing? Hell yes.


   Procedure:

      (It is obviously illegal to modify an AK-47 in this way. Don't!)

      Remove the magazine from the receiver. Remove the Receiver Cover by
      holding in the square button that sticks out the back of the cover.
      Slide the Return Spring and the Bolt-Carrier with Piston assembly out
      of the rifle.

      Using the twist-tie, tie the second Sear back to the pin that runs
      through the receiver of the rifle.

      Now reassemble the weapon. Slide the Piston and Bolt-Carrier back
      into the rifle. Slide the Return Spring back into the Bolt-Carrier
      and slide the other end of it into its guide slot. Push the "button"
      end of the Return Spring while settling the Receiver Cover back into
      place.


   Ammunition:

      I can tell you that not all ammunition will work with an AK-47 in
      this configuration. The problem is some ammo's primers are not
      sensitive enough to fire when the firing pin comes back after the
      first round is fired. In particular the military surplus ammo would
      not work for full-auto. Go figure. Experiment with different brands
      of ammo and you will find a brand that works.

  Final Notes:

      Uh, actually doing this would be very illegal.

#1. WHA?

Firstly, you're probably wondering, what IS skitching? Well, my
inquisitive friend, skitching is simply grabbing on to the back of a
moving vehicle while on rollerblades, or a skateboard (if you're
stupid-read on to find out why) and hitching a quick ride.

Now, yeah, I'm a hacker by trade, and you're probably reading this on a
hack/phreak page. So, why did I write this? Why not? I mean, we've gotta
find some way to get around from telco buildings to home, or whatever, and
for those of us who are too cheap to get insurance or too lazy/stupid to
get a license, a pair of $150 blades is perfect for quick, and simple
transportation. 


#2. Equipment!

Okay, now here are some things you should have for a successful skitch.

(a) Helmet - Now, I don't wear one, but it might be a good idea. After
all, you'll be travelling at 40-60+ km/hour and if you slip off the 
vehicle or something, your head is road pizza. A simple bike helmet will
do the trick, but if you really feel like being 31337 you can wear a
motor cycle helmet. Also, the visor on a motorbike helmet would be great
for improving your vision. Keep in mind, you've got wind blowing in your
eyes.

(b) Pads (with wings) - If you're deeply into rollerhockey, etc, then you
probably have all the gear: Knee-pads, elbo-pads, wrist-guards, condoms,
etc. Well, those are all a good idea. The last thing you want is to slip
off a bumper and thrash your knee. What do I recommend? Well, elbo pads
are overrated and cumbersome. Usually, if you hit something, it will be
your hands, your knees, or your ass that catches the asphalt. So, that
leaves knee pads and wrist guards. I wear wrist guards but no knee pads. I
was going to buy some pads for my knees, but I got too cheap and decided
to spend the $20 on a CD or some shit like that. I like the wrist guards 
though, cuz they save your hands, and your wrists from a brutal
thrashing, as well as they make it easier to grab onto things. Some people
might disagree, but I find they do.

(c) Eye protection - Sounds weird, eh? Well, it's true. You've got wind,
bugs, dirt, dust, and other debris flying at your face in many instances,
so keeping your eyes covered is a good idea. If you get a bug in your
mouth, who cares, extra protein. If you get a bug in your eye, you could
flinch and lose your grip. I wear a pair of $20 bike goggles with side
ventilation to prevent fogging. They work great. You COULD just wear
sunglasses, but there's a better chance of those falling off. Ski
goggles, a visor, anything. Whatever, just get something over your eyes.

(d) Knap sack - All good phreaks will carry a bag for their goodies.
Common sense alert: using a backpack with two shoulder straps makes
skitching easier. Purses, duffle bags, and even those little fanny/hip
packs are a pain in the ass.

(e) Clothing - It might be a good idea to wear some so some old lady
doesn't report a "naked kid skating around". Seriously, I want to keep it
clear that wearing something like leather or denim will reduce the rash
factor a whole wack. But, as usual, I don't follow my own advice, so you
don't have to either. I wear shorts and a t-shirt or a sweater usually.
(heh heh)


#3. Scoping yer ride...

Now, there are some things to look for in what you're going to skitch off
of. I've done alot of thinking about this, and here are my conclusions.
Heed them.

When you're skitching, what you're looking for is something you can hang
off of in case you're in trouble. Vehicles that are good for this are
pickups and city/telco vans. Why? With a pickup, you hang on to the
tailgate, and when you hit a ragged road, you just pull yourself up, and
kneel on the bumper. Real easy stuff! With utility vans, there are
usually those little ladders at the back. Those are sweet, cuz you can
hang on with those, and if something happens, just jump on up onto the
rungs of the ladder. Simple.

Now, compare this to a car.

You COULD hang on the bumper of some fucking toyota or something. But you
can't grip it too well, and your stance will be one that won't be too
great for balance. 

"Ah!" you're saying, "but what about cars with fins/spoilers?"

Uh! Looks like you got me there! ...hah... No, these suck too, cuz most
of those things won't be able to support your weight if you try to pull on
them. Besides, I wouldn't sit on the back of some dude's slippery car.
That's no good. Speedbumps can be a bitch.


#4. Watching the road.

Know your roads. Make sure where you're gonna be going is safe to glide
on. No bumps, potholes, gravel, cracks, etc. You can still always get
over all of these, but it's hard, and it makes it a hell of a lot easier
to avoid them altogether.

Main thing, don't ride a road you don't feel comfortable on.


#5. Catching the breeze~~~

Now that you've got your gear, know what kind of vehicles to go for, it's
time to actually get down and do it. All you've gotta do, is blade down
the street towards an intersection, or stop sign where your target is 
parked. It's the sweetest if you time it just right so that you won't
have to stop, just float up behind them and grab on as they start going.
It's much easier to start on a moving vehicle than a stopped one. Plus,
you have less of a chance of getting noticed.

If you think they see you, don't worry, it's easier just to give up right
away and make it look like you were using them to slow down or something.
This leads to my next topic...


#6. Getting away!

If you just happen to skitch off some spazoid piece of senile old shit
who throws a hissy fit cuz you're yanking on his bumper, you'd better
take off. These bastards don't take 'sorry' as a reasonable answer for
'why the hell you were trying to get yourself killed'. Nope. Just back
off, fast... What's the worst they could do? They could run you over if 
they're really psycho. They probably won't do that, but if you beat it,
they'll probably sure come close and do they're best to find out where
you live by following you.

Your best bet, take as many pedways, sidewalks, etc, so that you can get
as much distance between you and their car as easily as possible. 

Stairs are great for this if you happen to find yourself getting circled
in a mezzanine or underground parking lot. Remember, you've got blades,
there's no where you can't go. Running up stairs is easy, just make sure
you hang onto the rails.

Another thing that's real handy is a fence. Cars can't go over fences, 
and if there's a fence, the psycho-bitch chasing you will probably have 
to drive around the block to get to the other side. To climb a chainlink
fence nice and easy, just use your front wheels. They fit perfect-like
into the little holes. Once you're up, just fall onto the ground onto the
other side. Or, land on your feet... it's your call.

#7. Final words...

Okay, dudes, and dudettes, now you know everything I know, and probably
more... somehow...

Anyway, the main theme here, is DON'T do anything you don't feel
comfortable doing, and don't try anything you think you could hurt
yourself doing. You know the last thing you want to do is mash those
beautiful typing fingers. 

Oh, and one last thing, don't skitch cops. 

Endz.

                Cable Modem IP Hijacking in Win95/98


The purpose of this is to show you how bad cable modems security is and that
even with a win box you can take someone else's IP. You can hijack IP's using
a cable modem and it's very simple in any operating system. Just follow the
steps:

1) Choose someone's IP that you wish to have. Make sure the IP is on the same
   network. Most cable modem providers use DHCP. The fist thing you have to
   do is find the victims IP. Remember the victims IP has to be in the same
   network and with the same service provider for this to work.

2) Now this is probably the hardest thing in this file (but it's still easy),
   you have to wait until the victims computer is off or you can Smurf kill
   his connection. When you think his computer is off-line just try to ping
   it to see if you get a response. Do this by going to a DOS prompt and
   typing "ping <victims IP>". If you get a response then you have to try
   harder.

   After you get his PC off-line then you go into your network properties and
   edit the IP settings, but instead of having yours there you put the victims
   IP, host, and domain.

3) Restart. If you restart and you get an IP conflict this means that the
   victims computer is on, if you don't get an IP conflict then try to go to
   your web browser and see if it works. With some cable modem providers you
   might have to also add the Gateway, Subnet mask (255.255.55.0), Host, DNS
   search, and Domain.

Now you can go. Everything will work until the victims PC is back on. Once it is
back online it will take the IP away because it will tell you that you have the
wrong Mac addresses.


*Linux*
This is also possible in Linux, but is not the best way. You can change your Mac
address to the victims PC and this is more secure and much easier. There are a
couple of scripts to change your address, just look around.


Warning: Some cable modem service providers will know when you're using the wrong
IP, but hey, it might be useful.
