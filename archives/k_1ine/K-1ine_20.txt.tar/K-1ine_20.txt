:OVERVIEW:
So what the fuck is hash?? Hash can refer to the # (pound) key pertaining to
telecommunications. It can be the slang term for hashish, which refers to the
purified resinous extract of marijuana. Hash is also a unix command and has
roots in C aswell. In this txt i will refer to hash as the phreaking related
database program i will be writing. Right now it is in planning stages
and hopefuly soon i can begin coding, first i need your comments, suggestions,
and ideas.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!Please, read the functions and consider wether such a program is worth your !
!time, as im sure it will be. For this to become reality all i need is input.!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-:contact:-
/msg phlux on irc.2600.net irc.dal.net
ICQ 11192969, MSN m_s_n_sucksdank@hotmail.com
E-Mail fraud@verizonmail.com


-:intent:-
The aims of this program will be to provide multiple functions that otherwise
would otherwise be not easily accessible/available

Main objective: make Hash a simple program, easy to use, providing a wealth of
information and uses.


-:requirements:-
Because of the nature and simplicity of my my intents, the program will be
able to function on a 386, idealy, i plan on running Hash constantly, so use
of a dedicated low end computer is essential.

-:note:-
Because i am canadian, Hash will be written with a canadian prespective,
so alot of the functions will be canadian only, or more information will be
provided to canadians, and therefore more useable. However american users will
still find value for Hash

-:FUNCTIONS:-
If your wondering what the big fucking deal is then ill list off the functions
now;

to be incorporated into Hash:

**NPA lookup, NPA reverse lookup, including a graphical color coded Canadian
  NPA map(color)

**Numbering Information --user puts in any telephone number in the format of:
 NXX-XXX-XXXX (N is any digit other then a 1 or 0) this is the proper format
 for a north american telephone number. Much MUCH information can be told
 from a telephone number. For instance;

**If the telephone number spells any words (1-900-WET-CUNT) so assuming
  that number isn't assigned, and you want to buy it, Hash would tell you
  the 938 exchange in SAC 900 is operated by Federal Transtel, Inc.
  and to contact Ms. Geri Capri at 800-933-6600 extension 6202.

 \Also reversing of telephone number words should be implemented(tell hash the
  words and it will tell you the possible phone number combinations)
  In the meantime check phonespell.org to see exactly what i mean.

-900-NXX-XXXX -is a telephone number where an announced cost to call to
 such a number is billed to the calling party. 900 again is an SAC, so
 therefore it is non geographical. Other non geographical NPAs include:
 456 - Inbound International
 600 - Canadian Services
 710 - US Government


**So if 900-273-XXXX were entered, Hash would know 273 is assigned to
  Stentor Canadian Network Management, and additional information would be
  given, (contact information) in this case you would call Laurie Storm
  at 519-663-7485 .....

**If your wondering where 519-663-7485 is, Hash's database could further tell
   you, 519 NPA is assigned to Ontario, CANADA, that it has been inservice
   since Janruary, 1, 1953, if it is geographic or not(it is), while the 663
   exchange serves London. Much more information can be incorporated, such as
   Time Zone for that area, even conversion and comparison as per your
   timezone.

 \This would be useful if you don't want to be calling your distant phreaking
  buddies for a conf and end up waking up their mom because its 5am there.
  --depending on supply(coding)+demand issues, the relief planning stats for
  the NPA could be displayed, for instance, in 403 (alberta canada) Hash
  would've given the date of the area code split and the next time the NPA(s)
  would be in jeopardy for relief planning.

** 8XX-NXX-XXXX a telephone number with this format where the first 2 X's MUST
  represent like digits (so 800 888 877, 866 etc) are all  tollfree numbers.
  800 is not technicaly an area code but rather an SAC(service access code).
  This is an example of an ECR, Easily Recognized Code.

 \The INWATS(Inward Wide Area Telecommunications Service(8XX SACs)) has
  six bands of service areas.
    Band 6 -the best, anywhere in North America can reach a band 6 INWATS
     Band 5 -includes the 48 contiguous states
      Band 1 -includes only the state contiguous to that one
   So therefore a band 6 can be most easily reached(bands are responsible for 
   your american friends being able to dial into that conf, yet if you are
   canadian you will get an annoying intercept msg.)

!NOTE: This information pertaining to INWATS bands is courtesy of one
 Mr. Jolly Roger and is outdated, and therefore will be subject to R&D.

  \Intrastate INWATS (can only be called from one state) always has a
   2 as the last digit in the exchange, so 800-NX2-XXXX. The NXX (exchange)
   on 800 SACs respresents the area where the business is located.
   So 800-431 would terminate at a New York CO.
   (again this information courtey Jolly Roger, subject to further R&D
   obvisouly, in the meantime does anyone know how he figures 800-431
   terminates in NY? I sure as hell don't)

 **Now lets say you do a search for 800-855-XXXX The exchange 855 is used
   to access the PSTN via TTY (TRS/MRS) to and from speech or hearing
   impaired users, among other things, 800-855 #s are designated for such
   disabilitied users only. Because 800 is a ERC SAC, it is non geographic.
   It was implemented on Jan, 1, 1966 Hash will instantly tell you all
   this information pertaining to the phone number you enter, among whatever
   other related information is available.

  **Telco related searchable dictionary(still being considered as this
    function would require words to be submitted from users(credit given))
    Or im sure i could borrow one from somewhere...

  **ANI II code lookup(+definitions)

  **Calculator(calc.exe can lick my baunch)

  **DTMF decoder is a possibility with an added circuit(using serial/parallel)

  **Morse Code encoder/player(pc speaker --why not Mr Bell was an OK guy)

  **Resistor Encoder/Decoder(i always forget what the colored bands represent)

  **International&Caribbean Country Code Lookup(+reverse)

  **Planned NPAs(all of north america) + Old NPA/Overlay Status, inservice
    date and the status of the planned NPAs

  **Vertical Service Codes lookup/definitions (your *67, *69, etc)

  **CIC(carrier identification code) lookup(+company name, assignment date,
    contact information(name, phone #, address)
    \CICs purpose is to enable routing+billing from the local provider to the
     specific inter-exchange and other providers in the NANP network.
     Each CIC is in the format of XXXX, is a service providers identity that
     has bought either FGB/FGD(feature group B or D) access from the local
     access carrier.

     FGB CAC 950-XXXX where the XXXX is the CIC that public can use to access
     a chosen long distance provider.

     FGD CAC local trunk side access to local carrier by another carrier.
     Allows pre-subscription to a long distance carrier. FGD CAC is accessed
     with 101XXXX(XXXX=CIC) the user can then place a long distance call using
     a long distance carrier to which the phone is not pre-subscribed.
     3D(igit) FGD represents 101XXXX   4D(igit) FGD represents 10XXX


  **Personal Communications Services N00 NXX allows "some combination" of
    personal mobility, terminal mobility+service profile management. May be
    reffered to as "follow me" PCS. Relief planning will use ECR 533.
    500-NXX-XXXX prefix indicates service provider, suffix denotes the
    premium service.

  **GOVnet Dial-In Prefixes, see http://www.hackcanada.com/canadian/other/govnet.txt

  **More(tell me)

Beginner Phreakers to elite phreakers should find Hash a very useful program.
Alot of the information Hash will use is available at NANPA.com and
subsidaries involved with number planning, guidelines, and general
telecommunications.

For instance, cyb0rg/asm has on hackcanada.com/telco/edmontonexchanges.html
has posted a listing of exchanges in 780 Edmonton, Alberta that originally
appeared in the phonebook(1998 i believe). The information provided
is more extensive, whereas an exchange will say function+district. One
interesthing note is that 780-530 is reserved for Military use.
Hash could combine this list with an updated list of 780-NXX edmonton
exchanges, so an updated version would be accessible.

Another interesting thing to note if the government exchanges;
780-427-XXXX Provincial Government
780-496-XXXX Edmonton City Government
780-495-XXXX Edmonton Federal Government

Many telephone numbers using these government prefixes can be dialed with
310-0000 which must be an extender the government setup for us. yay.
Phone 310-4455 to give your thanks.(Alberta Connect Gov Comment Hotline :)

So yeah, more OCRing...(id like to know what district a prefix is instead of
just knowing it is in a big big city)

However the lists do include Plant Test Code NPAs (bust out the war dialer,
or perhaps i could incorporate one into Hash? that would be KING#@!)

Coding considerations for a war dialer are not out of my reach, as i plan to
code Hash in Turbo Pascal for DOS.(unix users should have no problems using
dosemu as the Hash is not a very complex program)
What would you guys want in Hash's scanner??
-Carrier Detection(obvisouly)
-SIT detection? should be fun..
-Fax detection..  "     "  "
-Dial tone (PBX) detection(etc etc,busy/reorder/ring counter all the obvisous)
-Direct modem AT access, scripting? The scanner should be able to work along
 side such devices as the PowerKey/Toll restrictors (so a pin cracker)
-you tell me, a scanner would have to be made available after the standard
 functions are implemented...

Should it be GUI or console based?? GUI would mean a little front end, so
extra code, larger program(im curious as to how large just the db files will
take up..though i do have plans to handle this.)

Console would be hardcore, nice and clean:

Hash# get 780. planttest

Hash# get 780. planttest > C:\780test.txt
....
Command'get 780. planttest > C:\780test.txt' complete.

</sample>

Console Hash would not be comprimised with excessive code, screen filler,
it would be more effecient. Anyone who has ever user DOS/Console unices/MUDs
should not feel uncomfortable with such a system, an extensive help system
would obvisouly be implemented, once commands learned, this would be much
faster then navigating menus with arrow keys.
However all suggestions welcomed.

Now that you have a taste how Hash may be able to help you i will address
other issues:

What liscense will the program be released under:
Seems as im ripping alot of information from nanpa.com, the program will be
free, i would only expect that if you use the program you tell me what you
think of it. I am ashamed of my coding, so source will not be releaed.

Why Turbo Pascal?:
I have not finished "Waite Groups New C Primer Plus" when i do, i will bust
out Borlands Turbo C, so DOS version will run much faster, and will benefit
the unix kiddies. Maybe i could write my own mini zip slack distribution
soley for hash, zip slack rules, Hash would run just find with 100mb parallel
(how many of you guys have zip drives? would be a good project to help me get
 to know linux)

System requirements?:
Hopefully minimal, being 486 8mb ram max, maybe 386 4mb ram.. it would be
slow though... but i think it would be worth it, just keep the box on 24/7
i would use that shit so much... like the program would have a clock+date
forsure...

For tone generation, PC speaker needed, tone generation is to limited single
frequency tones unless.. sound card implementation?

WAV files would take up abit of space.. but then i could include any/all
tones, intercept recordings (good fun when your drunk and harassing telus
TSPS opers)....hmm.. i would have to get like Wolfenstein/DOOM MIDIs too!

Well fuck look at me get all riled up.. might as well go all the way?
If im boxing a call at a payphone(see my payphone/TTY txt :) with my lappie,
hax0ring AGNPAC with the acoustic coupler.. fucking rights i'd want to listen
to DOOM MIDIs... that shit is elite, would be scary as fuck at such a time..

HEHE looking in the phone book theres a nice Postal Code listing in really
small txt, i could OCR that shit, and have an update package cuz it would
be a few MB worth of text!
note from phone book: "This publication contains data under liscense from
Canada Post Corporation's publication entitled Canada's Postal Code Directory.
The postal code data may only be copied for the purposes of preparing mail to
be delivered by Canada Post Corporation or in accordance with a written
licence from Canada Post Corporation"

Translation: In the future when i OCR that shit the command will be;
Hash# preparemail
Preparing Mail to be delivered by Canada Post;
What PO Box/Route/Street Address? (enter postal code for reverse)
T4V 4S1

Address Mail To: ELECTRO TEL  48AVE. #3720 T4V 4S1

..

What else is there?:
Pr0n, yes ofcourse the pr0n...

Because lots of the databased information changes quite frequently(every month
sometimes..) i would have to make little update programs.. but for that
i could use pkzip'ed executables... so i do all the fucking work and you
get to just run a program.

Color coding would be essential, so you could quickly recognize numbers
Government Telephone=GREEN
Toll Free Services=TEAL? (what color is teal?)
Business Exchanges/Suffixes: BLUE
Residential Exchanges/Suffixes: RED (notice a trend?)
Test Numbers: blinking teal?

Important numbers (pertaining to canada(priority)) that are business (telus
business offices, all the important shit..) i should have in another database
(toll free too.. i dont want the list too big) but common numbers like
ResPorg, Telus TTY/dialaround, Telus NOC, RCMAC :P, just stuff phreaks
commonly use, or may be commonly heard would be added to the list...

Many a time have unknown numbers been said on a conf, pasted to irc, etc, so
I hope this program will clear some shit up so you dont have to look like a
fool.

uhm oh yeah fuck colors im going to bed

What are your resources for thsi project:
Public docs from various orginazations;
NANPA(North American Numer Planning Administration), 
INC(Indutry Numbering Comittee),
CNA(Canadian Numbering Administrator),
CSCN(Canadian Steering Committee On Numbering)

so fucking e-mail phluxy and tell him what you want on your pie

    Introduction -

 GOVnet is the name given to the network infrastructure which serves government offices in
Montpelier and Waterbury as well as district offices in twelve cities and towns statewide. In
the near future the Whitehouse and the DOD will be adopting this network for nation-wide usage.

The physical backbone consists of fiber optic cable connecting state buildings on the Montpelier
and Waterbury campuses as well as high-bandwidth digital circuits connecting district offices
statewide. The wide-area backbone is divided into OSPF regions with at least one alternative
route for each link. From the backbone nodes, 56 Kbps backfeeds serve other government offices,
schools, and libraries statewide.

In addition there are dial-in sites located in every local calling area of the state facilitating
network access with a local phone call from any school or library in the state that elects to have
dial-in access. SLIP and PPP access, as well as VT100 access, are supported on a dial-in basis.

The network uses the "open" non-proprietary TCP/IP communications protocol which permits connectivity
throughout the state, the nation and the world.

Network services include Internet access, government-wide e-mail, and WWW access to government
information and services. See the State of Vermont home page (http://www.state.vt.us/).

 --

  GOVnet's Purpose -

 GOVnet was implemented to meet the twofold network challenge of improved access with reduced costs.
The network provides for complete inter-agency and inter-departmental information access through a single
system serving all agencies on a cooperative basis. This eliminates the need for each agency or department
to provide redundant networks involving duplicate costs.

 --

 GOVnet's Origin -

 The Vermont Information Strategy Plan (VISP) identified the requirement for information sharing and
networking in two of the critical success factors associated with its objectives. The Information Systems
Advisory Council (ISAC), which was created by VISP (now called IRMAC), was commissioned by the Telecommun-
ication Ten-Year Plan to form a network subcommittee to "develop a plan to integrate network services where
such sharing is valuable for information sharing among government agencies (and) where it is designed and
implemented with the participation and unanimous approval of ISAC."

For a detailed analysis of GOVnet, including a chronology, see the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office's GOVnet
System Evaluation and Network Study (http://www.leg.state.vt.us/reports/govnet/govnet.htm).

its existance and development has been an ongoing process for quite some time] 

  U.S. Seeks to Build Secure Online Network;
Telecom Firms Asked for Help in Constructing Private 'Govnet' System
(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40092-2001Oct10.html)

By Krissah Williams
Washington Post Staff Writer

The government's new cyber-security officials yesterday asked telecommunications
companies for help building a government computer network that would have "no risk
of outside penetration" -- a task some computer security consultants say is nearly impossible.

Plans for the private network, called Govnet, hinge on whether a reliable network infrastructure
can be built at an affordable price, officials said. Computer system consultants said they could
not estimate how much the network would cost because of the government's enormous size and security
needs.

Richard Clarke, who was appointed special adviser to the president for cyberspace security this week,
said he believes a more reliable system can be built. Ninety percent of available fiber-optic space is
unused and fairly inexpensive to obtain, he said.

Govnet is part of a plan Clarke announced earlier this week "to secure our cyberspace from a range of
possible threats, from hackers to criminals to terrorist groups, to foreign nations, which might use
cyber-war against us in the future." Govnet would be completely independent from the Internet to help
keep out hackers and viruses, according to the government's plan.

The request from the General Services Administration asks that telecommunications companies submit
proposals about how the network could be built, how much it would cost, and how long it would take
to construct.

"Based upon that we will make a decision. We're waiting to hear from industry right now," Clarke said.

This year, the current network has been breached by hackers, computer worms and viruses.
In April, government Web sites were manipulated by Chinese hackers angered by the death of a Chinese
pilot in a collision with an American spy plane. The system was also roughed up by the "Code Red"
computer worm and an attack program called "ILoveYou." The viruses affected thousands of government
computers.

Last year a report by the General Accounting Office, an internal government watchdog, found weaknesses
in the computer network that could allow terrorists or hackers to "severly damage or disrupt national
defense or vital public operations or steal sensitive data."

Clarke said the government's current virtual private network is vulnerable to viruses and denial of
service attacks that Govnet would make more difficult to execute.

George Kurtz, co-author of "Hacking Exposed" and chief executive of security consulting firm Foundstone
Inc., said such a network is feasible but would be costly and difficult to build. It is impossible to
stave off all attacks, he said.

"The gist of this entire effort is to try to segment critical government computer systems from the
rest of the Internet," Kurtz said. "You can't guarantee against these sort of attacks. There is always
going to be a flaw with software, a flaw with hardware or the human element."

Even on Govnet, viruses and attacks could still be spread by floppy disks or connections with trusted
systems, Kurtz said.

An internal network, such as the Govnet proposal, is worth investigating but will probably fall to
sophisticated hackers, said Amit Yoran, chief executive of security-services company Riptech Inc.
and a former information-security program director at the Defense Department.

"It is probably more feasible to implement and strongly enforce global security postures and practices
rather than go out and purchase new assets," Yoran said. "Once someone is able to get in, they will find
a weak link. When you have a network the size of the government's there will be weak links. Someone will
get in."

  Conclusion -

 This is what the US Government gets for publically releasing documentation on the Internet about
their so-called "secret" and "private" network... I know you'll have a few good laughs about that one
(I know I did). Love, Peace, And Afro Grease!

	Government Emergency Telephone System ACT --


Sec. 0.01.  This Act  shall  be  known  and  may  be  cited  as  the
"Emergency Telephone System Act".
(Source: P.A. 85-978.)

    Sec. 1.  The General Assembly finds and declares that it is  in  the
public  interest  to  shorten the time required for a citizen to request
and receive emergency aid.  There currently exist thousands of different
emergency phone numbers throughout  the  state,  and  present  telephone
exchange  boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily
correspond to public safety and political boundaries.   Provision  of  a
single,  primary  three-digit  emergency  number through which emergency
services can  be  quickly  and  efficiently  obtained  would  provide  a
significant  contribution  to  law  enforcement and other public service
efforts by making it less difficult  to  quickly  notify  public  safety
personnel.  Such a simplified means of procuring emergency services will
result  in  the  saving  of  life,  a  reduction  in  the destruction of
property, quicker apprehension of criminals, and ultimately  the  saving
of  money.   The  General  Assembly  further finds and declares that the
establishment of a uniform, statewide emergency number is  a  matter  of
statewide  concern  and interest to all inhabitants and citizens of this
State.  It is the purpose of this Act to establish the number "9-1-1" as
the primary emergency telephone number for use  in  this  State  and  to
encourage  units  of  local government and combinations of such units to
develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in
such a manner as to be able to quickly respond to any person calling the
telephone number "9-1-1" seeking  police,  fire,  medical,  rescue,  and
other emergency services.

system, and shall be entitled to participate in any program of grants or
other State funding of such systems.

    The establishment of such systems shall be centralized to the extent
feasible.  Nothing in  this  Act  shall  be  construed  to  prohibit  or
discourage  in  any way the formation of multijurisdictional or regional
systems, and any system established pursuant to this Act may include the

    Sec. 6.  Capabilities of system; pay telephones.  All systems  shall
be  designed  to  meet  the  specific requirements of each community and
public agency served by the  system.  Every  system,  whether  basic  or
sophisticated,  shall be designed to have the capability of utilizing at
least 1 of the methods specified in  Sections   2.03  through  2.06,  in
response  to  emergency  calls.  The General Assembly finds and declares
that the most critical aspect  of  the  design  of  any  system  is  the
procedure  established  for  handling  a telephone request for emergency
services.

    In addition, to maximize efficiency and utilization of  the  system,
all  pay  telephones  within each system shall, within 3 years after the
implementation date or by December 31, 1985, whichever is later,  enable

assistance  of  the Attorney General, shall assist local public agencies
and  local  public  safety  agencies  in  obtaining  financial  help  to
establish emergency telephone service, and shall aid  such  agencies  in
the  formulation of concepts, methods, and procedures which will improve
the operation of systems required by this Act and  which  will  increase
cooperation between public safety agencies.

utilities for the implementation  of  the  planned  emergency  telephone
system  no  later  than  3  years  after  the  implementation date or by
December 31, 1985, whichever is later.  A copy of the plan  required  by
this  subdivision shall be filed with the Commission. In order to secure
compliance  with  the  standards  promulgated  under  Section  10,   the
Commission  shall  have  the  power  to approve or disapprove such plan,
unless such plan was announced before the effective date of this Act.

    If any public agency has implemented  or  is  a  part  of  a  system
required  by  this  Act  on  a  deadline specified in this Section, such
public agency shall submit in lieu of the  tentative  or  final  plan  a
report describing the system and stating its operational date.

the progress in the implementation of  systems  required  by  this  Act.
Such   reports   shall   contain   his  recommendations  for  additional
legislation.

    In December of 1979 and in December of 1980 the Commission, with the
advice  and  assistance  of   the   Attorney   General,   shall   submit
recommendations  to  the  Bureau  of  the  Budget  and  to  the Governor
specifying amounts necessary to further implement  the  organization  of

    Sec. 14.  The General Assembly declares  that  a  major  purpose  in
enacting  this  Act  is  to  eliminate  instances  in which a responding
emergency service refuses to render aid to  the  requester  because  the
requester  is  outside of the jurisdictional boundaries of the emergency
service.  Therefore, in implementing systems under this Act, all  public
agencies in a single system shall enter into a joint powers agreement or
any other form of written cooperative agreement which is applicable when
need  arises  on  a  day-to-day  basis.   Certified  notification of the
continuation of such agreements shall be made among the involved parties
on an annual basis.  In addition, such agreements shall be entered  into
between  public  agencies  and  public safety agencies which are part of
different systems but whose jurisdictional  boundaries  are  contiguous.
The  agreements shall provide that, once an emergency unit is dispatched
in response to a request through the system, such unit shall render  its
services  to  the requesting party without regard to whether the unit is
operating outside its normal jurisdictional boundaries.

agreements  shall  be  so  filed  prior to the 31st day of January.  The
Attorney  General  shall  commence  judicial  proceedings   to   enforce
compliance  with  this  Section and Section 14, where a public agency or
public safety agency has failed to timely enter into such  agreement  or
file copies thereof.

government assuming the duties of an emergency telephone  system  board,
nor  any  officer, agent or employee of any public agency, public safety
agency, emergency telephone system board, or unit  of  local  government
assuming  the  duties  of  an emergency telephone system board, shall be
liable for any civil damages as a result of any act or omission,  except
willful  or  wanton misconduct, in connection with developing, adopting,
operating or implementing any plan or system required by this Act.

    Sec. 15.3.  (a) The corporate authorities of any municipality or any
county may, subject to the limitations of subsections (c), (d), and (h),
and in addition to any tax levied pursuant  to  Section  8-11-2  of  the
Illinois   Municipal   Code,   impose  a  monthly  surcharge  on  billed
subscribers of network connection provided by telecommunication carriers
engaged in the business of transmitting messages by means of electricity
originating within the corporate limits of the  municipality  or  county
imposing  the  surcharge  at a rate per network connection determined in
accordance with subsection  (c).   A  municipality  may  enter  into  an
intergovernmental  agreement  with  any  county in which it is partially
located, when the county has adopted an ordinance to impose a  surcharge
as   provided  in  subsection  (c),  to  include  that  portion  of  the
municipality  lying  outside  the  county  in  that  county's  surcharge
referendum.  If the  county's  surcharge  referendum  is  approved,  the
portion   of   the  municipality  identified  in  the  intergovernmental
agreement shall automatically be disconnected from the county  in  which
it  lies  and  connected to the county which approved the referendum for
purposes of a surcharge on telecommunications carriers.

(b)  For purposes of computing the surcharge imposed  by  subsection
(a), the network connections to which the surcharge shall apply shall be
those   in-service   network   connections,  other  than  those  network
connections assigned to the municipality or county,  where  the  service
address  for  each  such  network  connection  or connections is located
within the corporate limits of the municipality or  county  levying  the
surcharge.  The "service address" shall mean the location of the primary
use of the network connection or connections. With  respect  to  network
connections provided for use with pay telephone services for which there
is  no  billed  subscriber, the telecommunications carrier providing the
network connection shall be deemed to be its own billed  subscriber  for
purposes of applying the surcharge.

(c)  Upon  the  passage  of an ordinance to impose a surcharge under
this Section the clerk of the municipality or county shall  certify  the
question  of whether the surcharge may be imposed to the proper election
authority who shall submit the public question to the  electors  of  the
municipality  or  county  in  accordance  with the general election law;
provided that such question shall not be  submitted  at  a  consolidated
primary  election.   The  public  question shall be in substantially the
following form:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Shall the county (or city, village
or incorporated town) of.....impose          YES
a surcharge of up to...¢ per month per
network connection, which surcharge will
be added to the monthly bill you receive   -----------------------------
for telephone or telecommunications
charges, for the purpose of installing
(or improving) a 9-1-1 Emergency             NO
Telephone System?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a majority of the votes cast upon  the  public  question  are  in
favor thereof, the surcharge shall be imposed.
    However,  if  a  Joint  Emergency  Telephone  System  Board is to be
created pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement under  Section  15.4,
the  ordinance  to impose the surcharge shall be subject to the approval
of a majority of the total number of votes cast upon the public question
by the electors of all of the municipalities or counties, or combination
thereof, that are parties to the intergovernmental agreement.

    The referendum requirement of this subsection (c) shall not apply to
any municipality with a population over 500,000  or  to  any  county  in
which  a  proposition  as  to  whether  a  sophisticated 9-1-1 Emergency
Telephone System should be installed in the county, at  a  cost  not  to
exceed a specified monthly amount per network connection, has previously
been  approved by a majority of the electors of the county voting on the
proposition at an election conducted before the effective date  of  this
amendatory Act of 1987.

    (d)  A  county  may  not  impose  a surcharge, unless requested by a
municipality, in any incorporated area which has previously  approved  a
surcharge  as  provided  in  subsection  (c) or in any incorporated area
where the corporate authorities  of  the  municipality  have  previously
entered   into   a   binding   contract  or  letter  of  intent  with  a
telecommunications  carrier  to  provide  sophisticated  9-1-1   service
through municipal funds.

    (e)  A  municipality  or  county may at any time by ordinance change
the rate of the surcharge imposed under this Section  if  the  new  rate
does  not  exceed  the rate specified in the referendum held pursuant to
subsection (c).

    (f)  The surcharge authorized by this  Section  shall  be  collected
from  the  subscriber  by  the  telecommunications carrier providing the
subscriber the network connection as a separately  stated  item  on  the
subscriber's bill.

    (g)  The  amount  of  surcharge  collected by the telecommunications
carrier shall be paid to the particular municipality or county or  Joint
Emergency  Telephone  System  Board  not  later  than  30 days after the
surcharge  is  collected,  net  of  any  network  or  other   9-1-1   or
sophisticated   9-1-1   system   charges   then   due   the   particular
telecommunications   carrier,   as  shown  on  an  itemized  bill.   The
telecommunications  carrier  collecting  the  surcharge  shall  also  be
entitled to deduct 3% of the gross  amount  of  surcharge  collected  to
reimburse  the  telecommunications carrier for the expense of accounting
and collecting the surcharge.

    (h)  A municipality with a population over 500,000 may not impose  a
monthly surcharge in excess of $1.25 per network connection.

    (i)  Any  municipality or county or joint emergency telephone system
board that has imposed a surcharge pursuant to this Section prior to the
effective date of this amendatory Act of 1990 shall hereafter impose the
surcharge in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.

    (j)  The corporate authorities of any  municipality  or  county  may
issue,   in   accordance  with  Illinois  law,  bonds,  notes  or  other
obligations secured in whole or in part by the proceeds of the surcharge
described in this Section.  Notwithstanding any change in law subsequent
to the issuance of any bonds, notes or other obligations secured by  the
surcharge,  every  municipality  or  county issuing such bonds, notes or
other obligations shall be authorized to impose the surcharge as  though
the  laws  relating  to the imposition of the surcharge in effect at the
time of issuance of the bonds, notes or other obligations were  in  full
force and effect until the bonds, notes or other obligations are paid in
full. The State of Illinois pledges and agrees that it will not limit or
alter  the  rights  and  powers vested in municipalities and counties by
this Section to impose the surcharge so as to impair  the  terms  of  or
affect  the  security  for  bonds, notes or other obligations secured in
whole or in part with the proceeds of the surcharge  described  in  this

    Sec. 15.4.  Emergency Telephone System Board; powers.
    (a)  The corporate authorities of any county  or  municipality  that
imposes  a  surcharge  under  Section  15.3 shall establish an Emergency
Telephone System Board.  The corporate authorities shall provide for the
manner of appointment and the number of members of the  Board,  provided
that  the  board  shall consist of not fewer than 5 members, one of whom
may be a public member who is a resident of the local  exchange  service
territory  included in the 9-1-1 coverage area, one of whom (in counties
with a population less than 100,000) may  be  a  member  of  the  county
board,  and  at  least  3  of  whom shall be representative of the 9-1-1
public safety agencies, including but not limited to police departments,
fire departments, emergency medical services  providers,  and  emergency
services  and  disaster  agencies,  and  appointed on the basis of their
ability or experience.  Elected officials are also eligible to serve  on
the  board.   Members  of the board shall serve without compensation but
shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses.  Any  2  or
more  municipalities,  counties,  or  combination thereof, that impose a
surcharge under Section 15.3 may,  instead  of  establishing  individual
boards,  establish  by  intergovernmental  agreement  a  Joint Emergency
Telephone  System  Board  pursuant  to  this  Section.   The  manner  of
appointment of such a joint board shall be prescribed in the agreement.

    (b)  The powers  and  duties  of  the  board  shall  be  defined  by
ordinance  of  the  municipality  or  county,  or  by  intergovernmental
agreement  in  the  case  of a joint board.  The powers and duties shall
include, but need not be limited to the following:

         (1)  Planning a 9-1-1 system.

         (2)  Coordinating   and   supervising    the    implementation,
    upgrading, or maintenance of the system, including the establishment
    of equipment specifications and coding systems.

         (3)  Receiving  monies from the surcharge imposed under Section
    15.3, and from any other source,  for  deposit  into  the  Emergency
    Telephone System Fund.

         (4)  Authorizing all disbursements from the fund.

         (5)  Hiring  any  staff  necessary  for  the  implementation or
    upgrade of the system.

    (c)  All monies received by a board pursuant to a surcharge  imposed
under  Section  15.3 shall be deposited into a separate interest-bearing
Emergency  Telephone  System  Fund  account.  The   treasurer   of   the
municipality or county that has established the board or, in the case of
a  joint  board,  any  municipal  or  county treasurer designated in the
intergovernmental agreement,  shall  be  custodian  of  the  fund.   All
interest accruing on the fund shall remain in the fund.  No expenditures
may  be  made  from  such fund except upon the direction of the board by
resolution  passed  by  a  majority  of  all  members  of   the   board.
Expenditures  may  be made only to pay for the costs associated with the
following:

         (1)  The design of the Emergency Telephone System.

         (2)  The coding of an initial Master Street Address Guide  data
    base, and update and maintenance thereof.

         (3)  The   repayment   of   any   monies   advanced   for   the
    implementation of the system.

         (4)  The   charges  for  Automatic  Number  Identification  and
    Automatic  Location  Identification  equipment,  a  computer   aided
    dispatch system that records, maintains, and integrates information,
    mobile  data  transmitters equipped with automatic vehicle locators,
    and  maintenance,  replacement  and  update  thereof   to   increase
    operational  efficiency  and  improve  the  provision  of  emergency
    services.

         (5)  The  non-recurring  charges related to installation of the
    Emergency Telephone System and the ongoing network charges.

         (6)  The acquisition and installation, or the reimbursement  of
    costs therefor to other governmental bodies that have incurred those
    costs,   of   road  or  street  signs  that  are  essential  to  the
    implementation of the emergency telephone system and  that  are  not
    duplicative of signs that are the responsibility of the jurisdiction
    charged with maintaining road and street signs.

         (7)  Other    products   and   services   necessary   for   the
    implementation, upgrade, and maintenance of the system and any other
    purpose related to the operation  of  the  system,  including  costs
    attributable  directly  to the construction, leasing, or maintenance
    of any buildings or facilities or costs  of  personnel  attributable
    directly to the operation of the system. Costs attributable directly
    to the operation of an emergency telephone system do not include the
    costs  of  public safety agency personnel who are and equipment that
    is dispatched in response to an emergency call.

    (d)  The board shall complete the data base before implementation of
the 9-1-1 system.  The error ratio of the data base  shall  not  at  any
time exceed 1% of the total data base.

	Social Engineering:

Government Emergency Telephone Systems biggest flaw is not in its physical or
watts Band 6 network infrastructure, but the fact that all live operators who
administrate the GETS system more often than not allow themselves to be tricked
by unauthorized NON-government employees. Because all calls that route through
the GETS system are thought of as high-priority, operators who are called up won't
usually think twice about giving the person on the other end of the line a high-
priority account.

High-priority accounts allow anyone to call any number in most of Canada / USA for free.
Phone numbers that would normally give you a busy-signal, or an "all circuits busy" recording,
will allow you to do an Emergency Interrupt with a GETS account - thus allowing you to break
into the conversation between the called party and the third person on the line.


 Scenario between unauthorized person and GETS operator;

 Operator: "Operator services, how may I help you?"

 John Bashcoff: "Yes, hello this is John Bashcoff with the Office of the Commissioner for
Federal Judicial   Affairs. I'm in Edmonton right now, and I seem to have misplaced
my GETS pin number. This is an emergency, can you please supply me with a PIN?"

 Operator: "Yes of course Mr.Bashcoff. The pin number is [12 digit number]."

 John Bashcoff: "Thank You."

 Operator: "You're welcome."

 -- CALL ENDS --

Unauthorized caller proceeds to call back the GETS system, and immediately he
enters the 12 digit pin he was supplied with. Tada... outdial access anywhere
he wants for free. His caller identification information shows 'Long Distance,
710-627-4387'. FYI; The area code '710' is a private area code owned by the US
Government. When you dial up the phone number 710-627-4387, you will connect
to another GETS system.

--

 Dial-Up Numbers -

  I recommend you do not call the first phone number on this list,
  and when calling any of these numbers do NOT use them from home or work -
  use a payphone far away from your home if you can.
  

     * 1-710-627-4387
 
     * 1-800-257-8373
 
     * 1-800-900-GETS

     * 1-888-288-GETS


 --

 Conclusion;

  Have fun and don't get caught. Big brother *IS* watching, and he will rip
  your balls off and flush them down the toilet if he catches you using his
  systems.

Hiding Messages No One Will Ever See on disc.server.com

The disc.server.com CGI webboard allows users to manually choose what 
message they view by entering it into the URL.  Every message is ordered by 
its article # - starting at 1 when the message board first opened, moving 
upwards.  Now, when you send a message the html form sends the author, etc.. 
  When you reply to a message, it also sends the "parent" variable, which is 
the article number of the message you are replying to.

Now, go view some message on a a disc.server.com board,  Edit the URL to 
point to a higher article number.  If it displays another message, then keep 
increasing the article number until it displays "Wed Dec 31 18:00:00 1969."  
Remember this number.
(note: an easier way to find this number is simply to send a message, lok at 
its article number, and add 1)

Now, reply to a message.. it doesn't matter what.  Edit the HTML so that the 
"parent" variable is one more than the last valid article number.  Now, when 
you create this message, the article number will be equal to the parent 
number.  It doesn't get displayed in the index, but you can manually reach 
it by entering its article number.  Note: you can't reply to this message 
either.  Its just there.

Chances of anyone seeing that message? pretty much zero, unless they do what 
I do.  Instead of looking for updates to the board by searching through the 
index, I just increment the article number by one until the messages do not 
exist.

woah that was cool

How to piss off Telus with your ADSL Modem amongst other things.       09/26/01

Sitting here with nothing better to do, i thought i would write up a little article on what
information i've gathered on the Telus network in good ol' Edmonton. Also, let it be known
according to a tier 1 (yes, the godlike teir 1 guys) tech support guy, claiming he works
for telus (he answered at 310-inet) that telus does NOT, i repeat DOES NOT support the x86
arch (guess i'll just have to back to using my alpha)

Disclamer: This is for educational purposes only, if you happen to have the police knock
on your door at 7 AM to exersize a search warrant to obtain all computer related materials
in your residence because of what you did in this article, then thats too fkn bad, cause
your the dumb shit who let somone else tell him what to do. btw, only done this with a 
3com home connect modem, but logic dictates that those damned cisco's should behave the
same too. Now, down to business.

1) Overview

	The Telus Network is relatively secure, in so far as it doesnt usually spew packets
all over the network like lovely cable modems do. The only thing ive seen actually travel
across their dsl network is half life games (lord knows why, im too fucked up to figure it
out right now). Now for all you little script kiddiots out there that figure they can jack
their 1.5mbit DSL line up to a 4mbit down 640 kbit up line with windows registry tweaks or
patches are out of their fucking mind. your bandwidth is setup at your DSLAM at your
nearest friendly but nicely guarded telus CO.

2) How it works
	K, when you turn your DSL modem on, you will notice the alert light flash a couple
times. that means its posting (ive since sold my DSL modem and cant remember what color
the flases are) it will pause for a few seconds, then start flashing again for about 30sec+
this is it loading the IOS (Intergrated Operating System (or sumphin)) after this, it will
attempt to handshake with the DSLAM at the telus CO. if your line is not configured for DSL
or the line is too noisy, it will turn red, but if fate smiles, it will go green. nuff said.

3) DHCP

	DHCP is an absolutly beautiful thing. it stands for Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol. Basically, what happens, is your OS (whatever it may be) sends a broadcast
message through your ethernet card, which gets routed to Sodium.bctel.net (Primary DHCP Server)
The server then checks the MAC (Media Access Control) Adress of your ethernet card (remember
registering your computers with telus when you first got DSL? ) now, telus has implemented
somwhat of a security feature here, if your MAC Addy is not registered with their server
you are assigned an ip address on their LAN (always a 10.*.*.* address) but, if you have
registered, you will automagically be assigned a fully routeable IP address (161.184 if your
old school DSL or 142.59.*.* for all us newbies) along with your IP address you are given
the information for your DNS Servers (sodium at it again) and your default Gateway.
This is all done while your computer is booting (or for us linux people, when dhcpcd kicks
in). Now for you windows people, somtimes you will notice that windows will just seem to hang
while its booting, but its just waiting for the DHCP server to respond (more often than not
its offline or bogged to hell *shakes head*). But the great thing with DHCP, is that it means
telus can change your IP and move you around all it pleases, because you have a dynamic IP.
Now if your going to be running a domain, and want to get a static IP (pretty much a pre req)
your going to have to pay telus an extra $59/mnth (or so) just to have the same ip all the time.
sounds pretty fucking silly now doesnt it?

4) Security?

	I have a friend on Shaw Cable, in Millwoods (you know who you are) who would give
his left nut to be able to smurf (yes it still works) from his Cable modem. Shaw has gotten
somewhat smart, and from what ive seen, they have finally read the paper on smurf and how
to fix0r the routers so that you cannot send spoofed ICMP Echo Request packets anymore. This
is why Telus is my personal favourite for a broadband ISP (when its working). Telus doesnt
filter sweet fuck all. but, be careful dont let this fool you into thinking that they're
stupid, because the Telus internet security guy watching your packets go by, and red flagging
your account is far from stupid. Now lets say you happen to smurf somone, and they report the
logs from their firewall/sniffer/packet logging device to abuse@telus.net, and they check it
out they will notice that you've been up to somthing and send you a warning. you will get 3
of these (i got 2 for DDOS'in before i got smart) if you have 3 warning on your account it
will be terminated for a period of 30 days, and i belive they will also still expect you
to pay for the service for those 30 days.

5) Having Fun

	A while ago somone named The Gonz (or somthing similar) wrote an article on
'hard encoding your ip'. Honestly I still laugh to this day when i think about that.
no twit at telus is going to send the police after you for taking an IP. Now my idea works
the same way (this is where linux really shines) After you boot your computer, get your
default Gateway, it will be 142.59.*.1 (i hope =/) now write this down, its important
and for DNS servers use 199.185.220.36 and 199.185.220.52 since their much faster and
alot more reliable. Ok, So you've done that, now what? well, now you can set your IP
to anything you want (well almost) My gateway used to be 142.59.212.1 if memory serves me.
now this doesnt mean i could set my IP addy to 142.59.0.0 or 142.59.245.69 in my experence
you have 2 full class B subnets above your routers IP for you to use ex. 142.59.213.5, 
142.59.214.67 and 142.59.215.30) now, if you choose an IP address, and your net access
doesnt work period, that means that somone else is currently using that IP address
(2 machines on the internet cant share the same one) i find IP address's ending in .255
and .0 are fun to go on IRC from. when I first starting doing this, their were no
reverse DNS record set for the IP, so it wouldnt resolve. after using a certain IP for about
a couple weeks, telus would seem to put a reverse name on it (oh well, dont worry, their not
on to you) But, dont think just taking an IP and not using the one they gave you will let
you escape being caught. If they were to actually look at the packets your sending
they would find a nice little thing, that points them right to you. the MAC Address on
your ethernet card. there are supposed to be no numbers the same but its a lie. now
if you search on freshmeat.net for ethermac (i belive) you will find a beautiful little
utility for linux, what it does, is modify how packets are sent (you must be r00t)
and instead of your real MAC Address being there, its just a random one (put your next door
neighbours MAC Address in there for extra fun.)

6) Ok, when are we going to have fun?

	With my somwhat limited knowledge of exactly how the telus network is setup and
what my packets look like on their end, as near as I can figure, unless they go through
a fuckload of trouble while your sending your packets, it is hard to trace you by just
looking at the dumped TCP/IP Packets their loggers would pick up. Now, what can you do now?
well as far as i know, telus has only 1 DHCP server for Alberta, and maybe BC too. and
also how all the hapless lusers depend on that DHCP server. (after windows reboots,
or your lease expires, you will always have to get a new IP address) Now, lets say
what would happen if that DHCP server wasnt there? if it mysteriously got knocked offline
by a DDOS (namely a smurf attack) because remember, they also do not filter your packets.
Now, besides making the telus networking techs scream like little babys, there are other
things you could be doing. Mass scanning, trying to exploit a box etc. now as long as you
dont say on the same IP too long, and switch your MAC address somtimes, and dont do REALLY
stupid shit, telus shouldnt notice, or catch you. If they do, well who knows what will
happen.

7) Other fun things todo (Under linux of course silly)

	Depending on how you set your Broadcast address, and how your particular router
is setup, it is possible to put your Ethernet card into promiscuous mode and see whats going
on. (ifconfig eth0 promisc) now, as far as sniffers go, tcpdump is a nice one. it is an easy
way to find out whats going on in your network and how many subscribers there are and who is
using their DSL at the moment. their are other sniffing suits you can find kicking around on
various sites, i think there might be some on freshmeat.net, that will automagically sniff
passwords and whatnot for you, and convienently dump them into a text file for you to sort
through after a few hours of sniffing. I found in the ending days of my DSL line, a porn
site started up, and we shared the same router. now i got real lucky, since this poor SOB
had never discovered SSH, and loved to share his plain text passwords with me (sniffers are
beautiful arnt they). Anyway, somtime if your lucky, you might catch a telus tech logging
into your router to make changes and then youve got a new and very fast toy to play with.
Other things to piss off the poor people at tech support is alias your ethernet card
so that it occupies every single IP that your router services (during evening rush of course
=D, remember only 1 computer can use a IP address at the same time, or else they fight!)
you can do other things, like run a shitload of eggies off your box, all on diff IPs. Im
sure you'll find somthing fun todo, just dont make their lifes too difficult.


Anyways, I met The Clone at a party for last night, and we played crazy 8's for like 5
hours straight, and after we talked for a fkn long time, he told me i should write an
article. This is the first time i've ever written one, so if you dont like it, too bad.
Keep safe boys and Girls, and life is nothing but 1's and 0's.

	Heres a little secret ive known for a while, and its fun to play this trick on
shell providers. now, all you need is bash (Bourne Again Shell) (my fav shell btw).
now, this little trick does not give you root, nor does it give you command over anything.
its just somthing todo to be a shit disturber. Now, what you need todo is either telnet in
to your shell provider (maybe go through a wingate first duh!) and make sure your running bash.
now, all you do is type a bunch of gibberish in, but not just any gibberish. you can only
put in alpha-numeric characters (trust me on this) and definatly NO '|'s. after about half
your screen is filled with just plain jibberish, press your enter key. you will see what you
just typed scroll past your screen again, ending with bash: command not found. now, what
you do is type in about 40 !'s. thats right, a whole bunch of !!'s. type in like 10, and use
your mouse to copy and paste them. after you have 40 (or more depending) press enter.
now if you get somthing like 'bash: event not found'. that means you have an odd number of
!'s. you must have an even amount. not 39, not 41, 40 exclamation marks. Now for those of you
who put 40 (or more =D) in will see alot of gibberish fly past your screen. what !! means in
bash is to repeat the last command. and with every additional !!, the amount of text grows
exponentally. now, the fun part, is that all this text has to be read by the computer. now
since youve got all those !! adding on to each other, you can see how a line of maybe 30 
lines of just plain text, can turn into alot of text. now, if you do this correctly, you will
see text scroll by, but it will seem like it's locked. if you get returned to a normal bash
prompt, you need more !!'s. dont worry about putting in 3 pages of !!'s, remember, more is 
better. now, what happens next, is bash loads ALL this text into memory. i like to fire up
another login, in a seperate window, and fire up top on the poor unsuspecting shell box
before i hit enter. ive seen bash take up all the ram on nether.net (768MB system, 1.5GB swap)
and quite easily lag any other box to hell. bash will keep taking more and more ram, while still
using 99% of the CPU (even better if theirs multiple cpu's and you do this multiple times).
now somtimes the box will die, and not even respond to pings, other times, it will just die
and sit there, and you will not be able to ssh/telnet to it. I suppose you could use this
on a box thats hosting a bunch of eggdrops, and maybe you could drop them offline since 
bash is taking up all the available crunching power. now, next time you login, it may take
quite some time. bash has a wonderful file called .bash_history that remembers everything you
do to a certain point (thats why the up key works for recalling commands). now, for you
Admins reading this, and wanting to protect yourselfs, what you need todo is either recompile
bash from the source, and remove one of the options (RTFM), or enable user quotas which are
a good idea anyway. just set them up so that if any user is using massive amounts of ram/cpu
 time for any length of time (1 minute is good), then the pid is killed, and your box is
saved. its as simple as that. Alot of machines Ive been on show no evidence of having the
user quota's enabled. but i suppose you could setup maybe a crontab or some evil fork bomb
using pipes  to just stream random letters into multiple occurences of bash, then shove it a
bunch of !!'s, and you could have yourself a hayday. Anyways ive know about this for a long
time now, and havnt seen any mention of it anywhere else. Also make sure you log back in and
rm -rf .bash_history, because its got everything you typed in there. anyways, this is why
more people should have a basic understanding of bash, and how truly powerful it is.
I bet this might even work on shellyeah, and its not like your compiling any source, your
just using bash, your shell :].

"Straight From The Underground"
FORMER MOD MEMBER,
JOHN LEE, IS BACK...


Date: Thurs Oct 4, 2001

By: The Clone

URL: www.nettwerked.net


John Lee was no ordinary gangster punk-ass kid back in the mid-1980's, livin' it up in the
Brooklyn area of New York. He was recognized mainly as the famous b-boy named 'Corrupt',
who had seen it all... or at least he thought so. Spending some time in the penal-system as
a youth who hadn't even seen his 16th birthday, John Lee decided to trade in his guns, knives,
and negative lifestyle for something more mentally profitable and thrilling - computer hacking.

Now the computer hacking John Lee involved himself in doesn't paint a picture in any sort of
typical hacker scenario - no, sir. By the late 1980's, John Lee joined up with what eventually
became the largest organized computer hacker group on the planet. Straight 
outta 212, they were known as the Masters of Deception (M.O.D).

To give you an idea about how big the M.O.D were, high profile groups such as the
Legion of Doom considered the Masters of Deception their biggest online threat.

One night in 1990, five or six hackers in Texas, are hanging out on a telephone
conference bridge. Suddenly a new voice joins the conference in midsentence.
The unknown newcomer doesn't sound like a Texan. "Yo, dis is Dope Fiend from MOD,"
the stranger says in a non-white, non-cow tippin voice. One of the Texans responds:
"Get that nigger off the line!". Everyone falls silent. A moment later the stranger
responds to the hackers with a different accent. "Hi. This is Corrupt." Corrupt's
real name is John Lee. Corrupt lives in Bed-Stuy, New York. Corrupt is well known
and respected as a "hacker" extraordianaire. Corrupt is African-American. Cyber-War
has been declared.

Corrupt targets the slur slinger, a member of the rival Cyber Gang LOD (Legion
of Doom), who later claims he was not on during the incident. Corrupt harasses
his prey via phone...often. He switches his prey's long distance carrier. 
His prey retaliates by translating a text file titled "The History of MOD" 
(Masters of Deception) into street "jive" and places it back on the net. Corrupt's
prey claims to net observers that he isn't a bigot. He says "I have Black friends
at work". The on-line cyber war rages on.

"I started breaking into computer networks when I was 16. I did it because I liked
the thrill of it - you get all tingly. It was euphoric, like a runner's high.
We were MOD, we came out of nowhere. We were badasses who could crush anyone and
break into anything. There was a lot of stuff that, even now, I'm just like, Wow.
I've seen some stuff that could make you shit green.

"These days, most of the guys from MOD work in the tech field - security, mostly.
Yeah, I talk to them still. Why not? We had that life experience together. I'm sure
if some people crashed a plane in the Andes, then the people that survived would
still call each other from time to time. MOD was kind of like that - but we didn't
eat anybody. I think people know we got the raw end of the deal. I don't want to
minimize it, but there are people who stab people and get less time than I did."

MOD were like this creepy void that existed in cyberspace; in the BBS', packet
switching networks, private networks, and on the Internet. MOD were big and powerful
and people, specifically other hackers, knew it. Rumour has it the Masters of
Deception controlled everything - the New York City powergrid, the entire U.S
phone system, and DMV to name a few.

FBI steps in. You see, the members of MOD have been under investigation since 1989.
The indictment against the members of MOD is announced in July of 1992. The FBI
charges Corrupt with "illegal computer intrusion". Corrupt gets six months.

Today John Lee, the twenty-nine year old African-American who sort of resembles
"IceCube", is working on two Internet spinoffs: FellOff.com (coming this fall)
and MediaThreat.com (unknown release date). FellOff.com will be about celebrities
that have fallen off, put to rest with the nail in the coffin in regards to their
careers.

And finally, John Lee is in the process of writing a book, ironically called
"Why I Hate Computers".

John: "It delves into the psyche of a man whose life depends on computers, but
he's grown to despise them at the same time."

"At the end of that I'm not just a hacker. And you'll realize computers suck,
because beneath this veneer there's a deep dark side that no one knows."

Now you ask yourself: "What side of that?"

"Of course," John explains,

"you'll have to read the book to find out why." 

John Lee currently lives in New York City,
where he plans to move to California to better his life and career...
