:Dr. Klep Speaks:
 Kleptic

Hey Hey Hey!! Welcome to another illustrious installment of 'Dr. Klep
Speaks'.  As in all my other installments, I will will be discussion what
im pissed off about. Not only does this text give me a chance to tell
everyone how I think, it also lets me get my anger out! Well, I really
can't say that, because actually I dont always write about things that
piss me off. But Im hoping to discuss some music, anarchy, how I feel
about "posers", and some info on how to find virii and get rid of virii on
your home comp. And probably somemore stuff. So Enjoy your stay at the
Cafe Dr. Klep......

============================================
Punk Rock, Longest Surviving Style Of Music
============================================

When you think of Punk Rock, you normally don't think of it as the music
that has been around the longest, and people still listen to it.  Well,
for those of you that might think other wise, here is some info:

Rock and Roll is the roots of Punk Rock.. it before punk there was
alternative. Alternative was a more mellow softer version of punk rock,
they didnt want to be part of the main stream, so they stayed underground.

Punk Rock has been around since the 70's.. thats almost 30 years of punk
rock greatness.. The roots of punk started with bands such as Crass, Sex
Pistols, The Ramones, Sid Vicious.. etc.. These bands we're rocking out
with fast, 3-chord songs that made you want to jump around. Punk leaked
into the 80's with more and more bands.. Rancid, Anti-Flag, NoFX (they
started out in the 80's), Pinkerton Thugs, Bad Religion, Operation Ivy..
and a lot more bands.. Most punk rock bands in the 70's and 80's sang
about the government, telling listeners that the gov't sucks, and we
should all rebel. Now in the 90's punk rock is still big and good, but
most of the style has died.. not many punk bands express themselves by
dying there hair or putting it up in a mohawk.. now the average punk has
bleached hair and peircings, and maybe some tattoos... but all in all Punk
Rock is stronger than ever, and in its 30 year reign is the music that has
survied the longest!

=====================
Anarchy
=====================

A typical anarchist is a person who is againts the government, and who
would probably do anything to stop the government. Now most people think
anarchy is all about terrorism, and bombs.. its not.. to be a good
anarchist you need to know as much as possbile about our government. You
need to find loopholes in the constitution, and violence should still be
the last resort. Others shouldnt think of anarchists as a punk ass kid who
likes explosives, and listens to music that will destroy his mind.  The
best anarchist is a hacker/phreaker kid who studies the law, and read
alot.. So dont get mixed up the next time you hear the term "Anarchist".

=====================
Fishing For Viruses
=====================

Rather than rely on scanners, integrity checkers, virus monitors, or
heuristic analysis, some antivirus programs try to trick viruses into
revealing themselves by infecting special "bait" files.

For example, an antivirus program might include a simple .EXE and .COM
file that the antivirus program constantly watches. The moment a virus
infects one of these files, the antivirus program immediately captures the
virus's signature so it can recognize that particular virus later.

Bait files are the digital equivalent of Roach Motels. No matter what
immunities cockroaches develop against insecticides, they can always get
stuck in glue.

=====================
Virus Removal
=====================

Some antivirus programs claim they can disinfect an infected file. Then
again, some people claim they have seen Elvis. Although it is possible to
remove a virus from a file, the success rate of disinfecting files depends
on the virus and the technical abilities of the antivirus program.

When a virus infects a file, it may either attach itself to the front or
back of the file or bury itself in between. If the virus attaches to the
front or back of a file, the antivirus program can seperate the virus from
the file and then kill the virus. 

But if the virus has buried itself inside the file, removing that virus is
like curing a stomach ache by ripping out the stomach. In this case,
removing the virus physically destroys part of the file in the process,
rendering the file useless.

=============================
How Anti-Virus Programs Fail
=============================

Not all antivirus programs offer virus moniters, scanners, integrity
checkers, heuristic analysis, virus removal, or ability to create a rescue
disk.  Most offer some of these features, and those that offer all don't
always do any very well.

Despite massive advertising budgets and brand-name recognition, some of
the more popular antivirus programs are pretty lousy at catching may
viruses.

Most versions of programs, like spreadsheets and datebases, can be used
(almost) indefinitely. In fact, some people are perfectly happy using the
software they bought in the early 1980s.

But antivirus programs become obsolete about six months after release.
Because new viruses appear every day, an antivirus program older than six
months is about as useful as manual typewriter in a modern office.

Antivirus programs are extremely effective against viruses they know. But
each time antivirus companies update their programs, virus writers study
them for weaknesses and write new viruses specifically to exploit their
flaws. Because virus writers are always one step ahead of the antivirus
programmers, no antivirus program can ever guarantee that your computer is
100% free from viruses, despite their claims.
