Intro to Phreaking
================================

Phone Phreaking is about manipulating the telephone system im ways that the telephone company itself doesnt truly understand or believe is possible.

On the noblest level, phreaking is about exploring, experimenting, and learning as much as you can about the phone system out of sheer curiosity. On a more malicious level, phreaking can mean making free phone calls at somebody elses expence, denying phone service to valid customers, or wrecking telephone company equpitment.

==================
GETTING STARTED:
==================

To start phreaking, you need access to a telephone. However, phreaking from your own phone will not only cost you in phone charges, but also provide the phone company with a convenient way to track you by tracing your phone line. To be a true phone phreak, you need access to the telephone system and a way not to get billed.

The simplest method to access the phone system anonymously is through a pay phone, and the simplist way to avoid paying fo your phone calls is to use either somebody elses calling card number or a special box designed to trick the phone company computers.

=======================
Telephone Color Boxes:
=======================

A more sophisticated method for making free phone calls involves making a special telephone box that emits special tones or physically alters phone wiring, allowing you to manipulate the phone system. Soon after the introduction of the blue box for making free long-distance calls, phone phreaks created special boxes to perform different functions.

Since the phone company is liklely to frown on anyone actually building and using a telephone color box, read this warning, which appears in many text files that explain how to build boxes:
