Accessing banned web pages!
===================================

===================================

If you can't visit a banned website directly, you can retrieve it by e-mail
using a Webmail server. Just e-mail the Webmail server with the URL of the
webpage you would like to see, and within a few minutes, hours, or days
(depending on the server) the server will send you the page as HTML code.
Once you have the HTML, you can view the website's text (but not always the
graphics) on your computer. If the server returns only a sites text, you can
view the sites graphics by retrieving them with the server, by telling it to
follow the URLs for the various graphics. 

For example, to retrieve text from a website, you could send e-mail to the
webmail@www.ucc.ie site using the following:


                 To:  webmail@www.ucc.ie
                 Subject:  none

                 GO http://www.cnn.com

This tells the server webmail@www.ucc.ie to send you the webpage at
http://www.cnn.com

NOTE:  For the agora, getweb, and w3mail servers, you don't get HTML code,
you get a text version. Replace SEND with SOURCE to get the actual HTML code
for the page.

Of course, half the fun of visiting websites is vciewing their graphics. If you
want to retrieve the text and graphics from a website, use the w3mail@gmd.de
server, which can send you text and images as unencoded text. To use the w3mail
server, send a message like this:

                  To:  w3mail@gmd.de
                  Subject:

                  get -img http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/

When you decode the file you recieve (probably sent as several parts), you'll
create an HTML file and several GIF files. You can then open the HTML file
with your favorite Web browser and see the webpage exactly as it would appear
with ta "live" Web connection. 

Here are some webmail servers to try together with the text to send in the
body of your message. Leave the Subject blank in all cases.

WEB MAIL ADDRESSES                 SYNTAX TO USE
------------------                 -------------

agora@dna.affrc.go.jp              END <URL>
agora@kamakura.mss.co.jp           SEND <URL>
getweb@usa.healthnet.org           GET <URL>
getweb@unganisha.idrc.ca           GET <URL>
webmail@www.ucc.ie                 GO <URL>
w3mail@gmd.de                      GET <URL>  
Web-mail@ebay.com                  <URL>


Although time consuming, using e-mail to view the World Wide Web can help you
avoid any parental, office, or government restrictions you might face. Unless
someone takes the time to examine every e-mail you recieve, no one will likely
know that you've been accessing forbidden websites.



Thats all for now... later!
