Disable Fortres 101
===================
By - kleptic - kleptic@grex.org
===================


A lot of public schools and work places use Fortres 101 as a form of security
to pretty much keep you out of things you shouldn't be in anyway. So, here is
how you disable Fortres 101 on most computers. Unless you're network admin
already caught on to someone doing this than the admin can do something so you
can't do this anymore. But until then, have fun.



* Pull out the network cable from the network card (if you are paranoid)
* Don't log on to the network, just hit 'ESC' to get past the log-in screens
* Go into Internet Explorer
* Type in:   C:\FGC\F101\FGSA.EXE /u
* Hit enter, and wait for a DOS window to pop up that says "FGC Security will
not load when Windows starts."
* Click the "Start" button which brings up the shut down screen
* Select "Restart the Computer"
* Hold down shift while you click "OK" and keep the shift key held  down until
Windows exits.  (This will restart windows without restarting the computer.)
