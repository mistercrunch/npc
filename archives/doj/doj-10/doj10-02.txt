-City-

Everything. This city is so intense. 
Don't you grin on the moon's reflection in a puddle of blood?
You gotta love the colors swirling,
swirling in the poison-pink clouds,
the heat of a july thermal inversion.
I bet that's what it's like to be in a womb.
This city can be so, so beautiful

-UltraViolet-

The silicon crusts my eyes as i awake
to another wholesome corporate breakfast.
This time the toast is too crisp--
a friend's burnt mind
has crumbled to dust.
His feeble form rots at the Deck,
his mind just plankton
in the cybersea,
awash with sediment
of a thousand other
dissolved integrities
i ROM the sea
for mere germ of
the freedom to know
But do i rock the boat?
Mind spills over with the juice
of revolutionary idea,
every drop licked up
by the data police
and promptly disposed of
while a record is made of my
transgressions.
I atone for my sins at the great
MegaCorp altar.
It hears all and forgive all
and demands only my soul
as penance.
Orwell. Sterling. Gibson.

They washed us only in
the water of electric knowledge,
but one has come
who surrpimds us with a sea
Water, water everywhere
but not a drop to drink.
It is the new go. Everywhere.
A nanodeity that pervades
the network of our souls.
A vengeful god
indeed.
