Retrospective:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous issue - Issue #9 - of the Discordant Opposition Journal was
basically the comeback edition. I won't say it was easy to put together, but it
wasn't exactly the toughest experience. This issue I'm determined to prove it
wasn't just a case of beginner's luck. The "buzz" has somewhat died down, and
I'm still getting text submissions without asking (I've only started begging
for texts the last couple of days).

As the slightly more astute of our readers may have already noticed, we've
started expanding. When talking to Kleptic about the original idea of
rebirthing the zine, he said to me "there's no reason you should limit it to 10
files either". With this in mind, I figured that it would be better if each
issue was a more substantial read.

Among the other changes you might have noticed are the changes in graphics. The
ascii art has gone more old-school, using the original dos "tileset"
characters, which limits the viewer slightly (they must use a certain font in
order to see it correctly), but I think it's more effective. This change is
entirely experimental, if you don't like it... Voice your opinion - email
discordia@subterranea.net and let us know!

Next issue, the decision as to whether to continue expanding to maybe 30 files
per issue - or to stick to 20 - will be made entirely by the number of
submissions we get. If you have anything at all that we might find useful,
please email it to discordia@subterranea.net. We can't stress enough that we
can find a place for virtually anything, so stop worrying about if it's
relevant or crap or not!

Greets:

We'd mainly like to thank anyone who ever opened up the DoJ and read it.
Thanks also to previous staff members of the DoJ, we really miss you guys.
Finally, we'd like to thank the following organizations and groups for their
support:

               HackerzLair                     PacketStorm
        http://www.hackerzlair.org    http://packetstorm.securify.com
        #hackerzlair / irc.dal.net

             Subterranea.Net         Dutch Security Information Network
      #hacking / irc.subterranea.net        http://www.dsinet.org

Looking Forward:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next issue, we hope to continue our trend of growth. We may not get larger,
but we'd like to get to the stage where we can release on a regular basis. For
this to happen, we need more contributions (so send us your shit), and to get
contributions we need more readers. So, do us a favour, and if everyone who
reads this issue forwards it on to just ONE person, we'll achieve global
domination through media saturation in no time...

Until next issue, thanks for listening...
