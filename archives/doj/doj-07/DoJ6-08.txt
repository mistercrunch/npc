:The Girlfriend Story:
 cronus@iol.ie

 Is it hypocritical to love your girlfriend but still be infatuated
with another girl? Some would say it depends on your definition of
love. Do I love her or am I in love with her. I hope you see the
subtle difference, cause I sure don't. 

 This isn't an article on girls, we already have one of them from
the Illustrious Gangsta himself. Think of a girl as a server. As my
father used to say 'its ok to look but not touch.' The whole world 
can see her, have a look, but not everyone can touch. But the
hacker can touch, feel and enjoy her. Her being the server you'll
remember.

 I love my girlfriend, but I yearn for a change. I don't want to
abandon her, just experiment. Branch out. What is the obvious choice?
Have an open relationship. I may be young, but trust me that doesn't
work. The next best option is to go behind her back. But thats like
wiping a server's harddrive after you've rooted it simply because you
can. That is black hat hacking and unethical. No I wouldn't go behind
her back. 

 Picture my girlfriend, she is almost perfect. But the qualities she
doesn't have are embedded in the object of my spare desires. I love to
visit the server I can't have. The telnet MOTD says 'UNAUTHOURIZED
ACCESS' so you start to salivate and dream of getting inside. The cute
brunette passes as you wait for your girlfriend and your tongue rolls
out onto the ground with desire. The beauty of the unattainable.

 When I'm with my girlfriend, I'm happy. When we're apart, my eyes have
a habit of wandering. My eyes and other parts of my male anatomy. The
webserver that I run at work is nice and neat. It does what I want it
to do, it never complains and it suits me. But ever now and again I 
long for the webserver in the next office, just to compare, just to
see what I'm missing.

 Hacking a server is easy, once you've done it once the next one is
easier. You have hack as many systems as you wish without getting a
tarnished reputation, infact it will help. Women are so much more
complex. Thier intrusion detection routines involve frequent trips to
the bathroom in pairs and a gaggle of friends to reveal her whereabouts
should she vanish.

 I would urge girlfriends who read this to be both understanding and
leanient. And I urge boyfriends to indulge desires occasionally just
so you now what you've got when you have it. 

 Once last word, if your gonna do it, don't get caught. And I'm not
talking about hacking... [Cue evil genius laugh] Muhahahaha....
