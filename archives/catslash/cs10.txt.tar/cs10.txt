              '''''''''''''''File #3 of 9'''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''

One day, while I was bored with a scan, I hammered out a number and 
connected to a pager. I was bored, so I started to explore it, and 
discovered a system worth some laughs - the Skytel Pager system.

Unlike many other paging systems (Cantel for example), the Skytel 
system is networked to all the other pagers in its system. This can 
be very good for abusing the system and pissing people off.

Connecting - Finding a Number
=============================

This is fairly easy. Just dial 1-800-357-36XX. XX is any odd number 
between 0 and 15. All the odd ones are pagers. There are some pagers 
in the even numbers, but most even numbers are not in service. If you 
can't find one,or you are lame, dial 1-800-357-3603. This will be the 
number I will be using as an example for this file.

Entry Message
=============

Upon connecting you will either get a recorded message from the 
person asking you to leave a message, or you will hear the Skytel 
recording asking you to leave a message. A message in this case is 
not a voice message, but a numeric message (your phone number).You 
will then hear a beep telling you that it is ready to receive your 
message. Hit '*' to get to the main menu.

The System
==========

You are now in access to the entire Skytel pager and info system. For 
the menus, '*' is cancel and '#' is accept. The people's pagers are 
identified by a "pin" number. The pin number is their number minus 
the 1-800 (For our example, 1-800-357-3603, the pin is 3573603). To 
find the current person's pin, press '80#'. This will tell you the 
pin and all the functions you have access to.

Functions you can Access
==========================

1 - Send a normal page
2 - Time of day page
3 - Next pin (pager)
4 - Change security code
5 - Page recall
10 - Skytel Coverage Information
11 - Priority Page
12 - Cancel Priority Page
13 - Group Pager Call
16 - Enable/Disable message sequence numbering
20 - Suscriber profile functions
80 - Help
99 - Disconnect

Now your probably wondering "What the hell is all this shit?". Let me 
explain:

1. Send a Page
==============
Just enter a numeric message after the beep and press '#'. You will 
then hear a confirmation message. Hit '#' again to send to pager.

2. Time of day page
======================
Send a page telling them the date and time that you called.

3. Next pin
============
Enter a different pin number and switch to his paging system. For 
example, lets say we called 1-800-357-3601, his pin would be 3573601. 
We would enter 3573603, and we would be routed to 1-800-357-3603's 
pager.

4. Change Pager Security Code
=============================
If you wanted to change their security code, you would use this. 
First you enter their current security code (I have no idea how long 
these can be!), and enter your new one.

5. Page Recall
==============
To see all the pages the person has received, and what time they came 
in. This requires the security code.

10. Coverage Information
=========================
Enter your area code, and it tells you the boundaries of Skytels' 
Pager service. Outside these boundaries the pager will not work.

11. Priority Page
==================
Great for harassing the person. Upon entering you will first be 
prompted for the number of times the page is to be sent. The maximum 
is decided by the owner, but the default is between 1 and 5 times.

Then you are prompted for the time between pages. This too is decided 
by the owner. The default is usually between 5 to 120 minutes.

Finally, enter your numeric message followed by the # key.

12. Cancel Priority Page
=========================
To cancel your priority page.

13. Group Call
===============
Very cool! Broadcast a message to all the other Skytel pagers you can 
find the pins for. To use:
Enter it, by typing 13#
Enter the first pin number, followed by the pound (#) key.
Enter then next number followed by the # key, an so on. The number of 
pins you can enter is unlimited, however if you enter three wrong 
pins in a row, it kicks you out. Anyway, once done entering the pins 
in, hit # again. It will ask you for your numeric message. Enter it, 
and have fun with it. See if you can spell out words like FUCK YOU 
(38250968).

16. Message Sequence Numbering Toggle
=====================================
This requires the security code. This simply tells the system weather 
the owner of the pager would like his numeric messages stored (in 
order) or not.

20. Suscriber Profile Functions
================================
After entering the security code, you are presented with another 
menu. This menu controls all the user's pager settings. From here he 
can choose to have a greeting message, the amount of times a priority 
page can be sent, and all the other fun stuff.

80. Help
=========
Tells you the owner's pin and what functions are available to you.

99. Disconnect
==============
The system hangs up on you.

Other Numbers
===============
What about the functions in between on my list, like six? I don't 
know what those are for. They all say that you cannot access the 
function. These are either a place for new functions, for the Skytel 
ops, or for the pager's owner (But I doubt it). Play with them.

Conclusion
===========
So, now you can phuck with some pagers. Just think, if the Skytel 
Pager system expands (which it probably will), you will have even 
more people to piss off and more pagers to screw with. This is phun 
for all ages, and is fun when you are bored and are too lazy to 
phreak.

        Hello my terrorist bretherin, Its good to be back in the 
saddle after a nice break, but I am not saying that redbox chili 
pepper's stuff was no good, because it was great, but I had alot 
of diabolical thinking to do while I was enduring a whole shitload 
of bad marks and homework. But that is all over, I'm back, I'm bad, 
I'm a leb and I'm mad! (The insane kind of mad) But before that, 
I would like to congraduate the Lebanese Hezbollah rebels on their 
israeli ass kicking! back to business. This idea came to me a while 
ago and stuck through for a while, but it is good. 

        Okay, lets say there is some half-wit, two bit, senile 
neibourthat is constantly pissing you off, what you "could" do 
is tell him to go away, or give him a really crappy christmas gift, 
or even kill him! But NO, this is a better idea, you go for a ride 
on your preferred choice of conveyance and find "for sale" signs and 
garage sale signs, take them home, modify them in specific ways such 
as changing phone numbers, removing adressed portions and replacing 
them with arrows leading to mister asshole's house, or changing the 
phone numbers with his/hers. Then you stretegically place these signs 
on his/her front and back lawns and fences. After that run and watch
the havok! This is effective until the neibour gets a cutting edge 
security system. (oh wait, a good switch: change phone number to 
match another enemy's therefore creating double havok! Try it!)

Gasoline has many uses. It is phun at parties, phun at home, phun 
anywhere. We have already seen one, Napalm (Issue 2 I think), so now 
we will look at some more uses (and more phun).

The Origional Molitoff Cocktail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  is the favoured toy of many anarchists. Its just oil and gas in 
a glass bottle, with a gas soaked rag in the mouth of the bottle. You 
light the rag and throw. The oil makes the gas cling to surfaces, 
causing all kind of fun things to happen...

A Different Kind of Molitoff Cocktail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This comes from the Jolly Roger's Cookbook IV:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
A different kind of Molitoff Cocktail              by the Jolly Roger

Here is how you do it:

- Get a coke bottle & fill it with gasoline about half full

- Cram a piece of cloth into the neck of it nice and tight

- Get a chlorine tablet and stuff it in there. You are going to have
  to force it because the tablets are bigger than the opening of the 
  bottle.

- Now find a suitable victim and wing it in their direction. When it 
  hits the pavement or any surface hard enough to break it, and the
  chlorine and gasoline mix..... BOOM!!!!!!
 Have Fun!                                        -Jolly Roger-

Chud
~~~~
Chud is cheap, shapeable, and can burn all kinds of things.

To make it all you need is flour and gas. Fill a bowl 1/3 of the way 
full of flour. Then add gas. Stir it until you get a mixture that is 
like dough. It is done.

To use it, just light it. A cool thing you can do with this, is roll 
it into a ball, light it, and toss it into a house or car. A fireball 
will scare the hell out of anyone, and it sticks to stuff too. Just 
be careful cause it ignites really fast.

Chud was displayed at the "EME Plastique" demo last month. You 
should've been there.

Firewall
~~~~~~~~
Firewall is a cool mixture too. It is able to stick to anything and 
is highly flammable - sort of like a plastic explosive. Firewall is 
made by mixing gas and vaseline. It can be made in two ways:

1. Place vaseline in a bowl. Add gas. Stir until vaseline becomes 
   less thick and it looks like it absorbed a lot of gas. Then drain 
   off extra gasoline.

2. Heat vaseline until it is very thin. Remove from heat,add gasoline
   and stir. When they have mixed, let it cool.

This is called Firewall because it can stick to walls extremely well, 
(the vaseline makes it stick) and burns just as normal gasoline 
would. Try it out on your school's walls or on your enemies! Kill 'em 
all!

Enhanced Napalm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Napalm can be made even cooler by a few changes. Of all quick mix 
gasoline explosives, I like Napalm best because it is the closest to 
a real plastic explosive (The Canadian Army counts it as a low 
powered explosive, but it really is a flame fuel). It is shapeable, 
can be rolled into a ball, and burns like hell. Here are some ways to 
make it better:

1. For a hotter mixture, add Potassium Nitrate (Salt Peter, available 
   at IDA Drugs for pickling Meat) to the gas before adding the 
   styrofoam. With this it will burn hotter and higher than before.
2. For a cool explosion (BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF, in fact,   
   use a fuse) add Potassium Permanganate (Available in your school's
   chem lab or at a water distilling place). This will make a helluva 
   bang.

In the Jolly Roger's Cookbook, it lists another way to make Napalm. I 
won't include it here, but it is file #078 for those of you who want 
to check and go through the difficulty of the whole damn thing.

Potassium Permanganate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mix this with just plain gas. Potassium Permanganate is unstable in 
gas and will equal a film container full of gunpowder. Only add a 
little bit of gas to the Potassium Permanganate. Use a fuse and run. 
BOOM! Be careful, I heard that at last year's Anarcon a guy lost two 
fingers playing with this stuff.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~
These are only a few of the mixtures available to the anarchist from 
gasoline. These are also probably the simplest, and the cheapest. Try 
your own expiraments with gas and see what else you can find!

                             ''''''''''''
Recently I received mail describing a weird black device that 
hooks up to the phone line. From his description, I can guess that it 
is an AGT outdoor ringer. If it is not, then fuck it, I'm writing 
this file anyway...

The ringer's purpose is notify the owner when he is outside, that the 
phone is ringing. He then runs into his house and picks up the phone. 
These have been around for years, but are only found out in the 
country by farms and stuff.

Finding a Ringer
================
On farms or by cabins out in the country you will find them. They 
will usually be on the side the person's house, and sometimes on the 
person's garage. A good way to find them is to go to a place with 
lots of houses and listen for a loud ring like you hear on a rotary 
phone. Once you find it, identify the style:

Box Type
=========

  |_______________________|/_\
    |__|+ <-- Screw       |   |
    |  |<---- Line In     |___| <---- Padlock
    |  |   from phone box

These are the most popular and are used today. The ringer device is 
inside the box, as well as the wires. Sometimes the arrestor is in 
the box as well. The wires are protected by pipe. The easiest way to 
the line is the screw on the line in pipe. Unscrew it and pull the 
pipe off. Plug your beige box into the two wires inside. The 
disadvantage to this is that they will be disconnected inside, and 
notice the next time they try to place a call. They will most likely 
get pissed off and come outside to kick your ass. If the guy is a 
loser, beat him up, grab his wallet, and break into his house. You 
can use the phone from there too!

If you can get the padlock off, then open up the box. You will 
usually see a ringer device like the ones below, and an arrestor. If 
it is an arrestor, plug it into the two longest screws. If it is just 
the ringer with wires coming out, plug into either the bottom pair or 
the right pair.

The Double Ringer Type
======================

                      ||

These are the second most common type of ringer. These have two bells 
and ring VERY loud. To phreak the line, just cut the lower wire. Plug 
your beige box into the two wires inside.These are set up like an 
extension on the line, so when you cut it, they will not notice.

The Single Ringer Type
=======================

          ________     
         /        \   
        /   ___    \

      |_______________|
            ||
            ||<---- Line in from arrestor
            ||

These are the same as the double ringer type, except that the bottom 
wire may also be mounted in the back of the ringer, through the wall.

Some Pointers:
==============
- Many lines in the country use pulse, so make sure your beige box 
  can do pulse!
- All calls will be long distance, so remember to dial '1'
- Watch out! People out in the country usually have dogs! Look before
  you phreak or Lassie will bite off your ass!
- This is like usual beige boxing, so don't call any friends or they 
  will get you when Telus finishes questioning them.
- If you can't find one, there are always easy to find and open phone 
  boxes out in the country anyway.

\                    Getting People's Zterm Passwords               /
 \                            By: Bungie                           /
  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 10, May 1997______________/ 
              '''''''''''''''File #7 of 9'''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''
Many Mac users use the ZTerm program for calling BBSs. In ZTerm, in 
case the user forgets, there is a box for them to enter their 
password and username. The password is echoed with dots. Now, if you 
are on a mac BBS, or on a computer who's accounts you would like to 
access (like your school's accounts), use this technique to get the 
information. What we are targeting is the file called 'ZPhoneList' 
that is with ZTerm.

On a mac BBS, if you can, hack it and download this file. If you 
can't, try to get the sysop to send it to you. Just say you would
like the numbers of the BBS he calls. You would be surprised how
many dumb fucks fall for it (of course they think you can't get their
password since there are only dots, and try to look superior).

If you are on their computer, just copy it onto a disk, or, if the 
have ResEdit, do the next set of instructions:

Open ResEdit. It will either bring up an open dialog automatically, 
or you may have to choose 'open...' from the 'File' menu.
Find the file called 'ZPhoneList', in the same folder as ZTerm. 
Double click on it, or click on it and hit the return key.

You will now see a window with a bunch of icons and names under them. 
Find the 'STR#' Resource. It will be the only icon with a bunch of 
horizontal lines on it. Double click on it.

You will see three columns. On with 'ID' on top, the other with 
'Size' on top, and the third with 'Name' on top. The first two 
numbers (ID#'s 0 and 256) are system info, all the numbers after that 
(ID#'s 3000 and up), make up the target's dialing list. Look at the 
'Size' column. Any numbers over 30 will contain a username and 
password. Numbers in the size column below 30 will just have the 
phone number.

Double click on the one you want to open. You will see a window with 
'NumStrings 10' in it, some numbers, and some blank text entry 
fields. Number '1)' is the phone number for that BBS. Now scroll 
down. Number '6)' is their login name. Number '7)' is their password. 
Now all the info is yours! Shows that bastard something or two! Now 
call the BBSs, log in with his names, and phuck around.

Of course, if the person is not stupid enough to enter this 
information, you will not get it. But what the hell, there are a lot 
of dumb people out there!
