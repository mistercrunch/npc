This is our April issue! It has been long awaited by some, as this 
issue contains no real useful files. These files are created to be 
funny to all the anarchists out there. Ok, so it was a pretty good 
idea then. But hey, its here now, so what the hell.

It would be also good to know that trying stuff in this issue could 
KILL you, as it is untested and probably dangerous.

So, which files are real? Files #1 (This file) and everything after 
the Top Ten (File 6).

Even so, I have posted idiot warnings on top of the files, so that
the faggets who don't read my intros figure it out.

So, on with the April Fools issue.... Have Phun :-)...

  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 9, April 1997_____________/ 
              '''''''''''''''File #3 of 6''''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''

The tale of Poison ice's computer is a tale that spans centuries, but 
takes place now, even though it is now being written on a mac, it is 
still accurate in detail, and now without a hitch the story is 
brought to you by the good people at catslash magazine. now to the 
story.... 


        It was a full moon when it became time to transfer the articles to 
catslash studios, so it was time to turn on the computer (if you 
could call it that). Both I and bungie were preparing the computer 
for transfer of files when we realized what we needed, A firestaff, a 
lightning wand, a demons head, and the star of rasamind, ajewel of 
untold power. Now you can't just go into IGA and buy these things, 
you have to find these things each and every time you need them 
because they teleport to some unknown place after each use. So we 
were on the trail using the enchanted map to find each of the objects 
required. 

First on the list was the firestaff, it waas said to be inside the  
largest of fire caves inside the mountains, The obsticales were 
harsh, first we had to battle the super deadly fire trolls, who shot 
ice out of their hands (go figure), we attacked using water guns and 
other various c.a.t.s devices, but they werent effected very well, so 
we simply threw down some smoke bombs and ran towards them, we jumped 
over them! Bungie grabed the firestaff and we were on our way, firing 
wristrockets behind us. But  the fire trolls persisted shooting ice 
and throwing rocks, but two wristrockets soon took out the ridges 
above them, they were buried under half a ton of rock, they were 
unstable rocks of course but that isn't important. we had succeeded 
in achieving the recapture of the firestaff now the lightning wand 
was next. 

The second task would prove to be one of the most mentally chalenging 
tasks yet, it  was placet upon the highest point in the land, but 
first we had to get past the maze of the gargoyles, but we were 
pretty lazy that day so we used the firestaff to burn down the entire 
hedge maze, (you don't know how lazy we could get, belive me) 
so we approached the lightning altar, only the really pissed off 
gargoyles behind us, but thanks to the brilliant efforts of poison 
ice the gargoyles ran off wimpering, he had used some bolt bombs, 
those being capable of producing hiigh sound, but anyway to get the 
lightning wand we had to solve the puzzle of the bshanti, but like I 
said we were pretty lazy so we stole the wand and ran but not without 
spray painting c.a.t.s on the alter. 

Fortunatley we already had a gargoyles head so we figured that was 
close enough, we had returned to the computer and started the work we 
had hooked the cauldron to the rock pile, this way we could see what 
we were doing, we were using the star as a paperweight so we had 
everything. We had plugged in the firestaff into the slot when a 
panel had opened, we put the gargoyles head inside the space and it 
closed as suddenly as it opened. "align the runes for the windows 
program" Bungie yelled, when poison aligned them correctly the 
cauldron smoked, it had "ye old windows programme" two minutes later 
we reaaligned the runes and the cauldron said " ye olde terminal 
programme". Poison ice yelled " The time of transference is at hand, 
ahahahahahahahahahha!, complete the transfer!" "We haven't started 
yet dumbass, well start now." replied bungie. as we slammed the 
lightning wand into the slot, a beam had fired from the top of the 
wand and after a few seconds had stopped as all parts glowed and 
teleported away we knew that it was done, my articles were 
completley sent to catslash studios. the mission was over. 

                                 THE END
