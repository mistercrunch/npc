   Welcome to  the first issue of CATSlash magazine  dedicated to 
Phreaking, Hacking and other Anarchy like material. We will be 
publishing it monthly (or every second month if there is not enough 
information or testing time) in TXT format so Mac, Atari, and PCs can 
read it. There also may be a better version available for Macs in 
Docmaker format (if we get it out).
  We are reader supported, so if you write an article or phile that you
would like published in this magazine (and it is suitable) we will
publish it.Articles can be mailed to CATS on the Bethlehem Board.
(see the add at the end of the magazine). Distribute our magazine! 
Send it wherever. The more who read it, the more people will know.
Our main puprose is to inspire people to try these ideas.
  Now a bit about our names:If anyone starts using our names on boards
and stuff we will get really pissed off.Don't be a Lamer and think 
up your own name.If you take a piece of this magazine, leave our 
names in the article as they are.Otherwise, we have nothing else 
to say on the subject of aliases.

    Below is the table of contents, every month we will have at least 
one Hacking/phreaking article, one weapon/explosive article, and one 
Anarchist article.Plus, Poison Ice's Top Ten.We will also throw in 
some other articles, and if people mail us, theirs too.

|                 Building The Beige Box                  |

-----------------------------------------------------------
        For all you people that want to be able to use someone else's 
        phone or tap into their lines, heres how: The Beige Box 
        (you may also have heard it called the Modu-Box, but this 
        is the more popular name). The phone company uses something 
        like them to check lines called a lineman's handset, 
        basically, thats what this is.

Great! how do I build it?
-------------------------

Take a phone, we used a code-a-phone (keys and mouthpieces in one
rectangular unit), try to keep it touch tone (although the phone
company uses rotary dials) and plug it into a modular jack (like the
ones in your wall, except this is not in your wall) Then find the 
screws marked R or T (for Ring and Tip). Screw in a wire in each,
preferably Red for R and Green for T (those are the colors the phone 
company uses).Then fasten alligator clips on the end of the wires. 
In the end it should be like this:

Phone - 000
Wire - ---
Alligator Clip - <
Modular Jack - ()

000------()---------<
000      ()---------<

If you want it to look more professional, wrap the modular jack in
electrical tape, I once tricked a guy into thinking there was some 
complex circuitry inside.

Usage...
---------
To use the box, find a phone box and open it up. In it there will be 
lines running in with bunches of wire. Match two wires like Blue and 
white, these are one "pair".Strip a part of the wires . 
One is Ring (red) one is Tip(Green) switch around untill you get 
a dialtone, then use it like a regular phone. Another way is to go 
to to someone's house. Find their gas meter. Beside it there will be 
a silver pipe with an oval shaped end like this:
 _
( ) Open it up and you will see a black wire.Strip it.
|-| You will see your red and green wires inside.
| |
| |

Tapping
-------

When the guy is in a conversation, pick it up and listen in.Just 
don't make any noise.

Trouble
-------

If the guy picks up while you are boxing, just hang up.He will most
likely think he missed a number and dial again. If you do get busted,
most people will settle for the price of the bill you gave them. 
If the phone company catches you it is trouble.A tip: put scotch 
tape over the door.If it is broken when you come back, get away 
from there!!! Also watch out for suspicious looking people. We once 
had a phone company guy in his own car continually drive around the
block watching us, thinking we hadn't noticed him!

Well thats all. If your really into it and want a professional 
lineman's handset, steal one from a Phone Company truck. Have Phun!!!

|                           Cable Box Fun                           |
|                             by:Jeriatrick                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The first thing to do is find a cable box outside an enemy's  
   house. These are everywhere and in many shapes and sizes 
   and are usually light green or grey. Some may need a 7/16 hex 
   driver to open.Open it.Inside it should look like this:

HHHHHHHH - splitter box (big and grey)
!!!- Main cablevision input (thick black wire, reads CABLEVISION)
| - Small cable line (thin black wires read PROPERTY OF whoever)
--- - also small cable line
(really crappy text drawing)

                      ||||||||
                      ||||||||
                      HHHHHHHH
                        !!!

   The main cablevision input is the line from the cable company 
   (it is a very thick black cable marked CABLEVISION with serial 
   numbers). The splitter box splits the signal from the Cablevision
   input out to smaller lines (the splitter box is big and grey with 
   cable connectors sticking out of it).From the sp
   litter box runs 
   the smaller cable lines (marked PROPERTY OF whatever company).
   These run to houses. The address is usually marked on white tabs 
   on the lines.These unscrew from the splitter box.
   Now to set to work.To get free cable:
1.buy a 2-way cable splitter from a Dollar store
2.Find your box
3.Take the line of someone who is paying for cable and attach the 
2-way splitter's input end to the Splitter box in the cable box.
(do this when they aren't watching TV or they will come out to inspect)
4.Attach yours and his lines to the output ends of the 2-way splitter
5.Close up the box and watch TV

   It should look like this:
HHHHH-Main splitter box
III - 2-way splitter
--- - your cable
**** - neighbours cable
^^^^ - 2-wat splitter cable

H^^^^IIII--------
H    IIII********
H
H

   Another way is just to attach your line back onto the splitter box,
   but when they do a ratings sweep, you might be found.

To get Pay-TV, switch your line with someone getting Pay-TV. This 
is especially effective because when the cable people open it and 
see everythings attached and OK they miss it.

Revenge
-------
    To disconnect someone's cable:
1.Find their box and their cable line
2.Cut it near the bottom of the box and in many pieces
3.Close up the box
If it is cut up too badly, the cable company will have to 
replace the whole line which could mean digging up the victim's 
whole yard...

To dissconnect the cable, but make everything look ok:
1.Disconnect his cable from the splitter box
2.Take out the Copper wire that sticks out of the middle so that it 
doesen't stick out at all
3.Screw the line back in
This will give them fuzzy or no reception at all, and the cable 
people won't even notice it.
These ought to help with your knowledge of the TV systems, and give 
you something to do too!

|             Basic Prank Calls With no Money                       |                             
|                             By:Jeriatrick                         |                                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since people can be traced, prank calls must be done in a way 
    that can't be traced.A number rerout box would be fine, but they
    can cost A LOT of money. Boxing works, but it is a lot of trouble
    and some people might not want to build/use a box.So heres some 
    suggestions:

A Payphone
----------
Do these in sequence or by themselves, it works.

1.Make a collect call (use the AGT long distance 0-403-XXX-XXXX 
(X being the number you are calling).Say a normal name like John.When
 the person picks up they will ususally accept the charges.
 Swear loudly.

2.If they won't accept the charges keep making collect calls.
When it asks for a name - swear or make some crap up.He won't accept
the charges, but by the tenth time he will let his answering machine
pick up.

3. Call collect by dialing straight '0'. Then the operator will say
your name, and the victim won't reconise your voice.He may accept
charges (even after doing #2).Swear loudly.

4.If you get his answering machine, let it pick up your name
(say your name is Fuck Off) or convince the operator to let you 
leave a message or your number. Sooner or later he may even disconnect
his machine.

5.Call the phone repair service (611).Say that he's been vandalizing
 phones, and you followed him home.Give them his address.
 DON'T GIVE HIS NAME OR NUMBER.Remember keep cool and make up 
 answers to their questions.

6.Call collect.Use the payphone number as your name.See if he calls

7.If he pays for call block or call display, it helps out the 
phone company and him. Find another payphone or get into boxing.

Remember, if he traces the call, he dosen't know it is from a 
payphone, only the phone company knows. Plus he gets charged $3.00 
for each trace.

With a Dead or stolen Cell Phone
--------------------------------
 With a "dead'(not hooked up to any service) or stolen cell phone, 
 the fun is endless. TIP: you can still dial all numbers with 
 *XXX (three digit star numbers) even when you are not hooked up.
 This is for hookup assistance, but we can still call the radio 
 station (Power 92 at *925).

1.dial *611 and harass the operators

2.dial *611 and bullshit with the operators for information or 
for fun. Then when they are about to catch you yell something 
obscene and hang up.Poison Ice kept an operator on for about an 
hour with a story about flying to the US and giving his son his 
phone.These operators can trace you, so make sure it is not 
registered in your name. 

3.Make a collect call from *611. Some operators will do it for you.
Then prank away.

4.Call *611 at one o'clock in the morning. Say you are having 
phone problems. Then say you battery is going dead and to please 
call you back at your home number.Give them your victim's number.
The victim will wake up to the phone, only to have to explain to
 AGT that he dosen't even own a Cell.

5.Call and harass other *XXX numbers.

6. If the operators say they are tracing you, ask them questions 
about the trace, eg: How long does a trace take? Who am I then? 
How do you trace a call?

Remember: They say they can trace your location, but they can't 
unless they drive up and down the blocks with a scanner, so don't 
worry.
Well thats all for now. Have Phun.

|                  Hairspray Gun Plans                              |
|              Brought to you by Jeriatrick                         |
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I picked up this article from a gun enthusiast not too long ago.

Potato Bazooka Plans
--------------------

You may want a couple of buddies to go in buying the material with
you, or make 3 at the same time, as the pipe comes in 10 foot chunks.
I bought all material at a local "Home Depot" for about $15.

Note on choice of material:
I have seen and heard of plans for spud guns using PVC pipe.  
In fact, an article in the February issue of "Modern Gun" uses PVC.  
I chose to use schedule 40 ABS plastic.  The black pipe usually used 
for sewerage.  If you want to know why I chose ABS, take a chunk of 
PVC pipe.  Hit it with a 25 lb sledge hammer.  It fragments into 
many *sharp* pieces.  Try this with ABS.  The sledge hammer bounces
off the pipe and smashes into your foot.  But it didn't break!
(The pipe, that is, I don't know about your foot).  PVC also gets 
brittle with exposure to sunlight.  ABS just gets
hot.  Only ever use schedule 40!  That's the thick stuff.  
It costs a little more, but not that much more.

The bill of material says 10 foot lengths, only because that's as 
small a piece as is normally sold.

Bill of material:

1       10 foot piece of 2 inch diameter schedule 40 ABS pipe
1       10 foot piece of 3 inch diameter schedule 40 ABS pipe
1       3 inch to 2 inch reducing bushing
1       3 inch coupling
1       3 inch threaded (one side) coupling
1       3 inch threaded end-cap 
1       can ABS solvent-weld pipe glue.  NEVER USE PVC GLUE on 
        ABS!!!
1       Coleman sparker - these are easily found in any 
        sporting goods store that has a decent camping section.
        They are normally made for putting inside a Colman 
        lantern or stove so you don't need matches.

Step 1 - Cut the combustion chamber to size.  Cut off a 14 inch  
         section of the 3 inch diameter pipe.  You don't need
         the rest of the 10 foot length, so save it for future
         bazookas, or make one with a 
         couple of buddies splitting the cost.

Step 2 - glue the 3inch to 2 inch bushing into one side of 
         the 3 inch coupling, glue the other side of the 
         coupling to one end of the 14 inch combustion chamber.
         Make sure the joints are clean first 
         and be liberal with the glue.

Step 3 - glue the threaded coupling to the other end of the 
         combustion chamber (using the slip-joint side, 
         obviously)  make sure the glue doesn't run into 
         the threads.

Step 4 - Cut the "barrel" to size.  Cut off a 36 inch 
         (3 foot) length of the 2 inch pipe.  Glue this into 
         the other end of the bushing you've 
         glued to the combustion chamber.  You should now 
         have the complete gun, but it's not ready for firing
         just yet.

Step 5 - Using a file, taper the "muzzle" for the last half 
         an inch on the outside.  This will serve to cut the 
         potato as it's rammed in.

Step 6 - You'll need to mount the sparker inside the end cap.  
         If you got the Coleman one, it is threaded and has 
         two nuts with it.  There is also an angled piece of 
         metal meant to hold the ignitor inside a lantern.
         Take the knurled knob off the end of the shaft.  
         Be careful - there's an extra flint inside the knob.  
         Unscrew the nut and discard the angled bit of metal.  
         Drill a hole dead center in the ABS end cap of a diameter
         to take the shaft of the ignitor.  Mount the ignitor 
         inside the end cap, put the nut on the outside of the 
         shaft and tighten until the ignitor is held in place.  
         The shaft will slide back and forth, but won't come out.
         Put the end knob back on and tighten the lock screw.

Step 7 - Make sure the glue has "cured".  I left mine overnight 
         before firing.

Step 8 - make a ram rod.  I used surplus 1/2 inch PVC pipe, 
         4 feet in length.  A broomhandle, etc. will do.  
         Measure and make a mark about 2 feet 8 inches down 
         the ram rod.

To fire:
remove end cap.
Ram a potato from the muzzle end.  The tapered end will cut the 
potato to size. Make sure it has a good seal as you ram it down 
with the ramrod.  Ram to the mark you made.  I've found most 
misfires happen when there are gaps between the potato and the 
barrel where gasses can escape.   Spray 2 - 5 seconds worth of 
cheap hair spray (white rain, aqua net)   I'd use an "unscented" 
one if you can, or the gun stinks after a few shots!   Start at 
2 seconds and build up!
After the hair spray, quickly screw in the end cap.
One twist of the ignitor knob sends the spud skyward!

Safety:
Once you shoot this, you'll see the potato comes out with enough 
force, you wouldn't want to be on the wrong side!  Usual safety 
about pointing the muzzle etc. still apply.
This is for fun only.  I don't make any guarantee you won't 
blow your arse off.  (You may laugh it off, however).  Personally, 
I'd never use acetylene, starting fluid (ether), black powder, 
lighter fluid, gasoline etc. as a propellant, but 
you may not value your body parts as much <g>.

You can get 3 shots off a big spud.  Partially baked ones are 
fun - they seal in better and shoot farther, but they do break 
up and the barrel is a mess to clean up afterwards.

Clean up:  soap and water.  Push a small towel through 
(here's a case where it's OK to clean from the muzzle).
I've been shooting mine since 12/94 and have been having a 
barrel of laughs.  The spuds will go nearly 200 yards!  
I plan to make the "220 swift" variety by coupling a one inch 
barrel to the three inch combustion chamber.  
I wonder if you put the barrels on threaded couplings you could have 
interchangeable barrels.  Sort of an "Idaho Contender".

Other tricks:  ram in a cardboard container from McDonalds from 
an order of large fries.  Leave the fries in the container.  
The cardboard serves as a sabot and voila - a shotgun!  

They don't make much noise, so I fire mine in an empty field at the
end of my street.

Warning:  These things have a tendency to attract every 8-12 year old
boy  in the neighborhood.

Have fun!

- Remember: Anything that can fit in the barrel snugly will fire!

|                  Tapping into Cordless Phone Signals              |   
|                               by: Jeriatrick                      |                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Heres how to tap into the cordless phone signals. *NOTE*:Not Cellular
phones, just the ones that you can walk around your house with.There
are three easy ways.

The first - Get one of those Fisher Price baby monitors. We want only
the receiving end. Set it to C. Now turn it on and ride around your
neighbourhood.This dosen't work with all the cordless phones, but 
with a lot. The nice thing about this style is you can pick up a 
very clear signal.You can also use one of those $10 kids walkie 
talkies, but they don't pick up as good.One thing you will notice 
though is that when the walkie talkie's send button is pressed it 
will cause interference and sometimes what you say will appear on 
their phone.That is because they all work of FM.

The second - For the older phones, is a bit tougher. Get an AM radio
and open it up. Find the small plastic box inside and adjust the 
screws (not too much at a time) you want to try to get the frequency
down a few thousand KHz.If it desen't work, find the little silver
boxes with the colored screws on top and play with them.

The Third: Buy some expensive walkie talkies (eg.the $60 ones from
Radio Shack).Make sure they are FM.Open it and play with the little 
silver boxes with colored screws, or if you are really into 
electronics and really need this, change the crystal...

Well, those are my tips on tapping cordless phones. There are other
ways, but I either haven't heard of them yet, or decided it wasn't
worth it to include them in this article.

   A lot of chemicals required in explosives and such are sold under 
   brand names or are made from things easier to get. This saves a 
   lot of money, as well as  saving you the trouble of going to a 
   chemical store and signing the forms and shit.So I made a list. 
   Actually most of this list comes from the Jolly Roger Cookbook, 
   so he should get a lot of the credit. We just added in things 
   here and there. This will be a base for the next few issues so 
   you can look up the ingrediants here.

Whatever you can't find you can always try to get at a drug store. 
Here in Edmonton I suggest IDA Drugs. Their prices are steep and go 
up with demand (so don't all go to the same one) but they offer 
quite a lot of chemicals. Otherwise you can go to a Chemical Store 
(like the Edmonton Chemical Wharehouse).You can also read up on how
to make certain chemicals in later issues of this magazine.

        This column will be on how one would get revenge
on a teacher, yes, a teacher. Note that they are the darkest
form of evil in the universe as we know it, but they can be
terrorized easily and enjoyingly, it's just a matter of how you
approach the blood sucking faggots. When I started harrasing
my math teacher, I started simple, I looked up the name in the
phonebook( remember to find out the first name) and showered
him with prank calls untill the bastard changed his phone no.
personally you can annoy your teacher any way you desire
but first you must start simple,dont let your rage get ahead
of your concious thoughts. Send in your idea's to the bbs listed
at the end of the magazine.
