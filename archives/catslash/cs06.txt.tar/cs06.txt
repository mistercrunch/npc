~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the January 1997 issue of CATSlash! We hope you had a cool
New Years, but now its time to get back in the spirit of destruction.

We have changed a lot of our since December, so don't be surprised at
the difference. This will probably be the last change we are planning
for the magazine's graphics. We hope you enjoy them.

Poison Ice also bugged me to add a new feature to file #9. After the
CATSlash Top Ten, there is now the 'Question of the Month'. These
questions serve no actual purpose, and DON'T require really good
answers, actually, we want the most creative answers!

Tymnet may appear in a lot of future articles, so I will be teaching 
some of you about it here.

What is Tymnet?
"""""""""""""""

Tymnet is a world wide computer network, which a person can dial in 
from any city in North America and use it to access other networks,
like Delphi, Compuserve and BIX.

Sounds Cool! How do I call it?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You need your local number (there is a the Alberta numbers after this)
or the Tymnet WATS number. To find your number, call: 1-800-872-7654 and 
ask the operator, or call Delphi's registration service at: 1-800-365-4636, 
and fill in the info (false of course! We only want to access their number
list. Here's a list of Canadian numbers:

Logging in
""""""""""

OK, now to log in. Call your local number. Upon connecting you will see:
Please type your Terminal identifier>

or a string of garbled characters. You now enter a letter.
(This is from the INFORMATION Command)

   A  for PC's and CRT terminals (SAVE parity)
   C  for 300 baud Impact Printer Terminals
   E  for Thermal Printer Terminals like the SILENT 700 series
   F  for BETA transaction terminals
   G  for the GE Terminet at 1200 baud
   I  for 300 baud Thermal Printer Terminals
   K  for EVEN/ODD parity terminals  (future implementation)
   O  for MARK/SPACE parity terminals (BBS access)
   Y  for 300 baud Transaction terminals

You should just type 'o' also make sure you do not press return. Just
type in the letter.

Now you will see:
-XXXX-XXX- <------- [That is the Tymnet port you connected to]
PLEASE LOG IN:

This is where you enter the name of a company or service on tymnet. Some
companies require only a login name. You type it in, and your connected.
To test this type 'delphi'.

Sometimes, however, after entering the login name, it will ask
PASSWORD:

If it asks this, and you never got the password from a phriend, then its
fun to find. Tymnet passwords are 8 digits long, so you can try to crack
them. They can only use numbers and letters, so there are no special
characters used.

You only get three login attempts before it logs you off, so finding
the password is difficult simply because you have to continually
call them back.

Anyways, when you type in the service name (and possibly the right password)
you will see some connetion info, like 
DELPHI - CALL CONNECTED

Now you simply use or abuse the service. A list of services and how to access
them is available below.

Usernames/Services
""""""""""""""""""

Here's what you type, and a bit about each service:
<Listed in alphabetical order!>

BIX

Gives you access to BIX Informational Services. BIX is the one of the best
ways to get free internet. After connecting type in 'NEW'. Fill in all the
information (you don't even need a valid credit card number) and they give
you instant access to the internet and all file areas. The only drawback to
this is that some accounts last weeks, where some last only minutes, because
their credit card guy is almost always on patroll checking new accounts. To
avoid him log on in daytime hours (it is very busy then). Its difficult,
but its free!

COMPUSERVE

Gives you access to the Compuserve network. For some reason, logging into
Cserv's external hosts sometimes does not work. For more info on Compuserve,
see issue #2, and maybe some later issues.

CITIBANK

Citibank's Home banking services. I don't know the password though.

DELPHI

Accesses Delphi. Delphi is an internet provider, with many other services.
To get access dial 1-800-326-5476. Fill in false information, and put in
a stolen or generated credit card number. There is a 24-36 hour
verification period after this.

DELSLIP

Delphi's SLIP/PPP access. For use with Netscape and such. Register with
the DELPHI command first.

DPAC

This is for Datapac network access. After you must type in the proper data.
See 'Using DPAC' below this list.

HOMEBANKLA
Password:HOMEBANKSF

This accesses Bank of America's Home banking system. Homebank login name
works like so HOMEBANKXX (I put in LA above). The X's are the city near
you. I put LA for Los Angeles. The password is same as above, except it
is the second closest city (SF- San Fransisco). There are no Canadian
abbreviations that I know of.

For more information on hacking this system, find the file by Dark Creaper,
calles HOMEBANK.TXT. It gives a lot of information on it and is located on
several H/P/A websites and boards.

INFORMATION

Connects you to Tymnet information. From here you can look up numbers and
other Tymnet related stuff. I suggest reading their info.

MCIMAIL

Connects you to the MCI Mail nework. I think these guys are actually
a valid PSN.

NET

Connects you to Newsnet. I think this service belongs to the 
Washington Post.

NEWSNET

Connects you to Newsnet. Same as above...

PASSWORD

If you were a business with a service on Tymnet, you would type this
to change your password.

PRODIGY

Displays message: 'host not available thru net'. A firewall on
Tymnet? Hmmmmmm...


WIDNET

Connects you to Widnet. You can register through Delphi's registry
service, by typing "widnet" as your registration password.

I will upload a better host list to Bethlehem in the future.

Utilities:
""""""""""
   ^H    - control H - Enter Half Duplex mode - disable echo!!
   ^I    - control I - Build optimal circuit for Interactive traffic
   ^P    - control P - Force EVEN Parity
   ^R    - control R - Enable host backpressure X-on X-off
   ^U    - control U - Force terminal data to uppercase
   ^V    - control V - Build optimal circuit for Volume traffic
   ^W    - control W - Erase login up to last terminator
   ^X    - control X - Enable terminal backpressure X-on X-off
   ^Z    - control Z - Disconnect/Logoff
   ESC   - escape    - Discard login and get NEW please log in prompt
   BREAK - break     - Switch to CCITT X.3 X.28 X.29 PAD 

Using Datapac
"""""""""""""
Datapac is a usual PSN (Packet Switching Network), that is run by
Bell Canada. Datapac used to be only available in Canada, but through
Tymnet is now world wide. I don't know much about using Datapac, or
even logging in. The login process below is from another file by 
Byte Brain (The <R> is for RETURN):

1. DIAL-UP TYMNETE)

2. ENTER YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER

3. AT THE "PLEASE LOG IN:" PROMPT, ENTER THE LOG-IN COMMAND, SPECIFYING:
THE DATAPAC NETWORK (DPAC), A SEMICOLON (A SECOND SEMICOLON WILL ECHO AT
YOUR END) , THE DATAPAC NETWORK IDENTIFICATION CODE (3020),
THE 8-DIGIT HOST ADDRESS AND <R>.

E.G., DPAC;;3020HOST ADDRESS <R>

IF YOU NEED TO ENTER FUTHER USER DATA ENTER A COLON AFTER THE HOST
ADDRESS THEN A <R>.

E.G., DPAC;;3020HOST ADDRESS:USER DATA.     <R>

5. DATAPAC WILL THEN DISPLAY A MESSAGE OR CHARACTER TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE ON-LINE.

Warning
"""""""

When you try to access someone's passworded account, and you fail
three times, it will log you off. There is a rumor that it also runs
an ANI (They find your number) when this happens. I believe this
and warn you to be careful. I have never seen anyone busted by this,
but it may bring unwanted attention.

Conclusion
""""""""""

This is an important service, used by many hackers. You can access
external boards and hosts, and the hosts cannot trace you (as far as
I'm told).

  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 6, January 1997!__________/ 
              '''''''''''''''File #3 of 9'''''''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''
A cherry bomb is easy and inexpensive to make, and gives you hours of
quality phun. All you need is:

1 Ping Pong Ball
1 Fuse (Soak a string in gas or Potassium Nitrate + water)
some black powder (empty a few shotgun shells)
some nail polish (not needed but will greatly improve)

1. Ok, now take the ping pong ball and poke a hole in it. Then, fill 
   it with black powder, until it won't take any more.

2. Place in fuse, then cover the entire ball with nail polish.

3. You may also want to tape the outside of the ball very tightly,
   to ensure an explosion.

There we go. This works quite simply because the gunpowder in the ping
pong ball will cause it to blow up, and the nail polish ensures  a
good seal and also will cause the bombs' remains to ignite and burn.
The tape will just give it extra tight packing and sealing, and will
cause a better boom.

This is an especially good toy for anywhere where a loud noise could
be fun. These do not have the potential to be used destructively,
although I have heard of guys getting burned severly and one losing a
finger joint, so once lit, don't hold on to them. Some places you
could use them are:

- In school, anytime!
- When driving by someone on the road (throw it at their car's 
  windshield or at pedestrians)
- If you have a slow burning fuse, leave it on the bus
- In someone's mail box, or even better, in one of those mail slots
  where the mail goes through the front door!

As you can see, these have many uses...

Hello everybody, this particular vengance information was actually 
written by RedboxChiliPepper, it was sent to me by the nice ol' boys 
at anarchy presses a while ago, sure its...AMERICAN! But I salute 
them, they invented random violence and the need for modern vengance.
So here we go. 

How to use the newspaper classifieds to annoy your enemy, 
basically almost every newspaper out there lets you call in 
an ad you want to have put in the newspaper and they'll 
send you a bill for it. In other words, its free. Call the 
paper and tell them you are (enemy's name here) and you 
want to put in an ad in the paper. Have something ready 
like, "nice 3 bedroom, 2 bath, garage, den, dining room, 
great neighborhood, $300/month, $200/deposit." Compare your 
ad to the others in the "for rent" section and be sure  
that yours is the very best deal in there. 

As a phone number to call and inquire about the house,
leave two. "call (enemy's name here) anytime 24 hrs. at
487-5485 or 485-5877." The first being his work number and
the second being his home. Now when an awesome deal like you've put 
in the paper is seen, it gets a tremendous 
response. I'm talkin' about his phone ringing constantly 
for two days straight at the least. 

He'll get in big trouble with his boss for recieving 2 
billion calls. Even if he's able to convince his boss that 
he wasn't responsible , he'll still look bad. I mean, what 
would your boss think about all this happening? If he still
lives with his parents, he would still get in a lot of 
trouble with them too. 
                       *end of paragraph* 

I got a whole shitload of stuff from anarchy presses from 
this guy and I will probably show more of this genius's 
work. for now I leave you with these words, HACK THE 
PLANET!!

\                     The Lightening Arrestor                       /
 \                         By: Jeriatrick                          /
  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 6, January 1997!__________/ 
              '''''''''''''''File #5 of 9'''''''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''
There is an amazing device that runs your lines when they enter your
house, called the ligtening arrestor. Now I will explain its uses to
all of you.

Finding it
~~~~~~~~~~
Find out where your phone line enters your house. Then go into your
basement (I have never seen it anywhere else) and look for a black
square object with five screws coming out, and red, yellow, green
and black wires attached. It will also usually have a tag reading:
WARNING! THIS IS A LIGHTENING ARRESTOR. DO NOT COVER.
It looks like this:

*         *
     *
*         *

If you see any of these things. You have found it.
The wires are your standard Red-Ring Green-Tip Yellow-Auxillary
and BLACK-Ground. The centre screw is also a ground.

To test voltage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Get out a multimeter or something to read voltage.

2. Attach a probe to the screw with the green wire, and a probe to
   the screw with the red wire.

3. Get a phriend to call you. Note the voltage. Now using your 
   cordless phone or your beige box (see how to use your beige box
   farther down in this article), pick up. Now note that voltage.

In case you are too lame for this, I have recorded the voltages acco-
rding to my ED TEL lineman's book.

ON-HOOK:          40-50v
OFF-HOOK:         10-15v
RING:             90-100v
BETWEEN RINGS:    10-15v
CONVERSATION:     20-30v

That is why, if you get static on your line, the static box will
clear it up for you. This ups the CONVERSATION voltage by 3v.

Older Anarchy Philes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This also links to older American Anarchy files. They may tell you to
go to a phone box and look for the five prongs with the red, green,
black and yellow wires. Unfortunately, here they are moved inside 
people's houses (the lightening arrestor), and in phone boxes you
have several sets of wires, two of which are your ring and tip.

this is why those phreaking files (ie. the Acrylic Box) didn't make 
sense.

Testing Your Beige Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test your beige box from issue 1, attach the ring clip to the
screw with the red wire, and the tip clip to the screw with the
green wire. These are not hard to mix up, as the black and yellow
screws do not stick out as far, and the Red and green are also
usually on the bottom. It dosen't really matter if you reverse
ring or tip, as you will just switch from Tone to Pulse.

There you go. Now you can impress your phriends with you infinite
knowledge. Have Phun.

\          Finding Passwords in a Firstclass Settings File          /

Softarc made a big flaw in their 2.X versions of the Firstclass software.
If you can get on the computer of the guy's settings file, it is very
easy to access the password.
       
First, to do this you need SuperResEdit, The Forker init, or 
something else that lets you open Data Forks. I used Forker and 
ResEdit to open them. I have included the Forker init with this
issue, (Super ResEdit is too big. Look for it on the lopt web site).

1. Use the data fork opening program to open the settings file's data
fork (with forker it is called <DF>).

2. After opening it up, you will see three distinct columns of code.
One in numbers with a lot of zeroes ie 000008. The second with a whole
bunch of numbers, and the third with just letters. Look at the one with
the letters (on the far right).
3. Read what it says and scroll down. As you scroll down you will see
 USERID = "(Their username)"
 PASSWORD = "(Their Password"
 or with forker it looks like:

41"USER
ID = "JE
RRY ATRI
CK"PASS
WORD = "
DIE"AUT

(Note that the 41 in the beginning is just the last digits of the BBS
phone number).
There is also a program that will extract this for you called
Passfinder, it says that it won't work on version 3.X of Firstclass,
so this probably won't work either, however, a lot of people still
keep 2.X versions of their settings files, so you may get lucky!

\                       How to make Dextrin                         /

              '''''''''''''''File #7 of 9'''''''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''
A lot of pyrotechnical formulas (firework recipes) call for a 
binding agent called "Dextrin". Unfortunately for you people, it
probably dosen't say how. Well, here's how:

1. Spread flour on a plate.

2. Put this in your oven. Heat it at 220 degrees Celcius for 15
   or thirty minutes.

3. When it turns brown, its ready.

Some notes about making it: You can use starch instead of flour for 
the recipe. Also do not overheat it, or it will become useless.

Pretty simple huh? Bet now your asking another question, which is 
probably: How do I use the Dextrin?

This is a binding agent, which means it will hold your explosive
together. Lets say you make some fireworks (recipes may be in later
issues). It will be a powder. Now, you just mix the Dextrin with
water, slightly wet the explosive mixture, and add the two together.
Let them dry, but not too much, as you have to mold them. Now, cut it
into cubes, cram it into a cointainer, whatever you have to do.
Let the mixture dry, and there you have it! You explosive is whole!

If you have to coat it with ignition stuff, do it after the dextrin
has hardened the mixture. Mix in a little dextrin with the ignition
formula and coat.

Also, it it wise only to use this stuff if the recipe says to 
bind with Dextrin. The formula may not work with Dextrin in it, or
even worse, react with the Dextrin. Most firework formulas are ok
with it though.

|           |    The Anarchists' Cookbook created by CIA?           |
|           |=======================================================|
|           | Recently, a rumor has been going around about the Ana-|
|           | -rchists' cookbook being made by the CIA. This rumor  |
|           | was started by Spunk Presses, and this is off their   |
|           | web page:                                             |
|           | *The general consensus among anarchists seems to be   |
|           | that the book is very badly written, and full of      | 
|           | factual errors. These go so far that you will probably|
|           | blow yourself up if you try one of the bomb recipies, |
|           | or poison yourself if you try a drug from the book.   |
|           | The rumour is often heard that the book was compiled  |
|           | by a CIA agent for exactly this reason. Believe this  |
|           | or not to your own liking.                            |
|           |                                                       |
|           | It may also be noted that spunk presses is releasing  |
|           | their own version of the cookbook, and that this is   |
|           | only a rumor.                                         |

    This is a special top ten, I think you will not find it very   
          insightful though. THIS IS NOT A RAICIAL THING! 

	               Top ten countries bug me 
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  10. Canada - Nothing implied, but this country is too cold and too 
               wierd. For example: The CBC <shudder> 
   9. Germany- I just don't like nazi's, sure not all germans are 
               nazi's but that is where they started from.(I think) 
   8. England- They have those gay british  "comedies".   
   7. France-  They just speak french! 
   6. Australia- They beat their criminals with a giant boot! 
   5. Scotland- They made haggis! (the heart, lungs, and liver of a 
                sheep boiled in its own stomach) 
   4. Japan-   They made "sailor moon" <shudder> 
   3. Cuba-   too communist. (no offence)  
   2. Israel- There using the "Hezbollah" rebels as an excuse to
               occupy the south of lebanon, stupid bastards. 
   1. The U.S- They have hillbillies, The FBI, the CIA, and the         
               artist formerly known as prince!
