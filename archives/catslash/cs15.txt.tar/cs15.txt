            '''''''''''''''''File #2 of 16''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''
        We all know what an alarm is, it is the thing that keeps us from being 
to rob any place that we choose.  Up until this point, it has been very 
difficult to come across a good article on how to bypass an alarm or to 
bypass a security keypad.  However, those days are over.  Here is the 
first good way to bypass these pesky things.

        If the alarm is one of the old fashion kind where a loud bell or horn 
rings to draw attention to the location you are at then you can simply 
fill the horn or bell with polyurethane foam in a can to silence them.  
You can purchase this at any hardware store as insulation.  It is easy 
to handle and dries faster.  Once the foam is in place the bell or horn 
will not be able to produce sound and so the security system may still 
be active, but nothing comes of it.

        Some high-security installations use keypads just like touch-tone pads 
(a registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm 
alarms.  Most use three or four digits.  To figure out the code, wipe 
the key-pad free from all fingerprints by using a rag soaked in rubbing 
alcohol.  After the keypad has been used just apply finger print dust 
and all four digits will be marked. Now all you have to do is figure out 
the order. 

        The best way to figure out the order is to look for some sort of 
pattern.  Following the following examples you should be able to 
ascertain what the combo is:
                        7               8               9
                        4               5               6
                        1               2               3
                        *               0               #
        Usually there will be four different number like 7,5,3,0.  If those 
happened to be the four numbers than the obvious pattern would be 
7,5,3,0 because they form a line diagonal.  The same hold true for the 
patters like 9,5,1,0.  There is almost always a pattern to the way that 
the
owner of the system has used to make it easier to remember.  

        Two things you have to look out for.  The first is that you can only 
have so many wrong inputs before the system triggers.  Also, sometimes 
even though you may disarm the system, after a certain number of wrong 
answers a rent-a-cop will come by to make sure everything is OK.  The 
second thing is that after you dust for prints you may only find 3 
numbers.  However, the combo may be 4 numbers with one repeating.  If 
this is the case, then you might as well forget this method because 
there are far too many options.  With 4 numbers, each being used once 
there are 24 different combinations.  Follow the example using the 
numbers 1,2,3,4

1 2 3 4         2 1 3 4         3 1 2 4         4 1 2 3 
1 2 4 3         2 1 4 3         3 1 4 2         4 1 3 2
1 3 2 4         2 3 1 4         3 2 1 4         4 2 1 3
1 3 4 2         2 3 4 1         3 2 4 1         4 2 3 1
1 4 2 3         2 4 1 3         3 4 1 2         4 3 1 2
1 4 3 2         2 4 3 1         3 4 2 1         4 3 2 1

        However, if there only 3 number in a four pin combination the amount of 
different combos jumps from 24 to 33.  For an explanation follow the 
example using numbers 0,1,2

0 0 1 2         1 1 0 2         2 2 1 0
0 0 2 1         1 1 2 0         2 2 0 1
0 1 0 2         1 0 1 2         2 1 2 0
0 1 2 0         1 0 2 1         2 1 0 2
0 2 0 1         1 2 1 0         2 0 2 1
0 2 1 0         1 2 0 1         2 0 1 2
1 0 0 2         0 1 1 2         1 2 2 0
1 0 2 0         0 1 2 1         1 2 0 2
1 2 0 0         0 2 1 1         1 0 2 2 
2 0 0 1         2 1 1 0         0 2 2 1
2 1 0 0         2 0 1 1         0 1 2 2
        
        If you want to have some fun with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at 
the same time.  many units use this as a panic button. This will bring 
the owner and the cops running and ever-one will have a good time.  

Note:  Never try to remove these panels from the wall, as they have 
built-in tamper switches.

            '''''''''''''''''File #3 of 16''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''
To explain why this works, go buy (or rip off) a bottle of castor oil.
Then burn the contents. It gives off a lot of thick black smoke, right?
Now, there are a few ways that you can have fun with this stuff.

1. By far the simplest, is to squirt it as far as you can into their exhaust
pipe. When the car is running, the exhaust heats up (this is why you need to put it
as far as you can into the pipe) and the oil burns, sending smoke out of the pipe. 
This also works with DIRTY engine oil (because the clean stuff doesn't have as much 
crap in it to burn). This is just the thing to help a learner driver. 

2. This is a bit more complicated, and requires time, and access to underneath the 
bonnet (hood) and some equipment.
EQUIPMENT:
1 DRILL
1 BOTTLE of CASTOR OIL
1 INCH METAL PIPE (it should be small enough to fit over the washer pipe tightly)

 The car needs to have windscreen washers (the little things that look like bugs on 
the hood that spray water to clean the screen). Open the hood and find the pipes 
that go from these to under the hood. Cut one pipe (it doesn't matter which) just 
before it goes to the hood. Now drill a hole that the metal pipe will fit tightly 
in in the top of the exhaust manifold. If you don't know what this is, it is the 
four metal pipes that merge into at the back of the engine and go to the exhaust. 
Fit the metal over the pipe and the metal into the manifold. If the fittings are 
not tight the manifold will release smoke and the owner will stop and discover the 
little modifications you have made. Now fill the washer reservoir with castor oil 
and check you haven't left your drill in there. Now, when s/he (hey, vengeance 
doesn't discriminate by gender) tries top wash his/her screen while driving, the 
castor oil comes out in two places: the windscreen and the exhaust. The widscreen 
will fuck up their vision and the exhaust will release loads of smoke. Maybe they 
will get pulled over and get a ticket!!!!

3. If you do no.2 on your own car, make sure you clamp the other pipe or you will 
not be able to see through the screen. Now you have an instant smokescreen!!!!!!  
When you press the button, the view of the other drivers will be obscured. If you 
are into switches under the dashboard, why not rig a couple of powerful flash guns 
behind the rear windscreen? One touch of the button and BOOM!! instant pile-up. I 
strongly advise you not to do it at really high speeds, however, 'cause unless 
you're a really good driver they might skid and crash into you!!!!

If anyone has any varations on the stuff I have described here, Email me at 
blackheart42@hotmail.com 

Later, 
       Blackheart.

In some countries, it is possible to make free prank calls through a bug in the BT 
(British Telecommunications) phone system. If you are in the UK, you may be 
familiar with the freecall 0800/0500 phone codes. If you are in Canada or the US, 
you can use this system to your benefit. Simply dial:
00 (the international access code) 
44 (the code for the UK)
(8/5)00 (our freephone nos.)
89 (our code for the US cause it doesn't work with the normal acc. code of 00+1)
x6 (substitute 2-9 for the x) 
and 4-6 other digits (depending on the phone).
A lot of times when I try this, I get a recording "Sorry your call cannot be 
completed as dialled..." but often I get through to someone who is overworked and 
underpaid and in no mood to deal with someone like me.
This is when I can have my fun! (I'll leave it up to you to decide on what to say)
Strangely enough, I once got through to someone in the Netherlands and I slagged 
him off while I was waiting for a bus.
I'm not sure but I think this is the safest form of phreaking, given my limited 
knowledge of the profession, because it is virtually untraceable from the UK.

/o  o\                 The New CSi Signup Process              /o  o\

            '''''''''''''''''File #7 of 16''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''
Thanks to AOL's buyout of Compuserve, the old signup process in issue
6 to get free internet no longer works! But, good old CIS is still
dumb and they they kept the built in Compuserve 3 signup login open,
and we can use that. This process is only for the Mac (it may work
on a PC too, but also may not).

The first step is to send for a free compuserve CD. Visit 
www.compuserve.com and order one online. It is ok to have the CD sent 
to your house for this, but it would be better if you could have it 
sent to another place and get it. Some MacOS packages and modems come 
with this CD too.

Now that we have the CD, install the Compuserve 3.0 software onto 
your hard drive (you'll need about 20MB space without MSIE). Now open 
up the Compuserve 3 program and follow these steps:

1. Click the 'Signup' button
2. It brings up access shit, hit return
3. Select your country and hit return
4. Choose your dialing options (ie. call waiting disable) and hit 
   return.
5. Select the port that is attached to the modem and hit return
6. Pick modem settings and hit return.
7. When it asks you for your local number, click 'Modify' and type in
   your local Compuserve number. DO NOT USE THE 1-800 NUMBER IF YOU
   CAN HELP IT! The 1-800 number makes it easier to find you if they 
   try.
8. It will connect you to CSI. Type in your area code and the first 
   three digits of a local number.
9. You will then have to choose your local number. Be careful! In 
   some cases like here it count's Calgary's number as local to 
   Edmonton! Make sure it is on your city!
10. Select your dialing options. It will thwn disconnect you and call
    your local number to complete the signup process.
11. It will ask you for your offer code. DO NOT USE THE ONE 
    COMPUSERVE GIVES YOU. This will help them trace you. Instead type 
    in the offer code 'SKIP'
12. It will validate the code and then ask you for all your personal
    information. Fill in all false info. Make sure you fill in the 
    name, address, postal code, and phone number fields.
13. Choose your credit card type. The best for this would be VISA or
    Discover.
14. Use a credit card number generator like CrayZ Carder or Project X 
    to generate a phony credit card number. Copy it and paste it in 
    the 'Credit Card No:' field.
15. Type in a phony expiration date for your Crdit Card info. One 
    dated sometime next year would be a good choice.(ie. 06/98)
16. It will ask you about promotions. For safety's sake, you may 
    want to de-select them, but you can probably just hit return.
17. Hit return again at the agreement display
18. Click on the 'Agree' Box and hit return.
19. Copy down usernumber and password.
20. Type in Usernumber and Password where it asks you.
21. Hit return on 'Thank You' screen.
24. Hit return on e-mail address info
25. Enter anything for an e-mail address or just hit return.
26. Click the 'Next' button
27. On address info hit return.
28. Hit return again to save into CSi prefs.

This will create a 24 hour Compuserve account. When your 24 hours is 
up:
1. Open up your System Folder
2. Open up the 'Preferences' folder
3. Open up the 'Compuserve' folder
4. Drag the file 'Compuserve 3 Settings' to the trash.
This will reset all CSi 3's settings and allow you to signup again 
with this process.

As you can also see, this process takes about 5 minutes longer than 
the old signup process. That's because they moved all the data from 
the signup program online. The worst part however is all the space 
that CSi 3 takes up and the fact that old Macs can't get free CSi 
accounts. Maybe I can convince the Vigilante Corp to write a 
CSi account generator...

Anywayz, to set up internet access download the 'Compuserve PPP 
Config' software and run it. Then every time you want to set up a new 
username and password:
1. Open up 'ConfigPPP' from the Control Panels folder (under the 
   apple menu).
2. Click on the 'Config' button
3. Click on the 'Connect Script' button
4. Change your Usernumber and password in the fields.
That will let you to use internet programs like Netscape or 
Ircle without launching the Compuserve 3 program. Compuserve has 
access to all the internet products. Their mail server is just 
mail.compuserve.com with your regular CSi password as your POP 
password and their usenet server is just news.compuserve.com.

That should cover all you need to know. If you have any other 
questions, just e-mail me. Also, if you can't figure something out, 
look for more of my CSi tips on the 'Anarchy in the 403' page when 
it's up. That's all and have phun!

One day I lifted a bottle of mouthwash from a drugstore to use in a 
prank, but it didn't work. "Now what am I going to do with this 
stuff?!" My first thought was to burn it. BUT IT DIDN'T BURN! I was 
so pissed off at this useless stuff I added gas to make it burn. 
After that I got a three foot high torch. Maybe mouthwash has a use 
after all...

So, I played with the idea a bit more and decided to mix it with 
flour like chud. Thats why its called Chud X (I couldn't think of a 
better name, so sue me).

Ingrediants:
""""""""""""
- Some gas
 - Some flour
  - Some mouthwash (I had a bottle of red Plax)

How to make it:
""""""""""""""
1. In a jar mix equal amounts of gas and mouthwash (you don't need as
   much gas, but this makes sure it dosen't fuck up)
2. Stir in flour until you get a gummy mixture
3. Scoop it out and store it somewhere where the gas can't evaporate
   out of the mix, like an airtight jar.

Pretty easy huh?

How to use it:
"""""""""""""
Just stick the gum to anything and light it. This stuff lightes VERY 
easily and will spread quickly if you spread it around. It burns 
pretty high and in flashes, and will eventually die down to a small 
blue flame. Its a good way to kill a Sunday morning...

Suggestions:
""""""""""""
1. Try to use the red stuff. it just looks cool.
2. If you don't have flour, just leave the mouthwash and gas mixture 
    by itself in the jar and light it. It will make a big flame that 
    will probably attract people or scare the hell out of them!
3. Don't breathe the smoke stuff in or you'll get sick. Trust me.

Well, now you know how to make yet another useless house product into 
something that can burn things. Have phun!

				Our story begins with our heroes Bungie and
Poison Ice doing  their usual halloween Phreak or treat activities,
when they come across the house.... they usually do this every
halloween so they know the neighbourhood but this house was not
there the night before. So being as dim as they are they go to
the house, climb the steps to the porch and use the knocker and
yelled "Phreak or treat". no answer. So they do the knocker thing
again, and the door opens suddenly  "come in!" so they do, the door
closes, "oooo-k.."poison said, so they walk further in and start
looking for a light switch, no luck. then bungie yells "found it"
and flicks the switch.....Baam! a trap door opens swallowing our
dynamic duo of dastardly deeds! they slide down a sheute and land
hard on the ground. "that has to suck worse than N.E.R.D. #1!"
poison states,"that's true, but not as bad as their last issue of
CHM! " bungie replies. poison nods in agreement. a voice comes from
the backround "Hey, I'm a member of that group!" poison and Bungie
turn and see them, the demons of faginess, the children of Richard
Simmons, The BACKSTREET BOYS!!! Our heroes let out a cry of horror,
but their true destinie's to take out the gay bastards like them.
together they yell "We call upon the spirit of anarchy to drive us
on this glorious battle!!" suddenly bungie's costume of Judas Priest
disapearred and revealed his metallica "Metal up your ass" shirt and his
beige box nunchucks. he yelled Lets rock!! Poison's body started to glow,
his "mad arab" costume disolved and he turned into his alter ego, PRIMAL RAGE!
and his thermite gun appeared in his holster,he said "RRROOOAAARRR!! lets
jam!" The backstreet boys appeared as they did in the "backstreets 
back" video. the young sissy mummy said" metallica up your ass! thats 
bad!" the dracula guy said" the only thing that goes up my ass is 
these guys! Lets rock'em! Bungie instinctivley yelled "bring it 
on!!", the BSB attacked two went to bungie and two went to poison. 
Poison let out a growl, kicked one of them in the stomach and clawed 
off his gay little face, then bit off the vampire guy's arm, and then 
he stabbed his claws into his chest and split him in two! Bungie spun 
his beige box nunchucks aand imbedded it into some fag's head(I 
forgot his name) then the werewolf knocked him out! Bungie was about 
to get assphucked! but poison saw it , came at him and grabbed his 
arms, and doublekicked his head off, then started to eat at his 
insides. bungie regained conciousness and asked poison to brush his 
teeth later, poison concurred. there was only one guy left to kill, 
but they learned even though he was gay, he was smart "You will die 
now straight boys, observe!!" he pulled out a remote control and 
presssed a button, instantly a backstreet boy song started playing! 
Poison's super beastial hearing picked up the intanation of every 
sound, he cried out and went unconsious. Bungie started to buckle, he 
went to poison and grabbed his thermite gun, he loaded it and fired 
at the speakers , they were destroyed instantly. The smell of 
thermite burning woke poison and rejuvanated him, both bungie and 
Poison looked at the remaining backstreet boy with an evil grin, 
bungie threw the gun and the nunchucks then started to beat the 
living shit out of that gay fatherfucker! he died slowly and 
painfully. Suddenly a voice came over the intercom "You may have beat 
my gay minions but I'm another matter! come face me if you dare!" a 
door opened Poison got to thinking (for once) and asked bungie " hey 
bungie, how do we find these people?" bungie replied " our luck I 
guess, lets kick some ass!" they ran through the door, passed a 
particularaly evil obsticle course and arrived at their destination, 
in a chair was a guy with one of those sorcerer cloaks and aa bladed 
lomg staff. The heroes stared in amazment, for they knew their enemy 
and it was the evil, it was the infamous Jim Chamzuck!! "You have 
used my name too many times, you'll die now!" poison looks at bungie 
and states " well then, BRING IT ON!!!" He ran at them and waved his 
stick in a girly fashion, Poison and Bungie look at each other and 
act, they pick him up and throw him out a window! then escaped 
through the window and ran into the woods, remembering the night 
forever. 

the end.

| Tone Generator 3.0 |
 """"""""""""""""""""
<Available on the Weasel's page when it's back up>

Tone Generator is an awesome phreaking program that can perform 
almost any type of job you can come up with! It has the tones for all 
the major boxes already programmed in (ie. Red Box, Blue Box, Silver 
Box...) plus a WarDialer, Text file reader, file copier and even a 
terminal program! It does it all.

What also impressed me was that if you can't find the tone in one of 
it's tone sets, you can generate your own! Just type in the #of Hz 
and it blasts it back to you. This is even cooler when you make the 
device to hook up your computer to a phone (in one of our issues).

This program is the best phreaking program out there. It may not have 
cool graphics but it does the job in a kickass way!

Here is an e-mail that we had to publish. It was just too funny! It 
was sen't by anonymous remail though, so we can't bug him. Here it 
is:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
To whom it may concern,

My 10 year old son was reading your "CATSlash magzine" when he tried some of your 
suggestions out. He was trying out a bomb by your writers "Boom Boom" and 
"Jeriatric" which I believe would have killed him.

I think your publication is dispicable. You portray violence and hurting people as 
something that is fun and you support others in taking part in this violence. In 
one of your issues a writer "Poison Ice" saluted rebels who have killed thousands 
of people in terrorist attacks. You are a discrace to your civilization.

I have taken the liberty of contacting the CRTC and several other sources about the 
removal of your magazine. Thank you for your time.

                                                  A concerned citizen
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Our replies go as follows:

BUNGIE: If your still reading Citizen Lamer, I have a few pointers:

      1. I (Bungie) was Jeriatrick (spell it right you dork) and 
         BoomBoom has left the mag. We never made an explosive file 
         together ever.
      2. If he was almost killed that's his problem. And how do you 
         know he would have been killed? Maybe he was setting it for 
         you.
      3. YES! WE LOVE VIOLENCE AND HURTING PEOPLE! And as for the 
         Hezbollah rebels, how can you judge them without meeting 
         them  yourselves? I'm sure poison would be insulted if he 
         wasn't laughing so hard.
      4. The CRTC dosen't give a fuck about us. See the disclaimer in 
         the back of the magazine? Ever hear of freedom of speach?
      5. "Thank you for your time" Go back to Cuba you Nazi (thanx 
          to Trigger for that one!!).

POISON ICE: I don't know who the hell you think you are telling us 
that we are dispicable, you suck, and where the fuck do you get off 
commenting about the hezbollah, they are fighting for their homes, 
their families, and their country.   Besides how would you know what 
it feels like to have a bastard country like Isreal take over a 
portion of your country that your family has lived in for 
generations. If you ask me, you have the problem, If your such a good 
parent what the fuck is your kid doing trying to build explosives? 																										Get Fragged isreali spawn.

BUNGIE: I don't think Poison likes you or the Isrealies. 
Better watch your back.

POISON ICE:please write back.
_____________________________________________________________________
There now that that's out of the way, we can return to the regular magazine. 
Everybody else out there don't be afraid to e-mail us. This was a special case.

|  \____|___/  |   It comes as an application. Why is this better? 
|_______|______|   because the Mac version comes with pictures,
                   sound, movies, point and click interface plus
   Macs Rule!      all the other things you would expect to find
                   for your Mac. Check our web page for details.

                   Also, if you have trouble loading our text issues, 
                   download the Catslash Reader. Version 1 sucks but
                   at least it opens them properly, and version 2 is
                   on the way.
