This is a VERY good month for us (and you too!). Why? For starters we 
have had three new article submissions this month. They are all damn 
good, and you can read them in files 2,3 and 5. They are all fun things...

Then, to top it all off, BoomBoom IS BACK!!! Thats right, he's writing 
for us again too, only he's now known as Spectre. He's changed a bit 
from previous issues so don't be surprised. Check out his article in 
file #6.

Well, that's all, have phun!

Sunday Smoke Bombs are smoke bombs made out of newspaper it is 
very easy to make alot of these here is how.


What You Need:

1. Lots and lots of newspaper
2. Amonium Nitrate (Buy a Bag Of Fertilizer)
3. A jug or can
4. water
5. Wire

-------================-------------================--------------===

1. If you got all those good. Now put the Amonium Nitrate (Fertilizer)
in the can or jug dont fill it to the top just fill half: 

	         |        |
          |        |
          |        |
          |@@@@@@@@|
          |@@@@@@@@|\
          |@@@@@@@@| \  
          +--------+  \Amonium Nitrate


2. Now fill the rest with water and mix well:


          |~~~~~~~~|
 	        |~~~~~~~~|--------Water
	         |~~~~~~~~|
          |@@@@@@@@|
          |@@@@@@@@|\
          |@@@@@@@@| \
          +--------+  \Amonium Nitrate


3. Now set it aside and get a page from the newspaper then cut it 
   in half where the fold is:
 
       +----------+-----------+
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa| 
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|--------Newspaper page
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       |aaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa|
       +----------+-----------+
		                 \
                    \  
                     \Half of newspaper page (Cut Here)


4. Take the half of the newspaper page make it into a ball and dip
   it into the Amonium Nitrate (be careful if you have cuts it will 
   sting):
	
	  |########|-------Water and Amonium Nitrate
 	 |PPPPPPPP|
	  |PPPPPPPP|-------Half Of Newspaper page made into a ball
   |PPPPPPPP|
   |########| 
   |########|--------Water and Amonium Nitrate 
   +--------+



5. Wait two minutes take it out and squeeze all the water and Amonium    
   Nitrate back it to the can so it is just wet (I cant draw that)

6. Make alot of those and leave them out in the sun to dry for an     
   hour I mean ALOT!

7. Now to the hard part you have to fold them in a special way. First 
   when they are dry take one and fold it in half:


       +----------+
       |aaaaaaaaa |  
       |aaaaaaaaa | 
       |aaaaaaaaa | 
       |__________| 
       |          |\
       |aaaaaaaaa | \
       |aaaaaaaaa |  \Fold it here
       |aaaaaaaaa |
       +----------+
 
  
8. After you have folded it you have to fold it in half again:


       +----------+
       |aaa ! aaa |
       |aaa ! aaa |
       |aaa ! aaa |
       |aaa ! aaa |
       +----------+
             \
              \
               \Fold here

9. (NOTE: it must be folded really tight) Next roll it up like a 
   cigar and tie it with the wire (NOTE: if it is too big you can 
   fold it in half again it shouldn't be bigger than 4 inches):

      +-------------------------------+
      |              (                |
      |              (                |
      +-------------------------------+
                      \
                       \
                        \Wire

------==============------------===============---------------=======
How To Use:

Take it lite the end and if there is fire blow it out then throw it as
far as you can! (NOTE: Sometimes after the smoke stops it lites it self
on fire that could be FUN!!)

        This is probably old hat, but here's how you do it.
        Get a lynx can, take the top off and tape four bangers to it as shown.
 (black cats are best, but I don't know if you can get them in canada)
        Gunk loads of vaseline to it, especially around the spray bit. Now get 
a really long piece of string, gunk it in vaseline and stick one end in the big 
bit of vaseline. Walk away to the end of the string. Light it and move away 
about 50 metres. Watch as the match sinks thru the vaseline, ignites the bangers 
and BOOOM!!!!! Hey, fourth of july has come early.


                        /-----0-----\
                        |            |

        ok, that is supposed to be an overhead view of your lynx can but 
because I'm shit at ascii art it didn't come out properly. the 0's represent 
the bangers.

Today we will be discussing how to cause mischeif in a mall, now this 
can be really easy or really hard depending on the level of security 
in said mall. But if you have the balls to give it a try, then read 
on. Now a lot of people will say that the parkade is the best place 
to cause mall mischeif, not these days, nowadays if you want to cause 
trouble the indoors are the place to be. A good place to start would 
be the bathroom, where we can deposit our waste, what you do is get 
some ketchup packets and place the ketchup in the urinal. It'll look 
like blood, when you see the looks on the people's faces, you'll know 
you did it right. Another gleeful activity would be the penny toss, 
to accomplish this fun feat all you need is a two floor mass with a 
fountain and some pennies, then aim at the people sitting next to 
the fountain. I'll let you decifer the rest. So have fun and enjoy, 
I know I did.

        From the secret files of the LC!

It's impossible to explain all the aspects of lockpicking in one small text
file, but here's a brief overview.

A little over 50% of all locks are Pin Tumblers, which means they operate on
a system based on raising pins to the correct height, enabeling the cylindar
to turn (Generally Clockwise). Each pin (There is usually 5) can be lifted to
approximatly 5 different heights. Considering how many different shapes of keys
and pin combinations there are, Pin Tumblers provide the best security for their
price.

Here is a rough drawing of a pin tumbler lock:


                                /----------------\      } = Spring
                                |  }  }  }  }  } |      I = Tumbler
                                ===I==I==I==I==I=|      ! = Pin
                                   !  !  !  !  ! |
                                =================|
                                |________________|

See the Cylindar can't turn because the Tumblers are in the way. Actually the
tumblers are almost always different lengths, I just can't draw that in
ASCII...

Here is what the same lock would look like with the key in it:

                                /----------------\      } = Spring
                                |  I  I  I  I  I |      I = Tumbler
                                === == == == == =|      ! = Pin
                           /---\   !  !  !  !  ! |      ~ = Part of the Key
                          /_____\~~^~~^~~^~~^~~^\|      ^ = Little part of key that
                                =================|           pushs up the pin
                                |________________|

Okay, So I can't draw, but you get the idea, right? Now that the pins have
pushed up the tumblers, the cylindar is free to turn, hence opening the lock.
Simple so far. Now comes the harder part, picking the damn thing.

To pick the lock you will need 2 tools. The tension wrench (sometimes called
the torque wrench), and the pick. Now tension wrenchs are easier to build than
picks but probably more important. The tension wrench is needed to turn the
cylindar of the lock. A tension wrench looks a little bit like this:

           /----\
          / /---/
         / /
        /_/

You build them by bending a small(!) screwdriver at a 45 degree angle. Bend it 
with small taps by a hammer while it's on a vice. Don't use heat as it will destroy
the temper. Once you have your tension wrench make sureit fits nicely into the
average house deadbolt, or if your aim is for padlocks and such, consider filing
it down.

Next you'll need a pick. There's lotsa different kinds of picks, but you'll
probably use a diamond pick or small diamond pick most often, but I find myself
using rakes a considerable bit of the time. Making a set of picks is time consuming
and can be costly. If you have the resources I recommend buying some high quality
spring steel picks, but if not, you can use a large saftey pin.

Make it sorta in this shape:


                 \________0_______|===|

This pick can be used as a diamond or occasionaly a rake. (I'll get to that) Make
sure it feels comfortable and tough in your hands.

Now here's the basic principals of picking pin tumblers:

You slip your pick into the lock, letting it rattle against the pins. Once you ge
 to the last pin, keep your pick touching it and insert your tension wrench below
the pick. Now thanks to poor manufacturing standards, we can lift each pin
individually and keep it suspended at a certain height while applying pressure
on the tension wrench. So in other words, start twisting your tension wrench in
the right direction with your left hand, with maybe a little more than you would
normally use to twist a key. Then push the pick upwards against the pin at the very
back. Keep pushing it upwards until you feel it break. When I say breaking the
pin I mean you stop feeling the springiness of the pin. Usually you feel and hear
a click as well. Your still applying pressure with your tension wrench, right?
Good. Move on to the pin closer to you. Do the exact same thing. Move on to the
next pin,  and so forth. Once you've broken all the pins, the tension wrench
should be able to turn the cylindar all the way around. If not you've either
lifted a pin to high or not high enough. But Instead of releasing tension on the
tension wrench and starting all the pins over again, try lifting tension gradually.
You may feel/hear another click or 2. Try the full tension again. It might open.
I read somewhere that that tension play can solve 30% of beginners picking problems.
It's worked a couple of times for me, but certainly not 30%. The lock should unlock.
If not, try, try again. Remember sight plays onlt a small part in lockpicking. Try
to tone your senses of touch and sound to feel when a pick breaks, but the most
important  concept is visualization. Try to imagine the lock in your mind and where
your pick is at the moment.

That's the most reliable method of picking I know of, but if your a lazy ass, or
aren't that good at concentrating, you can try raking (sometimes referred to as
scrubbing). Basically same concept, but instead of lifting each pin one by one,
you "rake" the pick back and forth in the cylindar. I've heard of it working on
some really high-security locks, but the success rate is much less than the
conventional method.

Pin Tumbler locks are used on deadbolts for houses, small buisnesses, sheds, and
everywhere where cheap but good security is needed.

Wafer tumblers:

Wafer tumblers are basically just a variation on pin tumblers. They are a bit
easier to pick. The pins are a bit closer together. Wafer tumblers consist of
about a quarter of the locks in the world. It's where medium security is needed,
ie: vending machines, bike locks etc.

Car locks are actually wafer tumblers, but they have a certain device on them
known as a side bar. It makes your picks harder to get at the pins, and plus,
you can't feel or hear the pins break. If you need to get into a car, I
recommend you use the coat hanger method discussed in a different arcticle.
I once busted up a perfectly good pick trying to open a car lock. Needless to
say, I couldn't get it open.

The rest of the locks are like Mushroom Spools (Damn impossible locks. The
use em on banks. If you do try, I recommend using a feather touch tension
wrench. The pins are like mushroom shaped and stuff. I'm not to sure about
them, so I can't really help you.)

Magnetic Locks (Also used on very high security things. You need really funky
picks with batteries and such. Not gonna get into it now.)

Disc Tumblers (Elder Locks. I think you can use standard picks on them, but
they are barely ever used, so I'm not to sure.)

There are other kind of locks out there, but they're so insignifigant that
your probably wasting your time studying them.

When buying professional picks, make sure that they're tempered well, and
probably made out of some light, tough material, such as spring steel. Pretty
much any tension wrench will do, although you may want different thickness
for different sizes of cylindars. I've never used a pick gun before, but one
of my friends told me that they kicked ass.

Lock picking is generally associated as something only a burglar or car thiefs
practice. This isn't true. It's an intellectual battle between the lock maker
and the lock picker. Every true anarchist should be able to pick at least a
few simple locks. I can think of a million uses, and I'm sure you can too.
But for those of us who don't plan on destroying the world, overthrowing the
democracy, or detonating high megaton nuclear devices in metropolis areas, it
provides a challenging and satisfying hobby.

Napalm tastes like beef, I know 'cause the orange clown told me. I am

Stick a bunch of 3"- 4" nails through two pieces of corrugated cardboard. 
Then glue it to the bottom of the show box. Place the lid on. Bury it so 
that the lid is covered by about 1cm of dirt/snow/sand etc.

When stepped on, the lid collapses puncturing the victim's foot. If you
 want to make it really nasty for the mother fucker, smear the nails 
with dog shit (this has led to numerous amputations due to infection).

Have fun! (and remember where you buried it!)

Its been a long time since issue 1 and I've found all kinds of other phun things 
you can do inside cable boxes to annoy your enemies and get free TV. (NOTE: See 
issues 1 and maybe 3 for help in finding your cable box)

First off, those stupid little metal tubes that are being used more and more. 
These little tubes are connected to your cable line when you don't pay the 
cable company to keep you from just opening up your box and screwing in your 
home line (as described in issue 1). They are hollow, so if you attach your 
line to this you will get NOTHING!

Many people have discovered that you can't unscrew them just by turning them. 
They'll spin freely when you try. These have to be pushed in and then turned,
 sort of like a child proof Tylenol bottle. It will take a while to unscrew 
the bitch (I'll put the plans for an extractor in next issue). Then, when its 
done, look at the bottom of the box for the unconnected cable lines. They will 
have little white tabs on each line with the owner's address on them. Just find
 the one with your address and plug it in. You may also have to use pliers to 
get off the rubber crap if they put it on top. I've heard that watching TV before 
6:00 will get you pegged by a ratings sweep, but a phriend of mine went for 2 
years without getting caught. Ratings sweeps detect descramblers so the cable 
company can get big money, probably not people pirating cable.

Now you have a little metal tube. What are you going to do with it? Well, the 
most phun is to seal the end, fill it with gunpowder and make a mini pipe bomb.
They shatter pretty good sometimes. But it can be used for revenge! (not saying 
that blowing up someone's mailbox isn't revenge...)

Find your enemy's cable box. Make sure its not in the same cable box as yours, 
or the cable company will bust your ass when they find your free cable and he'll 
laugh at you! Now find his line and attach the metal tube! Now he'll lose cable 
for a while! Do this when there's a good movie on or a football game or 
something he likes. If you can, do it after 6:00 when the cable company is 
closed so he has to wait a day!

What if the buggers not paying for cable? Then we can still get him in trouble. 
Unplug the line of someone who's paying for cable and plug his into it. Then 
plug the person who's paying for the cable into the metal tube. The guy will 
call SHAW or Videotron to complain and they'll think your enemy's trying to 
steal cable! He might even get charged!

Here's a fun game to play too. Go down a whole block and plug non subscribers 
into their lines and place the metal tubes on the subscriber's lines. What takes
 you an hour to screw up will take the cable company three days to put back 
together! Do this on the superbowl weekend. The cable company will have to rush 
over and will have to check each and every line. Wheeeeeeee...

If you really want to piss somebody off rip out the copper centre of the line, 
fill a metal tube with crazy glue and hook them all together. Even once the 
cable company gets the tube off they'll have to replace the line (no copper 
wire). The victim will have to wait a long time to get it repaired (tho they 
might just split another subscribers line and attach him, as I have seen before!).

Now, some of you are probably asking "What about the older areas?". Areas like 
Beverly and Abbotsfield have all their lines on telephone poles, and unless you 
have climbing spurs or a bucket truck, you can't get at the splitters. Just 
attack the line where it comes down to their house. In a few complexes they 
have the cable down in a big box at the side of the building. Look for these 
too. Otherwise, yo can't do anything.

Well, now this should keep you cable phanatics busy for another year and a half.
Until the next file, have phun!

| There are a lot more assholes making deadly trojans this month so |
| whenver you see something that looks too good to be true, check   |
| this list because it probably is!                                 |
|                                                                   |
| I've also grouped together similar trojans like the Dreamweaver[k]|
| and Office 98 [k] trojans which do the same thing.                |
|                                                                   |
| Finally, I've got the real story on those 'Doubler' trojans every-|
| where and you can stop worrying. We've tested quite a few and     |
| found many to be fakes.                                           |
