Well, issue 7 is here! We have some pretty good stuff this month,
and you should have a ball with it!

There were also a lot of comments about the garbled text on the tops 
of our files and in our DIZ. This was the fault of our text program, 
and should now be fixed.

We are also announcing something cool. Since this month had 'random 
acst of kindness week', then in March we should have 'random acts of 
violence month'. So from March 2-8, we hope you join us in our 
violent actions.

And finally, we have started to fix up our web pages! They were 
starting to look rejected, and it turned out our Mac Issue page had
crashed and we were just uploading to an inaccessable FTP! That 
should be fixed soon. Also, keep an eye out for the CATS web page.
It will have links to all kinds of files and good H/P/A pages.

\                     Free Internet With Compuserve                 /

  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 7, February 1997__________/
              '''''''''''''''File #2 of 9'''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''

In issue 2, we told you how to get access to Compuserve by putting a 
fake credit card info into the signup program. We also mentioned that 
you could not get internet access, because they would have to mail you 
your second password. Well, that is no more, at least for the Mac 
users (This probably won't work for PCs!).

What you need to have:

1. The old Compuserve signup package which includes Mac CIM 1.0 and 
   the Signup program.
2. About 30Mb hard disk space (Don't worry, you will get most of it 
   back)
3. An hour or two on the modem

Now make sure we have all this stuff, as it is very important. Now
we need to get MacCIM 3.0:

1. Install Mac CIM 1.0 and the signup software
2. Using the Signup program, fill in all false info. For the Credit 
   Card info, use a program like CrayZ Carder or CCS Mac.
3. Uncheck all requests for stuff like Compuserve Magazine and 
   promotional mail.
4. Call their number, and follow the instructions to get a new 
   account. After registering, press the 'Launch MacCIM' button
5. Now when the Connect window pops up, choose 'Continue'
6. Open up the preferences, and type in this string before 
   compuserve's number: *70,,,*67,,,,,,,
7. Now, from under the File Menu, choose 'Connect'
8. Once connected, double click on the Internet icon. This will bring
   up a window telling you your version of MacCIM is outdated.
9. Double click on the 'Download MacCIM' option, and from there, 
   follow the buttons, and download MacCIM 3.0. This will take a long 
   time. My 28.8 modem took and hour and a half. It is about 8Mb.
10. Once finished, quit out of MacCIM 1.0, and install MacCIM 3.0.
    It is about 20Mb. If you have Netscape (the best internet 
    browser!) tell it not to install Microsoft Internet Explorer,
    and it will only take about 15Mb.
11. Delete the MacCIM 3.0 Installer. Then in the MacCIM 1.0 folder, 
    take out the 'Signup' program, the 'signup files' folder, and the 
    'signup data' file. In other words, any files associated with 
     signup, you keep! Then delete whatever else is left out of the 
     MacCIM 1.0 folder.

Now it is installed, and you are ready to go. I'll explain what 
happened, and why you can get this software. Basically, Compuserve 
3.0 (and 4.0 on the PCs) come with their own signup programs, and 
internet capability. The only problem here is, that these programs 
only allow you to signup once, so you cannot do the process described 
in CATSlash issue 2. However, they forgot one thing. Mac users have a
separate signup program that they can use!

Ok, now, if you only want internet, you can delete the whole CIM3.0
folder, because Compuserve PPP will launch when you open Netscape.
If you want to use any other services though, keep it around.

Now, to use the internet (this must be done every time!)

1. Open up signup
2. Change the Credit Card number
3. Follow the rest of the signup process and write down your 
   usernumber and password.
4. Open up 'Compuserve Dialer' from your 'Control Panels' folder.
5. Under the 'sessions' menu, change your usernumber and password to
   your new one.
6. Change the number to include *70,,,*67,,,,, if it isn't already
   changed.
7. Quit the Compuserve Dialer and launch Netscape.
8. If all goes well, you will connect and get internet!

One account number will last you up to a whole day. Once it is over, 
you must use the signup program and create a new account. If 
Compuserve kicks you off in about an hour while you are on the 
internet, quit Netscape and launch it again. No need to create a 
new account like on BIX!

MacCIM 3.0 is really a crappy program, it is slow, and has hundreds of 
bugs in it. If you are going to just browse Compuserve, stick with 
MacCIM 1.0. MacCIM 3.0 is really just good for internet browsing.
But like I said, for making your WWW page, accessing CIS forums,
or stuff like that, you will need it.

And, if the CIM Telnet browser is crappy, set up Internet Config to
use Black Night as the Telnet program, then visit the site with
" telnet:// " and enter the Telnet address after it. It will use
Black Night as the program, which is better (it has ANSI).

I hope you have fun with this, and make sure you visit our web page!

Well my fellow anarchists, we meet again, and I have some more stuff 
so here it is. 


                     Magazine subscriptions 
                     [[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]

The time-honored tradition of giving person x a subscription to every 
magazine that was ever made. Go to your library and rip out those 
little subscription cards out of each one. If the librarian asks you 
what you're doing, tell him/her to go piss up a flagpole and continue 
your mission. 

Now take this big stack of cards home and fill them all out in person 
x's name and send them in. Almost every one of the cards will already 
have the postage paid for so you won't have to worry about the cost 
of stamps. 

Now me, I could care less if someone did that to me. I would get a 
little pissed off, though, if someone were to use my name on the 
subscription cards and send them to my friends or my boss. So try 
this. He'll get a couple of issues of each magazine until they get 
pissed off that he's not paying for them and stop his subscription. 
For a few months after thea they'll harass him about paying for the 
magazines he ordered but he won't het into any kind of trouble 
because of it.

There are many Mac networks out there in the schools, and we have 
been asked many times how to hack them and screw them up. In reading
this, you must remember that Macs have been proven to be the hardest
computers to hack! But we won't let that discourage us will we...

MacJanet is a very popular type of Appletalk server. You can tell if 
its MacJanet by going under the apple menu and looking for something 
under it called "Waterloo MacJanet", and often "MacJanet Message". If 
it doesn't have this, it may be a MacJanet server, but chances are 
that it is not. If it is run by System 7, go under the Chooser and 
see if there is a MacJanet icon.


Part 1: The General Network Operations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
First, we will look at the general workings of the network, and what 
to do with it...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           Logging In:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logging in is a simple procedure. Under the apple menu, there will be 
something called "Waterloo MacJanet" or "MacJanet Login". Select this 
and you will get a dialog box with a "Login" button. Click on it or 
hit return. Then you will see two fields, the Login Name field and 
the password field.

The login name can be anything, it can be up to 31 characters long, 
with ANY character the mac keyboard can generate, including the 
special characters like bullets and spanish characters. It is a good 
idea to watch someone logging in, so you can get their username. Most 
usernames go in consecutive order like CPAB, CPAC, CPAD and so on, so 
if you get one, chances are you have 26 of them. The login names are 
not case sensitive.

The Password field is difficult to work with, as it uses the same 
process as the Login field, except it echoes the characters back with 
dark circles. The passwords can also be set up to be case sensitive.

If you are part of the network, log in here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The Network Disks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you log in, you will see two or more disks on the right side of 
the screen. The first is the hard drive. You can use this any time, 
logged in or off. For more info on hacking the hard disks, see part 2 
of this series (Coming next month). The next one will have an icon of 
a page with a corner bent over, and four small squares on it. This 
will have your Login name on the bottom as its name. This is your 
network disk.

Your network disk is completely under your control. You can move 
files, write to it, whatever. 

There may also be other disks. These are other network disks, which 
your system supervisor has allowed you access and set to display on 
login. You can open and run files from these disks, but according to 
the Mac OS, they are set to "locked".

To access other disks on your network, select the DA (Desk Accessory) 
under the apple menu that you used to login, and select the now 
available "More Disks..." button. Then you can double click on these 
and use them like the network disks described above. These are also 
set to "locked". These disks are not neccessarily located on the 
server, but can be from any computer attached to the network. 
Teachers in schools often set up these disks for their files, so only 
they can edit them.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    What the server shows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See that little guy in the corner by the apple menu who's running?
If you see him, your computer is exchanging info with the server.
This is performed every time you do something that involves a net-
work disk. The things on the hard drive don't count here.

Lets take a look at the server's monitor, and see what's going on:
(It is smaller than the real windows. The real windows are full
 screen, and have scroll bars, close boxes and stuff like that).

| LAZERJET+             Not Active                                  |
|___________________________________________________________________|

Ok, now to explain what you are seeing. On the top left, is the event
log, this records every program you open from the point you log in.
It will also record saves and prints. 
If your supervisor is not crazy about security, he will probably
close it to allow the server more memory.

Next to that window, is the one with "USERNAME" and "APPLICATION". 
This is quite obvious. The names like "JERIATRICK" are the people's 
login names. The time beside them is when they last opened a program 
or logged in. Then, under the APPLICATION window, there is what 
application each person is in. Of course, if they are in the Finder, 
or have just logged in, it is blank. The dark circles in front of the 
program they are in serves no purpose.

Under that is the printer status. This records the progress of every 
document spooled to the printers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     The System Administrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system administrator runs the whole system. He has no limits to 
what he can do. His login name is "ADMIN". To see if he's on the 
system, go into MacJanet Message under the apple menu and look for 
him.

The system administrator can do many things. One is screen lockup. 
This is when he hits a three key combination, and your screen changes 
to what's on his computer. There, you are helpless to do anything, but 
watch what he is doing. You don't even have to be logged in for this 
to work. Just as long as your computer is connected to the network!

He also has the power to unlock network disks, allowing you access 
them as a real disk.

He can basically do anything he wants to, from any terminal. The only 
thing he cannot do is find your password or edit your account. For 
those he must go to the server itself.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Messing with the network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok Jeriatrick, enough technical crap! Get to the good part! Well, 
here we are...

The Chooser - A great tool
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Under the apple menu is something called the Chooser. This is used to 
select a printer, network, fax driver, etc. Well, it is far more 
useful than that!

If you are in the market for other people's login names, open up the 
chooser, (before you log in!) and in the bottom right hand corner 
will be the username of the last person that logged in!

If you want to print on a better printer, open it up and select a 
different printer to spool to.

If you want to make life hell for the next guy, on the bottom right 
hand corner is also two options: Appletalk ON and Appletalk OFF. 
Switch it off to disconnect the computer from the network. Also use 
this to avoid the dreaded "screen lock"

To access other file areas on the network, click on the Appleshare 
icon in there and select a new fileserver!

After logging in, click on the MacJanet icon, select 'preferences...'
and change your username! Delete the old one and type in the new one. 
Then click on the 'save' box and choose OK.

Using Programs Without Getting Caught
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Ever get into some boring lecture in computer class and go "Fuck! If 
only I could play a game! But he would just look at the log and catch 
me!". Well there are solutions.

The first is really simple... Don't log in! As long as you are not 
logged in, they cannot find you. A teacher of mine went nuts because 
me and some friends were playing 'Shufflepuck' (You know, the one 
with the real loud sound effects and people!), and he couldn't find 
us!

But if you want to play a network game like Marathon? There is no 
easy way. The first thing to do is change the volume to 0. If he 
hears no gunfire, chances are he's not going to bother checking what 
program everyone's into. If you have no access to the volume control 
panel, plug your headphones into the headphone/speaker port on the 
back of the computer.

Another fun thing that may work for you, is under the chooser, change 
your Login names to stuff like "Fuck You". That way when he checks, 
he will not know who "Fuck You" is.

The final option is to get ahold of some of the programs that allow a 
"ghost login". This lets you log in, but you do not appear on the 
server's lists.

Multitasking
>>>>>>>>>>>>

Want to give some lamer a real shitty day on the network? Just choose 
'Set Startup...' from under the 'Special' menu. Then click on the 
button that says 'Multifinder only'. Now hit return and restart the 
computer. Now whenever someone tries to access MacJanet login, it 
will just beep.

An explanation of this is that Waterloo MacJanet does not work in a 
multitasking environment. That is why many networks have the old 
System 6, instead of the great System 7 or 7.5. The only way to log
in now is to use the Chooser, or AtEase.

Avoiding "screen lockup"
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Screen lockup is a real pain. There are many ways to get past it. 
The easiest way is to disconnect your computer from the network. This 
can be accomplished by using the Chooser (See the part about using 
the Chooser above...) or by physically unplugging your computer from 
the network. Just unplug the cable running to the Mac's printer or 
modem port.

Another way is to reset your Mac. This can be done by pressing the 
reset button on the side or back of your Mac. It is a small button 
with a triangle above it. Once your computer restarts, you will no 
longer be under screen lock, even if you log in!

You could probably also use the debugger to bypass it. On the side or 
back of your Mac is two buttons as described above. This time we want 
the one with the circle on it. I don't know what to type, but there 
probably is something!

And, if you are lucky enough to have System 7 on your network, press 
COMMAND-OPTION-ESCAPE. This will then ask you if you want to force 
quit the Finder. This usually will work.

Phun with peripherals
"""""""""""""""""""""
The following are ways to abuse all peripherals connected to the 
network!!!

Dialing out
>>>>>>>>>>>>
Lets say you wanted to dial a BBS through the network. Is very easy 
to do so. We'll use the Bethlehem BBS (403/477-2351) as an example.
1. Launch Microsoft Works, ClarisWorks, Hypercard or any other 
   terminal program you can locate.

2. Type in a command to silence the modem. This is very important 
   otherwise your teacher will hear the modem dialing and find you!
   some zero volume commands are:
   ATM0 - Most models
   ATS7=1DT - Some Hayes Models
   ATS7=1L0DT - An alternative to the above command

3. Now dial any number. Either use the program's dial command or type
   ATDT 477-2351.

Save the files to your network disk. Maybe even download a copy of 
ResEdit, so you can do some really cool stuff. Have phun!

Faxes
>>>>>>
There are so many fax modems out there today! To use them, try some 
of these methods:

1. Hold down COMMAND, SHIFT, CONTROL, or OPTION when selecting the 
file menu. If the Print... command is now a Fax... command, then 
select it, enter the requested number, and whatever page or window 
you have on your screen will be faxed.

2. Find or obtain some fax software like Fax STF. Now use it, just 
like you used the modem for dialing.

Scamming the school's internet
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Get some free internet time easily! If your school is connected to 
the internet through a psn, then you will be told the password and 
login name for the account. Look under the ConfigPPP, FreePPP, or 
InterSlip control panels (you will have to have access to those) and 
get the phone numbers.
If Netscape logs you in automatically, Just visit the control 
panels listed above and grab the username. You will have to crack the 
password yourself (make sure you count the dots so that you know how 
many characters are used in it!). There is also a program available
on many PD boards called 'PPP Password' that can find it for you.

Messing up the school's printer
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
There are a few ways to mess up the printer. Why would you want to do 
that? Lets say you have to print an assignment, but you don't have it 
done. If you could not print it, then you would have more time to 
finish it! Here are the easy ways:

1. Simply unplug the printer's serial cable. Now it is not connected, 
   and nothing can reach it. If you don't want it to be discovered, 
   unplug it, but make sure it is still partly into the port. If you 
   really want to cause a delay, steal the whole cable. They come out 
   very easy and it will be very short (from the printer to a small 
   plastic box not too far away).

2. Log in using the guest account, or ANY ACCOUNT THAT ISN'T YOURS. 
   On some networks you won't even have to log in. Open the Hard 
   Drive's window and keep selecting "Print Window" from the file 
   menu. You can also use the print screen F-Key (Command-Shift-4) if 
   it is an imagewriter. Do this repeatedly for a long time, and the 
   printer will be so overloaded with print jobs that it will be 
   hours before it will get to your assignment! Your teacher will 
   most likely shut it off to save ink. Better for you!

3. If your teacher is really lame, and knows nothing about computers, 
   try the following: Press the "Select" button on an Imagewriter 
   style printer, or the "Line" button on a Lazerjet style printer. 
   It will "pause" the printer, and most people don't know that. You 
   can also easily jam up an imagewriter by pulling on the paper 
   while it is printing. It will keep printing over the same line! 
   Let the bastard try to figure out why nothing he's spooling comes 
   out!

Conclusion
""""""""""
Well, now you have a basic idea of the server's operations and how to 
screw them. There are many other methods, but these are probably the 
easiest and the best for what you want to do. Tune in for part 2 next 
month titled "Foolproof" for info on getting the ability to edit the 
computer's hard disk!

Ever want to tell how effective your explosives are? Well, recently
while browsing a book on explosives, I came upon a diagram for an
explosive tester! I'll try to type a diagram here:


ignition -----> \      /       || <---------- thermometer
 wires           \    /        ||
 ___||____________|__|_________||____
|___||____________|__|_________||____|
| | ||            |  |         ||  | |
| |_||____________|  |_________||__| |<---- insulated container
| | ||            |  |         ||  | |
| | ||<- stirrer  |  |             <------- water
| | ||       ___|_|__|_____        | |
| | ||      |   | |  |     |       | |
| | ||      |   | |  |     |<------------------ bomb
| |(||)     |   |_|__|_    |       | |
| |         |    \____/ <---------------------- sample cup
| |         |______________|       | |
|  \______________________________/  |
 \__________________________________/

So, now we tell how it works. You place the bomb, with the ignition
wires connected and running out of the top into the reinforced 
container full of water. Then you use the ignition wires to blow up
the bomb. The thermometer tells you the approximate heat your bomb 
would generate. The amount of rotations that the stirer makes on
explosion tell you the force of the blast (I think you need a gauge
on the end of the stirrer). Then finally, you are supposed to measure 
the height that the water expanded to (so don't fill the container
to the top with water). That will give you a reading on the effectiv-
ness of your explosive. This test is also used in some labs, so you
will probably get a better explanation on how to use this thing at
a lab.

Its just a fun thing that I thought you might find a use for!

\                       CSIS is Watching You                        /
 \                          By: Jeriatrick                         /
  \___________CATSlash Magazine - Issue 7, February 1997__________/
              '''''''''''''''File #7 of 9'''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''
If you don't know, CSIS is the canadian equivalent of the FBI. They
recently have been busting a lot of people using methods that most 
are unaware of. Let it be known that our H/P/A community is also
threatened.

Here is an example of how they have been busting a lot of people:
.....................................................................

Jim Chamzuck is a drug dealer, so of course has a cell phone. One 
night, he is talking to a business associate over the phone, and at 
some point mentions the words 'drug deal'.

That night, CSIS also has a van parked beside a cellular tower, which 
unknown to them is the same tower that our buddy Jim is using. The 
van is white, like any other van you might see. The only difference 
is that on the inside are two CSIS agents and a whole shitload of 
computers. They are not looking for anything in particular, but have 
been there for two hours already. What are they doing? They are 
downloading every conversation that passes through that tower!

It is now three hours later, Jim's conversation has ended a long time 
ago, and the CSIS agents have filled their computers hard drives up 
so that they can't download anymore, or else they have just decided 
to call it a day. They set their computer to search for keywords in 
all the conversations, words like 'drugs', 'phreak', 'gun running' 
and many more are searched for. The computer of course, pinpoints 
Jim's conversation and flags it.

The next day, the CSIS agents check the computer provided list, and 
find Jim's conversation among the many flagged. A short investigation 
into it, and Jim is busted.
.....................................................................

This is almost the exact story that was told to me by one of our law 
enforcement contacts. Many people in Ontario have been busted by this 
process.

But isn't monitoring cell frequencies illegal? You have to remember 
that this regulation is set up by the CRTC, and who owns the CRTC and 
CSIS? The government. CSIS can monitor everything you say on a cell, 
and you don't even know it.

If you use a cellular modem, you are a bigger target. CSIS will check 
to see if you are downloading anything that you shouldn't. Then, it 
will give them an idea who to watch. Those they check first!

However, CSIS can't tap or monitor your phone line without a warrant, 
or you can charge them. They can ask to see your caller log to get an 
idea of the numbers you are calling, or see the status log to see if 
you are using a modem, fax or normal phone call, but that is as far 
as they can go without a warrant.

So, the solution is then to stick with your normal phone. That is 
true, it is the best way, but many people also don't know that by 
saying words like 'hack and 'phreak', the telco's computer flags the 
number on their computer. They may investigate your caller log after 
this, but usually won't.

CSIS mainly operates in Vancouver and Ontario, so we don't have to 
worry too much, but BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY ON THE PHONE. CSIS may be
listening and waiting...
