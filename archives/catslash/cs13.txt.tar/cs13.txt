Hello everybody! This is a great month for Catslash, maninly because 
we are now one year old! In honour of this great event we have put 
together some new articles that are really good stuff. We have also 
made this our "Violence and Warfare" issue, so you can go kill your 
phriends.

And as for all you people that e-mailed us over the past month, we're
sorry it is taking us so long to reply (we've been pretty busy). 
Don't think we've ignored you, WE HAVE ALL YOUR LETTERS SAVED! It 
just takes us a while to get back to you. Thanx for your patience.

In the sadder news, this is Boom Boom's last issue with us. Its sad 
to see him go, but unfortunate things happen. We will probably never 
get someone with his expertise in explosives for a long time though.

Anywayz, here is the lineup for issue 13:

        Hi everybody! today we will discuss an extention of ruining 
someone's reputation, which happends to be ruining someones bicycle 
(must be a bike with gears).

        Lets get started, first you get some retro-musalagenic compound (i.e
margarine, lard, etc.) and place it on the brakepads and metallic rim 
of wheels; Second you get a lot of pennies and glue them between the 
gears on the back tire; Third you remove the connection bolt on the 
seat and keep the seat on (once he drops from a curb..); fourth (if 
you can) switch the gear cables with the brake cables, nuff said. 

That was all I could think of today, untill next time!        
              (poison the flesh, poison the mind)

This is a phun toy from Poor Man's James Bond that is easy to make 
and can be pretty cool.

Materials
"""""""""
(1) Shotgun Shell
(1) ThumbTack
A roll of Scotch (clear plastic) tape

How to Assemble
"""""""""""""""
Take the tack and put a 5cm piece of tape over the head of the tack. 
Repeat this process so the tape on the head forms a cross.

                                                BOTTOM OF SHELL
Now place the tack over the primer piece on         ____
the shotgun shell. BE CAREFUL! IF YOU PIERCE       /    \ 
INTO THE PRIMER, IT WILL HURT YOUR HAND            |  O ---- Primer
FUCKING BAD! I MEAN IT! Now tape it to the         \____/    Piece
shell with the tape you put on the tack.
                                                   _____
Finally, lightly add some more tape to the        /  || \
tack so that it is on really good.                |=(  )<--- Tack
                                                  \__||<---- Tape
That's all it takes! Now when the tack hits
anything, it will fire the shell!

How to use!
"""""""""""
Just drop it so that the tack hits the ground. It works better when 
thrown from a high place. It also works when thrown into walls and 
other hard objects. Just be careful, because if you get hit with the 
shot inside the shell, then it will hurt a lot, and can probably be 
fatal. In fact, when you set it off, get away fast! Without a shotgun 
barrel the shot will often cloud  and pelt a lot of stuff.  JUST BE 
CAREFUL!

You can also lodge the shell tightly somewhere (a vise is good) and
hit the tack with a hammer. Instant shotgun!

Conclusion
"""""""""""
This is a pretty simple device, but is very dangerous. But, it is 
also very fun! This makes a hell of a noise and can scare the fuck 
out of anyone. Whatever you do with this, just have phun!

                    How To Flame Someone's E-Mail
*********************************************************************

Hello u all, this is DreD here. I'm writing my 1st article for 
catslash, and u better all like it. Lets go to todays topic: flaming 
some fuckhead's e-mail fer beginnerz!!!!!!!

For this u will need an internet account. One of the other issuez of 
this mag has an article about free internet from compu$erv. That 
would be the best way. That's what I used.
 
The first step is to find the lamer's email address. Lets all pretend 
its chm403@hotmail.com <=== The NERDS Address ==> Practice with this 
                                                  one too!!!!!!

Under Netscape, get to the setup, in the identity area, change 
all of the boxes to match yur victim. Using our example, it would be 
like:
Real Name: Elektric Fuckhead
E-Mail Address: chm403@hotmail.com
Reply To Address:chm403@hotmail.com
Just leave all the other shit blank. Now go into the the servers area, 
and fill in yur mail servers. Mine waz mail.compuserve.com (thankx 
to bungie fer the info). Now we have some fucking fun.

We R gonna subscribe the dumb fuck victim to a hundred MAILING 
LISTS!!!! Fer those of u who don't know what that is, u send them an 
e-mail and they send u a copy of their stupid newsletter every 
month. 

We'll start with 1 list so u can get used to it. I have a whole list of
places to send to at the end of this article. This time, we'll use the
QUEER-PARENTS newsletter. We pick NEW MESSAGE for this. Leave the
subject area blank. Now we type in the  lame lists' address which is 
majordomo@vector.casti.com. In the message area  type: SUBSCRIBE 
queer-parents. Pick SEND MESSAGE. It will ask u for a subject. Hit 
backspace and then hit enter.

So u get it? 
1.leave subject empty. 
2.type in lists e-mail address
3.type SUBSCRIBE <LISTNAME> 
4. send the message

Here's a good list of sitez:
The stuff in the LISTNAME row should be typed in small letters. 
I just used big ones so u all could see better.
In the extra stuff area:
NM means u add the motherfuck's name to the end of the message.
FNLN means u add the first and last name to the end of the message.
*'s R really fucking good lists to subscribe the fuck to.

            '''''''''''''''''File #7 of 13'''''''''''
                             ''''''''''''
        greetings one and greetings all, welcome to poison ice's first 
actual weapons file! It took me a while to get the bugs out of this 
damned contraption, but it works, so I like it. 

                     materials 

                 one calculator casing (casio brand)
                 three paperclips (small and bendable) 
                 one thin elastic 
                 one long candle 
                 one lighter 
                 a knife
                 some masking tape 
                 many straws 
                 some popsicle sticks 

                     procedure 

1. Light candle and heat knife for 5 seconds. 
2. Get calculator casing and cut one notch into each of    
   the two rises, they should dig in about two or three    
   millimetres in. 
3. Cut elastic once and place in between each notch, it    
   should be tight but with some slack (it has to be       
   able to stretch to the back),then cut and tie off. 
                 ex. *|-----|* 
4. Reheat knife and seal the notch openings, remember      
   to keep the elastic inside the notches. 
5. Bend one paperclip so it is completley extended and     
   place it at the bottom of casing, then slide it out and 
   bend untill it passes the back and goes forward over the 
   top then make a small bend downward, (this is the 
   trigger). 
6. Bend out ONE fold on another paperclip and place tape    
   around the rest, loop it three times at least, then     
   heat. 
7. Realign the trigger and tape it to the bottom of the    
   casing, see where the bent point will touch the       
   plastic and use paperclip to burn a slightly       
   comfortable hole into it. 
8. Reuse heated paperclip to make arrow aligner(here's     
   how, duh!) align a straw from the trigger and burn      
   one hole one each side of the straw, leave some         
   safety space. 
9. Unbend third paperclip and slide half of it through     
   one hole from the bottom, make a curcular bend, then    
   lower it through the second hole, bend it together      
   from the bottom and place tape over it. 
10. Tie a string to the trigger and tape it on to lock      
    it into place. 
11. Bend the last paperclip into a two pronged hook and     
    tie and tape it to the strings end. 
12. get a popsicle stick and break off a one cm piece,      
    fashion a point onto it, then make it slim enough to     
    fit into a popsicle stick.Then tape it together. 

        There, you now know how to make it, let me tell you that this thing 
is low yield and is best used to ward off your little brothers or 
sisters.

MAC SOFTWARE:
============
Bombtrack 2.0 PPC
"""""""""""""""""
Bombtrack is the most kick ass e-mail weapon you will ever see! It 
supports flaming and fakemail, all off of your local inet provider.

The best feature is the "Bombtrack" section. You enter the target's 
name and e-mail address, and then select from two lists of mail lists. 
Just double click on the list's name, and they are subscribed!

Then, fakemail allows you to send anonymous e-mail. Harass them 
without them tracing you!

I used this to harass a person and it drove him nuts. He cancelled
his internet under his provider and signed on with a new ISP just
to escape the 100's of e-mails he received. That's cool stuff.

Face it, if you want a mail war tool, Bombtrack 2.0 is the mother of 
them all. You can get a copy off of the Weasel's page.

CreditMaster 4

Creditmaster 4 generates credit card numbers. Just type in a bank 
prefix (it gives you a very long list of banks), enter the number 
of digits (for a VISA), and enter how many cards. It does all major 
cards - VISA, Mastercard, AMEX and Discover. It even fixes invalid 
numbers and can make more cards off of an existing seed! This version 
kicks ass! Way better than CMASTER3!

|     /\    |=======================================================|
|____/__\___| As many of you know, CATS has been trying to get the  |
|   /    \  | Anarcon to be in Edmonton this year. When Bungie      |                     
|  /      \ | brought this up at the last AAA meeting, it was voted |
|   Local   | down. Not only that but it was also voted that there  |
|  Anarchy  | will be no Anarcon this year!                         |                      
|   News:   | However, 403Ninja stated that they may hold one this  |
|           | winter. Location unknown.                             |

|           |                Area Code Change!!!                    |
|           |=======================================================|
|           | Looks like by 1999 Catslash won't be rocking the 403  |
|           | anymore!There's gonna  be an area code change for     |
|           | Alberta in 1999. Telus says that the current 403 NPA  |
|           | only supports 8 million numbers and that by the year  |
|           | 2000, AB will have about 7.8 million phone users.     |
|           | The solution is to split AB in half. The south half is|
|           | going to be the 403, the north half will be 780. This |
|           | will cause quite a stir in the Anarchy world here.    |
|           | Just think, all HPA adds, slogans, files and names    |
|           | (like 403Ninja) will probably have to change. This    |
|           | could really suck. But, we'll worry about that in     |
|           | 1999.                                                 |

|           | moved in, drugs have been of a much better quality    |
|           | than they used to be. One also noted that there also  |
|           | haven't been any shortages since they moved in. Looks |

|           | Earlier this month, SoulReaper announced that the VC  |
|           | was going to release all their anarchy files made     |
|           | between 1990 and 1996 (when they shut down). The 403  |
|           | has anxiously been awaiting these files, since they   |
|           | used to only be available to VC members.              |
|           | The only problem is, that when th VC shut down, no one|
|           | thought to save the files (sort of like the Mac issues|
|           | of Catslash). Anywayz, they are taking longer because |
|           | they have to hunt them all down.                      |

|           | 403Ninja announced this month that he is shutting down|
|           | the AnarchyMail network. He said it costs too much and|
|           | is becoming obselete.                                 |

|           | Due to a few bugs, the new web page for our mag is    |
|           | going to be delayed a bit longer. We've been getting  |
|           | mailed about it since the middle of August, and WE    |
|           | KNOW IT DOSEN'T WORK! We have switched back to the old|
|           | page for current distribution.                        |

|           | that they were going to become allies with Apple. It  |
|           | was almost a riot. We also got some news from the     |
|           | writers of MOUSETrap (A local Mac Newsletter) about   |
|           | this deal. Apparently Setve Jobs' lawyer found some-  |
|           | thing BIG about Microsoft and threatened them. Micro- |
|           | soft is now at Apple's disposal. The only unfortunate |
|           | side of this deal however, is that Raphsody will ship |
|           | with MIE instead of CyberDog. The good stuff is full  |
|           | Microsoft products for Macs and Microsoft is pumping  |
|           | a lot of money into Macs now. We'll have to see what  |
|           | happens next...                                       |
