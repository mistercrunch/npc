_____________________________________________________________________
Its snowed this month! Dammit, I thought we were safe. At least its 
warming up right now and the snow has melted away. This means less 
phreaking outdoors and more indoor stuff pretty soon...

Our page was upgraded this month! It is just sort of a halfway thing 
and I have some more stuff to upload and to add, but it's better than 
the old one. It's more organized and also supports reading issues 
online (Though I still have to upload a few).

Also, we'll be getting a Hotline Server up soon! On it we'll have 
lots of warez, texts etc. If you know what Hotline is, check your 
tracker for 'Shadows of Anarchy'. If you don't know what Hotline is 
(all you PC users), don't worry, you're just really losing access to 
some Mac programs/warez and maybe a few text files.

Finally, Blackheart is doing the Vengeance column this month cause he 
has a cool article for it and Poison hasn't written anything. Just 
don't read it and think Poison has majorly changed cause its 
Blackheart ok!!

This is a good one provided both you and the target smoke, and s/he doesn't know 
that you want him to die...

First you need to scrape the powder off a box of matches. (off the matches, not the 
box!!) DON'T use the "strike-anywhere" type; they might go off prematurely (and you 
do NOT want that!!!!!!)
Grind the stuff to a powder (pretend it's the guy's face or something).

Now you need 1 cigarette and a pair of tweezers. Pull a bit more than half of the 
tobacco out of the ciggy and retain it (you will need it later). Fold a piece of 
paper in 1/2 and use it to pour the powder into the cig. How much?, I hear you 
ask... Well, this stuff burns like flashpowder so I tend to fill it to about 3/4 of 
an inch of the fag. Now you need to stuff the tobacco into the fag and there you 
have it!!!!! The Exploding Ciggy!!!!!!!!!!
This is what it should look like when finished:

|--------------------------------|
|///|\\\\\\\\\###########\\\\\\\\\
|--------------------------------|

| and - :the end and sides of the cig.
/ is the Filter
\ is the Tobacco
# is the Matchpowder
(Note: I do explosives, not ASCII art!!!!)

Just offer it to him/her and watch from a safe distance.
When they get partway down it, and they drag on it...(OK it doesn't explode but it 
burns like flashpowder)
It should: 
Burn their fingers off
Fuck up their lungs (even more than they are doing already) and nose..

Have phun!!!!! and remember which ones you filled (I usually mark them by making a 
dent in the (philter??)) 
I will have another art. on this subject as soon as I remember how to make Nitrogen 
Trichloride...

      PART 1: Tracing Phone Calls     /____|  By: Bungie
_____________________________________________________________________

Have you ever had someone call you and you wanted to find them? There 
are many ways of doing it, but some people have trouble bullshitting 
operators into giving such information. Fortunately, in the age of 
technology, such ways are available to those who know about them.
 ______________________
|1. Tracing the Number |
 ======================
Lets say some fagget calls your house and starts harassing you. You 
now want to take him out. Well if you look in the white pages, it 
says dial *57 for Telus call trace. DON'T DO THAT!!! Telus call trace 
only flags the number in the Telus computers. Then you have to call 
Telus security and press harassment charges. This is no good because 
you don't get their number, and it also dings you for $3.00. And if 
Telus security is closed, you can't do anything.

But there is another way... Telus has a service that is not well 
known called CALL RETURN. It has an outgoing (redial) and incoming 
loop. As soon as they hang up, dial *69. It will then tell you the 
last number that called your house and ask you if you want to redial 
it. I think this service costs 30 cents every time you use it, but 
that might just be if you tell it to redial, so don't press 1.

 _______________________
|2. Returning their Call|
 =======================
Make sure its the right number now. Dial *67 (to block call display) 
and call their number. If the prankster's voice answers, you have 
him!

 ______________________
|3. Finding his Address|
 ======================
If he's really pissed you off, you'll need to find his address. Now, 
if you call Telus and ask for the address to a phone number, they'll 
thell you to fuck off. So we have to use another method - the ProCD 
Canada + US Phone CDs.

These are available at most libraries. I know Highlands Library and 
the one downtown have computers with these. The one downtown has the 
US Phone CD too. Just go to these computers and type the phone number 
in the PHONE NUMBER field (you'll have to scroll to the right a bit). 
Make sure you include the area code. Then hit return. It'll tell you 
the name, address, postal code, etc.

 _____________
|4. Conclusion|
 =============
If you do a lot of tracing, I suggest buying one of these for 
yourself. Places like Staples and Westworld will have them. They are 
expensive though!!! And make sure it is the one with all the numbers,
not just the businesses etc. These are very handy for traces of all 
sorts.

Next month I'll talk about other ways of tracing people using a 
variety of other materials. Until then, have phun!!!

        Okay, this is a subject I probably don't need to tell you about
but since this is one of my favourites I just have to divulge it in this
file. This works best in colder climates like Canada and the UK. 

You need:
=========
Gelatin pill capsules (you know, the ones that look like plastic but dissolve in water)
Pure sodium (Sorry, I cant help you to get this. Try your school or a chem supply house)
Calcium carbide (Try a hardware store (no, not computer hardware!!))
A victim who has a car (I'm sure you have a few hanging around)

        First, you must open the capsules and do whatever with the stuff inside.
Now, mix calcium carbide with sodium in a 1:1 ratio and fill 3 or 4 of the capsules
with it. Keep them in a sealable plastic bag or anything really, but:

DO NOT LET THEM GET WET!!!!!!!!!

        Next, you need to be able to get into his fuel tank. If the cap is a
locking type (i.e. you need a key to open it) try prying open the panel and
levering the cap out (I'm not sure about this, because I think it's different
here in the UK). As long as you can seal the tank afterwards it doesn't really
matter (you'll see why in a minute). Open the tank and throw the capsules in. They
need to get to the bottom of the tank or it will not work!!
seal the tank and watch from a SAFE distance. (I don't want you all to die because
of something petty like revenge) 

Here's a description of what happpens inside the tank:
1: When it's cold, condensation forms inside and sinks to the bottom.
2: After 10 mins. to 1/2 hour the capsule dissolves, exposing the sodium and calcium
carbide.
3: Calcium carbide reacts with water to form acetylene carbonate, which is used in cutting
torches.
4: Sodium burns in water, igniting the gas and fuel.
5: In the confined space fo the fuel tank you get a BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Do this to someone you really hate (e.g. that band... what are they called? The Buttfuck
Boys? The Back Passage Boys? Whatever...)

Yours,
       Blackheart

*****************************************************************************
 
THIS WILL BE A SERIES WRITTEN EVERY SO OFTEN TO INFORM YOU FUTURE NINJAS OR
KILLERS OUT THERE.  I WILL WRITE A SERIES OF PHILES ON THE SECRETS OF THE
NINJA.  THIS IS NO BULLSHIT YOU SEE IN THE BOOKS IN YOUR LOCAL MARTIAL ARTS
STORE.  THIS IS THE REAL SHIT.  DON'T ABUSE YOUR POWERS.
 
***WARNING***
IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN ANY OF THE SERIES AND YOU DO HARM SOMEONE BAD
I WILL TAKE NO BLAME FOR IT.  PLEASE DON'T INTEND TO USE THESE TRICKS AS A
CHILDISH JOKE.  SOME OF THE THINGS I MIGHT WRITE MAY BE VERY HARMFUL...MOST
LIKELY DEADLY.
 
 
BACKGROUND
----------
I WAS BORN IN JAPAN, RAISED AND TAUGHT THE ART OF NINJUTSU FROM MY FAMILY.
I IMMIGRATED TO THE U.S. AND BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN.  I'VE BEEN STUDYING
THE ART FOR OVER 15 YEARS NOW.  I AM REVEALING SOME OF THE SECRETS TO YOU
SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE WRITING BULLSHIT TO PLEASE THE KIDS, AND ALL THAT
BULL MAKES ME MAD.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE BOOKS CAN SOMETIMES DEGRADE US, THE
PRESENT NINJAS.
 
POISON
------
THERE WERE MANY TYPES OF POISON USED IN THE OLD DAYS IN JAPAN.  MOST OF THE
POISON WAS MADE AT HOME WITH PLANTS, HERBS, AND OTHER INGREDIENTS OBTAINABLE
VERY EASILY.  IN THIS SERIES I WILL DISCUSS A CERTAIN TYPE OF POISON WHICH
HAS A DELAYING DEATH EFFECT.
 
WARNING
-------
THIS POISON IS DEADLY.  I KNOW SOMEONE IN MY CLAN WHO HAS USED THIS TYPE OF
POISON TO KILL A PHEW PEOPLE.  IT WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT EVENTUALLY HE WAS
CAUGHT.  HE IS IN JAIL FOR A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDER.
 
========
 POISON
========
 
THIS POISON WILL KILL THE AFFECTED VICTIM WITHIN A WEEK.  THE REASON FOR THE
TIME DELAY IS THAT THE POISON CAUSES THE VICTIM TO GET TETANUS.  THIS PROCESS
CAN BE FATAL, SO PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL IN USING THIS POISON.
 
THE POISON IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO MAKE.  USING IT TO KILL SOMEONE IS SOMEWHAT
COMPLICATING.
 
THIS IS AN INFECTIOUS POISON SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T ANY CUTS ON YOUR HANDS
WHEN PREPARING THE POISON.
 
INGREDIENTS:
  HORSE SHIT (EXTRACTED)
  HUMAN BLOOD (TYPE DEPENDS ON VICTIM)
 
YOU CAN GET HORSE SHIT FROM MOST ANYWHERE NOWADAYS SINCE THERE ARE COPS WITH
HORSES NOWADAYS.  JUST WALK AROUND WHERE YOU KNOW HORSES PASS BY, AND GET A
SMALL QUANTITY OF HORSE SHIT.  DON'T GET A LOT CAUSE THAT SHIT STINKS.
 
TAKE SOME HORSE SHIT PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE AND PUT A RUBBER STOPPER ON TOP.
ONCE YOU OBTAIN THE HORSE SHIT, YOU MUST EXTRACT THE NECESSARY PART OF THE
SHIT.
 
YOU MUST REMOVE ALL THE HAY AND OTHER GARBAGE IN THE HORSE SHIT.  YOU CAN
REMOVE THE RUBBER STOPPER AND HEAT THE SHIT OVER A LIGHT FLAME.  THE SHIT
SHOULD START TO MELT AND THE JUNK IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE SHIT.
 
WHEN THE SHIT MELTS, DUMP IT ON SOME KIND OF FILTERING SYSTEM SO YOU CAN
REMOVE THE JUNK.  REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL MOST, IF POSSIBLE, ALL OF THE
JUNK IS REMOVED.  !!! CAUTION !!! THIS PROCESS STINKS UP THE WHOLE FUCKING
HOUSE SO DO IT OUT SIDE.
 
WHEN THE SHIT IS EXTRACTED, YOU MUST OBTAIN THE HUMAN BLOOD.  THE TYPE OF
BLOOD IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!
 
FOR EXAMPLE...IF YOU WANT TO KILL THE VICTIM, YOU MUST USE THE BLOOD TYPE
WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE VICTIM: BLOOD TYPE A POS. NEEDS AN A POS. BLOOD IN
THE POISON, AND SO FORTH.
 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENDED VICTIMS BLOOD TYPE IS, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN USE OTHER BLOOD TYPES AND MIX THEM LIKE TRANSFUSIONS OF BLOOD.  BUT
THE EFFECT OF THE POISON MAY BE DELAYED OR IT MAY NOT BE FATAL.  BUT IT
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
 
GET THE EXTRACTED HORSE SHIT AND MIX THE SHIT WITH THE BLOOD.  THE PROPORTION
OF THE BLOOD WITH RESPECT TO THE SHIT IS 3 TO 1, WHICH MEANS FOR EVERY 1 OZ.
OF SHIT, THERE MUST BE 3 OZ. OF BLOOD, AND SO FORTH.
 
HEAT THE MIXTURE AT A VERY LOW HEAT, AND THE MIXTURE SHOULD START BUBBLING.
TRY NOT TO INHALE THE SMELL.  IT'S KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER IF YOU SMELL IT.
DO NOT HEAT IT WITH A HIGH FLAME, SINCE THE BACTERIA IN THE SHIT AND THE
BLOOD WILL DIE AND THE POISON WILL BECOME USELESS.
 
HEAT THE TEST TUBE AND STIR THE CONTENT WHILE HEATING TO CREATE A BETTER
MIXTURE.  WHEN THE CONTENT STARTS TO CHANGE COLORS FROM RED TO BRICK BROWN OR
REDDISH-BROWN, THEN REMOVE THE MIXTURE FROM THE FLAME.  ALLOW THE POISON TO
COOL OFF.
 
WHEN THE POISON COOLS OFF, THEN YOU'VE JUST MADE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST POISONS
AROUND.
 
THIS IS NOT A TYPE OF POISON WHICH YOU CAN JUST SPILL ON THE VICTIM, NOR IS
IT ONE THAT YOU CAN JUST PUT INTO SOMEONES FOOD.  IT HAS TO ENTER THE VICTIM'S
BLOOD STREAMS.  TO DO THAT YOU MUST USE A NEEDLE OR A KNIFE TO RUPTURE THE
SKIN IN SOME WAY IN ORDER FOR THE POISON TO WORK.
 
THE NINJA IN THE OLDEN DAYS USED WHAT WAS CALLED FUKIYA AND FUKIBARI.  THE
FUKIYA IS A BLOWGUN MADE OF BAMBOO AND THE FUKIBARI WAS THE DART BLOWN OUT
OF THE BLOWGUN.  WE DIPPED THE DARTS IN THIS POISON, THEN BLEW THE DART OUT
OF THE GUN IMMEDIATELY.  WE USUALLY STRUCK THE VICTIM AT PRESSURE POINTS
WHICH MADE THE VICTIM PASS OUT.  WHEN THE VICTIM PASSED OUT, WE REMOVED THE
DART AND LEFT THE SCENE.  THE PERSON AWAKENS WITH TETANUS, AND DIES WITHIN A
PHEW DAYS, NO LONGER THAN A WEEK.  ANOTHER MURDER WITHOUT A TRACE.
 
WHAT CAN BE DONE IN MODERN TIMES IS GET A NEEDLE DIPPED WITH THE STUFF AND
JUST POKE THE VICTIM.  MOST LIKELY THE VICTIM THINKS YOUR CRAZY AND CONTINUE
TO FIGHT YOU.  IF THE POISON ENTERED HIS BLOOD STREAM, HE WILL GET TETANUS.
WHEN AND IF HE FINDS OUT THAT HE HAS TETANUS, AND GETS A PENICILLIN SHOT OR
SOMETHING, HE WILL LIVE.  BUT IF HE FINDS OUT TOO LATE OR DOESN'T FIND OUT
AT ALL, HE WILL DIE.
 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THE POISON INTO THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
STREAM.  YOU WANTING TO BECOME THE TRUE NINJA CAN TRY MANY WAYS TO KILL
WITHOUT A TRACE.  I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER USE IT AS A JOKE.  BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO GET THE POISON INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM.
 
GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY.
 
DATED: 01-05-1985
 
 
PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY PEOPLE.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS PHILE
WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS WITHIN
YOURSELF.

I have a new way to fuck up somebodyz day!!!! There is a fucking lame 
email service called infobeat at WWW.INFOBEAT.COM. Go there and make 
a new account with yur enemies email address. Pick a password too so 
he can't go in and fucking change it. Now go to each of the news 
sections and check off every fucking one. Make sure U check off all 
the onez that send every hour. Soon the fucker will check hiz mail 
and have athousand letters. It can freeze his computer too. If hez on 
hotmail make sure U do this when hes not home and cant check the mail
becauz he can block that server. This is a cool fucking trick. If U 
want to protect yur box make sure U sign up here with a password so 
noone can use yur email in it. Dont use this on other hackerz either. 
Just use it on lamerz and poserz like electrik. Fuck them all!

| Fake ID Maker |
 """""""""""""""
If you've ever wanted a Fake ID, now you can have it! It can generate 
a driver's liscense from three states. All you do is choose the 
state, type in the information (height, age, etc.) if you don't want 
what they provide and then hit ok. If you scan a photo of yourself 
onto your computer it even adds it onto the ID for you so you get the 
little round stamp on the picture's top corner and don't have to mess 
with glue. Thats something I could never do easily creating fakes 
from ClarisWorks. The only thing wrong is that it dosen't print, so 
you have to photograph the screen and print it from SimpleText. 
Otherwise, this program is the best Fake ID maker I've seen yet!

|/_ /   \   |=======================================================|
|\  \  H \  | It was announced this month that smoking is going to  |
| \_ \_ \_\ | be banned by the area known as "the pit" (the doors by|
|           | the music room. Smoking will not be banned at any of  |
|  Eastglen:| the other doors. Rumor has it that it is going to be  |
|           | used as a way to get back at some of the people that  |
|           | hang out there and also to get them away from there.  |
|           | Many of the anarchists in Eastglen prefer that area,  |
|           | and a counter plan is already in progress :-)         |

|   /    \  | his place at Long Lake. SoulReaper from the Vigilante |                     
|  /      \ | Corp might buy it from him. 403 still says he will fly|
|   Local   | into Edmonton every once in a while to visit everybody|

|           | Wrexsoul, the sysop of Sensory Overload (see the add  |
|           | in the Catslash Supporter Adds section) is going to   |
|           | connect the board to the net. Pretty soon you'll be   |

|           |=======================================================|
|           | RipTide is getting out of jail this month! RipTide was|
|           | the second in command of CATS when 403Ninja was runn- |
|           | ing it. He was arrested last year though for robbing  |
|           | a house. Well, he's finally out.                      |

|           |=======================================================|
| GENERAL   | One day early this month, at 8:00AM the cops hit the  |
|   NEWS    | Rebel's clubhouse and several of their houses. They   |
| (Local):  | had to use a towtruck to pull out their steel door. In|
|           | the end the cops busted 10 people and seized a few    |
|           | houses. A few did escape, but the police gang unit    |
|           | says that this is only the first stroke...            |

|           | This year the Grey Cup game was in Edmonton! Unfortun-|
|           | ately the Eskimoes were beat by Saskatchewan so they  |
|           | weren't there. But thats ok, at all the Roughrider    |
|           | games their fans are pretty drunk and wild. Well, at  |
|           | the end of the game there was no rioting or car       |
|           | turning. What a ripoff!                               |

|/ /\   \   |=======================================================|
|_/__\___\__| In Vancouver a kid blew off parts of his fingers when |
|/    \  /  | he lit a fuse attached to a pellet gun CO2 cartridge. |
|______\/   | The fuse was a chinese firecracker type and he pushed |
|           | it into the cartridge so that it exploded. What's the |
|   World   | point of a fuse when you push the flame into the exp- |
|   H/P/A   | losive?                                               |

|           | The Weasel's new domain was 'www.weasel.org' at the   |
|           | beginning of the month but it was soon replaced. He's |
|           | nowhere to be found on the web, but he still has a    |
|           | Hotline site up. Check hltracker.com for his Hotline  |
|           | tracker IP.                                           |

| MUSIC     |=======================================================|
|   NEWS:   |  Yes, that's right. I borrowed it from a phriend and  |
|           | found out that it sucks. It is better than Load, but  |
|           | not by much. When will they figure out that we want   |
|  /\/\     | cool music and not this radio music type shit.        |

|           |=======================================================|
|           | I've heard some of the Ozzman Cometh album. It's just |
|           | a remake of a few of his Sabbath and older Ozzy songs,|
|           | but its pretty good. The only thing that bugs me is   |
|           | how many albums are we going to see 'Shot in the Dark'|
|           | on? I think this is the third...                      |
