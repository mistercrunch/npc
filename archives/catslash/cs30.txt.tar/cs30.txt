[ SPECIAL RETURN ISSUE ]

Issue 30, March 2000
From Edmonton, Alberta, Canada

Welcome to the return of Catslash Magazine! Its been a long time since we went offline
and it feels fucking great to be back! This issue has been in the works for three months
while we were setting up this release. So of course, you'll see a lot of great shit in
this one. Also don't be confused by the age of some of the articles (ie. the new years
top ten was written in December, but came out with this issue).

There are a few changes though. Catslash will no longer be released monthly. Pushing an 
issue out every month was not easily done and was one of the reasons we shut down. So, in 
returning we decided to forget it and only release issues when we have everything together.

We have a lot of new writers among us this month too... after getting Poison to rally 
the group we have some writers from CATS. With all of our new support...we should be
up again permanently!

I have changed my alias back to Jeriatrick. Alot of people still know me by that
name, and it just seems to be cooler. As well, Spectre (aka. BoomBoom) is now known as
Cpt. Havoc. Just to keep the records straight.

So, here's the return issue...

THE BORING DISCLAIMER:
 Here's the usual legal shit: I am not responsible for anything you do with
the info presented here. It is for informatianl and perhaps humor purposes
only. In other word s you can't tell the judge that I influenced you to kill
your parents. Thanks to the first amendment and the freedom of speech I can
write about anything, hehe. So go ahead and read, for "informational" purposes
only though.


THE INTRODUCTION:


Everybody wants to kill their parents at some point in their life. If you
never wanted to kill your parents why the fuck are you reading this? 
   Below are some nice simple and creative ways to kill your parents, but
first if you are a little bit unsure whether to kill your parents or not
or you just need a good motive to give to Mr.Sheriff  here are some reasons
to kill your parents (or things your parents do that piss you off):
* They annoy you
* They embarrass you
* They piss you off
* They ground you
* They attempt to limit your freedoms (like no tv or no computer)
* They starve you (like if you get grounded and are sent up to your room
  without dinner)
* They overfeed you forcing you to eat until your stomach bursts and blood
  starts gushing out your mouth...
* They bug you about your grades
* They are bossy and ignorant
* They hit you
* They drink booze themselves but wont let you have any
* Etc...etc...etc...
  Now that you have a motive or two (or three, or four) here are the actual
  killing methods:
ELECTROCUTION:
    This method is usually used on the female parent(s) also know as "the mom."
    When your mom is taking a bath bring your sterio into the bathroom and plug
    it in, if the bitch asks you what the hell you are doing tell her to fuck off
    and then just drop the sterio (that's plugged in and turned on) in to the
    bathtub. Then just sit back and watch the fireworks.
UPS: Your mom will die quickly and almost soundlessly.
DOWNS: You have to see your mom nude, not very pleasant unless you like that sort
       of thing. You have to get a new sterio. Dead cooked corpses don't smell all
       that great...

SHOOTING: 
    This is a pretty simple consept even for all of you high school dropouts. All
    you need is a gun, some ammo (DUH, what did you think?) and a silencer, or
    something else to muffle the noise, like a pillow. However you don't need a
    silencer if you live in a remote area like Australia (yes that was a joke). Then
    once you have all the stuff just sneak up behind your parents and shoot them in
    the heart or the neck, or for all of you sadistic bastards shoot them in the head
    multiply times (hehe). Also, if you want to make your parents sad, wait until they
    turn around and see you and then shoot them in the leg first so you can see them
    suffer.
UPS: This method will absolutly kill your parents unless you are  a REALLY bad shot.
DOWNS: Someone might hear you (shoot the gun off). Or someone might hear your parents
       screaming.

CHOKING:
     The best time to choke your parents is when they are sleeping, unless you are
     really strong and can overpower them while they are awake. So, assuming your
     parents are asleep you need to sneak into their bedroom and handcuff/tie them
     to the bed/bedframe/, making sure they can't move. Then all you have to do is
     either put plastic bags over their heads (making sure there are no holes in the
     bags) and tie the bags with ropes around their necks so they can't take them off.
     Also for extra silence tape their mouths shut with electrical tape before putting
     on the plastic bags. There are also a variety of other ways to choke your parents
     like put a pillow over their heads, put them in an air tight room...
UPS: This is a really silent method, unless you screw up of course.  
DOWNS: Your parents can wake up while you are handcuffing them...leading to all sorts
       of explaining to do and possibly psychiatric hospitalization for you...ust tell
       them they told you to do it in school or something like that.

SCARING:
    This method usually only works if your parents are really old, have a bad heart,
    take heart medication or have a weak nervous system. If your parents have all of
    the above I am really surprised that they aren't dead yet. All you have to do is
    wait around a corner until your mom and/or dad comes and then jump out and scream
    "BOO!" or "AAAAGH!" You'll be surprised how often this works ;). 
UPS: If this method works your parents will die right away without any noise. 
DOWNS: Your  parents might not actually die but just pass out, so make sure to chop
       off their heads as soon as they are unconsious or "dead." If you don't have an
       axe (no home is complete without one) then you can just jump on top of your
       parents' head with your two feet. But make sure your wearing nice heavy boots.

POISONING:
    This method can be easy or hard. This mostly depends on you and how high your
    obsession with perfectionism is. If your level is high then you'll need to find
    your self some cyanide or other popular high class poison. Try asking Dr.Kevorkian
    (I'm still trying to find his fone #). Anyway, once you get the cyanide or whatever
    put it in your parents' food, then make sure they swallow it. If they do they'll be
    dead in no time (well in about 5 minutes actually). If you don't want to shell out
    the dough for the cyanide all you have to do is put some draino or another oven
    cleaner/drain cleaner in your parents' food. As soon as they eat it they will start
    gagging and if your parents have any brains at all (you'll be surprised how many
    actually do) they will try to reach for the fone to dial 911 or your grandma's
    house to tell her (the grandma or the 911 operator) that they (your parental units)
    are dying. So what you need to do is make sure that the fone is unplugged.
    Coming back to cyanide for a moment here's an interesting fact I found out not too
    long ago: apple seeds have a small percentage of cyanide in them. So what you can do
    is get about 200 apple seeds toss them in a blender add some ice cream and milk, mix
    it all up and then tell your mommy or daddy it's a great health milk shake you just
    found out about. This works even better if your parents are health food phreaks. 
    Another poisoning technique is to get some poison mushrooms and if your parents
    are cooking something with mushrooms put in the poison ones too. You can also
    give your parents stuff that they are allergic to, like if they are allergic
    to spicy stuff put some red pepper in their salad or whatever. If they are
    lactose-intolerant 9can't eat milk products) put some cheese in their spaghetti.
    Just remember to unplug the fone so your parents can't call anybody.
UPS:If you used the cyanide method(s) your parents will die for share in about 5 
    minutes unless they start sticking 2 fingers down their throats and barfing
    it all up, (but we can prevent that by chopping off their fingers, can't we?
DOWNS: Sometimes if you feed your parents stuff they are allergic to, they will
       might not actually die but they will experience some great discomforts that
       can be really fun to watch.

BOOBY TRAPS:
       There is a shitload of booby traps you can make. There is also a shitload of
       booby trap how-to philes out there in the great underground. So I wont get into
       all of those electrical and mechanical traps because there are enough places
       that have them allready. Just keep in mind that the basic principle is to wire
       something so when your parents open a door or something or turn on a light it
       completes the circuit and blows them (your parents) up. Anyway, here is a nice
       quick simple trap I came up with one fine day. All you need is a hammer (a real
       one, not one of those shitty play-skool plastic ones). If you don't have a hammer
      you can either a) go and steal one, b) use a heavy rock, or c) use another heavy
      object. So once you get your hammer you need a door that opens inwards (into the
      room) (if your parents are going into the room), or a door that opens outwards
      (out of the room) (if your parents are coming out of the room. Once you find the
      right door balance the hammer or the rock on top of the door. Letting part of it
      rest on the wall next to the door. So now when your parents open the door the
      hammer or rock will fall on their heads and crush their skull instantly (making
      a cool crunch sound like the one in all of those old crunch commercials). 
UPS: If this method works your parents will die instantly and soundlessly (except for
     the crunch sound, hehe).
DOWNS: Sometimes if your parents have a really thick skull this method will not kill
       them but give them a concussion. So as soon as they are unconcious and you think
       they are dead jump on their head or use the hammer to whack them a couple of times,
       like those arcade games where you hit the gators or the groundhogs. Also when
       jumping on their heads wear those mountain climbing boots with spikes on the
       bottom for extra fun!

DEPRESSION/SUICIDE:
       First of all I want YOU to memorize something: depression = suicide. Remember
       that scientific formula. This method usually takes some planning and some patience
       too. Now what you do is leave a suicide note pinned to the fridge saying soemthing
like this:

      Dear Mom and Dad,
   Thanks for making life such a hell for such a hell for me. You made me realize that
   life is not worth living anymore so I should just end it all right now. I am sick and
   tired of your yelling and arguing with me. I just can't take all that shit anymore.
   I can't stand living with you and I can't stand YOU! Therefore, I feel that this is
   the only way out, so I decided to 
(pick a suicide method or add one of your own)
a) go to the ocean and drown
b) Jump of a __________ (write in the name of a high place in your area, like a hill
   or something.
   So thank you once again dear mother and father for making me realize how
   shity/unkind/cold/mean the world is. If it wasn't for you I would still be alive
   in this fucked-up world. 

p.s. By the time you read this I will allready be free (dead) so don't bother looking
     for my body. 
Sincerely your dead son/daughter,
_________   ( sign your name)

The main focus point in the letter is to make them feel responsible for your death.
This letter will create an even stronger effect on your parents if you just had a
big fight the night before with them. Also don't forget to write the letter by hand
so they will know it's genuine. 
    Once you finish writing the letter and you put it in a visible spot you'll need
to find a place to hide out in for a while, like a treehouse. Just make sure you
have plenty of food and water (about a week's worth because it usually doesn't
take more than a week for your parents to snap). Then if you are lucky your parents
will soon decide life isn't worth living without their child and kill themselves,
(if you are not the only child kill your brother(s) and/or sister(s) and add their
signatures to the suicide note above). Now if you hear a gunshot or 2 in the next
couple of days it means you have succeded and your mission is accomplished. I you
don't hear a gunshot it could mean that your parents chose a different way to die or
that you need to take more drastic measures. 
    So what you do is late at night or early in the morning (around 2-3 am, or
whenever your parents are asleep) dress up in pale white clothing, make your skin
paler by using make up bought at a costume/art/prank store or sprinkle some flour
all over yourself. Also darken your eyes by using eyeliner or whatever and smear
some ketchup around yourself to represent blood. Then go to your parents' bedroom
and start saying in a low and slow voice, "Join me mommy and daddy, join me, it's
lonely here. I'm sad and I'm alone. It's very very cold." Do this repeatedly for a
week or so and it will definetly drive your parents "over the edge." 
UPS: This method is really fun to try and it gives you a chance to mess with your
parents' heads, not to mention you get to practice your acting skills. 
DOWNS: This method takes a little while, so like I said you need to have patience.
Another downer is that your parents might insist on looking for your body so they
can give little Johny a proper funeral. So what you have to do is order a human
corpse from the a science/biology catalog or get one (steal one in layman's terms) 
rom the local morgue. 

HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE BODIES

    Ok, so you've finally killed your parents, but now you have 2 corpses lying
around in the living room. Not exactly the furnishing style you were going for?
Well here are a couple of ways you can get rid of those 2 dead things in your
house:

* Drag them outside and dump them in the dumpster. Just make sure you pile some
  trash bags over them so they are not noticeable.
* If you are to weak to do the above method you should start working out, but
  for now you can chop the bodies into decent size pieces with a nice ax or
  butcher knife. Then put the pieces in a plastic bag, then put the plastic
  bag in a brown bag, then close the brown bag, then toss the bags into the
  dumpster. Or you can eat the meat if you are into that sort of thing.
* Toss the bodies into the ocean, when the tide is leaving.
* Bury the bodies in your backyard. Just make sure you bury them deep enough
  (the standard  6 feet should do just fine). You can also plant some flowers
  over the "graves" to disguise it as a garden. 

Well that's the end of this phile look for other philez by me wherever you got
this one.

ps. Email me all your threats at xcon0@yahoo.com or you can even fax me at
    1-559-663-4067

Tootles everyone

                                    '''''''''''''

	This coming year is new and uncertain, but some thing's never change,
like the desire to make razor sharp shrapnel explode. Also assholes, and hampster
sodomizing s.o.b.'s to use them against. So old 30.6 here is going to share with
you an easy effective and best of all heap way of constructing a glass frag
grenade!

	Materials:
		-glass bottle preferably a clearly canadian bottle
		-vinegar
		-baking powder
		-plastic bag
		-plastic bottle cap

	Instructions:

	Step 1:
	In the glass bottle add about an inch or so (or a finger joint for those of
      you that can't work a ruler) of vinegar.

	Step 2:
	Put the corner of the plastic bag into the bottle so that a fair portion is
      in the mouth of the bottle let it hang about three inches blow in ti to
      expand if to work able proprtion.

	Step 3:
	Load the plastic bag up with the baking powder.

	Step 4:
	Cut excess plastic That hangs off of the top of the bottle, leaving enough to
      just sit over the top of the "Lips" of the bottle.

      Step 5:
      Place bottle cap over the Lips of the plastic bag insuring that the plastic bag
      will not come loose or spill it's contents. Tighten Lid.

      This allows the bottle to be carried without fear of accidental detonation and
      also easily passes off as an everyday Item.

      Step 6:
      Finding something/someone that deserves to be hurt (Jehova's witness',    
      Mime's, Mailmen, communists, etc.). Unscrew lid, let bag drop into liquid
      place lid back on.

      Step 7: 
      Shake Violently, insuring good mixture and throw toward general vicinity of      
      intended target, Remember that it's the shrapnel that does the damage, not the
      actual detonation (there is no cuncussive force in the reaction).


	Have Fun with this little number, but Beware of your mixture ratio, Materials, and    
      General I.Q of your friends, for this could cause general discomfort to the human
      body, namely yours.

         Anyone ever ask you, "Hey, do you like dogs?", and have you ever responded "Sure 
do, we should exchange recipies!" If so, then you'll like what's up ahead, I'm going to 
tell you how Jeriatrick and I, singlehandedly gave a dog the shits, then cured him (weeks 
later). 

      Well, One day, while fiddling with a rocket launcher, Jeriatrick and I were 
complaining about a dog that constantly barked when we went by her yard, we didn't like 
this dog, and we hated the canines that she owned. So we went into his kitchen and got 
some hot dogs, and the various laxative related shit we found in his cupboards (we couldn't
find any ex-lax), I mixed up a spicy yet potent solution while Jeriatrick performed surgery
on the hot dogs, hollowing them out in preparation for the devastating payload. When all 
was ready, we loaded up the "Dogs of War" and proceded to the alleyway where the dogs lie.

      Upon arrival, we heard no dogs, no people, nothing. we wondered if the dogs were in 
the yard or in the house, upon tapping the fence, we heard them, barking and running at the
fence. We grinned with evil in our eyes, dropped the payload over the fence, and ran off. 
after reaching safe distance, we stopped, laughed, and continued laughing untill we fell 
down. Weeks later, back at Jeriatrick's house, still fiddling with that rocket launcher, 
he enters the room saying "You know, we did a bad thing to those dogs a few weeks ago, we 
should go remedy the situation." he then showed me a bottle of anti laxative. After 
laughing a few mintues, we prepared the medicinal charges, and proceded on the way. It 
pretty much went the same way as the last one... with us running laughing our asses off.

From the guy who brought you such articles as the exploding cigarette, comes another nugget
of destruction. Since this is to vbe the last issue of CATSlash I thought they should go 
out, not with a whimper but a BANG!!. 

I actually wrote this last 5th of Nov (1998), so this article is dedicated to the original 
anarchist, Guy Fawkes (Well, he tried to kill the king but got caught and killed. How much 
more anarchic can you get?), and I felt compelled to burn some stuff. Here is my guide to 
incendiaries.


Contents:
Fire Fudge
The Incendiary Brick
Napalm (again!!)
Explosive "Snowball"
Peroxyacetone

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(NON-EDIBLE) FIRE FUDGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Description.



(1) This item consists of a mixture of sugar and potassium chlorate in a hot water solution 
which solidifies when cooled to room temperature.

It can be used to ignite most incendiaries, except thermite. It may be used directly as an 
incendiary on rags, dry paper, dry hay, or in the combustible vapour above liquid fuels.

(2) The incendiary can be initiated by a fuse cord, string fuse, or concentrated sulphuric acid.

(3) Fire fudge resembles white sugar fudge having a smooth, hard surface. The advantage of 
this incendiary material over Sugar-Chlorate, is its malleability. The procedure for 
preparation must be followed closely to obtain a smooth, uniform material with a hard 
surface.

*CAUTION: THIS MATERIAL IS POISONOUS AND SHOULD NOT BE EATEN BY ANYONE WITH A SURVIVAL 
INSTINCT.*

b. Material and Equipment.

Granulated Sugar (NOT powdered or confectioners' sugar)
Potassium chlorate (no coarser than the sugar. It's in crystals so you can grind it -CAREFULLY- 
to the same grade as the sugar.)
Metallic, glass, or enamelled pan.
Measuring container
Spoon (non-metallic)
Thermometer (93-121 degrees Centigrade)

c. Preparation.

(1) Clean the pan by boiling some clean water in it for about five minutes. Discard the 
water, pour one measure of clean water into the pan and warm it. Dry the measuring 
container and add one measure-full of sugar. Stir the liquid until the sugar dissolves.

(2) Boil the solution until a fairly thick syrup is obtained.

(3) Remove the pan from the source of heat to a distance of at least six feet and shut off
the heat. Rapidly add two measures of potassium chlorate. Stir gently for a minute to mix 
the syrup and powder, then pour or spoon the mixture into appropriate moulds. If the mould 
is paper, it can usually be peeled off when the fire fudge cools and hardens. Pieces of 
cardboard or paper adhering to the incendiary will not impair its use. Pyrex, glass, or 
ceramic moulds can be used when a clear, smooth surface is desired. It is recommended that 
section thickness of moulded firefudge be at least one-half inch. If desired, moulded fire 
fudge can be safely broken with the fingers.

THIS STUFF IS FRICTION/SHOCK SENSITIVE, SO DON'T THROW IT AT THE WALL OR RUB IT WITH 
SANDPAPER!!!!

d. Application.

(1) Place a piece of fire fudge on top of the incendiary. Minimum size should be about one 
inch square and one-half inch thick. Prepare the fire fudge for ignition with a fuse cord, 
string fuse, or concentrated sulphuric acid in the normal manner.

(2) If only battery grade sulphuric acid is available, it must be concentrated before use 
to a specific gravity of 1.835, by heading it in an enamelled, heat resistant glass or 
porcelain pot, until dense, white fumes appear.

(3) When used to ignite flammable liquids, wrap a quantity of the incendiary mixture in a 
non-absorbent material and suspend it inside the container near the open top. The container 
must remain open for easy ignition and combustion of the flammable liquid.

(4) To minimise the hazard of premature ignition of flammable liquid vapours, allow at 
least two feet of fuse to extend from the top edge of an open container of flammable liquid
before lighting the fuse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE INCENDIARY BRICK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.

(1) This incendiary is composed of potassium chlorate, sulphur, sugar, iron filings, and 
wax. When properly made, it looks like an ordinary building brick and can be easily 
transported without detection. The incendiary brick will ignite wooden walls, floors, and 
many other combustible materials.

(2) All igniters can directly ignite this incendiary. To ignite this incendiary with White 
Phosphorus Solution, the solution must first be poured on absorbent paper and the paper 
placed on top of the brick.

b. Material and Equipment.

                                                         Parts By
                                                           Volume

  Potassium chlorate (powdered)..........................      40
  Sulphur (powdered)......................................     15
  Granulated sugar.......................................      20
  Iron filings...........................................      10
  Wax (beeswax or candle wax)............................      15
  Spoon or stick
  Brick mould
  Red paint
  Measuring cup or can
  Double boiler
  Heat source (hot plate or stove)



c. Preparation.



(1) Fill the bottom half of the double boiler with water and bring to a boil.

(2) Place the upper half of the boiler on the lower portion and add the wax, sulphur, 
granulated sugar, and iron filings in the proper amount.

(3) Stir well to blend all the materials evenly.

(4) Remove the upper half of the double boiler from the lower portion and switch off the 
heat source.

CAUTION: EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE ACCIDENTAL IGNITION OF THE 
MIXTURE IS POSSIBLE. SOME MEANS OF EXTINGUISHING A FIRE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE. IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO KEEP FACE, HANDS, AND CLOTHING AT A REASONABLY SAFE DISTANCE DURING THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PREPARATION. A FACE SHIELD AND FIREPROOF GLOVES ARE RECOMMENDED.

(5) CAREFULLY add the required amount of potassium chlorate and again stir well to obtain a 
homogenous mixture.

(6) Pour the mixture into a brick mould and set aside until it cools and hardens.

(7) When hard, remove the incendiary from the mould, and paint it red to simulate a normal 
building brick.

d. Application.

(1) When painted, the incendiary brick can be carried with normal construction materials 
and placed in or on combustible materials. (You can lay the brick as normal and wait for 
the building to be finished before burning it (You'll obviously need to mark your bricks 
somehow). Alternatively you can use a large number and then when it is done, burn the wall 
down!!!!!

(2) A short time delay in ignition can be obtained by combining fuses and one of the 
igniters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAPALM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, everyone already has done this topic to death, so I'll keep it short, but it should be 
in here for the purposes of completeness.

Materials:
Gasoline
Styrofoam (polystyrene) or thin plastics (e.g. table tennis balls)
(Failing that you can use shredded bars of soap or (I'm not sure about this) washing-up 
liquid i.e. Fairy etc etc.)
Oh yeah, and you need a big tub/basin/thing to mix them in.

This is so simple. First put loads of gasoline into the tub. Then add Styrofoam (or balls 
or soap) and mix it in until it reaches a gooey, jelly-like consistency. Add until the 
petrol is saturated and voila! your napalm is ready to use.

A phun thing to do with this stuff is to put it in a lightbulb bomb. Remove the glass from 
a bulb by heating the metal with a blowtorch, and phill with napalm... then put it back 
together and screw into the socket (with the switch off!!!!!!). Now leave the room and 
probably the building and wait for someone to switch it on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SNOWBALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, this is not an incendiary but...
Take ammonium triiodide (you know, pour ammonium over iodine crystals to saturation point), 
flour, & water and form this into a snowball. Leave this 'snowball' somewhere where it will
do serious damage when it dries out. (substituting some magnesium flash powder for some 
(not all) of that flour helps things a bit.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PEROXYACETONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MATERIALS:
4ml Acetone
4ml Hydrogen Peroxide (30% solution)
Concentrated hydrochloric acid
A test tube
Filter paper

THIS STUFF IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE AND SHOCK-SENSITIVE SO BE REALLY FUCKING CAREFUL WHEN MAKING
THIS SUBSTANCE, OK?

(1) Add Acetone then Hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.
(2) Add 4 drops of hydrochloric acid.
(3) Wait. A white solid should form within 20-30 mins.
(4) If it doesn't, warm the tube in a water bath at 40 deg Celsius.
(5) Allow the reaction to continue for 2 hours.
(6) Swirl the slurry and filter it . Leave it on the paper to dry for another 2 hours.
(7) Light from a long distance!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use these recipes to maximum effect.
Have phun!!,
	Maladjusted Freak.

===========================================================================================

Hey everyone, since DreD left the mag there's been a certain thing missing. A special
column dedicated to revenge and destruction on the internet. So, as part of our return 
we've decided to bring back the Internet Pain column!

Today's lesson is on the power of Winnuke attacks. Many of you old school hackers may think
the Winnuke attack is long old and dead. Many of you others may wonder what it is. Well,
a winnuke attack is a set of out of band data sent to port 139 on a Windows box. This
results in an instant blue screen of death, and all TCP/IP connections are toast until
they reboot. This is great for a lamer  on IRC or just someone you want to extract 
vengeance upon.

There are many great programs available to do this. On the Mac, there is Winnuke Pro, on 
the PC there is an app named Winnuke as well. DON'T download Winnuke 4 on a Windows box,
its a trojan! On linux, there is also a program called winnuke.c, but it is a bitch to
find.

Now, to use winnuke all you need is the IP of a wintel box that you want to hit. The only
problem with it is that some versions of Windows aren't vulnerable. Windows 95 is 
vulnerable unless it has the winsock 2 patch. Windows 98 is not vulnerable. Windows NT is
as long it is below service pack four (and even then sometimes multiple winnuke attacks 
can cause a core dump). So you're pretty much set.

Some funny shit is also to get a copy on your local school/work LAN. Guaranteed that your
lazy sysadmin hasn't applied patches, and your company hasn't upgraded to Windows 98 
beacuse it is unstable and eats nuts. So you can wreck shit all over the fucking place.

Well thats it for this column. Have phun!

*******************************THE*PAR*ONE**********************************

By : Cpt. Havoc,

This is some whacked ass shit that a phriend and I came up with last summer. It's a 45mm. 
golf ball launching cannon ( or just a fuckin' big shot gun ) that we threw together with 
some junked shit that we found near a dumpster.  We haven't fired it yet but we're positive
that it will work ( or it may just kill us )
and are testing it soon ( watch for an update ).

Materials Needed:
-1.5m of THICK steel pipe with a 45mm inside diameter capped off on one end.
-A drill with metal drilling bits.
-Birthday cake sparklers.
-toilet paper rolls ( with no toilet paper on them ).
-Golf balls.
-Lots of gun powder.
-And of course, Duct tape. ( The "force" from Star Wars, it has a dark side, a light side, 
and it holds the whole universe together! )

First, drill a hole large enough to push a sparkler through about 3cm in from the cap on 
the pipe, through one side only. Next, make amunition. For the ammo, duct tape one end of a
toilet paper roll shut, forming a cup. Then fill it with gu powder leaving about 3cm of 
room at the top. Next, cram a golf ball into the end of the roll, viola! instant artillery 
round.

Now take a sparkler, and cut the bare wire off.  next scrape off enough of the powder on 
one end to make a crude point. Now slide the round into the gun barrel, with the duct tape 
facing the back of the gun, until it hits the back. Now stab the sparkler point first into 
the hole you drilled, so that it pierces the toilet paper roll. make sure that a good 4-5cm
is still visible outside the gun.
Next ( and this is crucial for your survival ) tape around the base of the sparkler on the
cannon or some smart ass sparks may prematurely ignight the round inside and really fuck 
you up. If you've ever seen Starship Troopers, then you can imagine what you could look 
like if you fuck this up!
You may want to mount this on something, and fire it outside of the city 'cause this'll be 
fuckin' loud! Now go lay some unholy scrack to something with your ney toy, and make me 
proud!

Here are some crude drawings of what the cannon and rounds should look like.

                                                                              hole

                                    '''''''''''''

My Complete Guide of Useless Knowledge - By a newbie for newbies

INTRO -- if you ever read then you probably read the HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 
well, there is on somewhat newer editions a part called "The Guide to the Guide", well take
this as that, i will give you the basic proccesses and true basics which i think are 
fundamental, and then from this info you gotta read text files, and talk to ppl.
whatever you do, don't go round saying you know shit, and are a hacker, or anything like 
that, it'll only get you in trouble and make your life a social misery. i know a kid who 
kept reading 1 chapter out of programming books and he claimed he was a programmer, he read
1 chapter of an assembly book, went to a disassembler, changed a simple mathematical 
equasion, and called himself a cracker. everybody hates him. dont do that to yerself.
lame advice end
--nothingmuch

Anyways, i keep being pissed at all the articles i see, that are always for more advanced 
hackers, well, me, i dunno shit, thus i sat my ass down and decided to write this sort of 
newbie guide to UNIX hacking for those who want to learn.
ok, so yer a newbie, yeah? you wanna hack, yeah? well this is not the way to really learn, 
if ya wanna be a hacker then read text files, download shit, and best of all, talk to ppl.
i am writing this so that ppl who might wanna hack get an idea bout what hacking is and 
also learn maybe a thing or two (or not).
ok, so here we go, if you wanna gain root access to a UNIX webserver -- well i dunno how to
explain this step by step, coz 1 i only have LinuxPPC *LIVE*, i.e. i can't really do 
anything on it cept learn bash, and my dad keeps forgetting the full version. I do however 
know the basics of account gaining, and that depends on how dumb the user is, and a few 
other factors

now if you wanna hack a UNIX at most times you will be outa luck, coz these days most 
passwd files are shadowed. Sooooo, you go to www.kukluxklan.org and figure out their using 
linux, which in most cases don't have shadowing... get guest login, either by trying one of
the many lists you see in every hacking tut, or ask (it's amazing what ppl might let you 
do, i got an account on the university's servers coz i "wanted to play around on a UNIX 
shell..." however they have passwd shadowing, and raciest ppl make me sick, so that's a 
no-no for me with the kkk d00ds, so then we skip on to the second part, i.e. getting passwds.
So, you got in, eh? you have access, eh? well that's (for me and most ppl i know) the first 
part, so now get a passwd file cracker, like MacCrac, and do the following:
type in your UNIX shell prompt the following:
prompt*>cat /etc/passwd
*notice that the prompt may and will vary.
you should get a sort of text file, containing something like this:

root:Afn3589:PRIVELIGED USER:/:/etc/bash
user1:Fk399/xahdj3:100:100:John Doe:/home/usr/user1/:/etc/bash
guest::1:1:Guest Account:/home/guest/:/etc/bash

and so forth, feilds may vary.
let's look at what you see and disect:
                                       this is the home dir
                                        \     this is the shell
                                         \      \
user:KJfnkma9324ksa/faj3:2000:1000:User:/home/:/etc/bash
 |    |                  |_______|  |
 |    |                    |        this is the user's name
 |    |                    this is the GECOS
 |    this is the password
 this is the user login

*login: this is what you type in the login prompt
*password: this is what you would have typed in the password prompt had it not been encrypted...
*GECOS: this is your rank and group, the example user belongs to group 1000, and his rank is 2000 of 65535
*user's name: this is the users name/nick
*home dir: the home directory, where a users files are
*shell: the shell a user uses, might vary so to disable commands

now, what you do is you take the list you got, and stuff it in the 'passwd' file in 
MacCracs folder, and get a LARGE dictionary file, and a STRONG computer (not like mine)
use MacCrac to crack the passwd file and you should probably get a few out of a large list,
if they use real words

now, if you got root's password then you're one lucky bastard, you got admin, if you 
didn't, use the user with the same shell as root (see the description) and the highest 
'rank'

from here you would normally take a UNIX book and learn how to fuck up the kkk's site, but 
careful now, don't get intensive, these things ARE logged/traceable, so don't login more 
than 2 times per day per IP, and don't do much harm, know who you are pretending to be, so 
you can cover up, and clear your name (i'm *NOT* saying frame someone, it is the ugliest 
thing to do when you are a hacker) if you get cought *REMOTELY*.
if someone is on to you and tells you that on a UNIX Talk window (err, no window, unless 
you're on a smart terminal or the actual computer running X or X-Windows) DISCONNECT 
IMMEDIATLY! and never stay logged in for more than 1 hour at a time, it might raise 
suspitions.

a little more for true newbies:
if you are very new to this world then there are a few ethic rules, so don't try anything 
before you know who you are s'posed to be and what yer s'posed to do.

if you have any comments, and correction (well, few is not relevant here) then i would 
appreciate em, mail me at nothingmuch@newmail.net,
if you feel like you can do a better job, be my guest, i'm a newbie, i definatly have some 
mistakes, and i explain stuff horribly...
peace

                                    '''''''''''''

	This story is about a guy named Dan, real dim little shit, a few rounds short of a full 
clip (If you know what we mean). Basically, Dan thought he was pretty smart, a cool guy, 
and Jolly Roger Incarnate (Yeah, a lamer), So when 30 odd 6 taught this guy about the 
awesome might of the Frag Grenade, he tried it as per instruction. It worked like a charm. 
(This is the Normal part of the story, but it gets worse) You see, this is where Dan's 
moronic brain thought "Hey, why don't I play around with the materials in this frag 
grenade? Then I'll be cool!" So he did, he got a large glass bottle, grossly played with 
the Proportions of the mixture, and got a buddy to help him. (Please note that by doing so,
he Ignored the safety instructions left to him by 30 odd 6, thereby inviting disaster) So 
Dan and his buddy went out to a field, set it up, and started shaking the bottle. But since
he played with the proportions of the mixture, the bottle exploded earlier than 
anticipated, like while still in his hand. Dan got a piece of Glass an inch away from his 
Juggular, plus in his hand. While his friend got clipped by the shrapnel that went into his 
arms. The idiots were lucky that none of the peices went into their eyes.

	By reading this true story, you can see how idiocy and not using instructions correctly 
could cause bodily injury risking death. The moral of this story is "DON'T FUCK AROUND WITH 
THE INGREDIENTS, INSTRUCTIONS, AND THE MATERIALS OF ANY FILE YOU DIDN'T WRITE UNLESS YOU DO 
IT SAFELY!!!! YOU CAN HURT YOURSELF FUCKING BAD! WE MEAN IT!!!!! Thank you and keep the 
Napalm burning.

Phucking up someone's phone life.
By the Maladjusted Freak
Date: 25/09/98

Well, I haven't written in a while so I feel it is time I produced a new article.
I adapted these from the Anarchist's Cookbook (originally written by the Jolly Roger).

There are numerous ways to fuck up someone's phone life, even those of you who are less 
technologically-minded can have some fun...

1. Order lots of phone books.
It helps if you know his phone number, address, and can get a copy of a previous bill. This 
last is not really necessary but you will need to be pretty convincing over the phone.
Call up the operator, give his name address and phone number and say the you need copies of 
every phone book in the UK (or wherever you're doing this from). He will get them sent to 
his house and a very large bill. If he sends them back you can call the op back and say 
that you were away for a few days and your friend who was watching the place didn't know 
they were for you. Ask them to re-order and he will get them again!!

2 Change & Unlist
Call the op. Say "Hello, this is <loser's name>, I'd like to change my number, because I 
have getting lots of prank calls recently." They will give you a new number. ", then you 
say "I'd also like to unlist my no.", and you being a customer, they won't say no. Now, 
anyone who calls Mr Loser will get a message saying that this number has been changed to an

3 Charge
Call the op again. you will usually get different ones each time so this is low-risk 
anyway, but only a complete dickhead would do this stuff from their home phone so...
say I need to charge this call to my home phone at <Phone#>. 
They will ask for your name and address etc etc etc. which you should have in the first 
place.Now call, oh, I don't know, the Outer Hebrides (look in an atlas) or something and 
leave it off the hook for awhile. Now he will get a big bill for several hundred (or 
thousand depending on your currency and phone company) of er... whatever your currency is.

4 Call Divert
This requires about three or four accomplices. Get everyone away from the Customer Service 
counter in, say Toys R Us ("Can you help me? I can't seem to find this item where it should 
be...") then grab the phone and call the op from there. Tell them that you're the customer 
services manager and say that you'd like call forwarding from this phone to your victim's 
phone #. His phone will NEVER stop ringing.

As you may have spotted, the above techniques depend heavily on social engineering, so you 
need to be good at this in order to be effective.

That's it for now. If I think of any more I'll let you know.

                  ''''''''''''''''''File #11 of 14 ''''''''''
                                    ''''''''''''''                        

       Greetings all, this article is dedicated to those true to life lamers that go into 
chat rooms and try and pick people up... Yes their dumb, yes their most likely pug ugly 
dickmunchers who sit around a comic book store playing ridiculous card games that aren't 
worth the paper they're printed on, and yes their most likely bound to be little 
pantywaists who end up studying computer science as if it were a new religion. That's why 
I'm gonna bash 'em here.



        Now during the lag time that catslash wasn't publishing, I scoured the net to see 
what it really was, past the quickly diminishing anarchist sites, and past the Piracy sites
where oh so many people get warez these days. All there is, after our golden age of anarchy 
ended, was Porn, Pop Music fan sites, trekkies, and chat rooms. Now being the straight 
shooting Muslim psycho that I am, I avoided the first three, and decided to see what kind 
of moron was infesting the chat rooms.... the horror..... oh the horror. The menace of chat
is truly beyond words, especially on IRC..... 

        Now for example's sake, we'll assume they use mIRC, now these people, whom we'll 
call mIRC monkeys, are really rather dim as compared to the enlightened masses of the 
anarchist Combine. Most of them are aged 11-19, the rest are either children or pedophiles. 
They'll go on to a server like Dal.net for example. There are three different types of mIRC
 monkey: 



1. The dipshit - (A.K.A Lamers)The guy's go into a room and try to find stupid girls to  
                 have cybersex with. Now bear in mind, all cybering really is is jacking 
                 off to what's on a screen. And geeks will use this because they can't find 
                 a real girl.....

2. The Cyberditz - (A.K.A cyberhoes) The stupid teenage girls that use symbols from the       
                   windows character map to spel out their name in an attempt to look cool.   
                   Now these girls are usually pop music fans who spend their time mooning 
                   over the Backdoor Boys, N'Stync, and Ricky martin, the famous border 
                   jumping mexican who scored a green card by singing. 

3. The Nerds - (A.K.A Trekkies) The really nerdy folk who have rooms dedicated to their  
               Idolic false gods : Gene Roddenberry, George Lucas, William Shattner, 
               Patrick Stewart, and as always, Leonard Nimoy. One must remember those time  
               honored gimps who think their klingon's, and the fact that they actually   
               dress like that in real life too.

       So to summarize, chat jockeys are the true evil of the net, yes satanists, 
pedophiles, and hacker wannabees are bad, but chat jockeys are just taking up decent ram, 
one day they'll all end up face down in a tar pit somewhere.

There is a mothod that is unknown to a lot of people in the ways of hacking. It is a way to
attack any machine, even through a firewall, as long as someone is browsing the net. This 
way is through hostile html/javascript that is inserted into web pages.

The most popular example of this is seen in the most exploitable browser, Microsoft 
Internet Explorer. In IE3, you could click on a link that crashed the browser through this 
html:
<a href="res://aaaaaaaaa...(over 256 characters)>Click here</a>
Since then, people have been working hard to find exploits (and patch exploits) in web 
browsers.

What can these exploits do? Depending on the browser and version, you can do anything from 
force emails to modifying krnl386 on a Windows machine!

If you want more, you'll have to search for them. The best places to find them are:
the Bugtraq archive (http://www.security-focus.com)
Exploit World (http://www.insecure.org)
Rootshell (http://www.rootshell.com)
George Guninsi's Homepage (
These will get you started in the ways of exploiting browsers. The best is Bugtraq because 
you can search for the target browser of your choice. George Guninski is also the best at 
finding exploits for the browsers, so visit him too.

Well, now that you know of the ways of exploiting browsers, good luck, and have phun!

Ah it feels good to be back in the fold again, and here's my first top ten in a while, so I
hope it's up to par.

 ******************************************************************* 
 *        Top Ten things most likely to happen on Y2K              * 
 ******************************************************************* 

10. The Ethiopian Armed Forces invade the rest of Africa in an attempt to find food.
9. The Allies realize that the original key to winning WW2 was to nail the French first.
8. Colonel Kaddafi Finally snaps due to the United States' constant attempts to kill him.
7. The United States Changes the name of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to                   
   Constantly Irritating Arabs (Still CIA)
6. Quebec Become's independant and Aquires Nukes.
5. Russia's Nuclear arsenal launches, but since the missile's are russian, they only work 
   for a few seconds, then fall down again and break open.
4. As a result of Number 5, Russian's can now glow in the dark. (Moreso than before)
3. The Microsoft Portion of the Y2K Patch Malfunctions (big suprise) and Relinquishes 
   Bill Gates' Iron grasp on the world.
2. The Amish/Hutterite Alliance Become the Ruling Class and Force all those nerdy little 
   freaks who studied Web Page Design and E-Commerce to get jobs requiring actual effort.
10. Nothing, everyone feels dumb about Reacting so blindly to all the hype the media put 
    out in a satanic conspiracy to get people to buy products they didn't need or want, but
    rest assured, firm blame and a multi billion dollar suit will be rested upon Microsoft 
   (where it belongs.)
