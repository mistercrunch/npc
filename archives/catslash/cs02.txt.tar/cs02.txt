Welcome back to school! Well if you are in the hellish scenario I'm in,
then this issue may come as something to help you pass the time. 
Maybe you could build a bomb for show and tell...

Anyways, we're back with our second issue, bringing you more toys 
and ideas to try on whatever you want. For all those that read our 
first issue, I hope you liked it and found some use for it other 
than pir8 board credit value. For all those who want to send us 
mail and comments, you can't reach us at Bethlehem (it is private 
access).

Some notes about distribution: Bethlehem now requires a new user 
password, so a lot of people can't get in. The fact that C.A.T.S. 
was recently plunged into problems means that the C.A.T.S. board 
will not be up as soon as we thought. But don't despair! We will 
be uploading our issues to various internet sites, so wherever 
you picked this up would probably be the best place to look for 
further issues. As for mailing us, mail me (Jeriatrick) wherever
you picked this up.

Now on to issue 2!

|                   The Aqua Box                                    |
|                       By: Jeriatrick                              |

  Well, its time for another box, and this is an easy to build one.
Its the Aqua Box. Its origional function was to beat the FBI's Lock
In Trace. The Lock In Trace worked by keeping the voltage in the line
up so they would be able to trace you. Your phone would keep ringing.
The Aqua Box was invented to drain the voltage in the line. I doubt
that you will ever run into the Lock In Trace here, especially since
ESS keeps logs of calls and they only have to look at that, but this
is still a neat toy.
  All you need are: A lightbulb socket (not in the wall), a phone
extension cord, a Lightbulb, and some wire strippers. Ok, take the 
phone extension cord and cut off one end. Strip off the beige or grey
wire and you will see four wires - Red, Green, Yellow, and Black.
Strip the red and green wires. Screw them onto the bottom of the 
lightbulb socket where the wiring goes. Then screw in the light bulb.
There you have it! A genuine Aqua Box!
  To test it, have a friend call. Plug it into a phone jack. If the 
ringing stops: Success! If he says it just suddenly stopped ringing
then it works for sure.
  This is great for controlling your houses phone lines. If you plug
it in the line is dead. No dialtone, no dialing ability, just silen-
ce. I think the phone company computers probably notice it on their
computers, so I wouldn't reccommend using it a lot at your own 
house.
   To use it at a phone box: Plug it into the jack on your Beige Box.
Or place two wires with alligator clips on the end instead of a 
cut phone extension cord.
  Well, I hope you find some use for this box. If not I don't really
care. Have Phun!

  Ok, you've made or bought or built a Pay-TV hacking box.(the one 
  that gives you all the pay channels) Now how do you keep from 
  getting busted. Well, by talking to our contact at SHAW Cable, 
  we learnt a lot.
  The cable company has a detection circuit in their computers. 
  It used to only be used for ratings, to see who was watching 
  what, but now it is used for Pay-TV fraud detection. They can 
  take 6 seconds to trace you. Some boxes have fail safes that 
  hold out on detection for 1/2 an hour, but that is still bad 
  because you can't watch or record the whole movie.Well we 
  found the solution.
   The solution is to get one of those scrambler boxes that 
   are always advertised in the back of Popular Mechanics. 
   You know, the ones for TVs with knobs.I'll type a picture.

--------------

\/          \/

Get it? the black boxes with the red or green digital channel display.
Ok, now heres how you would hook it up:


Cable in-->Scrambler Box--->Pay TV Box--->VCR--->TV

The scrambler box must be before the Pay-TV box in your hookup!
   We have also heard rumors that you can use your VCR instead 
   of a scrambler box. This probably works too, but may not be as
   safe.
Have fun and don't get caught!

|                   Making Certain Chemicals                        |
|               A collection of Chemical Recipies                   |
|                   Brought to you by: Jeriatrick                   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though there are some chemicals that there are no household 
equivelents for, that dosen't mean you can't make them from 
household chemicals. Here's a few chemical making recipies from 
our knowledge and other files we have found.

1. Gunpowder

Everyone should know this one. If you don't heres the chance to 
learn:
75% Potassium Nitrate (Salt Peter)
15% Charcoal
10% Sulphur

Seperately crush each into a fine powder.Then mix. Uses for gunpow-
der will be discussed in another article.

2. Oxygen

Mix Hydrogen Peroxide and Maganese Dioxide (Black battery powder)
together. It will make highly flammable Oxygen. Put a balloon or 
something on top to catch it.

3.Hydrogen

Take some Liguid Plumr and some aluminum foil. Mix them together
and youve got Hydrogen. Place a Balloon or something on top to 
catch it.

4.Potassium Chlorate

This article is from the Jolly Roger's Cookbook III

Potassium chlorate is an extremely volatile explosive compound, 
and has been used in the past as the main explosive filler in 
grenades, land mines, and mortar rounds by such countries as 
France and Germany.  Common household bleach contains a small 
amount of potassium chlorate, which can be extracted by the 
procedure that follows.

First off, you must obtain:

[1]  A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
[2]  A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
[3]  A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh 
     chemicals)
[4]  Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and 
     nutrition stores)

Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin 
heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of 
potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.  
Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, 
and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a battery 
hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.

Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it 
is between room temperature and 0 degrees Celcius.  Filter out the 
crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution again 
and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.

Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with 
distilled water in the following proportions:  56 grams per 100 
milliliters distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils 
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that 
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called 
"fractional crystalization".  These crystals should be relatively 
pure potassium chlorate.

Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to 
drive off all moisture.

5. Chlorine

Chlorine is used in a lot of neat explosives. Heres how to make it.
Mix Ammonia with Clorine Bleach or powder cleanser (like Bon Ami or
Ajax).The Chlorine will stay in the bottle unless the bottle is too
full, because it is heavier than air.

6.Potassium Nitrate

This too is from the Jolly Roger's Cookbook III

Potassium Nitrate is an ingredient in making fuses, among other 
things. Here is how you make it:

Materials needed:

 -3.5 gallons of nitrate bearing earth or other material
 -1/2 cup of wood ashes
 -Bucket or other similar container about 4-5 gallons in volume
 -2 pieces of finely woven cloth, each a bit bigger than the 
  bottom of the bucket
 -Shallow dish or pan at least as large in diameter as the bucket
 -Shallow, heat resistant container
 -2 gallons of water
 -Something to punch holes in the bottom of the bucket
 -1 gallon of any type of alcohol
 -A heat source
 -Paper & tape

Procedure:

 - Punch holes on the inside bottom of the bucket, so that the 
metal is"puckered" outward from the bottom
 - Spread cloth over the holes from the bottom
 - Place wood ashes on the cloth. Spread it out so that it covers 
the entire cloth and has about the same thickness.
 - Place 2nd cloth on top of the wood ashes
 - Place the dirt or other material in the bucket
 - Place the bucket over the shallow container. NOTE: It may need 
support on the bottom so that the holes on the bottom are not 
blocked.
 - Boil water and pour it over the earth very slowly. Do NOT pour 
it all at once, as this will clog the filter on the bottom.
 - Allow water to run through holes into the shallow dish on the 
bottom.
 - Be sure that the water goes through ALL of the earth!
 - Allow water in dish to cool for an hour or so
 - Carefully drain the liquid in the dish away, and discard the 
sludge in the bottom
 - Boil this liquid over a fire for at least two hours. Small 
grains of salt will form - scoop these out with the paper as they 
form
 - When the liquid has boiled down to 1/2 its original volume let 
it sit
 - After 1/2 hour, add equal volume of the alcohol; when this 
mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals appear. This 
is the posassium nitrate.

Purification:

 - Redissolve crystals in small amount of boiling water
 - Remove any crystals that appear
 - Pour through improvised filter then heat concentrated solution 
to dryness.
 - Spread out crystals and allow to dry

7. Sodium Chlorate

Also from the Jolly Roger's Cookbook III...

     Sodium Chlorate is a strong oxidizer used in the manufacture of 
explosives. It can be used in place of Potassium Chlorate.

Material Required                            Sources
-----------------                            -------

2 carbon or lead rods (1 in. diameter        Dry Cell Batteries
by 5 in. long)                               (2-1/2 in. diameter by
                                             7" long) or plumbing
                                             supply store
Salt, or ocean water                         Grocery store or ocean
Sulfuric acid, diluted                       Motor Vehicle Batteries
Motor Vehicle
Water
2 wires, 16 gauge (3/64 in. diameter approx.), 6 ft. long, insulated.
Gasoline
1 gallon glass jar, wide mouth (5 in. diameter by 6 in. high approx.)
Sticks
String
Teaspoon
Trays
Cup
Heavy cloth
Knife
Large flat pan or tray        

Procedure
---------

1) Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 litres (3 
quarts) of water.
2) Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously 
for 5 minutes.
3) Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
4) With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-1/2. Tie
 the wood strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 
 incles apart.
5) Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated
 wire.
6) Submerge 4-1/2 inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
7) With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the
 accelerator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
8) Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then shut it down for 2 hours.
9) Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level
  of the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.

CAUTION: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous!
  Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!

10) Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and 
disconnect wire leads from the battery.
11) Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or 
tray,  leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
12) Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room 
temperature (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or 
more  sodium chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive 
ingredient.

                         ---------------Jolly Roger

8. Iodine

Take a bottle of tinticure of Iodine (the kind in stores).Place
it on a piece of metal and heat it. Have another metal lid over it
with ice on top for the Iodine to sublimate on. WARNING: Don't 
breathe in the iodine fumes or it will condense in your lungs and 
really screw them up!

9.Mercury Fulminate

This is from a PrimoPyro file:

The following are manufacturing processes for small laboratory amounts
 of primary explosives. Follow safety rules if you decide to 
 manufacture them.Mercury Fulminate: This is one of the oldest 
 explosives used for making deto-nators. It is one of the easiest 
 explosives to make.In a glass container put 40 ml. of 90% nitric 
 acid. If you have red fuming nitric acid, put in 10 ml. of water 
 then add 30 ml. of acid one drop at atime until all the acid is 
 added. Water should never be added to acid.The reaction can cause
  splattering of the acid. Acid to water is what you oughta. 
  Water to acid is not very placid.Now, add 5 gms. of mercury 
  metal. As the metal dissolves in the acid, some red fumes of 
  nitric oxides may be released. Avoid breathing them. Allow the
   mixture to stand until the mercury is dissolved. You may want 
   to stir theacid to help the mercury dissolve. The mercury may 
   take some time to dissolveso have patience. When the metal is 
   dissolved, add the acid to 75 ml. of warm 90% ethyl alcohol.
   in a 500 ml. glass container. In a few minutes a reaction will
   start. The mixture will start bubbling and frothing so the 
   reaction musttake place in a large container. White fumes will 
   start coming out of thereaction and must not be inhaled. The 
   white fumes will give way to red fumes then change back to white 
   again. A precipitate will be seen to form in theliquid. This is
    mercury fulminate. When the reaction stops bubbling, pour 
    the liquid into about 12 oz. of water. Wash the precipitate 
    out of the reaction container and into the water. Filter 
    the fulminate out of the water and washit with a few ounces 
    of ethyl alcohol and a final wash of a few ounces of distilled
     water. The fulminate should be a grayish to a white powder. 
     It isbest stored under water until use.Mercury fulminate can 
     be exploded by a 4 cm. drop of a 1 kilo weight. It will become 
     "dead pressed" if subjected to pressures of 25,000 - 30,000 psi
      and will no longer explode but just burn.

10. Nitric Acid

This is also from the Jolly Roger Cookbook III

      There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids 
      for  explosives. One method by which it could be made will be 
      presented. Once   again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD
      NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ                              ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source     
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with             
                                            stopper

1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of 
potassium nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all 
does not dissolve, carefully stir the solution with a glass rod 
until it does.

3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, 
and place the collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating 
until liquid begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The 
liquid that forms is nitric acid.  Heat until the precipitate in 
the bottom of the retort is almost dry, or until no more nitric 
acid is forming.  CAUTION: If the acid is headed too strongly, 
the nitric acid will decompose as soon as it is formed.  This 
can result in the production of highly flammable and toxic gasses 
that may explode.  It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up,
 and then get away from it.

     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black
      powder, simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and 
      filtering out the sulfur and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of 
      potassium nitrate, it would be necessary to dissolve about 90 g
      of black powder in about one litre of boiling water. Filter 
      the dissolved solution through filter paper in a funnel into 
      a jar until the liquid that pours through is clear. The char-
      coal and sulfur in black powder are insoluble in water, and
      so when the solution of water is allowed to evaporate, 
      potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.

Well, these are all the chemical recipies I will put in for now.
Keep reading other issues for more great recipies!

|               Getting Access to Compuserve                        |
|                       By: Jeriatrick                              |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  First you need a copy of the CIM Software. Call their toll free 
line and get a copy mailed to  a false address. This software also 
comes with a new modem.
  Type in all phoney information in the signup program. Use a phoney
or stolen credit card number (Citibank works exceptionally well). Do
not order promotional mailings and stuff (it only attracts unwanted
attention).Signup. The computer will accept any credit card number and
expiry date as long as it matches the proper algorithyms. It does not
check if it is useable! Although you may have to repeat this process 
every few times you call, because when Compuserve checks the credit 
card no. and finds it phoney, they will erase your account. Don't 
worry, just use the signup program again. You don't have to change 
any information, it will still accept you and give you a new account.

  You now have a basic access. To get internet, you need the version
of CIM with the built in Internet Browser (v.3.0 on PCs 2.0 on Macs).
Get this from a friend. You will not get access to a few features
because you have no second password.
  To get full access, you must get into someone's account. The 
process varies.
  The first and easiest way is to log on with your basic account.
Join a conference with the name "Supervisor" or something like that.
Then, chat with people. Say you are Compuserve, you had a hard drive
wipeout or something and you lost their logon number and password.
Some gullible people will fall for this, but be warned, once
Compuserve finds out about this scam, they'll post that "someone
using supervisor names was asking passwords" everywhere they can.
  The second way is to use a terminal program (not the CIM terminal
emulator). Dial Compuserve and when you connect hit CONTROL - C.
It will say HOST NAME:. Type CIS. You will get USER ID:. type in any
Compuserve account number (eg. 120745,783).It will ask you for the
password. This is the hard part. Compuserve automatically assigns
passwords like this: WORD SYMBOL WORD (eg.BIRD*BOAT). Most people
have never changed their password from the one Compuserve gave them,
or they use this style because Compuserve recommends it. There
are some fine utilities for hacking these passwords. Check your local
pir8 board. Then type GO PASSWORD to change it, and the password is 
yours! The guy will have to call Compuserve and pay to get his pass-
word. Keep changing it often to keep him from getting the right one.

Things to remember:
1. Don't attract any attention
2. Don't post any messages
3. Don't play the online games
4. Don't chat with a hacked account
5. Be very Careful when you mess with Compuserve!!!

|                  The Dissolving of ED Tel                         |
|                      By:Jeriatrick                                |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you noticed all the ED Tel workers screwing with the phone booths
lately. Wonder why? Or perhaps you saw the Tellus van/worker in the
season premier of X-Files. Why was it Tellus and not AGT? Its the
beginning of a lot of changes to the 
telecommunications world in Alberta.

First off, by the end of 1996, ED Tel and AGT will become Tellus. 
That is why, they have been changing the phone booths to that faggy 
purple coloring and changing the ED Tel Logo to the Tellus logo. 
After talking to several linemen and such, I learnt that the same 
thing will happen to AGT. This is only the start (I was really 
ticked when I heard this), because Tellus will redo all of ED Tel's 
services. That means all of those precious loop, ringback, etc 
numbers from our exchange scans will be changed!! What a way to 
start 1997.

Secondly, there will be a new local compeditor to ED Tel/Tellus 
here in Edmonton. They will be moving in from Ontario to compete 
with ED Tel for local calling. They are suppost to install their 
own lines, but according to the ED Tel people, they probably will 
just rent the existing ones. They are rumored to have shittier 
service than ED Tel, but are a lot cheaper. We will probably 
publish more about them in further issues.

With Tellus taking over AGT, expect a lot of changes. Sure, Tellus 
has owned them for a few years already, but those were just set-up 
years. With this final process emerging, expect lots more security 
on rural boxes. It will not be as easy as it was to phreak from the 
country.

Well, I hope this has given you some insight as to what the hell 
is going on here. Expect more changes than outlined here, but 
remember, a lot is still in the works.

        Hello my fellow phreakers, today on the vengence
column, how to annoy your enemies, personally, I have
rather good experience in this field of expertise, so here's
what you do. First of all, you find out how to draw, second,
you find a lot of paper(either looseleaf or blank white),
third, you draw a halfassed picture of him that does both insult
him and imply a lot, forth , You include the word "story" and
explain the happenings of the picture, fifth, use stealth to
deploy the picture where everyone can see it, sixth, run
like hell and keep real quiet about it to protect your
identity.these
are the tricks of the trade, use them wisely and don't
squeal,
see ya in hell!

        This is a Catslash special report by poison ice, the
connection corner will be back next issue, but for now, this
is the report. The person known as "Elektrik fire", who has
created the N.E.R.D'S society ( Negitive Energy Rechannled
Destructively) has Wrongfully used my name and jeriatricks,
in his newsletter, the "information" shown to be by poison
ice is inacurate and overdone, we, the writers of catslash
magazine totally deny any and all facts that we were apart
of that morons magazine or ever participated in his
information
gathering, we also deny the fact that we are sources for his
magazine. So remember, hack the planet, not our reputations.
