Well, another year is here and so are we. And dammit, it did snow! On
new years day. Damn unpredictable weather caused me to freeze while on
a beige boxing trip. That really sucked!

In the bad news, 403Ninja was shot and killed in LA. This really sucks.
If you want to know more, read the Connection Corner.

This month DreD will be leaving us too. He fell on his head really
hard and now he want to take over the internet or something. If you
know DreD, then you probably know I'm telling the truth! He called me to
resign and was mumbling some pretty weird shit. Be afraid...

As for our web page, you've probably noticed that it is pretty dead.
Tripod installed some new software and it phucked up our page. We
can't u/l anything. They said that an update to fix the bug is on
the way, and we're still waiting. You'll just have to call Bethlehem
or e-mail us and ask for them.

Oh, and the Infection section is now called the Security Section.
Its still the same, just with a different name.

            '''''''''''''''''File #2 of 12''''''''''''''
                             '''''''''''''
Polish flare mix is easy to make and can make you look like a pro
pyro at parties. It basically lights up and burns with a pink or
red flame at a pretty good height. It will also make a lot of
smoke and other cool devices. This look especially good at night.

Ingrediants:
''''''''''''
- Some Potassium Nitrate (sold at IDA Drug stores as "Salt Peter". It 
  comes in a vitamin container or now a square glass bottle)
 - Some ordinary table sugar

Not a lot huh? You might have trouble getting the KNO3 if you can't
find a drug store that sells it, but IDA is in most towns and cities
and will order it if they don't have it. Its used for pickling meat.

How to Make it
''''''''''''''
Just mix the two with a little more sugar than KNO3. You can get away
with adding more sugar since the sugar gives it the red color and
otherwise it would burn blue and orange. Mix them together well.

Setting it off
''''''''''''''
Just dump some on the ground and light it. It will light best with a
match. Just ignite the match and drop it on the powder. The match holds
heat and will light it up a lot easier and safer than the lighter. It
burns fairly quickly, so you may want to spread it out so it lasts longer.

If you want to chemically ignite it, I've heard you can pour sulphuric
acid on it. 

Flares
''''''
Just pour it in a tube and add a fuse or use a cigarette as a fuse.
Tape it all up tight except DO NOT SEAL THE TOP. Light it and the
flame comes out the top. Make sure you don't seal it or you'll get:

A Bomb from the mix
''''''''''''''''''''
When contained this mix can be really nasty. Place a large amount of
the mix in a jar or pipe. Throw in an electrical delay ignitor or
pour some sulphuric acid in a plastic capsule and drop it in the
container with the mix. Seal off the container and run away.
Eventually the acid eats through the capsule and sets off the mix,
or the detonator ignites the mix. The expanding gases have no where
to go and it blows out.

Smoke Bombs
'''''''''''
In one of the NINJA009 files (File #4?) he describes making a smoke
bomb out of this. If you fill a whole vitamin container and light
it, it can probably make enough smoke for a quick getaway.

Conclusion
'''''''''''
So now you can make another cool pyro mix pretty easily. This stuff
has a lot of uses. At skewl me and a phriend planted some by a
group of people and set it off. If the big red flame and the sudden
noise it makes dosen't scare them off, the choking smoke will.
Think of your own stuff! Have phun!

                             '''''''''''''
Well, the bastards at Telus have created a new plan to destroy the
few phreakers left in the 403. You probably haven't even seen it
coming either.

Have you ever played with those new digital payphones that they have
in the malls. Those things are completely computerized. At first they
look pretty cool. They make scanning a lot faster with that new [<>]
feature and bring back red boxing. They seem sort of phun...

But, there are a lot of disadvantages too! The computer in the
payphone knows which numbers you aren't supposed to dial. The main
Telus services like ringback,loops and telus system dialups can't be
called. Neither can long distance carriers that we aren't supposed to
access. International calls too (me and Poison tried to call Iran.
No dice.) All of them give you the NO ACCESS message. This really sucks. 

Another shitty thing is the caller logs. They are really improved here.
If you dial a WATS (800) number too many times it will notify the phone's
CO. If you red box calls, it will be monitored severely in the next
week. These computers make catching phreaks who always use the same
payphone easy.

The buggers are alarmed like hell too. When you open the lower panels,
and an alarm goes off. When you open the other panels, and an even noisier
alarm goes off. The CO and probably the police are alerted too.

Now back to Telus' plan. They are not just putting them in malls anymore!
By the end of this month, all the COCOTS (ie. the phones on the wall of the
7-eleven) in the city will be digital. Pretty soon, all the payphones may
be digital! They think their new toys will kill phreaking in the 403.

So you're saying, "How can we phreak this and make Telus pay for its
stupidity?". Well, as I was saying, calls no longer require the operator
to collect the toll. All back to ACTS. So your red box tones will work again!
Also, these suckers can be programmed! Thats right, there are certain codes
you can use to make phree calls. You just have to find them (tho that can be
a hell of a phun thing).

I'll have more info later, as I play with these more. I hope this keeps you
informed enough for now. Later.

Well, I'm here again because Poison didn't do his column...

Anywayz, this month's topic is sort of useless since it is getting
warmer out, so you'll just have to use it next winter.

When your teacher come to school on a cold day, they of course plug
in their cars. So, skip a class in the morning, and UNPLUG EVERY CAR.
Pretty simple huh?

Now you're saying "But that is way to noticable, the day after they'll
probably keep a better eye on it or something!" They probably will,
so we'll just have to cut the power going to the outlets in the parking
lot!

Buy two extension cords at the dollar store. Cut off the end with the
recepticals so you just have two cords like this:

___                                               ____
_|_|========= <-- Cut off parts --> =============|__|_ <----- Prongs

Now, get a switch of some sort and attach the black wire of one cord
to one screw, and then attach the other black wire to the other screw.
Now solder the two red wires together.

For safety, wrap the whole circuit in electric tape. Now you are ready.
Find two empty recepticals in your teacher's parking lot. Make sure the
switch on your device is on OFF. Now plug the two cords into the
recepticals. Turn the switch on, and in a few second turn it off.

What you've done is looped the electricity and hopefully thrown the
breaker that those outlets all run off of (the recepticals have their
own breaker so they can be turned off in the summer). Now no car is
getting power.

What was the switch for? That was to keep the electricity from arc
welding the plug into the socket. Now unplug your device and save it.
Maybe you can plug it in other places of the school too!

Well, this should really piss off any teachers or your boss or whoever.
Have phun!

This has been posted on several Hotline servers supposedly by the SPA.
Its good to read this if you own a warez server because if the law
comes to Canada they will be busting our asses. I had no idea that 
having HackUser issues on my server would be illegal! All they can
do now is bother my ISP. Its good reading...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
SPA Notification 1/13/98

The SPA has had several "sting operation" servers (heretofore referred to
as Hotline Sites) using the Hot line Server software (page three). In
accordance to the new laws regarding Pirated Software we have begun a
more aggressive approach to curbing the illegal duplication and
transference of copyrighted and trademarked electronic media.

- We have placed tracking Resources (page five) within Software, both
disabled, functional and non-functional (page four), at our Hot line
Servers in order to better understand how pirated software is spread.
If we Download a particular piece of software from another Hot line
Server and it contains our resource, we know that it was Downloaded
from us at some point, and then illegally transferred to another Hot
line Server. In fact we have had several instances where our "marked"
software has been Downloaded from one of our server's only to be Uploaded
several days later at another.

- We have compiled a list of those IP's who have transferred so-called
"warez" and other illegal electronic media through our Hot line Servers.
Fortunately, Hot line Server Software logs most of this for us.
(page six, Attachment A-C)

- We have operated these Server's for several months on all major "Trackers"
(page three). Changing the name of some often, while leaving others alone. We
have greatly increased our knowledge of Who, Where and How Pirated Software is
being transferred. We have utilized "Accounts" (page three) at some of our
Hot line Servers to show Intent and Aforethought for that individual in
regards to Illegal and Pirated Software transfer.

- Those fitting the recidivism profile (page two) will be notified. We are
now in the process of notification of ISP Account holders, The ISP providers
themselves, as well as Schools, Universities, etc... (page six)

- Our main concern are so-called "warez", referring to Pirated Software
and Illegal Software (ie.. Serial Number Generators, Credit Card Number
Generators, and Lists or Compilations of Serial Numbers that qualify and
function as a Software Application under specification 12-B), and Patching
Software known as a "crack" or "hack".

- Although our jurisdiction does not fall on these Electronic Media we
have notified the proper Organizations (page 6 attachment D) in regards
to: "Mp3's" (page four) and other electronic recordings of Copyrighted
Music, Electronic Recordings of Copyrighted Visual Media (ie..
television programs that consist of the entire copyrighted material but
not limited to the "Reviewer's Portion" (page four). Although it is
admittedly difficult for us to review each and every piece of Image,
Quicktime, AVI and Mpeg, etc... media out there, we have been in contact
with, and continue to maintain contact with the proper affiliations (mainly
INTERPOL and the respective copyright holders themselves) in regard to
their transference.

- We do continue and shall continue to operate Hotline Servers on all
major Trackers. Future plans are outlined on Page Six,  Attachment E.

=====================================================================

This is my last thing for catslash so I made a fucking awesome last
bomber in the phile BOMB.SIT. In its a script and some text philez
that u can use to fuck somebody bad!!!

First, U need a program called EUDORA LIGHT. It is a email program.
Set up eudora so that yur enemies address is the reply address and
yur email server is in the server box.

Drag all the text philes onto the script and let yur enemies get a
hundred fucking letters from every list in listserv.

U can also use this to blastmail someone. Change the script name to
yur enemies email, get an account on compu$serv and keep dragging a
text phile onto it. It will email the text phile every time U do
that!!!

Remember what I taught U all. See U all later.

| Mac OS 8.1 Beta Upgrade Trojan                             01/98|
|=================================================================|
|Be careful of this! Certain versions of th MacOS 8.1 Beta Upgrade|
|are trojans. It will change your menu bars and place a file      |
|called MacLink Demo Movie on the desktop, and worst of all, hides|
|in your computer's PRAM!(the RAM that controls clock and disk    |
|functions etc.) Only download the upgrade off of sites certified |
|by Hotline Communications (they have a list on hltracker.com)    |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| Hotline Fightback Trojan                                   01/98|
|=================================================================|
|There is a rumour going around that Hotline Communications can   |
|use a code to get the download log off of your server, and get a |
|log of all the places you have visited with your client. I have  |
|talked to many people who are greatly expirenced with Hotline,   |
|and it is agreed that it was probably only a rumour started by   |
|the SPA since their laws didn't scare anyone. Don't worry!       |

| Dreamweaver Patch FULL Trojan                              01/98|
|=================================================================|
|This is probably the most popular trojan on HL right now. It     |
|installs the "NoPowerOffKey" extension, renames your Finder to a |
|bunch of garbled characters, trashes it, and then puts a fake    |
|Finder in your System Folder. It then installs a trash emptying  |
|program in your Startup Items folder. When you restart, its gone!|
|If you get caught, restart off of a floppy disk, and drag the    |
|files out of the trash. One will be the Finder. Use ResEdit to   |
|find the right one, then delete all the other files,the extension|
|and the startup program.                                         |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| Erotica Theatre Trojan                                     01/98|
|=================================================================|
|This "porno" program comes in the form of a VISE installer.      |
|It installs an Applescript that runs on restart and then trashes |
|itself and two programs '23.35 & 3.38' which look like Open      |
|Transport apps when you use Get Info. It will also install a     |
|background process disguised as an apple guide called 'Text      |
|Conversion Guide'. This will create folders with random character|
|names in your System Folder. When we were e-mailed this, we tried|
|it on two computers. The first, an older powermac, reported an   |
|error in the script. The second worked ok, and after a few days  |
|the test mac kept freezing up constantly. When you get this you  |
|need to reinstall the System Software and wipe the old System    |
|Folder out completely.                                           |

|=================================================================|
|Recently I have heard about the supposed "RAM Doubler 3". People |
|think it will quadruple your RAM. People, RAM Doubler 2 triples  |
|your RAM and it was a long time to develop that, Connectix       |
|probably hasn't even thought about a way to make a third one. RAM|
|Doubler three is a trojan of course, and WAY too many people are |
|falling for it.                                                  |

|I guess this is supposed to double the speed of the SoftWindows  |
|PC emulator. Well, when you open it up it tries to delete all    |
|your files and wipe your HD clean. Doubles your disk space...    |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| Hotline Helper                                             01/98|
|=================================================================|
|Many people are scared of the 'Hotline Helper' trojan. Its just  |
|InvisibleOasis, a keystroke logger. Use ResEdit to make Oasis    |
|visible and delete it.                                           |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| CPU Doubler Virus                                          01/98|
|=================================================================|
|Rumor has it that some versions of CPU doubler have been spread  |
|around with a virus. You will need the new Virex update to get   |
|rid of it.                                                       |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| HL Better Bandwith Patch                                   01/98|
|=================================================================|
|Someone told me that this is going around again. This patch will |
|allow someone to easily hack your server. Don't install it.      |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| Silverlining 6.0 and 6.0.1 Trojan                          12/97|
|=================================================================|
| Silverlining disk management tool 6.0 and 6.0.1 are trojans.Take|
| note that there never was a Silverlining 6. This Trojan will    |
| completely destroy your hard drive to the point that it can be  |
| used only as a paperweight. DO NOT D/L SILVERLINING 6!          |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| Stuffit Deluxe 4.5 Trojan                                  12/97|
|=================================================================|
| There is a version of SD 4.5 going aroundthat acts like SD but  |
| when you compress an archive it deletes files it is supposed to |
| be compressing and creates a dummy Stuffit file.                |
|_________________________________________________________________|
| C&N Xmas Trojan                                            12/97|
|=================================================================|
| This says your hard disk needs repairs and then starts to work. |
| There was no "Xmas" issue of C&N so if you get it, don't run it.|
| If you do run it, force quit out of it!                         |

|     /\    |=======================================================|
|____/__\___| Many of the anarchists in the 403 were mourning this  |
|   /    \  | as on the 16th, news reached us all that 403Ninja,    |                     
|  /      \ | well known anarchist and former leader of CATS was    |

|           | A day after 403's killing, a quick meeting of the     |
|           | Anarchist Commonwealth was arranged and it was decided|
|           | that vengence would be obtained. The Vigilante Corp,  |
|           | and a few other local anarchists would fly down to LA |
|           | where they would be joined by members of PhilPhreak   |
|           | and AP (Anarchy Presses). Hope their plan works!      |

|_/__\___\__| Last month we published that MacMan's site was down.  |
|/    \  /  | Well, its back up again, Its not on interlog anymore, |
|______\/   | and he can no longer place any [k]'s or warez on it.  |

|           | Last month new laws came in outlawing pirated software|
|           | (warez). We told you that a few trap servers were set |
|           | up. A whole tracker was set up! The Macpunx tracker!  |
|           | had alot of warez sites and now is being run by HL    |
|           | communications. Also, a server with 25GB of warez was |
|           | just shut down by the SPA. They are coming! So far    |
|           | though, I have heard that all Canadian servers are    |
|           | safe!                                                 |

|   NEWS:   | Somebody e-mailed us about that chumbawumba story     |
|           | in last month's issue. He claims that we could never  |
|           | kill chumbawumba because they are better anarchists   |
|  /\/\     | than us. That is just sad. I would also like to point | 
| //\/\\    | out that our stories are just for fun. If you like    |
|//    \\   | Backstreet, Chumbawamba etc, then don't read them! But|
|           | almost all of the anarchists I know hate them, so viva|
|           | Poison's stories!                                     |
|           |P.S. Chumbawamba could NEVER be anarchists! They claim |
|           |     it only for publicity. Would you wear a dress in  |
|           |     public?                                           |
