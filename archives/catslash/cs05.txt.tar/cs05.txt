Its getting near Christmas and we've been very busy. This issue is
really not that great this month because of that. Hey, its hard to
run a magazine, write three articles and get the other writers to
write in all in one month! I had to put this issue together quite
fast this month, so it may not look as nice either. I also noticed,
as our articles came together, that not one had anything to do with
Christmas! So, you'll have to look to the BGR or something for
Christmas ideas...

We would also like to thank all those who made CATSlash's 96 issues
possible, that includes all our connections (for the Connection 
Corner), all the sysops who distribute our magazine, and all our 
readers, and people who wrote in. With all that help, CATSlash will
live on for '97.

Here we go, the last issue of 1996...

Sorry Folks, but the Vencence Column wasn't written this month, so 
I've filled in. If you want revenge against your local phone CO, here
are some sure fire ways to fuck up a phone booth so that the phone
repair boys will be busy for a while. WARNING: Do not do this to
those new computerized pieces of shit (the ones that you see in malls
with the credit card slot). They have alarms everywhere!

1. Jam finishing nails through the mouthpiece holes, destroying the
   mouthpiece. Nobody will notice anything wrong until they connect
   and can't say anything. Boy, will they be pissed off!

2. Place glue or something sticky all over the keypad to make the
   buttons stick. If your really daring call 611 and stick down a 
   button or two.

3. Under the phone there is sometimes some metal panels running
   down. You can take these off with a Phillips screwdriver. You
   now have access to the phone booth's phone line. Cut and splice,
   or do whatever else you want... 

4. Jam garbage or gum into the coin slot (self explanitory).

5. Use a lighter and melt the plexiglass siding, mouthpiece plastic,
   whatever...

6. Take a flathead screwdriver and pry off the Tellus pricing infor-
   mation. They pop right out of the brown casing. The phone booth
   casing itself will give if you pry it enough!

7. If you hammer the casing hard enough (with your fist, although
   a real hammer could work too), sometimes the phone's guts slide 
   inwards. Then nobody can dial out because the keys slip inside
   the casing and get stuck. This is notorious for indoor phones.

 Remember, these are vandalism, so don't get caught doing this! Also,
 if there is another phone booth in the area, or if it is only a
 small town, they may remove the phone booth. So watch where you do
 this or you will have nothing to phreak from!

Here's how to build a fast radio detonator.

1. Take one of those remote controlled cars.
2. Open up the car.
3. Remove the insides.
4. Notice the two wires to the back tires' motor? Cut them from the 
   electric motor(s) and strip the ends.
5. Attach a phosphorus igniter (these come in Rocket Engine packages)
   to the ends of the wires that come from the circuit board to the 
   motor (the ends you just stripped.
6. Place the phosphorus legs into the explosive.

How this works: When you press the remote controll button that makes 
the car move forward or backward, the 6 to 9 volts that normally go 
to the electric motor on the back tires is sent into the phosphorus 
igniter. The igniter gets the legs hot enough to ignite your 
explosive. This model is nice because remote controlled cars are 
cheap and this takes seconds to make.

A lot of people wonder about rockets, so here's an explanation...
Most model rocket kits can be bought at hobby stores in your local 
mall. Engines too can be bought for the price of $8.00 for 3 engines.

The Rocket
~~~~~~~~~~
Below is a cross section of a model rocket that you buy at a store:


    /\
   /  \ <---------- Nose Cone (Pops off to deploy parachute/streamer,
  /    \             held on by elastic)

 |      | |                rocket flies straight up.(looks like
 |______|_|                 a drinking straw.
 |      | <-------------- Rocket engine (see diagram below)
 |      |
/|      |\
_|________\ <------------- Stabalizer fins (keep rocket straight)
       _| <---------- Engine Holder (Holds in rocket engine)

The Engine
~~~~~~~~~~
|______|<--------Clay Cover
|******|<--- Fine Black Powder
|******|
|******|
|&&&&&&|
|&&&&&&|<---- Muddy Powder (mixed black powder, brownish color)
|%%%%%%|      
|%%%%%%|<------- Black Powder
|%%%%%%|
| \ &/ |
 --  -- <-------- Porcelain Base (hole in centre)

All the insides are wrapped in a cardboard case.
On the cover is marked A,B, or C followed by numbers or dashes. These 
letters are for the power the rocket engine has. A is the lowest, B 
is the highest.

When the rocket ignites, (with igniters placed through the base) the 
black powder burns.This forces the rocket up. When the black powder 
burns up, The muddy powder is ignited. Muddy powder is black powder 
mixed with something else so it burns longer and produces smoke. This 
makes the rocket more visible, so when you use the eye thing it can 
be seen. When the muddy powder burns up the fine black powder is 
ignited. All the fine black powder ignites in a second, causing a 
mini explosion, blowing through the top of the rocket engine and 
blasting out the parachute.

Making it into a Weapon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many ways to turn this into a deadly toy. The simplest is 
to place an explosive on the end of the engine (see diagram). When 
the black powder ignites, it also ignites the explosive. This is not 
too bright however, because there is no way of knowing weather it 
will hit the target before blowing. Here is what it will look like:

Make sure clay blocker is removed from fine black powder (get it off 
with a PLASTIC or wooden device so it dosen't cause a spark!). Place 
explosive's fuse into black powder, so when one ignites, it will burn 
the fuse and blow the explosive.

|________________|-----------
              /\
             Fuse (the thing in the middle)

Shove all this into a rocket and launch at someone. Here's how to 
build a launcher:

   H - Phosphorus igniter (the white thing with the two wires coming
                            out.)
  +__- - Lantern Battery (Big square 6 volt battery with 2 springs on
  |__|                top.) Can also be a solar rocket igniter or 
                         something else to heat up the phosphorus.

The wiring diagram looks like this:

 ----|+   -|-------|__|---
 |                       |
 |______/ _______________|

There are better diagrams in the Mac Issue.

To use this toy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Place rockets launch lug down metal bar. Place Phosphorus igniters 
into rocket engine (Rocket engine is in rocket and has explosive 
attached). When ready aim at something and hit switch/trigger/button 
to fire rocket. Rocket will explode at a certain time (when the 
powder in the engine burns up) no on impact. An on impact rocket will 
be discussed in a later issue.

Have fun and don't poke anybody's eye out!

Hello all, today we check out the connection feedback as promised, 
so here we go! And I would like to remind everyone that this article 
is not restricted to anarchy news, it is all purpose!(suck on that
electrik fire).

 From Eastglen: News states that the school may be looking into 
                uniforms! The source says that the uniforms would
                be a dress shirt, dress pants and a tie!The source
                also states that people may be transferring from 
                eastglen and into nearby schools in the near future. 


                There was news of a bomb threat on Friday the 13th
                at one school, but the name was not given to us.

 Anarchy news: Me and Jeriatrick discovered that all alias' that
               wrote in N.E.R.D magazine #1 (if you can call it 
               that) exept for the one known as "Deja vu" (I 
               probably spelled it wrong though), Were all 
               ELECTRIK FIRE!! Jeez talk about low!  That is 
               Shotty journalism! 

               
               There is also some new thing called the c.a malitia,
               I first heard of it a while ago but I still know very
               little about it. 
               It bears further investigation and I will keep you
               advised if  I find anything. But if any of you know
               something about it please tell me.

Here is an interesting file I found on red boxing. This one covers 
everything. The only difference here in Edmonton is that the ACTS 
system is only on indoor payphones. The outdoor ones connect you to a 
Tellus operator. She can be fooled however, if you put in a nickel 
and play the tones for her to hear. They do catch on sometimes. To see
if they do, jiggle the hangup thing on the payphone and you can hear 
her conversation with her supervisor about it. I myself just use a 
portable tape recorder and tones from Phoney (a cool mac program 
available on your favorite Mac H/P/A site. With this issue I included 
the three tones (Quarter, nickel, and dime) in Mac System 7 format.
Just double click on them to use them.
___________________________________________________________________________________
------- 
RED BOX 
-------

------------ 
Introduction 
------------

Red boxing consists of simulating the tones produced  when  coins
are  deposited  in a pay phone. Coin tones are beeps of 2200 Hz +
1700 Hz as follows:

5 cents  - 1 beep, 66 milliseconds duration.

10 cents - 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds duration
           with 66 millisecond pause between beeps.

25 cents - 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds duration
           with a 33 millisecond pause between beeps.


Three methods have commonly been used by phone phreaks to produce
these tones and make free calls.


*****************************************************************
1. The traditional Red Box consisting of a  pair  of  Wien-bridge
   oscillators with the timing controlled by 555 timer chips.
*****************************************************************

-----------------                         
CIRCUIT OPERATION
-----------------

   Each time the pushbutton is pressed, it triggers half of  IC1,
configured  as a monostable multivibrator to energize the rest of
the circuit for a length of time determined by the setting of the
coin selector switch.  This in turn starts the other half of IC1,
configured as an astable multivibrator, pulsing  on  and  off  at
regular  intervals  at  a  rate determined by the 50k pot between
pins 12 and 13.  The  output  of  the  astable  thus  alternately
powers  of IC2, configured as a square wave oscillator, providing
the required 1700hz and 2200hz to the op  amp  which  acts  as  a
buffer to drive the speaker.

   Assemble the circuit as you wish.  Component placement is  not
on  a  "universal"  PC  grid board with solder ringed holes.  Use
sockets if you aren't a whiz with a soldering iron.  Be  sure  to
leave easy access to the potentiometers for alignment.

   For alignment, a frequency counter and tiggered sweep oscillo-
scope are extremely handy (but not absolutely necessary.)

   Install a temporary jumper from +9v supply to pin  14  of  IC2
and  temporarily disconnect the 0.01uF capacitors from pins 5 and
9 of IC2.  Power up the circuit.  Measuring the output from pin 5
of  IC2  with  the  frequency counter, adjust the 20k pot between
pins 1 and 6 for an output of 1700hz.  Now  adjust  the  20k  pot
between  pins 8 and 13 for an output of 2200hz from pin 9 of IC2.
Remove the temporary jumper and re-attach the capacitors to  pins
5  and  9.  (Note: if no frequency counter is available, the out-
puts can be adjusted by ear one at a  time  by  zero-beating  the
output tone with a computer generated tone of known precision.)

   Next, temporarily disconnect the wire between pins 5 and 10 of
IC1.   Set  coin  selector  switch  in the "N" (nickel) position.
With the oscilloscope measuring the output from pin 9 of IC1, ad-
just  the 50k pot between pins 12 and 13 of IC1 for output pulses
of 60 millisecond duration.  Reconnect the wire  between  pins  5
and  10.   (Note: If no scope is available, adjust the pulse rate
by ear using computer generated tones for comparison.)

   The remaining adjustments are made by ear.

   Leave the selector switch in the "N" position.  Adjust the 50k
pot  labelled  "Dime" for a quick double beep each time the push-
button is pressed.

   Finally, set the selector to "Quarter".  Adjust  the  50k  pot
labelled "Quarter" until exactly 5 very quick beeps are heard for
each button press.  Don't worry if the quarter beeps sound short-
er and faster than the nickel and dime ones.  They should be.

   If all went well to this point, your red box  should  be  com-
pletely  aligned and functional.  A final test should now be con-
ducted from a payphone using the DATL  (dial  access  test  line)
coin  test.   Dial  09591230 and follow the computer instructions
using the red box at the proper  prompts.   The  computer  should
correctly  identify all coins "simulated" and flag any anomalies.
With a little discretion, your red  box  should  bring  you  many
years of use.  Remember, there's no such thing as spare change.!

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

   Operation is simple.  Simply dial a long distance number (some
areas  require  you to stick in a genuine nickel first), wait for
the ACTS computer to demand your cash, and  press  the  "deposit"
button  on  the  red box for each coin you want to simulate.  The
coin signals are coupled from the red box into the phone  with  a
small  speaker  held  to the mouthpiece.  For local calls, either
you must first deposit a genuine nickel before "simulating"  more
coins  or  place your call through the operator with 0 + 7d.  Use
some care when the operator is on the line--sometimes they  catch
on to your beeper ploy.

*****************************************************************
  2. Producing the signals with a computer which are recorded    
     and then played back into the mouth piece of a pay phone.   
     Most common is the new hallmark greeting cards.             
*****************************************************************

---------
Materials
---------

1 Hallmark digital recording card (~$8, card store)

1 1/8 inch mono phono plug (~$1 or in a junk bin)

1 SPST switch, or momentary contact NORMALLY OPEN.

The QUARTER.VOC File (and access to a sound card to play it, 
and software that lets you loop it).  

1 case of some sort (I used a case from a DAT, but anything you 
  can put the stuff in will work.  Perhaps the case from a Data 
  Tape or a 8mm Video tape, or just a casette)

1 Tube of silicone sealant.
  have silicone on hand)

----------
What to do
----------

1. Remove all components from the plastic thing inside the card,
   this includes sliding the battry pack out of it's drawer.

2. Cut the following wires:

   Both wires going to microphone (both are green, mark which one
   goes to the center of the mic)
   Both wires to the battery pack (red and white)
   Both wires to the switch mechanisim (green and black)

2a. (OPTIONAL) It is a wise idea (if you are  fairly  experienced
    at  soldering/desoldering on small PC boards) to desolder all 
    the wires and replace them with ones of a thicker  gauge. The
    ones that hallmark supplies are just too damn thin and have a
    real tendancy to break at connections. REMEMBER, the wires in  
    this card  are supposed to be protected in the little plastic
    grooves that you removed them from.

3. Discard the switch mechanisim.

4. Wrap the battery pack in electrical tape (I used red tape just
   to be cheesy, since the box is clear)

5. Solder the SPST switch to the black and green wires that  used
   to go to theo original switch (polarity is NOT important)

6. Solder  the  phono  plug  to  the  2  green  wires.   Polarity
   shouldn't really be important, but to be on the safe side, the 
   wire that ran to the center of the mic (I told you to mark it)
   should go to the TIP of the plug.

7. Connect the battery. (This battery pack puts  out  6.25VDC,  I
   suppose

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!.  The red wire goes to the  Positive  termi-
nal,  and the white goes to the negative.  On my box, if the pack
is laying flat, with the exposed part of the  batteries  pointing
up, the positive terminal is the one on the left (if you are fac-
ing the terminals)  I'd use a multimeter just to be sure.

8. Glue the pc board to the top of the battery (this saves  space
   and hassle later, but is not necessary for operation)

9. Program the thing...

   I used the QUARTER.VOC file (sorry, i don't have a copy of  it
   in any other format) and I looped it 10  times, with a  random
   delay of between .5 and 1 seconds  between  each  quarter (who 
   puts them in at regular intervals anyway?)

   Plug the phono plug into your soundcard, turn the volume waaay
   down (trial and error will give you  the  proper  volume)  and
   play the voc file (after setting the switch on the pc board to
   the record position, and flipping the SPST at the beginning of
   the VOC file)

10. Test it...

   Best way to test is to call a long distance  Directory  Assis-
   tance (Im partial to 808-555-1212 which is Hawaii)

   If it doesn't work, go back to step 9. The ideal volume is one
   that can be heard  clearly,  but does not cause the speaker to
   break up.

11. Once you have the thing programmed, there is no need to  keep
    the phono plug attatched.  If  you want to save room,  cut it 
    off.

12. Put the thing in the case.  Drill several holes in  the  case
    where the speaker will mount. I mounted the speaker with sil-
    icone  very  carefully  applied to the edges of the  speaker. 
    Same was true of the battery pack. The switch should mount in
    a hole on the side of the case.

Thats it...

------------------
Comments/Questions
------------------

Why the SPST Switch?

 First off, I thought the switch that came with the thing  looked
really cheaply made, and would probably break.  Secondly, bu put-
ting in a switch instead of a momentary switch, it allows  me  to
record  $2.50  on  the box, and play the whole thing back just by
flipping the switch, rather than having to hold it down.

There you have it. the Under $10 red-box.

A third method has recently appeared which is a real mind blower.
A  phreak  in  the Midwest has extensively tested a method of red
boxing which uses nothing more than a pair of brass  or  aluminum
whistles.  The whistles are 1/4 inch in diameter by 4 inches long
and are tuned by means of a wooden dowel rod  which  fits  snugly
inside.  The  whistles  can  be brought precisely on frequency by
tuning them against a known signal source such as a computer  ca-
pable  of producing the tones. Once tuned, the whistles are glued
or taped together so they can be blown together  to  produce  the
dual  tone used in coin signaling.  It has been tested and proven
that with a little practice these whistles can be  used  to  make
free calls. Now you can blow your money without spending a cent.

     If there are two pay phones next to each other, you can call
long  distance  on  one  and put the coins in the other. When the
operator cuts in and asks you to deposit money, drop the coins in
the  one you are not using, but hold the reciever up to the slots
so the operator can hear the bells ring.  When  you've  finished,
you  can  simply  press  the  return button on the phone with the
coins, and you'll get them back. (Or tape record the sounds  etc)
{For  this,  nowadays,  put the reciver up to the earpiece on the
other phone and procede as above stated.}

Oh, shit! You need cover real bad! What's gonna work? Smoke Bombs!

There are many types of smoke bombs. The easiest to make is sugar-
potassium nitrate mixture.

Standard Smoke Bombs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Mix 50 parts sugar and 50 parts potassium nitrate (salt peter) in 
   a pot, or 3 parts sugar to 1 part potassium nitrate. Its up to 
   you, preferences vary.
   If you want yellow smoke, add in iron oxide (rust!!).
   If you want this to smell bad, add sulphur (NOTE: This also 
   will destroy someone's lungs if it is lit in an enclosed area!)

2. Put it over a heat source and melt it until it turns brown or 
   white (if its white its better).
   Careful not to ignite it! The potassium Nitrate can give you 
   about a foot of blue flames (believe me, I know! The first time
   I tried I almost set my kitchen on fire, and filled my house 
   smoke!). If it starts to smoke, move it off the heat!

3. Put it in a container of some sort. Before it hardens put in a 
   fuse (or electronic device) so that you can light it. If you can't
   get a good fuse, soak a string in gasoline or pull one off some
   fireworks. Presto!

4. Next, you can take the seperated crystals, mix in gunpowder and 
   add some alcohol or nail  polish. (nail polish works pretty good).
   This will help it burn more reliably. It is not needed, but best 
   to put in.

5. Remember:  The tighter the mixture, the more the smoke. When the
   mixture binds (after the alcohol or nail polish), PRESS it so it
   is tightly packed. 


This is a nice mixture because it is easy and fast to make, and also
lights easily. This is probably all the standard anarchist will ever 
use, however, if you need better quality you can use military stock 
smoke bombs:

Military Smoke Bombs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Mix:
    45 parts zinc oxide (I think this is those zinc vitamins) or 
         22 parts titanium dioxide (I think this can be found in some
         types of face makeup).
    72 parts PVC
    10 parts aluminum filings

2. Heat the mixture until it melts together (flame hazard here too).

3. Pack in a container. Insert a sparkler as a fuse.

This is what the army uses in their bombs, except that the PVC part 
is 45 parts hexachloroethane. If you can find hexachloroethane, it
will work better. This bomb is also a bitch to light, that is why
you need a sparkler as a fuse.

Once again, iron oxide (rust) or any oxidizer for that matter, will
give you yellowish smoke (although, weakly colored).

Have phun!!!

This is a story about me, from a while ago. This was before ED-Tel
became Tellus, so when you dialed an ED-Tel operator, it was really 
an AGT operator out of Calgary. It was in the summer,to learn how to 
better use my beige box, I called an AGT operator. Then I made up a 
story. I said I had a lineman's handset I had stolen from an ED-Tel 
van. At first she didn't believe me, but when I gave her an accurate 
description of one that I had seen before, I grabbed her attention. 
She immediatly locked up the line! I did this for several times. The 
conversations went something like this:

OPERATOR: Hello, AGT operator <whoever> speaking.
ME: Hello, I was wondering if you could help me.
OPERATOR: What's the problem?
ME: You see, I stole this phone type thing from an ED-Tel van...
OPERATOR: What, I didn't hear that correctly.
ME: I said I stole this phone thing from an ED-Tel van, and I want to 
know how to use it.
OPERATOR: I'm not going to help you! You stole it!
ME: Can you connect me with someone who can tell me how it works then?
OPERATOR: Your not getting me to help you! Maybe I'll connect you to 
the police!
<At this point I would just bug them>
ME: Oh, come on <operator's name>! I'll send you a cheque if you tell 
me.
OPERATOR: I'm not going to help you. If you want help go to an ED-Tel 
phone exchange in a mall...
ME: Will they give me something in return?
OPERATOR: Yeah, maybe a trip to the police station. Thats all. Good-bye!

This went on for a week or two. Finally I got operators to connect me 
with ED Tel security, I knew that they could give me the info:

OPERATOR: ED-Tel security, I hear we have a problem with you.
ME: Yeah, I have this problem, see I stole this phone thing from an 
ED-Tel van and the operators won't tell me how to use it. Can you?
OPERATOR: Listen, I know who you are.
ME: Ok, where?
OPERATOR: <Payphone's number>
ME: Bet you can't tell me which area of Edmonton I'm in. <the operator was from Calgary>
OPERATOR: Look, just who are you?
ME: My name is Jim Chamzuck <this gay guy who I hate. If they 
tracked the name I wanted them to visit him>
OPERATOR: and where do you live Jim.
ME: Yeah right, like I'm gonna tell you...

At that point I hung up. She locked up the phone as usual, because 30 
minutes later I picked up the phone and was greeted by "Hello Jim". 
After several incidents like that, I was known notoriously by all the 
AGT operators. They made memos about me and my "handset" for all the 
operators. I also got a spot in the student crime stoppers list.

One night I lucked out. I was connected to ED-Tel security, and I ran 
into a guy who was willing to negotiate. He said if I told him where 
I stole the handset (so the lineman could get a new one), he would 
tell me how to use it. I said I couldn't quite remember, so we 
negotiated. While talking to him, they brougt in a guy who knew a lot 
about using the handsets to give him info. In return, since I really 
didn't steal the handset I made up a story that it was by the 
coliseum. We talked for about an hour, echanging information on the 
use and price of the handset. Finally, in the background, I heard the 
supervisor telling him something about paying overtime (it was an 
hour past ED-Tel security's closing time), so he asked if I had it on 
me. Foolishly, I replied "yes". He then put me on hold. Luckily I 
realized that they were sending somebody to pick me up, so I took 
off. I heard later that a police car had shown up at the phone booth.

After that incident, they were very angry. Almost all calls connected 
me immediatly to ED-Tel security...

OPERATOR: Hello, Jim. Listen I'm still not telling you anything!
<at this point, she locked up the line. I simply went to the phone 
across the street, dialed the operator and asked her to connect me to 
ED-Tel security. She did.>
ME: Hello <operator's name>
OPERATOR: Jim! How did you... Whats your problem!

After this, I saw a white van pulling into a parking lot. He was 
talking on his cell and looking at all the payphones nearby. I was on 
the farthest one from him. Then it clicked ED-TEL SECURITY VAN! I 
looked at his plates (ED-Tel security vans had no ED-Tel symbols 
except for their front plates), and sure enough that damn ED-Tel 
symbol was there.
OPERATOR: <laughing the whole time> What's wrong Jim?
ME: Nothing. Gotta go. bye!

I blasted down a couple of alleys. I don't know how far he chased me 
befor he gave up because I never looked back at the bastard. After 
that incident, I realized that the operators were never going to give 
me any more info on handsets, so Jim retired.

Nowadays, this would dosen't work as well. Tellus is so jumpy that 
any  suspicious actions send security vans. Also, operators now are 
far more educated with knowledge of boxes and lineman's handsets. 
Just to  finish though, if you call an operator, DON'T USE THE ALIAS
 "JIM".
