             Catslash Magazine Tribute to Bethlehem BBS
                           August, 1998
                     Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
_____________________________________________________________________
Early this year, people logging on Bethlehem were greeted with this 
message:

     'Since the leering and ominous dominance of the internet's shadow
completely eclipses the popularity of Bethlehem I will probably be shutting
it down in the beginning weeks of February 1998.
        From 1994 to 1998.  Rest in Peace Bethlehem, and the Edmonton BBS era.'

Well, a few months ago it happened. Bethlehem had closed down. One of 
the last good boards in the city was gone.

But this is Edmonton dammit! We didn't have enough underground boards 
in the first place! Bethlehem isn't just going to fade from the HPA 
world like it was never there! Just like all the other boards. Tell 
me...did anyone hear about Planet Motherfucker or Sensory Overload 
after they closed? No, didn't think so...

So, we got together some of our Catslash writers who were Bethlehem 
users and put together a tribute issue with all our fun memories. Now 
at least the gates won't close unremembered...

BETHLEHEM, PREVIOUS SYSTEMS & HISTORY

        For those of you who don't know where the roots of my BBS fever lay,
they lay in Grande Prairie.  That's where I first aspired to become a Sysop.
It all started when I got my Tandy 1000RL in early Grade 7 back in 1990.
I remember programming crummy RPG games in GW-BASIC.
        I used the terminal in Deskmate.  For those of you who don't know,
Deskmate is sort of a Windows for the Tandy.  This terminal did not support
the ANSI emulation which confused me at first, "What are all these codes?!"
I attempted to try to set up a BBS with this program (not knowing that you
could not).
        I then met a few people from the biggest BBS in Grande Prairie which
happened to have 3-nodes, many echomail networks, CD-ROMs, lots of files.
It was great.  We played Galactic Warzone by Scott Baker (who was my hero).
I was around when 6.0 was the latest version, that was a long time ago.
Galatic Warzone is a very good door game indeed!
        I eventually purchased a copy of Procomm Plus for DOS at the very
huge price of $109 at the Micro Computers Plus (where I would later work).
I was going to set up a BBS with David Vadeboncouer (a former friend from
the Grande Prairie modem scene) using Procomm Plus host mode.  We were going
to call it "Trekkie BBS" or "Trekker BBS" because at that time I was a
die-hard Star Trek fan.  Yes, that was many years ago.
        I would like to go off track here and tell everyone what a faggot
David is.  He is definitely a homosexual.  He was very prissy, wore
jogging-suits all of the time.  He enjoyed cross-stitching in front of the
television.  In fact, me and my other friend (who still lives in Grande
Prairie, his alias is Corpse) who I've been friends with since Kindergarten
enjoyed David's _father's_ company more than his.
        Back on track.  I met a man over the modem named Roger Wilkins.
He ran Cozy Hollow BBS (also called Online Computers, and now called
Dragon's Lair or something like that).  He had been running a BBS since
1985 or so.  I was amazed, he was like my mentor.  I received a BBS program
from him.  A real actual functional BBS program! It was called MiniHost.  It
was really bad.  He ran it the very first time I called his BBS.  He also
ran a really shitty computer store called Online Computers for a few years.
Anyway, once I got the hang of that, he got me a copy of RBBS-PC 17.4! Wow!
This is when I first got my BBS running.  I can't remember what it was
called.
        Eventually I tried a few other systems (k-rad ones like AfterShock,
ORiON, ViSiON-X).  Then I arrived at RemoteAccess 1.10 (which was the latest
version at the time).  I actually registered this bitch! I sent in the cash
and this guy from Ontario called my shitty BBS and uploaded my .KEY.  Was
I ever excited.  I payed $60 or so for it.
        At this time my BBS was started to look very nice.  In fact, I bet
it wouldn't be very hard to say it was the nicest looking system running in
Grande Prairie.  It just didn't have very many files or doors, and the
people in Grande Prairie don't know the meaning of messaging.  It also ran
very slow because RemoteAccess is a very slow program (in combination with
my slow computer).  Anyway, I got about 5 calls per day or so.
        Eventually my BBS was in the back burner because I had friends and
stuff.  Hanging out with girls, staying out late walking the streets of
Grande Prairie at night.  Spending nights at our fortress in the forest by
the trails.  Winter, moon, friends, campfires, parties... anyway.
        Soon I found myself getting a $100 grant from some people to produce
a video game... but I found out that I was moving to Edmonton.  Not only
that, I doubt I was even smart enough to produce a video game at this time.
At the time it was very exciting, but it was also kind of scary because I
would have to leave all my friends.  Most of them have moved from Grande
Prairie, I will never see a lot of them ever again.  <sob>
        I called E-Zoot BBS quite a lot when I was living in Grande Prairie
so I actually had lots of BBS numbers when I got here.  The Borg BBS was
huge, I couldn't believe it.  So when I moved to Edmonton and my alias was
ORiON.  I got into the BBS scene here.  Then I quickly discovered the
'scene.'  Chaos Unlimited, Vex II (or Vex Main)... then I was moving onto
boards like Anhiliation Nation (ran by Liquid Flesh), The Wicked Garden (ran
by The Minister who still calls around now and then), The Dark Side (which
was PD, oh well, hail Nfn Nln!), and a few others.  I called a BBS, I forget
what it was called (ran by The Dixie Flatline, but that was not his name at
the time).
        I started a group called DiiNA and I ripped of some ACiD ANSI and
landed myself into big shit.  I wasn't thinking; I didn't know the 'code'
of the elite back then.  Anyway, I was considered very lame.  Then there
was this guy (The Dixie Flatline) who ran this group called CiA.  Hey, does
anybody remember someone named Guy Smilie? Anyway, he kind of helped me
out and let me onto his board.
        Everything was happy.  I tried starting a few new groups like
CREATiON-D, MORBiD.  I must say actually I was quite successful.  There were
a few other groups going on at the time like DouBT (who was founded by
someone called The Corrupt, who is now Platinum Ice I believe) and he had a
few members including Crack Baby (I forget what he was called then).
Anyway, some of these guys applied (by mail) for my group (DiiNA) and I
still have their application forms somewhere.  Seriously.  Paper
application forms sent by mail.  This was all taking back in October, Grade
9, because I remember eating Halloween Candy and listening to Malevolent
Creation.
        At the time I was perhaps one of the better 'lame' ANSI artists
around.  Anyway - after Baal, Prime Evil and a few other aliases I landed
at Morbid Warrior.  A lot of people still know me as Morbid Warrior which
is not surprising because I've actually been using that alias for close to
3 years.  Then I started to fight with The Dixie Flatline because he was
starting to become a real dick.  We blacklisted each other off of many
BBSs.  This was known as the infamous 'TDF vs MW scandal.'  Some say I won
the actual fight.  But there were death threats coming every which way.  Not
that it matters.  I was planning to set up a BBS called Impaled Hope.  You
may have seen the BBS advertisement in some of files.  It makes me laugh
when I still see the ad in files now and then.  That idea never worked out.
        About late Grade 9 and summer holidays is when I started to really
satanize.  I called a few other boards like Silent Mobius (but not often),
Macross Island, Darkland, ViewLine, Street of Dreams, etc.  New lamer
batches came and went.  Some stayed, most left.  I got onto a BBS called
Spontaneous Kombustion in Grade 10.  I remember meeting Naomi (Sweetheart),
and Jessica (Sweetcheeks) eventually when I went to Queen Elizabeth High
(QECHS).  I also went out to Gibbons and met all the Gibbons girls (Stacey
"Frances Bean", Jacqueline, Val, Kimberly or something?).
        During really late Grade 10 I decided I should finally set up my
BBS.  I decided to call it Bethlehem because there was/is a German band
called Bethlehem and their CD cover looked cool.  This time I would use
Oblivion/2.  I believe I started out with 2.25 or something like that.
        The BBS ran fairly decently for awhile at 2400 BPS.  But of course
not many people appreciated 2400 BPS so I bought a 14.4 USR external
Sportster from Liquid Ice.  Me and Virtuoso (Randy) made fun of him lots.
With the new 14.4k BPS modem I was set.  That is, until my data files got
corrupted.  Everything had to be reset many times and nothing worked.  I
finally got it started again.  This was the first resurrection of Bethlehem.
        Everything ran fine until the modem broke.  There was a blown CIA
chip or something like that.  I had radio interference and the modem
wouldn't answer properly.  The BBS went down for 2 months or so until I
bought a replacement modem from Lasher (who now runs Stronghold).  It was
a ViVa 14.4k BPS internal.  This was the second resurrection of Bethlehem.
        Everything ran fine.  But one day during Grade 11 (1996) I decided
I would clean my keyboard because it was absolutely disgusting.  So I wiped
the interior with a semi-damp cloth.  I lost the springs for a few keys
so I used the ones from F11 and F12 (disabling them, but oh well).  Anyway
I put my keyboard back together and it didn't work.  When I tried to type
I cause an Internal Stack Overflow.  Shit! I couldn't type, so I couldn't
reboot the BBS.  Finally I managed to type "CD\BBS", "BBS" and rebooted
Bethlehem.  So I threw out the keyboard while I was looking for a second
hand one.  I kept up on messages from the library at Victoria School.  Then
I thought it would be a good idea to receive a voice call on my modem line,
then I thought, "Oh no! The BBS is going to pick up and beep in this poor
guy's ear (Glen aka Maimed and Dismembered who runs Planet Motherfucker), so
I'll just turn the computer off so that the modem doesn't answer."  The
second after I turned off the power I realised I had no keyboard to reboot
the BBS.  The BBS was down until I got my new keyboard from Radio Shack.
This was the third resurrection of Bethlehem.
        Then I changed my alias from Morbid Warrior to Lord Mysteriis,
people are starting to get used to the new name.  And now everything has
been running pretty much perfect ever since.



BETHLEHEM, MEMORABLE USERS WHO DISAPPEARED

        Flynn - This was around the time of the first resurrection.  He was
sided with the Christians and he would always fight about Christianity in
the Black Mass message base.
        Skater - I believe he disappeared around the second resurrection,
along with Sonix.  We had Sonix back however.
        Dead Soul - I'm not sure.  I thought he died but he's on The
Dooplex.  He mostly is on the Internet now I hear.  He's a sell-out.
        Maimed and Dismembered - He still modems.  He runs a BBS called
Planet Motherfucker.  But he's too busy too call Bethlehem anymore or
whatever.
        Shaka Zulu - He was some African guy.  He sided with politically
trendy and was politically correct.  He was ZuluLand in Falcon's Eye.

I would have to say Bethlehem was a great underground board. It gave 
me a better connection to the anarchists of this city, as well as 
started the Catslash Magazine thing. It was cool.

Its amazing that just a few years ago, I logged on a Jeriatrick and 
thought it was nothing. Bethlehem looked like a major satanist board. 
I thought it was pretty crappy, leeched a bunch of files and logged 
off. I never called back for another few months after that. 
Its amazing how important it became in the next year or so.

I remember all the phun things on the board. The "I want you dead" 
screen at the end of a long day. The one-liners when you logged in 
were great too! You could post all kinds of weird shit there and 
everyone else would post weird shit back. The rumors were cool. 
You could leave a message that would appear at the main menu prompt 
when people where there. A lot of good messages were put on there (up 
until people figured out how to trace rumors). The message bases were 
probably the best part. There would be conversations there about 
nothing, and they went on for about 200 messages.

The thing I also thought was funny was the so called "magazine wars". 
After Bethlehem picked up Catslash, NERD (now known as CHM) and 
Nothing Magazine also jumped in there. It became crazy. Between 
Poison,DreD, and Electrik bashing each other on all points, and then 
Da Drug from Nothing trying to get us all, it was just funny. Some of 
the comments they placed were so stupid and insulting. There was also 
DreD's posts which just appeared to be random rants at E-fire and 
made no sense at all.

Anywayz, Bethlehem has been around for a long time, and many of us in 
the local H/P/A used it to communicate. Bethlehem will be missed as 
the internet monster slowly takes over our lives. Good luck Lord 
Mysteriis.

                       My memories: Bethlehem 

       Oh, I remember those days, as if they were last year....
                       (oh yeah, it was..)

I would log on and check through Elektrik fire's hate mail and see 
the  "I want you dead" screen. that screen rocked. Then I would go 
into the one liners, read the Elektrik bashing and laugh aloud (my 
mom thought I was crazy). Then I would ad my own, like that one "I 
hear E-Fire is a pedofile on the west side" and " E-fire's territory
consists of his backyard and the little fort in the corner" or 
something like that. Anyway, I can clearly remember the time I saw 
the rumor "Node 2 (sexy): come to chat!" oh how I searched for the
chat room! But I'm sure Ol' lord mysteriis remembers my costant (yet 
unintentional) dropping carrier, it wasn't my fault honest!! But does 
anybody remember him bantering about moonspell? that was wierd. 
Something else I remember fondly, Elektrik wrote "russia could kick 
Canada's ass any day" then dred replying to the same messages that 
were two months old, man nobody knew what the hell dreddy boy was 
talking about. those were the days, we'll miss bethlehem, but most of 
all we'll miss the hours of enjoyment we recieved from it. After 
bethlehem, I never logged on to another board again, well actually I 
logged on to several boards, but well, you know..... 



                    See ya later LM!!

A little while ago I was asked by CATSlash to write up a tribute to 
Bethlehem article.  So here is my crappy story about how I remember
Bethlehem most.

When I first came on Bethlehem I had made a few remarks and was critisized,
but after a while all was forgoten by the citizens of the great board.
My magazine got its own file area, and everything was going great untill
Dred showed up.

As it turns out Dred emailed me about downloading files off of Bethlehem,
the fool didn't know how to download files!  Well I emailed him back on
how to get files.  The next time I went on I got an email back with him
promising that I'm going down(and a few other not so nice comments).  As
it turns out he heard about my fued with Poison Ice.  As it turns out
he emailed Bungie telling him he'd like to join CATSlash in fighting
CHM.  Bungie told him CATSlash wouldn't do that.. its was just me and
Poison Ice that were ranking each other out.  

Anyhow Dred posted some messages on the board and he was ranked out and
told to get lost.  He ran away with his tail between his legs.  He was
never heard from since.

Those are my memories of Bethlehem as it goes down.  I would like to 
take this moment to say I am also retireing my magazine, its become
a pain to put together every month, I just don't have time.  I'll still
maintain, and I might add a small anarchy archive.  Check it out at
members.tripod.com/~havoc403.  Good by bethlehem.

I logged on a few timez onto bethlehem.

All I did was cutup that fucking loozer elektric fire. He was a lamass. I read his 
shitty magazine and hated him. If u read it u would hate him to.

So I called him a homo in the rumorz. Then i went in the messages and he was saying 
russia is better than canada or some shit like that. So I told him what was the 
rights. But I was realy re:ing to 1 month old messages. The message system was a 
stupid system. I got in trouble with some people on there for it and that pissed me 
off more.

Later I got tired of going on the board so I never called again.

Here is the newest userlist we had in our archives, so some users may 
have been left out. This was copied directly from the ANSI userlist 
online. Its good to remember all the phun people on the board so you
have someone to blame for it all when you go on a murder spree.

Well, Bethlehem is gone, as well as the whole BBS era in general. Its 
true that the internet killed it all. Its sort of unfortunate, as 
boards always gave anarchists the advantage over agencies that would 
like to see them dissolved. Bethlehem was no different, it too was a 
fast and private way to spread info that the internet will never 
offer.

Bethlehem was just one of those boards. Its sort of odd. It never was 
a total anarchy BBS such as those that carried warez or numbers. It 
was just a meeting place, since every anarchist in the city knew 
Bethlehem. Hell, I remember wasting whole classes in skewl discussing
Bethlehem and its messages with my phriends. Times change...

So, we close the door on an board and an era that we'll probably look 
back on as the good times. Farewell Bethlehem, Lord Mysteriis, and 
all the users that made it great.
