   Random Access Humor (RAH) has been published since September
   1992.  Can't find those back issues of RAH online?  Now you 
   can find out what you've been missing with our exclusive
   "RAH on Disk" service.  For a modest fee the publisher will
   send you an MS-DOS compatible diskette containing all existing
   issues of RAH, as well as information for potential RAH writers
   and distributors.  Both ASCII Text and READROOM.TOC versions 
   are included.  Eventually the RAH back issues will fill even a
   high density diskette, but until that happens each disk will
   include recent issues of other electronic magazines.  Check out
   the latest the rapidly developing field of electronic 
   publishing has to offer.
