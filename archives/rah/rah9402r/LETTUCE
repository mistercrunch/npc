I think it's supposed to be an exclamation point.  Greg
doesn't think so, and none of my other proofreaders see it.
I just hope it isn't a rude symbol in some other culture.  :-)

The symbol in question appears to         / _\/_ \
the right.  It is the last symbol        | |____| |
in the new RAH logo.  I had thought      \__ \____/
all along that it was an exclamation      |_\____|
point (without the point at the            |____|
bottom).  This makes the new logo a
stylized "RAH!" with the magazine title imbedded within.
The following are some other opinions:

Kelly Price -  Logo's designer:
"Straight answer:  NOT an exclamation mark.  It's the same
 character used for piping in MS-DOS, made by pressing 
 [SHIFT] and [\] together.  Better now that you don't 
 have to change it for the next issue of RAH?"

Ray Koziel - who officially kicked this off with his letter:

"You know, since I've been looking at it, it might actually be a 
 hand with its forefinger pointing outward, like in the old Uncle 
 Sam posters.  Hmmmmm. "

Hmm, indeed.  Someone else told me it looked like a computer screen. 
Looks like the RAH logo has become the RAH ink blot test.  Oh, well.
Unless it turns out to be offensive to someone (but what isn't these
days?), the logo will remain in its original form, whatever that is.

Dear Honourable Saint Divinity and part time All Round Swell Guy 
Mr. Bealer, 

Hi!

Yours Truly,
Giuliano Maciocci Jr.

PS: I was puzzled by a phrase which featured in the the Twit-Filter
(RAH Jan 1994) when you refer to a KIDIA (n. 1.: Knowit/Done it All,
common e-mail annoying subject prone to self-gratification by
unjustified boasting, usually afflicted by a severe inferiority
complex; 2.: RAH reader; 3.: RAH Editor) as "She."

Could you please supply details as to explain the cause of your
unusual adversity towards the opposite sex?  It is quite unusual for
a publication such as yours to discriminate between the sexes,
instead, you should should have referred to the KIDIA as "It" or "The
KIDIA." I should sue you for the black eye donated to me by my most
adorable and feminist girlfriend, but I will not since I like your
magazine.

Giuliano,

First, RAH is one of the last bastions of the fine art of political
incorrectness.  The very word "empowerment" makes me spit up.  I
needed to place a pronoun in the article at a couple of places, and
despise those clumsy he/she constructs.  The trouble is that "it" is
not a proper way to refer to a human, even indirectly.

I made this mistake a few years back when referring to the newborn son
of a good friend as "it" and was severely dressed-down for my error.
The newborn son who was not an "it" was, at the time, only capable of
eating, crying, and excreting.  The boy was therefore less socially
capable than a KIDIA (though only slightly).  Nevertheless, he was
not an "it."  It follows that a KIDIA cannot be an "it" either.

Getting back to the point of this discourse (if, indeed, there is
one), I needed to use either he or she in the article.  In a fit of
conformity I decided to alternate between the two.  Since even this
is not good enough, I'm going back to strictly "he" when referring to
a generic human animal.  If anybody doesn't like it, tough beans.

Second, you should have your girlfriend arrested for assault before
she does something even worse.  Does the name Bobbitt mean anything
to you?

Hey! Could you arrange for umich anonymous ftp to get all this
nifty RAH stuff?  The address is 192.131.22.7.

Dear John,

I've been uploading the RAH issues to etext.archive.umich.edu
on the last day of the previous month since May 1993.  For some
reason the 11/93, 12/93 and 01/94 issues were not posted for
download until mid January.  If the new issue hasn't been posted by
the second week of the month, e-mail the archivist of that site.

Otherwise, you can obtain the issues from:
   ftp.clark.net (198.17.243.2)  dir: pub/rah
This is a public area on my Internet service provider's system.  I
maintain the RAH directory myself, but I don't own the site.  This
directory contains both editions of RAH in ZIP archives and the ASCII
edition in uncompressed format.

 Subject: RAH distribution         

Dave Bealer,
       I have only recently discovered your electronic 
magazine and have been trying to find every issue since.  
Here in the Land Down Under it is difficult to do so though 
and I was wondering if you had any way of getting the 
latest copy of RAH to Australia with any sort of regularity.
*** WARNING --- GRATUITOUS APPRECIATION PARAGRAPH WARNING --- ***

  My congratulations to you on being able to start and 
continue such a fine and long needed publication.  Good 
luck for the future.

Regards,
Ray
