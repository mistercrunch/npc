
   This is the new style of RAH Readroom format.  It makes use of
one of the more interesting features of version 3.0 of the 
READROOM.TOC specification published on 9/14/93.

   The issue has been divided up into "departments," with each
article residing in the department it best fits.  At least that 
is the theory.  If you believe that something has been placed in
the wrong department, let the editor know.  He probably won't 
change it, but you never know.  Stranger things have happened on 
occasion.
