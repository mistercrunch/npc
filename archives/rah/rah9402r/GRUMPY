
RAH Humor Review: "Grumpy Old Men"
by Ray Koziel

In the movie "Grumpy Old Men", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are
back together again as two elderly gentlemen who have known each
other since childhood.  Lemmon and Matthau, John Gustafson and Max
Goldman respectively, were good friends as children.  Their
relationship changed when Max accused John of taking his girl.  Now
as old men, they greet by calling each other "putz" and "moron" and
have fun by playing pranks on each other.

Enter Ariel, played by Ann-Margaret.  Ariel is a beautiful, middle
aged woman who just happens to move across the street from John and
Max and immediately grabs their attention.  Ariel is always looking
for new and exciting things.  As she gets to know her new neighbors,
she helps John and Max rediscover their own inner youth.  In the
process though, the old rivalry between Max and John is rekindled.
In the end, Ariel ends up with...woah!  You didn't think I was going
to spoil the ending now?

A delightful character in the movie is John's father, played by
Burgess Meredith.  He plays the dirty old man character perfectly,
encouraging his son to go after Ariel or he might do it himself.
Also, hang around through the closing credits.  They show some of the
bloopers which took place while filming the movie, including some
good one-liners from Meredith. 

All in all, "Grumpy Old Men" is an amusing movie that subscribes to
the philosophy that even though growing old is mandatory, growing up
can be optional.                                                {RAH}
