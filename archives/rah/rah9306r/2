Editorial - Pizza and Circuses
by Dave Bealer

This has turned into a strange RAH issue (a redundancy?) again.  This
bit of prose replaces the previously written editorial, which was
promoted to an actual article, "The Eyes Have Had It."

May was a stressful month for yours truly, with several instances of
day work required; yuck!  I usually work nights (and Greg is the 
vampire?), so my sleep cycle was totally scrambled.  I managed to
churn out a few articles despite the problems.  A few jokes may even
have crept into one or two of them.

This issue suddenly has two articles dealing with late night
activities in computer centers.  Ray Koziel submitted his in early
May.  It was formatted, spell-checked, then set aside until needed.
Greg Borek submitted his article four days after deadline, which is
typical.  Greg's article seemed vaguely familiar.  I thought we might
have published a similar article in a recent issue.  Only when I
began laying out this beast did I realize that the familiar sounding
article was slated for the same issue!  Oh...what the heck?  Why not
make this a theme issue?  So this is now the "Late Night Pizza Party
in the Computer Center" issue of RAH.

RAH Does Internet

RAH is now available directly to users on the Internet via anonymous
FTP.   site:        uglymouse.css.itd.umich.edu
       directory:   pub/Zines/RAH
The files are named: rahYYMM.txt.   This is an uncompressed ASCII
text version.  Issues since May 1993 are available.  I have no direct
control over when the new issue is posted for download at this site.
Each new issue will be sent to the archivist on the last day of the
previous month.  Please be patient.                             {RAH}
