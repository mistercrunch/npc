The Eyes Have Had It
by Dave Bealer

"Don't sit so close to the television!  You'll ruin your eyes!"
Familiar words from childhood for members of the first true "TV
Generation."  If only mother knew what we were in for once we grew
up.  Now those of us in the "information professions" spend all our
days staring at modified TV screens that are typically less than 2
feet from our faces.  Increasing numbers of employers are admitting
the effects that extended CRT usage has on the eyes of their workers.
Low radiation CRTs, screen filters and free eyeglass plans are the
common reactions of corporations to this problem.  

Many of us don't get enough of this abuse at work, so we plant
ourselves in front of PC monitors for hours once we get home.  The
full color Super VGA monitors we use are getting larger all the time.
The mega-monitors of the future will require humans working within
the hazard zone to wear modified welding masks to protect their
eyesight.  Of course the hazard zone will extend from the front of
the monitor out approximately 4.8 kilometers.

I recently used my rapidly failing eyesight to read the final book in
the popular series by John Updike, _Rabbit tastes good_.        {RAH}
