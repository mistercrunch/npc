RAH Humor Review: Splitting Heirs
by Dave Bealer

Since nothing new and funny presented itself online this month, I had
planned to review the new comedy movie "Splitting Heirs," starring
Eric Idle, John Cleese and Rick Moranis.  Greg Borek and I saw it
early in May and enjoyed it.  The problem occurred when I tried to
find an advertisement for the movie in the 05/23/93 edition of the
_Baltimore Sun_ (a newspaper) in order to obtain information for the
review such as the name of the studio that released the flick.  Not
only couldn't I find an ad, but I couldn't even find a listing for
the movie in ANY theatre in the Baltimore area!  

It boggles my mind that this movie could have left the first run
theatres that quickly.  "Splitting Heirs" (SH) is not as good as some
of the Python alumni's earlier efforts, like "A Fish Called Wanda."
It is no slouch as a funny movie, however, and deserves better than 
this.  

While I'm no fan of Rick Moranis, I actually enjoyed his work in SH.
Eric Idle was his comically affable self, while John Cleese had a
hilarious turn as a homicidal lawyer.  It may be too late to see SH
in the theatre, but it will be well worth renting when it comes out
on video.                                                       {RAH}
