>>>> Lettuce to the Editor <<<<

We only received one letter this month, by a reader from the wilds of
coastal British Columbia.  Said reader only has access to issues 0
through 3 of RAH Volume 0 due to the vagaries of communications in
that part of the world.  It was also apparent from the missive that
spelling checkers are a luxury unknown in those parts.  The crux of
the letter was a request for a diskette filled with more recent RAH
issues.

Although this request could not be honored as such, we are making
every effort to find new ways to distribute RAH.  A new service is
now being offered by Vaporware Communications: dial 1-900-555-TWIT
and hear James Earl Jones reading the text of the latest RAH issue.
This call costs just $4.95 per minute, average call is 18 minutes.
Kids, distract your parents' attention away from the phone before
calling.                 

Seriously speaking, there are plans in the works for a "Best of RAH" 
annual hypertext edition for MS-DOS.  The first one should be
available in September 1993, concurrent with the first anniversary
issue of RAH.  The annual will not be freeware, but a commercial
product.  Price has yet to be determined, but will probably fall into
the $10 - $9999 range.                                          {RAH}
