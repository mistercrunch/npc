
The Comp Sci Song  
(To the tune of Rawhide, best performed with lots of choruses 
at approximately 4 am.)

lyrics: Brian Dyck
inspiration: Brian Dyck, Pat Johanneson, Neil Enns

Typing typing typing
keep those fingers typing
Keep those fingers typing
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

Don't try to understand it
just prove it by induction
who knows if you'll survive 
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

Coding coding coding
though your fingers are swollen
keep on keep on CODING
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

Magnetic radiation
late night aggravation
stress-filled heat prostration
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

No matter who you're under
You are baffled and you blunder
You can do nothing now but suffer
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

Dataloss on diskettes
Bugged up code not fixed yet
Nothing left but regret
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

Coding coding coding
though your fingers are swollen
keep on keep on CODING
COMP-SCIIIIIII!!!

(snap)

HeyaaAAAAHHHH!!!
YAHHHHHOOOOOO!!!

COMP-SCIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!
