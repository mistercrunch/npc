Here we go, heading for the biggest marketing opportunity of the
year; a real orgy of consumerism.  It makes me proud to be an
American.  RAH has even jumped on the holiday bandwagon and included
some unique gift giving ideas for that hard-to-shop-for friend or
family member.

This will be the last RAH issue using the current format.  Both the
ASCII Text and Readroom editions will be different next month.  For
one thing, the new RAH logo will make its debut.  In order to blend
it into the ASCII Text edition, the "cover" will have to be re-
designed.  The Readroom edition will begin to make use of some new,
advanced features of the READROOM.TOC architecture.

RAH now has a private support site on the Internet.  For complete
details, see the Announcement section.

RAH finished in a tie for third in the "electronic serial" category
of the 1993 Digital Quill Awards.  This is a great honor, considering
the quality of the other magazines named in the top four.  See the
included press release for details.
