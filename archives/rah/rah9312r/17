
Announcements and Observations

As of the January 1994 issue, the Readroom edition of RAH will be
formatted for version 3.0 of the READROOM.TOC specification.  Sysops
should note that they will need Readroom V3.0 or higher to display
RAH online for their callers.

RAH now has a private support site on the Internet.  This is not a
"live" site, so telnet and FTP are not supported.  By January we
hope to have an e-mail fileserver operating at the site.  At that
time users will be able to request RAH back issues, which will be
sent as UUENCODED file attaches to e-mail messages.

In the meantime, free RAH subscriptions are available to readers with
an Internet account (FidoNet users *cannot* make use of this service
through the Internet <> FidoNet gateway).  Simply send an e-mail
message to our listserver at:  listserv@rah.clark.net

In the body of your message, include a line like this:

                 SUB rahtext Your Name

Where "Your Name" is your username on your Internet host machine.
This will place you on the subscription list for the uncompressed
ASCII Text edition of RAH, which is sent as a UUENCODED file attach 
to an e-mail message.

If you would prefer to receive the ASCII Text and Readroom editions
as UUENCODED ZIP archives, place the following line in the body of
your message:

                 SUB rahzip Your Name

Finally, you may join in the discussion in our new Bitnet-style
mailing list.  There you can ask questions of the RAH staff.  To
join this list, place the following line in the body of your message:

                 SUB rahuser Your Name

In the unlikely event you wish to unsubscribe from any list you have
joined, simply send a message to the listserver with the following
line in the body:

                 UNSUB listname

Where listname is the name of the mailing list you joined.
