
End of Term Blues
by Pat Johanneson ($JOHANNESONP@brandonu.ca)

You know it's late, but you're not sure how late.  You haven't
checked your watch since three AM, and frankly, you don't plan to
look at it again until the security guards come by and open the doors
to the science building.  You need a pizza.  You need a beer.  You
need a soft place to lay your head.  You need to finish this program
before midnight last night, but since you obviously have flubbed that
deadline, you're going to have to edit the date stamp back.  And that
is not an easy thing to do.  It takes a light touch and nimble
fingers, and right now your fingers feel as light and nimble as
frozen Maple Leaf weiners. 

And you *know* you could get your code working, if you could just
figure out which of the 19 optional flags you need on this particular
call.  And then figure out just why you're getting a stack dump every
time you try to run the concatenation subroutine at the heart of your
program.  Then, by God and Turing, you will be able to go home and
*sleep*. 

Ah, the life of a student.  No life like it.

Except maybe corporate prisoner.
