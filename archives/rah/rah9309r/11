
The Canonical List of Canonical Lists
by Dave Bealer

Canonical lists are currently popular among users of the Internet.
Available for many subjects, a canonical list is the "authoritative,
generally accepted," list of items composing the given subject
matter.  Compiled and maintained by volunteers, many of these lists 
find their way to online conferences on other networks.  The lists
can vary in size from a few entries to hundreds of entries split
among several messages.  Since the volunteers compile and maintain
the lists, they are also the ones who get to determine exactly what
is canonical for each list.

A partial list of canonical lists follows:

Dead Baby Jokes
Elephant Jokes
"Mommy, mommy" Jokes
"Koresh and burn" Jokes
Jeffrey Dahmer Jokes
PMS Jokes
Lawyer Jokes (not approved by the California Bar Assoc.)
Fulldeckisms (e.g. He's not playing with a full deck)
Dan Quayle Dictionare
Blonde Jokes (probably redundant)
Hill-Billary Jokes
Steven Wright Jokes
Monty Python Quotes
Blackadder Quotes
"Deep Thoughts" (from Saturday Night Live)
Touch Tone Phone Songs (you play them on your telephone)
Ted Kennedy's Late Night Driving Tips
Jana Novotna's Rules of Wimbledon Etiquette
Mike Tyson's Dating Tips
MidEast Peace Proposals Throughout the Years (a LONG list)
Ronald Reagan's Presidential Memoirs (a SHORT list)
Honest Politicians of the World (the SHORTEST list)

The legality of lists that consist mostly of quotations of
copyrighted material is questionable, at best.  Propagate them
at your own risk.                                               {RAH}
