A new theme park has an immediate opening for a systems programmer or
developer.  The theme park is based on a new concept using exotic
animals in their natural, contained habitat.  Knowledge of Unix and
C++ helpful but not required.  Must be willing to relocate to the
Costa Rica area and should have a liking for reptiles, especially
large ones.  If interested, please call the following number for more
details: 1-800-RAPTORS.  Ask for Mr. Koziel.
