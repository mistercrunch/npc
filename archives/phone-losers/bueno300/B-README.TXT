 bueno.irc documentation - redboxchilipepper & logic box
---------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to bueno.irc, the hottest mIRC script in the whole
entire world! (We have proof) This is release 3.00.


---------------------------------------------------------
 History
---------------------------------------------------------
v3.00
I fixed alot of broken stuff and made some of the aliases
better in this release. There's also some new stuff. I
don't remember what all I put in, so go find it yourself,
dammit. What, did you actually expect me to keep an accurate
history file or something?
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.00
You're going to notice a completely different script than
you used with Bueno v1.00 because Logic Box came along and
added alot of cool war scripts and other bad things from 
his own script, FlaP 4.0. In fact, all the script work for
version 2.0 was done by him entirely so thanks Logic!

Besides that, the only major improvement over version 1.0 
is that everything is a little more organized and we got 
rid of alot of the stupid shit that was in there before. 
There's also more controls for dal.net users.
---------------------------------------------------------
v1.00
RBCP took lots of annoying color stuff out of a bunch of
other scripts and made the first incarnation of our beloved
Bueno.


---------------------------------------------------------
 Installing Bueno
---------------------------------------------------------
Unzip bueno300.zip into c:\bueno or wherever it is you want
to put it, then copy your mirc32.exe file into the same
directory and run it. I'd aldo suggest making a directory
for your logs and running /warsetup the first time you run
the script.

Guess that's about it. Enjoy the script! Maybe we'll make 
some real documentation someday even.
