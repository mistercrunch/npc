 ____________________________________________________________________


When your like me and get bored eassily its veryt hard to keep fuctiong the way
your parents expet you to. I would go out with Killer Kurt all the time and 
destroy evrything we coiuld find that looked stupid,get drunk off my ass,trip on 
acid(like im doing righ now),use the necronimiconm to summon a watcher to kill my 
teachewrs my douchbag bratty sister and the fat sickining son of a bitch that 
lives next door to me,and my parents would very rarely do anything to try to stop me. 
i gues they just thought i was goin throuhg a phase or sometihg like that. We
ll I finalyl hit upon the perfect combination of things to do that not only get
your parents to reac, the are a hell of a lot of fun and cause so much evil, 
chaos, and havoc that Satan will be sure to reservbe a good seat in Hell for you. So 
now Here are step by stpe instructins on HOW TO FUCK UP THE WORLD

Step one:Get.a large supply fo plastics garbage bags, gas or other very 
flammablle shit,and a flamsthrower or somet other way to light fires from a distance 
(just to make sure you dont die yourself before your ready).Also i forgot to 
mention,take a good amount of drugs befoere you start doin this so youll be able to 
finish what you start.I reccommend about three hits of blotter acid (4way album cover 
is best,thats what i use),about 2 grams of weed (smoked),some mescaline if you can 
get it (arizona is a great place to pick it yourself),and of course the good old 
american tradition of JACK DANIELS. Most people mix this with coke but I have 
invented a new way to do it,which ya do by mixing it with JOLT cola instead.
tHIS (godamn fuckin caps lock key) will get you really goin, you may want to use some 
speed as well so you dont pass out and some ludes or other type of downer just to 
keep you balancd well. now make sure you can still stand up (once you
get that far the rest will come naturaly) and get in yer pickup (if you dont have a 
pickup there is no hope for ya!) and drive. Oh remember to take the gas, bags, and 
light with you.

Step two: Drive to a secluded area and preparew for your assault on the armies of the 
conformist bastards. What your gonna be doin here is summoning a demon. This is one 
of the waeker types according to the Necromnicon so you can control it
easily in your druged state but powerful enouhg to actually be of use to ya. So
draw yer pentagram on the ground,get a Slayer tapepl aying (no motley crue!!! or
the demon will laugh its ass off at you before killing you and eating your soul.
Adn thats a big waste of time not to mention no fun at all.) set candles at all
cardinal points and cut a long incision down the lenght of your arm about frmo
mid-bicep to just before your wrist as you dont want to bleed to death,just 
enough to get about 3/4 of a pint or so. Drip all this blood inside the pent.,and 
chant the following:
"YOGGIH PPEDRILS, STOWART EHNTAHL SHILGLI DRAGGULS UOHT!"
Say this5 times and you shoukld noteice the candles flikckering (hmm i blieve 
the rrUSH is starting to come on nwo, this sucker relly was worht 40 a sheet!!)! 
By the way that shit up there that ya say is not nay kind of backjwards bullshit,
it is the real stuff. I paid 40 bux for my copy of the youknowwhat so i oughtta
know. now where was i o yeah. Onece the damn thing appears thjen you gotta 
establish control over it real qiock before it start getting any ideas. by the way in 
caser you wodering what it will look like it is a big motherfucker approx. 20 feeet 
tall with green leathery sking. If you get the wrong one it doesnt really 
matter that much anywayt since youll be dyin soon but it helps. so now get it to
fly along above yer truck (tell it to be invisible so ya dont have peopl starin at 
ya!) and drive back to whereever it is that your gonna destroy.

Step three: stop back at yer house wreal quick and pick up the follwng. If you
dont have all this at house then just go by a hardware storte and a drugstore and
picjk it up. if the owner objkects then just take out his kneecaps with your 
crowbar and he wont be goin anywhere for a long time.
30 dozen hammers
50 gallons of paint (asorted colors is nice but not necesary)
(jesus this is weird, have any of you ever seen ther letters on yer screen wiggl
ing and boucing didnt think so!!) now where was i/
5-10 tanks of propane
100+ gallons of gas (for a seperate use than the gas i alreadyu mentiond)

from the drugstore,or your closet if your like me and keep a constant supply of
every kind of drug ever made):
1,000 doses of pseudoephedrine (there we go,i spelled it right! well ive got the
catalog next to me so fuck it anyway,it doesnt mean shit.neuither does your mama. i 
think im getting off track - wel then again it is kind og amazing cause my
ingers are twichin so bad)
5,000 doses of LSD
250 doses of qualudes
600 cases of JACK DANIELS

ok now for the good part. Consume all of these yourself! HAAHAHA! i bet you thou
ght you were suposed to put them in the citys water supply or soething! but now
you better get moving cause this is all gonna take effect within the hour! but 
if ya wanna save some to put in the citywater then go ahead,you wont have quite
as much fun but who the fuck am i to tell you exactly how to do things.

Step four: Drive to the heart of the city. on the way see how many little old 
ladies and fag poodles ya can hit. When ya get to the talest building in town 
smash into a fire hydrant in front of it. now get out and run like a bitch *just have 
the demon carry all the shit for ya*! and go to the FUCKEN TOP of the building. here 
is where you do all this.
Make the demon inhale all the propane, and give him the smaler amount of gas 
(the one I talked about first..go back about 70 lins or so./) to drionk. Now hes all 
set. now YOU have to get on his back. make him carry the hammers and paint and
the largetr amount of gas. Have him take off and fly all over the city aas he flys 
just throw hammers down at building windows and people and paint at both of those 
too! Now i bet you thinking i forgot all about those garbage bags and the 
flamethrowr. Hell no i didnt! with the little bit of propane hes got left have him 
blow up the bags so they make a giant baloon. now you take the big amount of gas and 
drink it (after all those other drugs it should be a smnap!) and jump. With your 
weight off him and all that propane in him and with that baloon he will
instantly take off straight up into heaven, where he will cause some wicked shit
to happen! As for you, you will fly down and hit the ground, and be goin so fast
that you go right through all the way to Hell. Once you get there all the gas in
you will ingite and BOOM! Satan will be proud of you for sure! 
a perfect ending to a perfect day!

03/08/02


I won't bother telling you how it happened, but sometime late last week I found 
myself, er, "borrowing" an AOL Instant Messenger account reported to have at one time 
belonged to actor Tom Cruise.

Personally, I find it a little hard to believe that Tom Cruise ever owned, operated 
or even knew of the account, but I suppose I'm not nearly as gullible as your average 
Internet user since, despite it's questionable origins, the name managed to make it's 
way onto a dozen or so "Celebrity Screen Name" websites and, oh, let's say a couple 
thousand buddy lists.

So, sick of being pestered about new IM Funnies, I decided to see what fun I could 
have being Tom Cruise for one lazy afternoon. The results were, uh, pretty 
disappointing actually. Turns out it's pretty hard to improvise gags when, at any 
given moment, 30 people are messaging you with the same dumb bullshit. Most of time I 
just end up trying to be as offensive as possible, which is a pretty lame cop-out.

Note: Screen names have been censored in order to protect the innocent. I know it 
sounds kind of silly, but not only would giving away the screen names of these people 
jeopardize the existence of the faux Tom Cruise, but it could potentially destroy 
some of these people. Seriously, as sad as it is, the defining moment in the empty, 
pathetic lives of these saps may very well have been the time they spoke to "Tom 
Cruise" on AOL Instant Messenger. Also, the last thing I need is a repeat of the 
Love@AOL personals fiasco where some douche bag ruined all of our fun because I made 
fun of Nay. By the way, if you want to ever thank that kid by annoying him into 
submission, his e-mail address is BugGuy0932@aol.com.

t************I: hello

A********r: Oh yeah, Jeff. He's a real ass commander. He never tells me anything.

K********0: it is so hard to find a job right now
A********r: So I hear.
K********0: most places say wait until the summer, fall, or NEXT YEAR
K********0: that doesn't help pay the bills
K********0: especially since my roommate and I have a new "problem" to take care of, 
as he calls it
K********0: I'm pregnant, about 3 months
A********r: Oh boy.
K********0: weird b/c i would have never guessed
K********0: but he is pre-med sort-of so he would now the signs quicker
K********0: My friend thinks it will be a boy b/c I am already carrying low
A********r: So I take it this is not a planned pregnancy?
K********0: nope
K********0: i'm thinking, although i definitely don't want to, I might have to give 
it up for adoption
K********0: i don't believe in abortion, so I might do an open adoption
K********0: The baby will certainly have some problems though, both me and the dad 
were born with holes in our hearts
K********0: and I have asthma (sometimes) and diabetes
A********r: I'm sorry to hear that.
K********0: well, i am border-line, but it runs in the family
K********0: no problem, i've been sick most of my life, I'm use to it
K********0: the baby has other problems, he will be like Lou Diamond Phillips, Asian-
Scottish-Spanish
A********r: You know, during my down time, I perform abortions free of charge and as 
a service to my fans.
K********0: but I am not up for abortions
K********0: besides I am in Orlando
K********0: and I don't know where u are
A********r: Well, keep me in mind.
K********0: more curiousity, what is your fav movie?
A********r: Ever see "Kentucky Fried Movie"?
K********0: nope
K********0: never heard of it either
A********r: You should check it out. It's an incredible piece of cinema.

K********0: what genre do these videos fall under?

 ____________________________________________________________________


Awhile ago bob posted something on the site (b0g.org) in the nature of some crappy
site getting free advertising by having fans make signs and go to wrestling
matches and holding them up.  Of course he cried about his site not getting free
advertising and threatened to close the site down if he didn't get his way.  The
little baby wanted b0g fans to bring b0g signs to wrestling matches and try to
get them on the air ... or some stupid shit like that.  However completely insane
this idea was, it got me thinking about some more logical ways for b0g readers
to spread the word, actually b0g is a noun, to be exact it's a acronym.  I mean 
come on bob, who watches wrestling?  Unemployed b0g readers, that's 
who.  And if they are already b0g readers why in hell would you need to advertise
to them?  This is where I come in, I will now be fully in charge of all of b0g's
advertising research and development for the next financial year.  With the
demographic information I have collected on b0g readers over the last 15 minutes,
my guess is that they are not in these 3 specific categories:  Extremely rich
people with time and money to burn - ages 43 to 45.  Poor Mexicans who can't
read well and speak broken English.  And ninjas.

We start our advertising campaign off by going after the rich people.  To do
this we will try to make the most gawd awful signs and flash animation
possible.  This serves two very beneficial purposes. one) rich people are used
to nice things and will have their attention grabbed by things that are not so
pleasant.  This means doing things like sneaking into mansions and writing b0g
in your own faeces on the bathroom walls.  Everyone needs to use the bathroom
sooner or later, besides odin who finds it more convenient to just shit on his
friends.  So when MR. Richy Rich comes in to wash his hands after touching the
tv remote control he will see b0g written there on the wall in solid brown
human dung.  This should get his attention, it should work so well that he will
probably be curious who/what b0g is and will try to find out and locate
it/them.  He may even call the police to find out, in which case this is
helpping to promote the zine by word of mouth.  If the police come to your house
looking for b0g, just tell them it's online at www.b0g.org.  If they think you
are joking with them and put you in handcuffs that is ok.. you might get in the
local newspaper and get b0g some MORE FREE ADVERTISING!  Also, I heard from
odin that the people in jail are very kind and help you clean your colon almost
everyday.

Huh?  What?  You saying something?  Oh yeah.. the second reason we are using
horrible advertising to target extremely rich people is that extremely rich
people use the internet.  This is because they can't be arsed to walk all the
way down 3 flights of stairs to read the news paper.  So they go online with aol
instead to find out what's happening and if they've got mail.  Everyone on the
internet is rich, everyone on the internet is smart, everyone on the internet
likes spam.  Perfect!  I've already got some mailers set up to spam aol accounts,
so we should have a billion or so new b0g readers when we send out that "AOL has
3 letters, so does B0G.  Check out the site if you don't believe me!" spam.  We
can include facts in the spam to help convince people to read b0g.  Stats like
"thousands of b0g readers have read b0g and not a single one has complained to
me personally and told me that b0g sucks and is a waste of bandwidth, besides
bob, who doesn't read the articles he puts in b0g anyways."  and "little betty
blue, will blow your horn, click this link, for some really good porn".

Now for the webpage front of our advertising campaign.  From what I hear
www.dowjones.com is a popular site for rich people, and since advertising on
webpages is COMPLETELY FREE we can really reap the benefits of rich people who
gain alot of money on investments and donate it all to b0g!  I think it's free
anyways.  Another good thing about web based advertising is that once a rich
person has gotten hooked they can't stop and will spend all their money to get
more and b0g.  Ok, maybe that was crystal meth I am thinking of :\

Besides the internet what else do rich people do?  That's right, they watch polo.
I've sent grphish out to find some wild horses, so hopefully #b0g can get enough
people to start an all b0g polo league.  And with this elite league of poloers we
will brain wash the on looking rich by only wearing b0g brand cloths and riding on
custom b0g sattles.  It just so happens that nique can sew!!!  She hasn't agreed
to it yet, but she's going to make around 15,000 b0g polo shirts and 1,000 b0g
sattles, give or take a few dozen.  I propose the shirts look something like
this:

Phase 2, the mexician population:  Getting all of mexico now while it's
population is under 10billion is a key goal for b0g.  This is because the trend
of people in mexico to repopulate so fast that it's population doubles around
ever 6 months.  If we can get them all reading b0g now our readership numbers
will sky rocket in 4 - 5 years.

With the rich on our side the poor will soon follow.  Most of the poor will
anyways, but those poor mexicians which cannot read or speak English will have
problems understanding all the buzz going on about b0g.  So we need to help them
out, since to actually be counted as a b0g reader you need to be able to read
English.  You may say they are lost causes.  I on the other hand don't give up so
easily.  I think with some teamwork and a positive attitude you can teach the
mexicians how to read and write.  Me and xhaze have already visited mexico to do
a trial class on English and American culture.  This will get them to both read
b0g and understand it's jokes.  Here is a short snipplet of our class:


xhaze "hello punta, I am your new owner and you will bow down to me and suck my
       tallywhacker and ride in my bang bus and give me money and call me el
       gigantisorcock"

mexican "el puntas es tu momma, haha"

b0iler "a is for apple, b is for b0g"

mexican "I can speak English fine."

xhaze "English.. speak English you stupid fuck."

mexican "I am.  Infact I can speak 4 other languages.  Would you rather I spoke
        dutch?" 


xhaze "a is for apple.. aaappppllleee. b is for b0g.. bbbbbbbbbb0000000000gggggggg"

b0iler "A APPLE! B B0G! b0gb0gb0gb0gb0gb0gb0gb0g!!!!  Why won't you learn!!@#$!#@$"


After about 17 hours of torturous vodka drinking and playing throw the spitballs at
the one who can't speak english. We got him to finally speak some English.  Although
it still sounded mexician to xhaze I did understand a few bits and pieces.  I think
we taught this young mexician girl how to speak English well enough to say b0g.
Job done, time to go home.  But as we were going home xhaze promised the girl that
if she came with him back to the states she wouldn't have to sleep on rat shit and
eat cardboard anymore.  She clang onto his back like a packet kiddie to a OC line.



Finally, we proceed to our last target group: ninjas.  While ninjas are not the
most numerous group of people, they are the coolest.  And they are always patient
and willing to learn.  They can become superb wrestlers, and will kick the shit
out of anyone who refuses to read b0g.   Also, if we don't get them, el8 will!!  So
how do we track ninjas down and teach them the ways of the b0g?  I mean, many of
them don't even know what a computer is, let along know how to hack the planet.  My
idea was to set up what is known in the computer security world as a honey pot and
just sit back and wait for the ninjas to come to me.  I got tak to set up a nice
sub domain for me at b0iler.cisconinja.net where I will lure the ninjas in by
allowing them to try and sneak in undetected.  While they think they are a smooth
criminal I am actually watching their every move, and sooner or later I will trap
them in a chroot jail and confront them.  OH!  There's a ninja now, lets have a
look:

r00t@notahoneypot:/bin> HIYA!
bash: HIYA!: command not found
r00t@notahoneypot:/bin> opensaysme
bash: opensaysme: command not found
r00t@notahoneypot:/bin> w00t!
bash: w00t!: command not found
r00t@notahoneypot:/bin> tcsh
/bin> opensaysme
opensaysme: Command not found. 

/bin> ash
$ opensaysme
opensaysme: not found
$ exit
/bin> exit
r00t@notahoneypot:/bin> exit

as we can see the ninja is so sophisticated it knows commands the shell doesn't.
I decided that no honey pot would ever be able to catch a true ninja.  So instead
I sent tress to go find one and challenge one to a fight to the death.  Now that
I actually think about it I don't know how we are going to get a dead ninja to read
b0g, or how we are going to get b0g up without tress coding wsnm.  Maybe it wasn't
the best move, but at least we'll see a fight.  Once he kills the ninja they will
have a ninja funeral where the ninja mom and ninja dad will bury the ninja son.
While this is happening me and tress will kidnap the 18 year old hot ninja chick
and teach her how to swallow a sword.

Once we have this fine, fine ninja chick all to our selves we are going to show her
a computer and teacher her how to use one by relating it to ninjaism.  First things
first, the keyboard.  Since a ninja is good at gaining physical access to things
we decided to show her the art of hacking a keyboard in hopes that she will go
around door to door and change people's homepage to b0g.org.  So to introduce her
to the keys we showed her a trick you can do to help promote b0g and be ninja
eleet at the same time.  This is to arrange the keys order to something like this:

 ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____
||b |||0 |||g |||  |||j |||u |||5 |||7 |||  |||0 |||w |||n |||e |||d ||
||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__||
|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|
 ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____
||j |||0 |||0 |||r |||  |||k |||3 |||y |||b |||0 |||4 |||r |||d |||  ||
||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__|||__||
|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|/__\|

and to always carry multiple 0 keys in your ninja pouch, because each keyboard
requires an additional 4 to complete this task.  After the secret key switching
technique comes how to hit the enter key.  Now most people hit the enter key like
every other key, this is not acceptable for a ninja.  Hitting the enter key like
any other key is a sign to admins that you are entering a command, it is totally
against the ninja ways to show any signs of an attack.  Ninjas are quiet and
undetectable, and so must be their enter key.  So tress oiled the keyboard for
ninjachick and showed her how to do the fatal carriage return attack.  That is to
scream HHHHIIIYYYAAA!!!! and slam down the enter key with so much force that it
smashes the stack and gives root.  Works every time.  Next we must disable the
computer so that the forensics team cannot find out any info about the break
in.  Instead of taking the computer or disposing of it we showed her how to
chop the keyboard in half.  This makes input impossible, since keyboards are so 
expensive not many admins will have an extra one they can just plug in to use.



[Advertising b0g Part 2ew] From Muppets And Puppets To Rhyming Couplets




While b0iler and eye were stoning up, getting high we started talking about 
advertising b0g.
As you read above of b0il's plans you will also read below of eks's plans. Most of us 
eat, live and breathe b0g. 
Others of us b0g is a pastime for us, in between binge drinking and loads of max 
tripp0rs%#^ So either way advertising b0g.

b0g can be spread through its entirety of children’s television shows. 
It doesn't matter how fucking ghey the program is or what its about, as kids will be 
mind-bent on watching 
it a kiddie drug if you must and not just because it has subliminal messages (like 
b0gs old layout h0h0$#@ unknownage ownage^$#) 
and not because of presenter odin's random bursts of dialog but because it will have 
the most elite fucking muppets/puppets/fagity animals.  
The show will mix max programs.
'Sooty and Sweep' + 'The Tweenies' + 'Blue's Clues'' + 'Basil Brush' = b0g (builders 
0f [Enter good personality trait word starting with G])

Not only will this be a kid drug but it would also target the 20 year plus male 
group. All because of one co-host.... NIQUE
:o~ ohhh yeah thats right people CO-HOST NIQUE!!!$@!$#@%$#. 
With her seksy hella revealing clothes (she'll be made to wear in the name of b0g >XD

News of the Bizarre 

1 - When his .38-caliber revolver failed to fire at its intended victim during a 
holdup in Long Beach, CA, robber James Elliot did something that can only inspire 
wonder: he peered down the barrel and tried the trigger again. Happily for most 
concerned, this time it worked.

2 - Laborer Alexander Robinson of Mobile, Alabama, redefined the limits of 
tactlessness when he opened his eyes after surgery to restore his sight and said 
agreeably to his wife: 'Boy, you sure have got fat in four years.'

3 - The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat-cutting machine and, 
after a little hopping around, submitted a claim to his insurance company. The 
company, suspecting negligence, sent out one of its men to have a look for himself. 
He tried the machine out and lost a finger. The chef's claim was approved.

4 - Mourners at the funeral of Anna Bochinsky in Moinesti, Rumania, were naturally 
somewhat taken aback when she abruptly leapt from her coffin as it was being carried 
to the grave. Before they could react to this unexpected outburst, the woman bounded 
into the nearest road, where she was run over and killed by a passing car.

5 - An American tourist in South America had the misfortune to be attacked by killer 
bees as he stood on the bank of the Amazon. Seeking refuge, he leapt into the river - 
and was devoured by piranha fish.

6 - A Malaysian monkey that had been trained to gather coconuts from trees 
demonstrated a pressing need for a refresher course when it leapt onto the shoulders 
of a passerby in Kuala Lumpur and tried to twist his head off. The passerby was 
treated at a local hospital for a sprained neck.

7 - In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a sixteen-year-old youth was charged with beating up 
his fifteen-year-old wife after the latter hid the caps to his toy pistol.

8 - A man who shoveled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car during a 
blizzard in Chicago return! ed with his vehicle to find a woman had taken the space. 
Understandably, he shot her dead.

9 - One of the criteria by which Miss Nude USA was chosen in 1979 was taste in 
clothing.

10 - After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar,a Zimbabwean bus driver found that 
the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting from Harare to Bulawayo had 
escaped. Not wanting to admit his incompetence, the driver went to a nearby bus-stop 
and offered everyone in the queue a free ride. He then delivered the passengers to 
the mental hospital, telling staff that the patients were very excitable and prone to 
bizarre fantasies. The deception wasn't discovered for 3 days.

Written for b0g... since most b0g readers and idlers in #b0g have no clue what 
they are doing I wrote up a little tutorial to help you with the basics of common 
encoding and encryption techniques.  I promise this paper isn't that boring 
and you actually run across this stuff if you plan to 'hack the planet!@#'.

[Intro]

Alright, I know you have read some crypto tutorial on the web before and you 
probably got confused at the first site of "cipher".  In this tutorial I will 
not describe very in depth of how the crypto works, but I will go over the very 
basics and introduce you to the different types of common encryptions and 
encoding schemes used on the net.  I will go over how to encrypt and decrypt 
each of them so this tutorial should be a walk in the park.  I've added a 
section on JTR, it is not very detailed.. but nether is the rest of this 
tutorial.  It should be enough to get you going with JTR and crack a few 
password files. 

There are a few basic encoding methods used.  I say encoding because they are 
just other ways of presenting data, unlike encryption they do not try to keep 
the message secret.  Anyone can decode them without knowing the key, all they 
need to know is which program to use to decode it, or how to arrange the 
letters.  Three very basic forms of encoding are uuencode (.uue) base64 (.b64) 
and rot13 (doesn't have a file extension as far as I know) All of these encoding
methods are really simple to understand and decode.  I'll also go over XOR and 
DES, which are true forms of encryption. 



[Uuencode]

uuencode stands for unix to unix encoding also called uue, it was once only 
for unix systems, but now can be used on almost all operating systems.  What 
uuencode does is convert the file (picture, text, program, etc..) bit-stream 
into 7-bit ascii.  This makes it possible for times when you cannot transfer 
binary files, you can encode them in ascii and transfer them.  uuencode is 
often used in emails and most email clients can handle uuencode.

You can encode a file into uuencode by going to a *nix command prompt, if you 
don't have *nix get a shell account, and use the command 'uuencode file.txt 
file.uue' if file.txt is the file you want encoded and it will become encoded 
into a file created called file.uue.  Here is a trick if you only want the 
output on the screen, instead of being saved in a file, use /dev/stdout as the 
output: 'uuencode file.txt /dev/stdout'.  Also to be noted that when you 
uuencode a file it is increased in size by around 42%.  On a couple systems 
(both older mandrake) I had problems with the output file, it was not created.  
Instead mandrake seems to send the output to /dev/stdout (your screen) every 
time and not to the file you specify as the output.  You could set the stdout 
to any file you want and then run uuencode and it would work.  With every other 
system I've used worked as normal.

To decode uuencode you use the 'uudecode' command with 'uudecode -o file.txt 
file.uue' this will decode file.uue and send the output to file.txt.  Another 
simple way to decode uuencode is to use a program most ever windows user has, 
winzip.  Simply name the uuencoded file: file.uue and open it in winzip and 
follow the instructions on decoding it (press next, next, next... not that 
hard).

So how can you tell if something is encoded in uue?  First check if it has an 
extension, if it is .uue then it is uuencoded.  If the file doesn't have an 
extension or is just text it should be like this:


begin 644 blah.txt

M=&AI<R!T97AT('=A'0@
M=V%S(&AA<FUE9"!I;B!T:&4@8W)E871I;VX@;V8@=&AI<R!F:6QE+@IA;'1H
H;W5G:"!A(&9E=R!C<'4@8WEC;&5S('=E `
end


Now there are a few ways to tell this is uuencoded.  First, all uuencoding 
starts with 'begin' and then the file permissions of the file, in this case 
'664'.  Then the file name, 'blah.txt'.  Another way to tell is that uuencode 
uses the first character of each line to tell how long that line is, in this 
case the first 3 lines use 'M' and the last line, which is shorter, uses a 
different letter 'H'.  The second to last line is always ' and the very last 
line in uuencoded files is 'end'.  So if you don't know what kind of encoding 
is used just look for these signs.



[base64]

Well base64 is the grand daddy of all encoding methods.  It uses less cpu power
to encode/decode than uuencode and uuencode increases the file size much more, 
base64 only increases file size by about 33%.  Base64 is compliant with us 
ascii and ebedic standards, nether of which uuencode is, making base64 much 
more compatible.  Base64 is pretty much the standard when sending email 
attachments now.  It uses what is known as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions) when used with email attachments.  It is also used with some weak 
authentication methods.  Like uue, base64 turns binary into ascii so it is able 
to be transfered when binary transfer cannot be established.   Base64 uses 65 
characters for encoding, 64 actual characters and 1 character which is =, it is 
used for signaling the end of the base64.  Here is a base64 chart:


                            Table 1: The Base64 Alphabet 


      Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding

          16 Q            33 h            50 y


You can encode base64 by using the same command for uuencode with the -m 
option.Although there is a popular program called mpack which can do this 
aswell.  Mpack comes for a variety of operating systems, the windows version 
is located at ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/mpack15d.zip the others are 
in the /pub/mpack directory.  Using mpack should be pretty easy since it comes 
with a help file (readme.dos).  Mpack doesn't just do base64, it does a few 
mime types.To decode base64 you can use uudecode or munpack (comes with mpack), 
uudecode will automaticly sense that it is base64 when decoding so do it just 
like decoding uuencode.  Mpack comes with that readme.dos file which will 
explain everything very easily.

Here is an example of what blah.txt looks like encoded in base64:


begin-base64 644 blah.txt
dGhpcyB0ZXh0IHdhcyBlbmNvZGVkIGluIHV1ZW5jb2RpbmcuCm5vIHRleHQg
d2FzIGhhcm1lZCBpbiB0aGUgY3JlYXRpb24gb2YgdGhpcyBmaWxlLgphbHRo
b3VnaCBhIGZldyBjcHUgY3ljbGVzIHdlcmUgdXNlZCB1cC4KOy0oCg==
====


(note: the above is a bad example on how b64 is generally smaller than uue)
Sometimes you will see content-type headers on base64 files, such as:


Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="a.txt"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="a.txt"
Content-MD5: LByIVUcB0AGQTTnYDyzOjQ==

VGhpcyBpcyBiYXNlNjQsIGFuZCB5b3UganVzdCBkZWNvZGVkIGl0IGNvcnJlY3RseSE=


A few ways to tell this was base64 is that it says it's 
"Content-Transfer-Encoding" is base64.  But also it ends in = which is a big 
hint, sometimes base64 ends in multiple ='s.  Another way to tell is if the 
document contains many strings of "ICAg" which is used for a space.  Often in 
longer base64 encoded files you will find many ICAg's all together like: 
ICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAg this is a sign that the file is base64 encoded. 

$text[201] =~ s/icag/b0g!#@!/ig; #har har har


[Rot-13]

Rot-13 is probably the most basic type of encryption.  It just rotates the 
letters in the alphabit by 13 characters.  Since the alphabit is 26 letters it 
just moves letters to a new letter.  It isn't really an encryption type, it is 
just a way you can keep msg's from less net swavvy people.  Also it is 
used sometimes to keep info some people might not want to know hidden, for 
example the ending of a movie might be in rot-13 so people who want to know can 
read it, and those who don't can watch the movie themselves =) Here is the 
rot-13 alphabit... 


a = n
b = o
c = p
d = q
e = r
f = s
g = t
h = u
i = v
j = w
k = x
l = y
m = z 


Rot-13 is a type of caesar cipher, which means each letter is replaced by 
another letter and the replacement depends only on the plaintext character.  
To encrypt or decrypt rot-13 you can use the alphabit above, or just go to 
www.rot13.com and fill out the form. 


[XOR]
XOR stands for eXclusive OR.  What it does is it checks 2 values against each
other and if they are the same it will return a false (or 0) value, if they are 
different it will return a true (or 1) value.  Since xor works on the binary 
level it only compares 0's and 1's.  To decode xor you can write a simple 
program.  In most languages ^ is the xor operator.  So it would be: 
"whateverstring" ^= 1; you can even use the windows (or any other OS) 
calculator to do it.  Start->Run->calc.exe then click view and select 
scientific.  Enter in a number, select the 'bin' (binary) button and then press 
'xor', go back to 'dec' (decimal) and enter in a second number (also known as 
the mask), press 'bin' again and then press '='.  It should be something like 
this:


170 change to binary you can see it is: 10101010
xor
255 change to binary you can see it is: 11111111
=
1010101 change to decimal: 85


Now, if you followed along above you will know that it checks the binary values 
against each other.  I'll do it by hand so you can see how it works.


10101010
11111111
--------
01010101


if you still don't see it, let me explain:


1 1 - they are the same, so xor returns 0
0 1 - they are different, so xor returns 1
1 1 - they are the same, so xor returns 0
0 1 - they are different, so xor returns 1
1 1 - they are the same, so xor returns 0
0 1 - they are different, so xor returns 1
1 1 - they are the same, so xor returns 0
0 1 - they are different, so xor returns 1


Now here is a perl script for an XOR encryptor/decryptor:



--- script kiddies grep for 'cut here' ---

#!/usr/bin/perl
# Get Otp here: http://www3.marketrends.net/encrypt/download/Babel_Otp_Rot13.tar
#
# encrypt/decrypt xor
#

use Otp;

$xor = new Otp;

  print 'type e for encrypt, anything else for decrypt:';
  chomp($todo = <STDIN>);

  if ($todo eq 'e'){
     print 'type in the string you want encrypted:';
     $orignal = <STDIN>;
     print 'type in the key you want to use:';
     $key = <STDIN>;
     $encrypted = $xor->Otp($orignal,"$key");
  }

  else{
     print 'type in the string you want decrypted:';
     $encrypted = <STDIN>;
     print 'type in the key to decrypt the string:';
     $key = <STDIN>;
     $orignal = $xor->Otp($encrypted,"$key");
  }

print "The original string is: $orignal\n";
print "The encrypted string is: $encrypted\n";

exit;

---script kiddies cannot bother looking at tthe code, so 'stop cutting here'---



If you don't know the mask of xor you can brute force it with a program called 
Vcrack (Unix version here) Although it will have to be a pretty weak password 
for this to work in a reasonable amount of time. (don't expect it to crack keys 
and strings longer than 10 characters). 



[DES]

DES stands for Data Encryption Standard, it is a very commonly used encryption 
method.  So common infact that it is used on nearly very *nix machine to 
encrypt the password.  DES unlike most of the above cannot be easily decrypted
by moving bits or performing a simple command.  There is no reasonable way of 
decrypting DES, instead you have to rely on "brute forcing" the password.  
What brute forcing means is trying different passwords until you get the right 
one, this might be 100 guesses, it might be 100,000,000.  It depends on how 
good the password the user picked is.

Now this is pretty interesting.. when IBM originally created DES they used a 
128bit key, but when NSA (National Security Agency) made it standard they 
lowered it to 56bits.  This made the encryption much weaker.  Some people 
(cough*everyone*cough) think that they made it weaker because with 128bit they 
would not be able to brute force it.  Also, it has been reported that the 
government has tried to stop research and documentation on more advanced 
ciphers.

Since brute forcers usually try all the combinations of letters first it is 
always smart to add in a number or two for your passwords.  Using both upper 
and lower case letters can also help, as well as adding a special character 
such as: &) 

Now I won't explain how DES works in detail but the basics are that it takes a 
message and breaks it into 64 bits groups and takes a key that is 56 bits 
(actually 64 bits, but every 8th bit is ignored).  DES is a block cipher, what 
that means is it takes plaintext and groups it into a fixed length (64-bits) 
and then does it's encryption algorithm.  A seed is kind of the key to the 
whole thing, when you encrypt des you get the seed as the first two characters 
in the encrypted data.  Run the following script and check the first two 
characters of your encrypted password with your chosen seed. 

To encrypt DES you can use this perl script:


--- script kiddies grep for 'cut here' ---

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# script to encrypt des.
#to decrypt you will need to brute force it.
#

print 'enter in the username:';
chomp($username = <STDIN>);

$password = 1234567890;
while((length($password)) > 8){
print 'enter in the password (8 or less characters):'; 

#remember it is a block cipher of 64 bits (8 bytes)

chomp($password = <STDIN>);
}

$seed = 'not_two';
while ((length($seed)) != 2){
print 'enter in the seed (2 characters):'; 

#seeds must be 2 characters

chomp($seed = <STDIN>);
}

$encrypted = crypt($password, $seed);

print "your username:password is:\n\n";
print "$username:$encrypted";

exit;

---script kiddies cannot bother looking at tthe code, so 'stop cutting here'---

To decrypt you need to use a program that can brute force it.  The hackers 
favorite is JTR, John The Ripper, available for both windows and *nix systems.
I will go over how to use JTR to it's fullest.



[Using JTR]

Step one in using JTR is getting and installing jtr on your computer.  Head 
over to http://www.openwall.com/john/ and get the version of JTR you would like.

After you finish installing JTR get out the username and password you would 
like to crack.  If you do not know what the username and password looks like or 
do not have a username and password to crack just use b0iler for the username 
and YyBWL06.zBiZE for the encrypted password.

Now to create the file that JTR will crack, put the username and password in 
this format


b0iler:YyBWL06.zBiZE


so it's username:password if you are trying to crack a *nix password file 
(/etc/shadow) you can leave it in it's current format.  You can also put 
multiple username and passwords in like


b0iler:YyBWL06.zBiZE:0:0:owns:/home/b0iler:/bin/bash
root:Yym34X1Wq86GI:0:0:pansy:/dev/null:/bin/sh
cyrus:YySNBbemZw8pI:9999:10:obese:/slim/fast:/bin/hamburger 


All you really need is the username:password, but since the *nix password file 
contains more info on users you can just leave them in (it will make no 
difference to JTR).  Here is a tip, if you do not care which user's password 
you crack just run them all.  If you want root then take out the rest, save 
them in a different file just incase.  Save the file in the same directory as 
JTR, you can name it anything (ex. pass1.txt). 

Now go to a command prompt, *nix users will know how.. 
windows users start->programs->MS-DOS prompt->type in: cd c:\unzipped\john-16w 
(or whatever dir it is in) then cd john-16 (or whatever dir) and finally cd run.
This is the directory where you should have saved your password file you wish  

to crack.  Now run jtr by issuing


john -single pass1.txt


or use whatever you named your password file.  What this does is do a very 
basic brute force attack on the password.  The -single attack is a very quick 
and basic attack which tries to break weak passwords.  If this does not work, 
or if you know that the users pick strong passwords I would move onto using 
JTR's ability to use wordlist (otherwise known as dictionary) attacks.  What 
this does is allows you to use a file called a wordlist in JTR's attack.  JTR 
will try every string of characters in the wordlist file and see if any are 
the passwords.  To use a wordlist issue this command

john -w:wordlist.txt pass1.txt

you can get a wordlist at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/ I would recommend a 
wordlist around 3mb, it will crack most standard passwords people pick.

Now you can add rules to JTR to make it work extremely fast, but for this you 
need to know a little about the password.  Like if it uses numbers or only 
letters, if it is a certain number of characters long, etc.. Most of the time 
you have no clue, so telling newbies about rules is mostly pointless and will 
just be confusing.  Just stick with the standard ways unless you know some info 
on the passwords.  If you know that the password is 7 characters then by all 
means please tell JTR that! It will allow JTR to only try combinations of 7 
characters so it will crack the pass ALOT faster.  But as I said, it is rare 
that you know anything about the passwords like this :/

The last method you should try is incremental, this attack tries every possible 
combination of characters until it gets it.  This means it could take a long 
long time for JTR to crack it.. but it will crack it. To do an incremental 
attack issue this command

john -i:all pass1.txt 

This will go through every possible character, number, and special character 
until it gets it.  If you don't think the users use special characters use


john -i:lanman pass1.txt


This will try characters, numbers .. but just a few special characters.  Now 
there are other more advanced ways to use JTR, some are very cool and can save 
you a lot of time, such as the ability to use multiple computers on the same 
password.  This splits up the time it takes by a lot.  Lets say you use your 
schools computer lab for a night.  If it has 20 computers you are almost 
garenteed that one of them will crack it =)

Also editing the configuration file: john.ini will allow you more 
customization.  Since this is more advanced and not done by normal JTR users 
I will let the ones who wish to learn about it visit Monkee's Advanced JTR 
Tutorial.

Now let JTR run for A LONG TIME, don't email me asking why it is taking over 
12 hours to crack a password.  JTR has to brute force it.. this takes lots of 
time.  Don't be surprised to spend a long time waiting for it to crack.  When 
I say long, I mean L O N G.  If you think 12 hours is long I will just laugh 
at you.

While JTR is running you can check it's status by pressing enter.  This will 
display where it is at, how fast it is going, and other info you might find 
amusing.  Once it's done check the default cracked password file: john.pot .. 
with any luck you'll get the password and be home free.  JTR can also be used 
to brute force other forms of encryption.. although I've had problems in the past 
trying to use JTR to crack other cryptos. 



[Conclusion]

Well, that's all a newbie would need to know about crypto to get into it.  
Encoding, decoding, detecting the type of crypto used.. that's all you need to 
know to break the basic types of crypto widely used.  If you wish to get more 
into crypto you will need to understand how the algorithms of the encryption 
work, for this you will need to be above average in math and be very deticated 
to it.  If you are interested in learning about more advanced crypto I have 
heard for many, many people that the book "Applied Cryptography" is the best 
book ever written for learning cryptography.  A few other encryption methods 
you might want to look into include PGP, ssl, twofish, blowfish, tripleDES, 
and steganography. Most of the stuff I covered I learned from reading, some 
from experimenting, and a little bit is just my opinion or take on things. I 
coded all the scripts and don't care if you distribute them under your name 
or whatever since they took me a total of like 12 minutes to do. I didn't even 
use any leetspeak in this article :D

Supplies:
Aquarium vacuum - $4.99
Tin foil - cheap
2 dope fiends - free

Notes:
if you don’t know what a aquarium vacuum is it is a long tube with a large cylinder 
at the end used to clean out fish tanks using the whole syphon technique.  You can 
find these in any pet supply place.

Procedure:
First, take some tin foil and make a bowl with it large enough to cover the open end 
of the cylinder.  Poke a number of holes in the foil and place it in the open end of 
the cylinder.  Insert weed.  Have one fiend hold the cylinder and sit on the floor 
[or anywhere lower than the toker].  You should know what to do from here.

Warning:
Be careful, a lot of smoke WILL enter your lungs.  The first time I hit one of these 
I puked.

Shouts:

Everybody knows that all truly l33t IRC'ers use BitchX, and you can
too! But surprisingly few BitchX users actually know what the hell
they're doing, the elite version reply is all they seek. Today we 
learn to mold BitchX (henceforth abbreviated bx) into a functional 
irc client, and ultimately you won't even miss mIRC anymore.

These bx'isms hold true for BitchX-1.0c18 run on Debian GNU Linux with
a 2.4.4 kernel. Most will hold for past and future versions of bx run on
various other operating systems as well, but no guarantees.



###########################################################
Gibbor me that l33t * me is away: (hax0ring) [BX-MsgLog On]
###########################################################



First up, we've gotta have that phat /away system. By default,
send_away_msg is off, so your /away's and /back's will show up on your
screen but not on anyone else's. To start sending your away info
publicly:

   /set send_away_msg on
   /save

You now have a fully functional away system with logging and away
times and a msg that gets sent to every damn channel you're on.
Note that when changing bx settings you almost always have to /save,
otherwise you'll lose whatever you've done as soon as you shutdown
your client.

Away info sometimes annoys channel operators, so use it wisely. If
you'd prefer not to broadcast your whereabouts:

   /set send_away_msg off

Then again, no channel op in his or her right mind would dare mess
with an authentic BitchX user.

You'll probably soon notice bx auto-away kicking in, by default after 10 minutes. 
This can be really annoying, both to you and to others. Shut it off with:

   /toggle auto_aw



###############################################
I can't stand so many channels! I need windows!
###############################################



Not a problem my good man. (or woman, which would be ubercool.) bx gives us the power 
to create windows within a text only client. 

   /window new double on hide

You just created yourself a second window. Changing windows within bx
can usually be done with ALT + [1-9]. Your default window is obviously
ALT + 1. The window we just created is ALT + 2. If you run the command
again, making a third window, you can get to it with ALT + 3. Some
terminals screw this up, and problems arise in other areas when
the ALT key is bound to do something else. (ie. in WindowMaker) In cases where you 
find ALT + number not working, you can usually substitute ESC + number.

To get rid of a window: 

   /window kill

You can do alot more with the /window command, and only an idiot
wouldn't take 5 seconds to learn how to properly alias commands. (/window new double 
on hide is a bitch to type every time you log on)

The following are a few quick /window aliases stolen from cypress, a
bx script:

# something we need for the rest of these aliases
alias channame if (left(1 $0)==[#]) {return $0} {return #$0}

# create a new window
alias wc {window new hide_others double on split on}

# create a new window and join a channel in it
alias wj if ([$0])
	{wc;^window bind $channame($0);join $0-}
	{echo Usage:  /wj <channel>}

# kill this window
alias wk  {window kill}

# kill this window and part the current channel
alias wlk {part $C;wk}

# take me to the next window
alias wn {window next}

# take me to the previous window
alias wp {window previous}

These aliases aren't really intended to be entered while in bx. It's
much more efficient to include them in a small script, which you'll
learn how to do in just a second.

These aliases provide some basic window control, but there's alot more
you can do. Read the documentation, or get yourself a script with a
decent window module. (I'll speak briefly on scripts near the end of 

this article)

bx has a few other window features worth mentioning. Firstly you can
bind multiple channels to one window. By that I mean /join all your
hax0r channels in your main window, create another, /join all your
warez channels, create another, /join all the channels you only idle
in for a leet /whois reply and really don't give a damn about who's
talking in them, etc. This let's you keep things a little more
organized, and you should of course know that Ctrl+x is used to switch
the channel you're speaking to in any given window.

Secondly, you can log on to multiple irc servers/networks within one
bx session. Create yourself a new window and do:

   /server +irc.whatever.org

Instantly you're on another server where you can join channels and go
about your business the same as on your original server in your other
windows. This can get screwy when a server cuts you off, and sometimes
it just breaks. Test it out and see how it performs for you.



#######################################################
I can't type this shit in every fucking time asshole!!!
#######################################################



This somewhat leads us into our next topic, scripts. A script is
nothing more than a collection of regular bitchx commands saved into a
plain ASCII text file. These commands get executed when you load the
filename:

   /load filename

/save's won't keep your aliases, so you need to put these and various
other things into a script to save yourself carpal tunnel down the
road.

Whenever you start bx it looks for a default script in your home
directory named .bitchxrc. This is a good place to put your aliases, or
of you store them in another file, load it from within this one. ie:

   1. Open ~/.bitchxrc in your favorite text editor.

   2. Add the line:

	  load filenameyouputyouraliasesin

   3. Restart bx.

It's just that simple. And you can put any other commands here you
with, each on a separate line. A leading / isn't required, although it
probably won't hurt anything.



###############
Kicking l4m3rz.
###############



Builtin commands for this are pretty straightforward.

To kick someone with an optional reason:

	/k <user> [reason]

If you don't specify a reason, you'll end up with a default random one
from a file somewhere on your system. I however strongly recommend you
make a text file containing your own kick messages in:

   ~/.BitchX/BitchX.reasons

The default file on my system is in:

   /usr/local/lib/bx/BitchX.reasons

You'll probably find a few other files in this directory, which you
can easily replace by placing a file of the same name in your
~/.BitchX directory. BitchX.quit is another file worth making for
yourself.

Anyhow, back to the harassing of lamers, /kb works just like /k, only
with a ban. That's enough for now.



##############################
Private Cybersex0ring Sessions
##############################



Ok pervert, this'll start sounding scary and then get better. To send a
private message in bx:

   /msg <nickname> Wake up, Neo...

Looks annoying I know. However as soon as you do this, or as soon as
someone sends a message to you, their nick is available in the TAB list.
Clear the input prompt (sekret UNIX hax0r hint: CTRL + u) and start
pressing TAB. bx will cycle through the last nicks you talked to, doing
all the nasty typing for you.

This can still get a little confusing, so in a final use for the /window
command, create yourself a new window and type:

   /query nickname

Now you need not press TAB or type anything before your message. This
works similar to your query windows in mIRC. 

DCC chat's a similar, /dcc chat nickname to initiate, and then:

   /msg =nickname hey bitch

to send a message through. Again, once this gets underway bx will take
care of that for you, or you can /query =nickname in a separate window
to not have to type anything.



#################################
I've Got Friends, Let Me Auto-Op!
#################################



Auto-opping is often dangerous, but in this age of static ip cable
connections and various shell accounts it can be very useful.

To add someone to your userlist:

   /adduser <nick|host> <channel|*> <userlevels> [password]

Note that the password isn't a necessary attribute. Most people don't
bother with them anyhow since we're only doing this for auto-ops. To
further simplify this:

   /adduser *!herk@nerd.ca * friend,dcc,i_ops

To anyone irc'ing from herk@nerd.ca a bunch of friendly stuff,
auto-accept dcc's, and auto-ops. (i_ops) There are other flags you can
give, and several options for shitlisting people you hate. I don't use
these much as eggdrop's are a more common solution. But should you be
so inclined:

   /bhelp adduser
   /bhelp userlevels
   /bhelp addshit
   /bhelp unuser



##################################
* I'm to lame to read BitchX.doc *
##################################



Not anymore. You can change this lame ircname in for a much cooler one
with:

   /ircname I READ BITCHX.doc

This only takes effect on your next server connect. Save yourself some
trouble and once again, put it into your .bitchxrc. Or if you'd like
to be a bash hax0r, you can edit your .bashrc or .bash_profile, adding
the line:

	export IRCNAME="my ph4t n3w ircn4me."

Other shells will of course have similar options.



########################################
Someone keeps stealing my nickname... =/
########################################



A handy bx feature is the orignick command:

   /orignick herk

Will check for my nickname every 5 seconds (I think) and immediately
grab it once it become available. I personally set a hook to start
orignick every time I connect to a server with the following line in
my ~/.bitchxrc:

   on connect * orignick herk



#########
Detaching
#########



This is an insanely useful feature for anyone using bx
remotely. Detach allows you to cut away from your bx session and leave
it running in the background, your client remains on irc, behaving
exactly as it normally would. You can log off the account you're using
and go about your business. When you decide to return, you can log
back into the account and reattach to your session, just as you left
it.

To detach from within bx:
  
   /detach

To reattach from the command prompt: (bash, tcsh, etc.)

   scr-bx

All this is made possible by the massive portion of the GNU screen
source code included within bx. It can however be a little buggy at
times, so if you find it breaking alot take a few minutes to get to
learn GNU screen, a more reliable and potent program which does
exactly this and much more.



######################
That's nice, now what?
######################



Well bx has lots of things you can play with. For instance:

   /toggle
   /set
   /fset

The list goes on. Explore, experiment, remember to /save, and put
everything else in ~/.bitchxrc. 

bx is supposedly coded to run fine without a script. However I and
many others prefer to run a script regardless, and that's ok. bx
scripts are readily available at:

   http://scripts.bitchx.com
   http://irc.themes.org

Personally I highly recommend cypress, for it's ability to specify
channels NOT to send your away info too, a nice /config command, and
great formats/themes.

In conclusion, I don't even use BitchX anymore. It's bloated and
buggy, and slow when you're hardware deprived. If BitchX bores you,
look into Epic (http://www.epicsol.org) with a good script. (like
lice, http://lice.codehack.com)

That's all folks!

Conclusion



-Intro-

Welcome to the 2nd issue of Hacking Techniques.  If you read the first one I am
glad to see you liked it enough to want to read this one.  This issue will
focus on how hackers bounce their attacks so that they do not get caught and so
they use the power of a *nix shell.  As with the first one this tutorial can
both be used by hackers and admins.  Hackers will learn how to mount an attack
and use proxies to help stay anonymous.  Admins will learn how to prevent
themselves from being used in an attack as a proxy and prevent stress.  If you
don't know what a proxy is or how to use a wingate you need to read this
tutorial.  People who run wingates, proxies, or give shells out also should go
over this tutorial as to scare them into securing it.  I'll go over a few other
random things such as using routers as wingates, and using wingates to bounce
your irc sessions.



-Bouncing Attacks-

There are a few ways to bounce your attack.  Sometimes it depends on how you
are gonna to do the attack, sometimes it depends on what you got on hand.  I
will introduce you to 3 ways to bounce you attack.  I will not go into using
routers as proxies since wingates are fairly easy to get.  And I will not go
over bouncing your attack off an ftp because all (or very close to all) ftp
programs are patched to this by now. Not only should hackers read this next
part, but so should admins who want to keep themselves from being used in an
attack.  Securing their proxies and wingates can help prevent trouble with
hackers abusing it. This can save some time and hassle because you will not
need to bother with an admin who trying to track down a hacker who used your
network to bounce off of.


    * Bouncing through proxies

    * Bouncing through wingates

    * Bouncing with shells


Bouncing through proxies
Proxies are the most basic way to stay anonymous while on the web.  They are
used with your web browser to rely data that you are downloading.  So when you
send data to get a webpage it is first sent to the proxy and then to the
webpage.  like this:


    [your computer] -> [proxy] -> [website]


Some kinds of proxies, known as cache'ing proxies, will hold local copies of
websites people visit.  This makes browsing much faster since ideally the
connection between you and the proxy is very fast.  So instead of having to
query the website the proxy will just send out the saved (cache'd) copy and
save time and resources.  Although this can be a problem as I have had first
hand experience with this.  When running lame industries we put a script up
that allowed people to check out other users email addresses, image, website,
names, country, etc.. all info was optional.  But the script would check if
you were an admin of lame industries and if you were it would display users
passwords, cookies, allow you to change the status of users.  Now somehow a
nice fellow named MaAaX found a cache'ing proxy that had this page cached.
Not only was it cache'd.. but it was the admin version cache'd.  Some admin of
the site must have used that proxy to visit that script, so the proxy saved
what he saw.  And MaAaX reported this, but he was tricked into reporting it to
someone who was not an admin of the site.  That person then used the proxy to
get an admin's password from the cache'd page.  Moral of the story? Don't leave
sensitive info out for everyone to see, I would suggest not using a proxy when
admining a site through and also to put all scripts which can be used by
an admin in a .htaccess protected directory.


Proxies are very easy to find and very easy to use.  To find them try using a
program called Proxy Hunter [ http://go8.163.com/windzh/indexe.htm ] what this
program will do is it will scan large ranges of ips for open proxies.  Then it
will report them to you so you can try them and see if they require a username
and password or if you can use them without.  Another way is to look on the
web for lists of proxies, a few good sites for this are:


    * cyberarmy's proxy list - ttp://www.cyberarmy.com/lists/proxy/index.shtml

    * roswell's proxy list - http://tools.rosinstrument.com/proxy/


Don't expect proxies to stay up forever, if one goes down try another.  It is
fairly simple to set up basic security for your proxy server, get a good access
list restricting who can use it.  Also, as with all programs, check for known
security vulnerabilities in the proxy server itself, and vulnerabilities in
your firewall, which you set the access list for the proxy server.


To use proxies you need to set up your browser to bounce off of them.  In
internet explorer this is done by going to Tools->Internet Options...->
Connections->(highlighting your connection)->Settings...->check "Use a proxy
server for this connection"->file in the ip or hostname and the port number
then press ok, and ok.


To set up Netscape to use a proxy select edit->preferences->advanced->proxies
->"Manual proxy configuration" then fill in the hostname or ip and the port
number.


In lynx (or Mosaic) you would do this at the command line:

http_proxy="http://proxy.com:80/"; export http_proxy; exec lynx

or exec Mosaic.


Now to validate that the proxy is working go to a site which displays server
environment variables from a perl/php script. One such site is
http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl


One proxy is good for everyday surfing, but what if you are up to alittle more
than just that?  (I see that smile on your face)  You need to use a technique
called chaining proxies.  What happends is you rely the data transfer from one
proxy, to another, to another, to another ... until it reaches the destination.
It is fairly simple to do this, but some proxies don't support it.  Other
problems include one proxy is slow it makes the connection timeout, too many
proxies that the connection times out, and it takes awhile to find 4 or 5 good
proxies.  This should work in almost every browser, put the proxies in the
address bar in this format:
http://proxy1.com:80/http://proxy2.com:80/http://proxy3.com:8000/http://site.com
this should connect you to site.com using those 3 proxies and the one you put in
your configuration (options, preferences.. what we just did above).  I've also
heard that using http://proxy.com;80-_-http://site.com works, but from my
experience it tends to be less supported by proxy servers.  Of course if you are
having problems getting this to work it may be that the proxy doesn't allow
chaining.


Now when I say proxies can be used to bounce a connection to a webpage - I mean
webpage.  You cannot use a normal http proxy on anything besides port 80 (the
http port.. for webpages).  If you want to bounce connections on other ports try
a wingate.


So what if you are using an exploit to mount an attack and you are too lazy to
use wingates to connect to your shell?  You can use something like
rain.forrest.puppy's libwhisker, which makes it extremely easy to add proxy
support to perl scripts.  You can get libwhisker at:
http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/bins/libwhisker/pr4/libwhisker.pm  I haven't really
looked for a C/C++ version of something like this, since it's just as simple to
connect to a shell.


One last thing I will go over for proxies is chaining them together, hackers use
this so they have more cover when hacking into a script avalible over port 80.
To do this you can put proxy1-_-proxy2-_-proxy3-_- before the url, or you can
use a program called MultiProxy [ www.multiproxy.org ] to chain anonymous
proxies together. What is an anonymous proxy? It is a proxy that will not
forward information about you. The main peice of information hackers want to
keep secret is their IP address, when a proxy forwards this to a computer it is
known as the X-Forward-For.  It is a header in the packet which tells the target
what computer the proxy is going to send the info to (the hackers IP). Anonymous
proxies will leave the REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR or HTTP_VIA headers
blank so that the target has no idea where the attack is comming from.  You can
check if a proxy is anonymous at http://www.cyberarmy.com/cgi/whoami.pl



-Bouncing through wingates-

Wingates are a type of proxy that allow you to make a telnet connection.  They
are intended to be used to allow computers to access the internet through
another one, but since many types of wingates allow anyone to connect without
a password this can be exploited by hackers and other people to be used to
bounce their connection off of.  Here is how this works:


    [hacker's computer] -> [wingate] -> [destination]


This snazzy ascii shows how your data will go through a wingate and then to
it's destination.  So the destination sees it as if the data is coming from
the wingate.  If you can't see how hackers can use this to their advantage
let me explain...


Hackers want to keep their ip hidden, they don't want their target to know where
they are coming from.  This is both so they cannot block the attack as easy and
so they do not get in trouble if they do get caught.  Using a wingate means
that the target doesn't see the hackers ip, it sees the wingate's ip instead.
Most hackers use over 3 wingates when hacking, just to be safe.  Because if an
admin caught the hack attempt and contacted the admin of the wingate logs can be
used to find the hackers ip.  So if they bounce off of like 5 wingates that
means alot more hassle for the attacked admin to go through to find the hacker
and the more chance that logs will not be kept or will be deleted by one of the
wingate admins.


Bouncing hacking attacks off of a wingate is not the only reason a hacker would
use one.  They are also quite handy when going on some irc servers.  The same
basic concept applies, the data is bounced off the wingate and then sent to the
destination (irc server).  So the irc server sees the connection as coming
from the wingate.  This can allow hackers to get around channel bans, get around
glines, hide themselves from others, create clones, etc..  Check your options in
irc client to figure out how to use them. (with mirc it's known as a SOCKS 4
firewall in the options.)


Since they are useful on an irc, many people on irc tend to be using wingates.
This is why I ported a simple port scanner to irssi (also works with BitchX
and maybe Xchat).  This port scanner is edited to only look for port 23 and
1080 the most commonly used ports for wingates, 23 is telnet, 1080 is SOCKS.
What it does is collects people's ips when they enter a channel and then when
you issue the command /scan it will check the list of ips for avalible wingates.
There is also easy to use scripts for mirc that do this, a search on google
for mirc wingate scanner produced many links.  You can also use tools that scan
wide blocks of ips for wingates using tools like wingate scanners
[ http://packetstormsecurity.org/wingate-scanner/ ].  Here is a tip: find a
cable or dsl isp and scan their subnet for wingates.  Many people on fast
connections use wingates for their network to split their bandwidth up and
since cable they have a static ip they will not change as often.  So do a
'/whois user' on someone who is on cable to get their ip, then check
all-nettols.com (use "smartwhois") to get their isp's ip range and I scan that
for wingates.


Wingates tend to go up and down hourly, this is because sometimes people only
need them for awhile and when someone does put one up they get alot of traffic
from hackers using them to bounce off of, so instead of wasting their bandwidth
they secure the wingate or take it down.  Because of this you need to scan for
wingates all the time.  Another reason why irc works good for looking for
wingates, you let other people find them for you. =)


Not many hackers just use 1 wingate when hacking. This is how using 4 wingates
would work (wg = wingate:


    [hacker] -> [wg] -> [wg] -> [wg] -> [wg] -> [destination]


Using multiple wingates is required for a hacker, they will not just use one,
since it would be easy to track them.  But using too many can make things very
slow.  Anything over 4 and under 10 would be normal.


So after you scan (this may take awhile, be patient) and get a few wingates how
do you connect to them and use them? This is very simple, but tends to be asked
all the time on message boards and chatrooms all over the place.  When you
telnet to a wingate you need to have it's ip or hostname and the port the
wingate is running on.  Normally the port is 23 or 1080.  Now we can only use
wingates which don't require a username and password to use.  So after we get
a list of them we will need to test and see which work without a login.  Simply
get out telnet and connect to that ip and port, wait for the connection and see
if it says something like this:


    Wingate>


If it had a login of some sort then you cannot use it.  This is one way admins
of wingates can protect themselves, make sure to password protect the wingate
so random hackers cannot use it.  Not only can hackers use your wingate, but
spammers often use them as well.  Having spammers send thousands of emails
through your wingate is a surefire way to get your isp to cancel your account.
Besides adding passwords you can also secure your wingate by only allowing
computers on your LAN to access it, this is how for GateKeeper
[ http://www.infopulse.net/store/index.html ]


login as Administrator on GateKeeper
Policies -> Default Policies -> Users can access services -> select everyone
Location -> Specify locations from where this recipient has rights -> add
127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.* (or whatever ip range your network uses).


To secure Deerfield's wingate [ http://wingate.deerfield.com ] simply upgrade
to 3.x home version. The home version of 3.x doesn't let anyone connect at
default. It's now configured securely by default :D


There are also other terminal's that will appear, it is not allways "Wingate>".
It could be anything, Wingate> is just default on some.


We got connected, now to use the wingate.  Wingates by default will telnet to
any ip port you enter, so try to telnet to a server you
know is up:


    Wingate> 204.42.253.18:23


Now if you encounter an error this means something’s either wrong with the ip:port
you entered, the ip:port is down, or the wingate is not working.  Also try to
do 'telnet ip:port' since that wingate might not telnet at default.  So we got
our list of wingates down to a list of working, none passworded wingate.  Now
to link them.  Lets say we have the wingates (note, these are fake):


    203.43.25.104 port 23
    214.133.200.20 port 1080
    180.23.56.93 port 23
    194.51.107.68 port 23


To link these we would telnet into the first one:


    telnet 203.43.25.104 23
    Sparky's server 1.03>


Then enter in the ip:port of the next one on the list.


    Sparky's server 1.03> 214.133.200.20 1080
    CDD Proxy Server>


and link the rest..


    CDD Proxy Server> 180.23.56.93 23
    welcome to 180.23.56.93: 194.51.107.68 23


Now A hacker can telnet into a shell account from the last wingate and launch
the attack, or if they know how to do some socket programming they can set up
exploits to go through wingates themselves.  For the next section , shells,
I'll go over how a hacker can use a shell to make his attack.


I have heard from a few people that routers can be used as a wingate, I myself
have never done this since there is always plenty of wingates to use if you
just scan for them.  But.. using a router as a wingate is very interesting for
a number of reasons.  First, a router gets so much traffic that the admin
would probably not know if it was being used to bounce an attack.  Routers
don't log by default, and since they get a lot of traffic not many admins log
everything (or they're logs do not last too long) this means there is less of
a chance of the hacker getting tracked down.  Routers are pretty much always up
and have a fast connection, so if you got a few routers going as wingates you
wouldn't have to scan for new ones as much =)


Now don't go out looking for routers just yet, before you can use a router as
a wingate you need to have access to use telnet on it.  Unlike wingates which
can sometimes allow anyone to run telnet, routers don't.  You will need to
hack into the router to be able to use telnet on it to wingate from it.  Of
course the number of routers with default passwords (admin:admin) or simple
exploits not patched is pretty high from my experience.  Also to note: it might
not be a good idea to telnet directly into a router as your first wingate.. if
the admin does find out of your break in (and they log) you will have left your
real ip.  Hackers will probably use a regular wingate or two before connecting
to a compromised router.  Needless to say, if you admin a router make sure to
keep it locked up tight, not only can hackers screw up your network, sniff
passwords, redirect data, and generally cause a muck, but they can also use
your router as a launching pad for their next attack.


Another use for wingates is to use them to bounce a connection off of irc.
Most commonly SOCKS (stands for SOCK-et-S), are used for irc, they are very
simular to wingates but used mainly at a firewall to allow transparent
connections through it.  SOCKS usually run on port 1080.  To bounce your
connection to an IRC server with a wingate or SOCKS type the following in your
irc client:


/server win.gate.com 23
/quote irc.box.sk 6667
/quote user grendelsucks 123.123.123.123 b0iler :ban evader
/quote nick b0iler2


Then use irc like normal, you will have the ip or hostname of the wingate.
I believe if you use mirc you can go to File -> Options -> Connect -> Firewall
and then enter in the wingate's IP and port and checking "Use SOCKS Firewall"
(correct me if I am wrong).   If you use Xchat try Settings -> Setup -> IRC
-> Proxy Server -> Fill in IP and port and select the type as wingate.  You
can also use a bnc (stands for BouNCe) to rely your connection to an IRC server.


Same as with proxies, if you don't want people connecting to your wingate set
up a strict access list on a firewall.  Also username and passwords are a good
idea when it comes to wingates.



-Shell Accounts-

A shell account is having access to a remote computer.  Users can connect to
them and issue commands just like if they were at that computer's keyboard.
This also means that hackers can issue commands, and they often use shell
accounts as another way to bounce their attack.


Usually a shell account is used along with wingates and is used by the hacker
to launch the attack.  Hackers will not use free shells such as nether.net or
hobbiton.org because they do not have the ability to run programs they need and
they cannot delete the log files with a regular user account.  If they were to
use one of these shells the admin could easily check the logs and see what
they were upto.  So hackers will use what are known as root shells, these are
systems the hacker has already comprised and has root on them.  This allows them
to delete all necessary logs of their attack and lets them have full access to
*nix tools.  The key tools hackers need are raw packet support, nmap and other
auditing programs, a c compiler, a perl interpreter, and exploits.  These come
standard on most *nix boxes, so it makes *nix very valuable to hackers.
Although most will have *nix installed on their computer they might still use
shells because they have faster connections, and will allow another layer of
protection along with the wingates.


This is an example of how a hacker would use 3 wingates with 2 shells
(wg = wingate):


  [hacker] -> [wg] -> [wg] -> [wg] -> [shell] -> [shell] -> [target]


To login to the shells a hacker can use telnet or they can use ssh
[ http://www.openssh.org ], whichever they want.  ssh will allow a more secure
connection.  A simple: telnet owned.com:5742 would allow them to get in (if
they set up telnetd on port 5742).  To connect with ssh is: ssh owned.com -p
5742. If your system would get comprised it too could be used as a shell for
the hackers next attack.


There are free shell accounts for beginner hackers to use, again, I stress
that these are closely monitored and you only get a user account, so things
are logged and power is limited. Don't use them to hack! What a hacker wants
is a 'rootshell' which is root access.  This allows the hacker total control
over everything on that computer.  Please don't ever, ever, ever ask anyone
for a root shell, and don't ask "which free shell is the best" - because all
free shells pretty much stink.  Raw sockets is a big thing, access to edit
logs is another.  If you can edit the logs on a rootshell this means that it
is all the more harder for anyone to track you. If you use a free shell or a
user account on a box you cannot edit the logs and will be vulnerable to be
traced. Always using a lot of wingates will help in keeping you out of trouble.


Most shells you will want are on *nix boxes, so you need to learn unix commands.
Also knowing what files do what will help you understand how to hide yourself
and how to modify the system the way you want. Setting up linux and securing
your box will help you better understand how to break in, as well as breaking
into linux will help you better understand how to secure it =) To help you
learn *nix here is a few really good tutorials:


    * http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk - A very easy and detailed step by step
      guide to getting started with Unix, with examples, solution to
      problems, and some cool facts.

    * http://www.mines.utah.edu/~wmgg/ - A short and sweet Unix
      tutorial to help with the basic commands.

    * http://www.belgarath.demon.co.uk/guide/ - A very nice guide
      that takes things slow and uses helpful pictures to explain
      things.

    * http://www.linuxnewbie.org - A very helpful stop for anyone new
      to linux, it has many helpful files.

    * And of course the best one of all:  man <command>


How can you stop hackers from using your system? Well this is a very in-depth
question, because you will need to completely secure your box to stop them
from gaining access to it.  Read up on Unix security, firewalls, and IDS.
Of course take action before the hacker gets in, secure your box...  use
tripwire and snort 'just incase'.  One way to catch them is to install a
remote logging box. This will allow you to have logs of everything they do, 

to do this set up any old box with inetd and syslogd and then change syslog's
configuration file to have logs sent to that box.


# /etc/syslog.conf file
*.*                             @213.165.52.61


For more info on setting up a secure remote logger try loki's guide on How to
set up a secure remote logger -
[ http://www.linuxsecurity.com/feature_stories/remote_logserver-1.html ]

One thing I would like to stress about using shells from a friends box is that
they may be logging everything you do and gathering your username:passwords to
your email, hacked accounts, sites, ftp, nickserv, and anything else you
transfer.  Same holds true for BNCs and wingates.  It's a trick passed around
by many hackers to put a wingate on their box and put it on a hacker website's
list and wait for people to log into their hacked accounts with it.  I also
read somewhere that governments set up wingates to catch hackers, I don't know
how true this is.. but it sure is a good way to discourage hackers.



-Conclusion-

In this paper of Hacking Techniques I went over how and why hackers use proxies,
wingates, and shells when attacking and how admins can stop them from using
their networks to bounce attacks from.  I think the next issue will be much
longer, it will cover many things hackers do once they comprize a system.  I
hope everyone learned atleast something from this issue, and I hope I didn't
forget anything =)  I am sorry if you felt it was hard to read this tutorial, I
had a hard time writing it, it just felt like my words didn't go together
right.  It may be awhile till I get around to finishing issue #3, thanks for
your patients.

DARWIN AWARD CANDIDATES 

1. In September in Detroit, a 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned 
in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch-wide 
sewer grate to retrieve his car keys. 

2. In October, a 49-year-old San Francisco stockbroker, who 
"totally zoned when he ran," according to his wife, accidentally jogged 
off a 200-foot-high cliff on his daily run. 

3. Buxton, NC: A man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he 
had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it. Beachgoers said 
Daniel Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun, or protection from the wind, and 
had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom Thursday afternoon when 
it collapsed, burying him beneath 5 feet of sand. People on the beach, 
on the outer banks, used their hands and shovels, trying to claw their 
way to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, VA, but could not reach him. It 
took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him 
while about 200 people looked on. Jones was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. 

4. In February, Santiago Alvarado, 24, was killed in Lompoc, CA, as 
he fell face-first through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was 
burglarizing. Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in 
his mouth (to keep his hands free) rammed into the base of his skull as 
he hit the floor. 

5. According to police in Dahlonega, GA, ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, 
20, was stabbed to death in January by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, 
who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flak vest 
Berrena was wearing. 

6. Sylvester Briddell, JR , 26, was killed in February in 
Selbyville, Del, as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put 
a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger. 

7. In February, according to police in Windsor, Ontario, Daniel 
Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus 
earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their 
snowmobiles. 


DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS 

1. In Guthrie, Okla , in October, Jason Heck tried to kill a 
millipede with a shot from his 22-caliber rifle, but the bullet 
ricocheted off a rock near the hole and hit pal Antonio Martinez in the 
head, fracturing his skull. 

2. In Elyria, Ohio, in October, Martyn Eskins, attempting to clean 
out cobwebs in his basement, declined to use a broom in favor of a 
propane torch and caused a fire that burned the first and second floors 
of his house. 

3. Paul Stiller, 47, was hospitalized in Andover Township, NJ, in 
September, and his wife Bonnie was also injured, by a quarter-stick of 
dynamite that blew up in their car. While driving around at 2AM, the 
bored couple lit the dynamite and tried to toss it out the window to see 
what would happen, but they apparently failed to notice that the window 
was closed. 

4. Taking "Amateur Night" Too Far: In Betulia, Colombia, an annual 
festival in November includes five days of amateur bullfighting. This 
year, no bull was killed, but dozens of matadors were injured, including 
one gored in the head and one Bobbittized. Said one participant, "It's 
just one bull against [a town of] a thousand Morons." 


AND THE WINNER.... 


PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zoo keeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his 
constipated elephant, Stefan, 22 doses of animal laxative and more than 
a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm 
finally let fly - and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop! 
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the 
ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on 
him like a dump truck full of mud. "The sheer force of the elephant's 
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he 
struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued 
to evacuate his bowels on top of him," said flabbergasted Paderborn 
police detective Erik Dern. "With no one there to help him, he lay under 
all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and 
during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak 
accidents."

"We're gonna teach you how to pull bitches."



S0 YOU WANT TO PICK UP HOES. You ain't interested in romance. You don't want a 
girlfriend. You want girlfriends. You want a little black book full of names of 
females that won't hesitate to come over at 2:30 in the morning and break you off 
something PROPER. Sure you could pick up any buckled beer whore at the local club, 
but you want better than that. You want a lifestyle full of hot bitches, wild nights, 
and the occasional menage a trois. 

You want to be a player. 

But you're afraid of rejection. You're afraid she's gonna dog you. Or worse, laugh at 
you. And so you never have the balls to approach a good looking lady. And so you 
never get laid. Except occasionally with Rosie Palmer and her five friends.  

What's the problem? You're the problem. Your self-esteem sucks and you've got no 
confidence. Maybe at one time you had some confidence. But now it's gone. Confidence 
was what gave you game, but you picked yourself apart a long time ago worrying about 
all the faults women found in you. 

That's one of your problems right there. You worry too much about what women think of 
you. Well, don't. They're JUST HOES. (From this point on "hoes" will be used to make 
all references to the female gender.) 

Why should you care what some basket-case ho thinks?. . .Once you've realized this 
you'll have started to build up confidence. And now that you've started to build up 
confidence, you no longer need to worry about what hoes think of you. See the 
relation? It's what you think of yourself that determines whether you're a roach or a 
player. If you make yourself believe that you can get any ho to skin down, then guess 
what - you can get any ho to skin down. 


Player's Rule # 1: 
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks.



To make the reading and understanding of our book easy to use, it's been broken down 
into the following sections: 


*Lyrics to use in a bar or nightclub to get laid. 

*Scams to get laid. 

*Hustling older hoes to get laid. 



At a bar or nightclub, or even just at the shopping mall, it all starts with eye 
contact. Fierce eye contact ignites an emotional state similar to fear. It's like 
staring a fool down from another set. It fucks with his head. Same thing works on 
bitches. So strong, almost threatening eye contact with a ho is the first step in 
making her want to get with you. Strong eye contact also shows power. If you don't 
look away after she first sees that you peepin', it shows her that you're confident. 
After a few seconds of strong eye contact though, be ready for her to look away. This 
doesn't mean she's not attracted to you. Subconsciously, hoes have been raised to be 
submissive to men. After looking away, if the ho glances back again within under a 
minute, you can count on her more than likely being game. 


Player's Rule # 2: 
If you stare long enough, you'll see right through a ho. 


Your next step then would be to smile and give her a slight nod, letting her know 
that you know what she’s thinking deep down. If you follow this simple little 
pattern, your next step is to make your approach. And right now she doesn't expect 
anything less. You've got her quivering in her bar stool. From the high level of 
confidence you've already demonstrated by locking eyes with her, smiling, and then 
nodding your head, she wouldn't be surprised if you were to push people out of the 
way to get to her. And at this point that would probably only turn her on more. 


But does she want to skin down? 


It's true. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Your opening 
line needs to be delivered clearly and confidently and should relate to the ho or the 
present situation. This early on, your first words and how they're said are important 
because this is all the ho has to measure you up on. And if you can manage it, the 
less clever your opening the better. You can hit her up with a compliment. Tell the 
bitch you like her necklace. There's probably ten things you could compliment her on 
if you look and think hard enough. 





For the most part, using lines is a thing of the past, but they can still be used if 
you say them with the correct level of humor. A classic: 

       "What's a ho like you doing in a place like this?" 

From the present: 

       "Damn...Girl." 

       "How you doin'?" 


Some hoes are turned off by lines, though. Which brings us to. . 


Player's Rule # 3: 
Weed out the hoes that fuck from the hoes that don't fuck. 


This is an important point to take into consideration. It helps you realize that even 
though you're this smooth, cool, confident fellow now, you're still going to 
experience the occasional rejection. It's like working the streets. Any hood knows 
that he may only have a ten percent buying market for his product. This means that he 
has to pitch a hundred prospective buyers to get ten that actually buy. That's ninety 
rejections! He's successful though because this is what he expects. So if you ever 
get a drink dumped over your head, just remember Player’s Rule # 3 and take it in 
stride. 


Player’s Rule # 4: 
Ten will getcha two. 


Every time. Talk to ten hoes and you’ll get two that are game. Get ten phone numbers 
and two will eventually pay off. 
When picking up hoes, you've got to be careful to mix up your lyrics from time to 
time because hoes each have their own personalities. (Or so they think.) Using 
different lyrics will also make you sound more sincere. And it's good to develop your 
own style. Your own style will set you apart from the other players who are on the 
same mission as you. 



Contrary to popular belief, talking with a ho you've never met is actually pretty 
easy. As long as you follow two simple rules: 

Let her do most of the talking—this is accomplished by picking up on key words or 
phrases that she uses and then throwing them back at her in an effort to keep 
conversation going. Let her tell you about herself. Hoes love to think that the world 
revolves around them. She'll feel like a star. And the more you get her to talk about 
herself, the more you'll make her feel like a star. (But you know otherwise.) 

Keep her eyes locked on yours—of course you do this by locking your eyes on hers. The 
moment she starts to lose interest in you her eyes will drift off to other things. 


If this happens it probably means that she's getting bored with the conversation - 
maybe you took the spotlight from her and began telling her too much about your days 
as a thug. Move quick to get her interest back. Either shift the conversation to 
reflect one or more of the key words or phrases you've picked up on that she's been 
using, or move on to another step. Like ask her to dance or offer to buy her a drink. 
Except you don't ask her to dance or you don't offer her a drink. You're a player 
with a lot of confidence. You take her by the hand and lead her to the dance floor. 
You buy two drinks and place one in front of her. (This is also an excellent opening 
move.) She'll feel obligated to drink it. And if you get her to drink two of more, 
she'll feel obligated to skin down later. 

Some hoes are worth skinning down with more than once. If you happen to find one of 
these "special" hoes, be sure to record her phone number, as well as where she works. 
Where she works is important to know because this reveals a little bit about her 
personality. To get far in the game, it's important to know which direction a ho's 
coming from. There's two basic personality types—"Easy" hoes, and "Not-so-easy" hoes. 
If she's an Easy ho, then all she needs is a couple of drinks and she'll be on your 
knob. But if she's a Not-so-easy ho, then it's going to take a few maneuvers. 

Let's say for example that you meet a really classy ho one evening, but no matter how 
many lines you throw at her, you only manage to get her phone number. So now what? Do 
you call her back the next day, panting like a puppy dog, and ask her for a date? 
Hell, no. You're a player. Give her the impression that she's nothing special to you. 
Wait a few days before you call her back. 

Here's an act you can put on when you call: 

When she answers the phone, purposely ask for a different ho. When she says you've 
got the wrong number, ask her what number you just dialed. She'll tell you her number 
and then you say something like, "I'm sorry, I meant (the hoes name)." Immediately 
follow this with, "I don't know what I was thinking. Your phone number's like one 
digit off of. . .(it's important to pause here for a second or two before finishing). 
. .my sister's." 

Because you paused, she'll know that you're lying. But that's cool, though. That's 
what you want. In sales they call it "fear-of-loss." It's psychological. When you 
fear-of-loss a customer, it helps make him or her feel a need for the product. The 
same goes for hoes. If you tease them, it's makes them want a piece of you. 

This tactic can also be used if all you have is the hoe’s pager number. Page her, and 
then when she calls back, act like you think it’s some other ho by calling her a 
different name. For example, let’s say you page a girl named Lucy. When Lucy calls 
back and asks if someone paged, say, "What’s up Angela? Don’t you get enough? Quit 
calling me." Of course Lucy will say, "This is Lucy, not Angela." 

You see, it's key to make hoes believe that you've got game. Some hoes are turned off 
by this, however. But that's no big deal. Remember Players Rule # 3? You're weeding 
out the ones that skin down from the ones that don't. 


* Editor's note: The piece that is about to follow was almost left out. We realized 
that there would be some ho out there who would read it and figure out that she'd 
been had. (Actually there's more than one ho out there.) We argued long and hard over 
this. Finally we gave in. We'd promised that if you read our book and took our tips 
into practice you'd more than likely start getting bitches. So, against better 
judgment, here it is. . . 


Lights, Camera, Action! 


Scams are part of the game. If you're going to be a major player, then you need to be 
able to pull a major act. Just like an actor. But instead of under the cameras and 
bright lights, the local bar or nightclub is your movie set. (Or anywhere else you're 
putting on game.) And on your set you're the scriptwriter, director, and producer. 
You're a fucking pimp. So whatever role you choose play it like one. 


Player's Rule # 5: 
Fake it ‘till you make it. 


Scenario: You're at a bar seated with a ho you've just met. You're dressed flashy. 
The drinks you ordered just arrived. You reach into your pocket and pull out your 
wallet, "accidentally" dropping a couple of business cards on the table which the ho 
you're seated with, out of curiosity, grabs and reads. 

The business card states that you're an Assistant Movie Producer. The address reads 
Hollywood, California. 

If she falls for this, which more than likely she will because this is a rare scam, 
YOU ARE GETTING LAID. 

Have a good pitch, know a little bit about camera angles, and mention names like "Rod 
Steele" whom you "do some work with." "He's unknown up here," you can tell her, "but 
down in L.A. he's popular for his work." 

With this approach you represent fame, excitement, and the glamour lifestyle. This is 
the shit hoes dream about. But be careful. After five successful nights of using this 
act on five different hoes in five different clubs, one of us ran into a ho who 
actually was in the movie industry. A couple of questions and he was revealed as a 
fake. 


Player's Rule # 6: 
Roll with the punches. 


If your cover’s been blown, roll with the punches. Smile big and then tell the ho 
that not only is she gorgeous, but that she's also incredibly intelligent. Act 
impressed. Tell her that you don't see that very often. Then follow up by saying 
that's a rare quality in bitches. 
If you use your imagination, you'll discover that there's a million scams you can 
pull over on a ho. Sure the first couple scams you try might not go to smooth, but 
hey, practice makes perfect. And don't feel bad. This is good for both of you. You 
get your rocks off on the ho and the ho gets her rocks off the next day bragging to 
all her friends about the assistant movie producer (or whatever role you played) that 
she skinned down with. So chalk it up as a one-nighter and she'll never know. 


Because most hoes don't travel in packs any smaller than two, some scams are better 
pulled when you have a friend in on the action. It's like a tag-team. If everything 
goes right you'll both get laid. 

Here's a good scam to pull using a friend: 

Scenario: You're posing as a couple of journalists for a popular magazine. With a 
couple backpacks and some expensive camera equipment the two of you rented earlier 
that day, you march into a bar and take a table to yourselves as far away from the 
action as possible. You ignore everyone. You place the cameras on the table and whip 
out a couple of notebooks. These are your props. (And you'll eventually discover that 
they're your conversation pieces.) Compare notes for a while. Lean in close to each 
other. You're ignoring everyone. Your work is important and this is what the two of 
you are discussing. You're ignoring everyone. 

But everyone is not ignoring you. Hoes all over the bar noticed when you marched in 
with your equipment, noticed that you took a table far away from the action, noticed 
that neither of you even glanced at another ho. Noticed that you look important. They 
can see that you aren't here to pick up one of them. 

The two of you have become the main event. All the hoes are casting looks at one 
another as they share the same thought—I better make a move quick before one of these 
other hoes does. And with every minute that goes by that the two of you remain 
unapproached by a ho, the better. Because the heat is rising. With their eyes these 
bitches are challenging each other. They're tigresses on the hunt—there's fifty of 
them and only one meal. And that's you. And as the evening progresses, be secure 
knowing that when a couple hoes finally do come up to your table, they'll already be 
dripping wet. Getting them to skin down will be easier than slammin' down a domino. 


Players Rule # 7: 
Get in and get out! 


These are probably life’s greatest words to live by. You should take this to mean 
that if things are going good, get out while the gettin's good. If you’re winning big 
at the craps tables, get up and cash out. If you’re holding up a bank and you’ve 
emptied three cash tills, don’t stick around to empty the last two. GET OUT WITH YO' 
MONEY! And when you swoop down on a ho who’s boyfriend just stepped away for a 
moment, Get in and get out! Don’t hesitate. Get her phone number and go back to your 
business. 

It might go something like this: 

A smooth hustler, Mikey, sees this fly ho, but she’s got a date. Mikey hangs tight, 
sipping his drink, scoping the scene, waiting to make his move. And then it happens. 
The ho’s date steps away for a moment—maybe to buy a drink. It don’t matter. Mikey’s 
in like a shark. 

“Hey, yo, baby girl,” says Mikey. “Where do we know each other?” 

Translation: “You look familiar. Have we met before?” 

Says the ho, “I don’t think so.” 

“My boys call me Mikey, and you girl?” 

Translation: “I’m Mikey. What’s your name?” 



The ho says, “I’m Kiley.” 
“Yo, Kiley, what makes you so sly?” 

Translation: “Tell me a little about yourself.” 
 

Mikey lets her talk for a few moments but then cuts in before her date can return. He 
says, “I saw you got a friend tonight, so I’d hate to keep you out. What’s your 
number?” 

He jots down her phone number and then boogies. 

Get in and get out!



"I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a 
woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to master her, to conquer her by force; and 
it can be seen that she lets herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who 
proceed coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to the young, 
because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with greater audacity." 

- Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469 - 1527 

  

"What do you want to be when you grow up?" 

"I want to be a mother fuckin’ hustler." 

- Snoop D.D., 1993 



Your Best Friend's Mom 



With older hoes it's pretty basic. Here's two really easy steps to follow: 

1. Compliment her every time you see her. Older bitches are attracted to young niggas 
who give off the persona that they will develop into major "players" when they're 
older. The ability to give compliments reflects this. It shows your confidence. Also 
keep in mind that a lot of hoes fantasize about being seduced by a young nigga, 
because the nigga's in his prime. Even married hoes. So your goal with these 
compliments is to not come across as nice—it’s to come across as manipulative. This 
is where you become a hustler in their eyes. And all hoes subconsciously have an 
inner need to be hustled. Believe that. 

2. In a humorous fashion, feed a ho this line: "When I'm 25 (assuming that you, the 
reader, is younger, of course), and make it big, will you marry me?" 

She may see you now as a "big thinker" who's going to be a success in life. It 
doesn't matter what age they are, hoes are attracted to success. You may now 
represent to her an "interesting affair." 

In any of your flirting, if she ever says "I'm too old for you" or, "You're too 
young," you can say, "You just need a little youth in you." Or, "You’re wrong, girl. 
You’re like an exotic wine. You taste better with age." (It’s important to call her 
"girl." When you do you immediately take control of the situation.) 

Some older hoes would rather seduce a young brother into an affair. In this case, it 
would be the older ho who would instigate things. To make the situation arise, the 
proper conditions need to exist. Think back to Players Rule # 5. Fake it ‘till you 
make it. 

Whenever you're around her, act like you're uncomfortable. Let her catch you gazing 
at her body. Immediately whip your eyes away. She's attracted to your shyness. To 
give her the impression that she's aroused you and made you uncomfortable, rub your 
hand across the back of your neck, then, for greater effect, rub your hand around 
your shirt collar (classic move). Now she knows that you’re getting hard. And this 
turns her on. 


"Ho, Ho, Hoes!" 

- Santa Claus, 1999



So There You Have It 

As you've found out by reading our book, there really isn't much to being a player. 
And there really isn't much to picking up hoes. It all boils down to confidence. And 
when it comes to confidence, there's no magic formula—you're as confident as you 
think you are.


Here's a point to think about:


They’re all the same. 

What's this mean? 

You’ve seen one ho, you’ve seen them all.


Hoes play games. Hoes in Miami pull the same shit as hoes in Detroit. Hoes in D.C. 
pull the same shit as hoes in L.A. And that’s why it’s so easy to be a player. 
Because you already know what they’re all about. 

So in all your travels and in all your conquests, we at MP3-Orgy.com wish you the 
best. 

Oh, yeah. . . One more thing worth mentioning that's guaranteed to get you laid. . . 

Scenario: You're parked out in front of a nightclub. It's a few minutes before it 
closes for the night and drunken hoes are beginning to stagger out in groups of two's 
and three's. You're wearing a jacket that has your name stitched into the fabric 
above the breast pocket and you're also carrying a small clipboard. You look 
professional, like you have a job to do. 

You get out of your car and march into the club. You take a second or two to scope 
out the scene. Hoes are everywhere. Most of them look like they've had too much to 
drink. You laugh to yourself. This is almost like taking candy from a little brotha. 

With one hand, you shake your car keys high above your head and shout, "SOMEONE CALL 
A TAXI?"

So, you just relized you can run faster than your car, and you are pissed off at 
people making fun of how slow it is. If you cannot have speed, you can sure as hell 
have looks. What we are going for is complete and utter fear when rolling up to an 
intersection. 

Steps to making a hax0r car:

Go to the dollar store and buy some white 'car markers' then write 1's and 0's all 
over your car. 

Next you should go to the Salvation Army or something and pick up a few old 386's for 
$2. Take all of them apart so you got mad parts. 

Now pull your hubcaps off and ductape your 4 motherboards on. Now you are rolling on 
some 22" motherboards. 

Take the ductape, and tape like 2 random cards together, some old ISA ones. Now put 
this contraption over your rear view window, instead of something non hax0rish like 
DICE, you have network cards and modems.


Get some glue, a big market, and alot of paper, its time to make some bumpter 
stickers. You should write some cool stuff on the papers, anything you want! Some 
suggestions are:
b0g!@#!
ph33r m3 1 r 31337
sup unix?
Type*
x-7r3m3 h4x0rZ r4c1nG
*PING PING*

Those are just the ones i have. Just glue the paper anywhere on your car you want.

Now you need a cool display, like their elite software in the fast & the furious, so 
if you got another 386, use that. You will need to remove your passenger side seat to 
fir your 1980's huge ass monitor, cause who the fucks got money for an LCD display. 

After you mount your monitor, you need to determine what OS you wanna run. This is 
hte hard part, because if you wanna be l33t and run unix, you need to be able to 
draw. You are going to have to make a "This car is powered by XXXX" sticker, and draw 
the accompanied logo. If you can draw a Pneguin, or Daemon, go for it, but its alot 
easier to put "This car is powered by:" and have a big arrow going to your window. 

Speaking of windows, if you are real elite, you should remove, or smash all yours 
out, then put up signs that say "fuX0r w1nd0z!" around the old windows. If you get 
questioned by the local authorities about this, just tell them that u dont wanna 
crash, so you dont use windows. If they are elite they will get it.

Take the CPU fans from the 386's and mount them to your hood, they will look like 
"uber turbo engine fans" like you gotta keep the shit cool with max airflow for uber 
horsepower.

Thats about it for basic suggestions, there are however some more complex things if 
you have time and money. 

These include adding a defense system to your car [missiles&paintball] with a nice 
LCD screen and pretty GTK interface!

Something else thats pretty hax0rly is too put a mirror on your bumper with a sticker 
that says root@ and then a # rm -rf/ one after...so it says: root@[mirror]# rm -rf /
They will fear because it will be their license plate # and shit. 

Another sign i have on my car is one in the rear window, it says:

"If you can read this, i just 0wn3d j00, or im going real slow on a 1 lane street, 
and you cant pass me, you fag. Or if your a cop have a good day"  <-- that shit gets 
me mad hoes.

Anyways, i need to upgrade the cpu's on my tires, have fun hax0ring the information 
superhighway in your new ride.

           the following is taken from an actual muder trial

attorney: "Before you signed the death certificate had you taken the man's pulse?"
coroner : "No," 

attorney: "Did you listen for a heartbeat?"
coroner : "No."

attorney: "Did you check for breathing?"
coroner : "No."

attorney: "So when you signed the death certificate you had not taken any steps to 
make sure the man was dead, had you?"

coroner : "Well, let me put it this way. The man's brain was sitting in a jar on my 
desk, but for all I know he could be out there practicing law somewhere."

#Include <disclaimer.h> /*If you can't make backups you can't edit the
						   Registry*/

														  
Introduction
This guide is intended to give you enough information to become sufficiently
interested in Registry editing and also enough so you can actually do what 
you want - it is suggested however that you do further reading and also if you
really want total control over your Operating System (OS) you really want an
Open Source OS (Micro$oft don't currently do this) that way if you want to
alter something you can do it at the source. If you had already written your
own OS at the age of 6 this guide is not for you (unless you want to see how
stupid people live).

This guide is written with the Windows 98 Registry in mind, much of it 
Applies to NT, ME AND 2000 though. None applies to the 3.1 Registry which is has a
completely different structure and use. I have used the default directories
etc. where possible, if your Windows is not installed in C:\Windows then
change the instructions accordingly.

Finally I must agree that a lot of Registry editing is pointless if you can
find a key in The Registry which alters some trait of a program then chances
are you'll also find the option within one of the program's menus, but this 
is not always the case once when I was trying to play a music CD the program
skipped to the next track after playing 20 seconds of each track, finally I
found a key called "Preview" in the section with all my CD player's option 
it had a value of "1" which I changed to "0" and after that it was all OK, I 
have subsequently looked for a way to have manually done this but I can't find 
one (although I'm now a little curious to find out how it got turned on in the 
1st place).

Just be safe in the knowledge that the worst that can happen is that you 
Will need to reinstall Windows.

=======================================================================
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
I. How to make sure that whatever you do in The Registry can be fixed:
=======================================================================
=========================================
The best way of backing up your Registry:
-----------------------------------------
Save "user.dat" and "system.dat" in the Windows directory under different
names (I suggest "user.zee" and "system.zee" that way if you forget what 
they are called you can always refer back to this text). DON'T FORGET - make a
backup each time you alter The Registry since each time you install a piece
of hardware or software The Registry is changed (in fact some programs store
values in The Registry about the position of its window on the screen so it 
is the same size next time you start the program). Also, as a rule, it is best 
to only change one thing at a time (when possible).This means that if something
goes wrong you can identify what it is more easily - if you've changed 7
things in 40 minutes it's really annoying to have to go back to the previous
settings and have to do it again. (Yes this is something I've learnt from
experience)

=======================
How to use the backups:
-----------------------
1.If Windows loads but you have an undesired effect then you can open
Windows Explorer and rename your backups to "user.dat" and "system.dat"
(you may need to change "folder settings" in Windows Explorer so you can see
all file types) then reboot.

2.If on the other hand Windows cannot start and the system hangs then reboot
and after ScanDisk runs you will get a menu asking what you want to do
(because it has been detected that Windows did not successfully load). If 
you want you can try running in safe mode but chances are this will not load
either instead choose to stay in DOS. If you've never used DOS before this
can be quite scary. In DOS you will most likely be presented with a black
screen with white letters "C:\>" (there are ways of changing this) if you
called the files "user.zee" and "system.zee" then type each of these lines
followed by the enter key

attrib C:\Windows\user.dat -r
attrib C:\Windows\system.dat -r           /*strips files of "readonly"ness 
*/
ren C:\Windows\user.zee C:\Windows\user.dat           /*renames*/
ren C:\Windows\system.zee C:\Windows\system.dat

(Alternatively you could make a batch file and do it all in one go, to do
this just copy/paste the relevant lines and save the file as Zee.bat then 
all you need to do from DOS is type Zee to run it. Don't include the bits 
between the /*s, it won't work if you do.)

3.If you can do neither of these two things (e.g. your backup is corrupted)
then reboot the computer when you see "Starting Windows {whatever your 
Windows is}", push the "F8" key a menu should come up Choose "Safe mode command 
Prompt only" from the menu. You will be presented with a black screen with white
letters "C:\>". Change to your Windows directory (type cd\Windows) and type
"RegEdit /e savereg.reg" It will say "exporting file". eventually it will 
stop with an error message. After this, type "attrib system.dat -r -s -h". Then
type "ren system.dat system.old". Finally type "RegEdit /c savereg.reg". 
These commands will pull only the undamaged sections from your old Registry and 
Make a new one based on these. If it fails, reinstall Windows. If it works, some 
Of your programs may no longer function, they will need to be reinstalled.

If none of this appeals to you (I.E. - you are scared of DOS) then don't 
Even bother reading the rest of this file, editing The Registry is pretty stupid
without backups (unless if you are completely sure what you're doing is
right). If you don't have the technical ability to backup your Registry you
WILL screw up Windows big time so just don't bother. Quite simply editing
without having a backup is plain stupid so BACKUP!
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
II.  How to use RegEdit.exe 

=======================================================================
To start The Registry editor (RegEdit) type RegEdit.exe in the run box or 
Open Windows Explorer and type C:\Windows\RegEdit.exe in the address bar then 
press enter (whilst you've got Explorer open you may want to drag the icon onto 
The Windows pop-up start menu or desktop and create yourself a shortcut for 
Future use) It's got a lovely icon (a friend of mine likes it so much he made a 
model one out of sugar cubes). You should be presented with a vaguely familiar
interface, it looks a lot like Windows Explorer. Everyone I speak to says 
you should never even acknowledge The Registry exists - doing so will only bring
bad karma to your system, well they don't say that but they do say that one
false move will leave you with a totally broke OS if you're lucky and a 
house razed to the ground if you're not! This is not further from the truth - 
click on the + next to [HKEY_CURRENT_USER] then in the left pane right click in an
empty space choose a New entry (any type but I'm choosing DWORD) call it
ScrewUp then edit it so it has a value of 1. Now click the X button at the 
top right of RegEdit to close it, note that RegEdit does not ask if you want to
save changes - Micro$oft obviously think that anyone using RegEdit doesn't
deserve the user friendliness they put in their other programs (e.g. Word 
"Are you SURE you're sure ?")Now shutdown your computer - restart it and note
that nothing happened even though you've altered The Registry, if any of 
your friends told you using RegEdit was dangerous now is the time to phone them
and tell them they are stupid.

OK you've lost all your friends but at least you've got more time to 
Registry
edit now, so fire up RegEdit again. First we'll get rid off that stupid 
entry
we just made, so click on the plus next to [HKEY_CURRENT_USER] again and
highlight ScrewUp (click on it once) then press delete (on your keyboard) to
delete it.
	As you've already seen to create a new value right click in an empty space
and choose New then new options will appear choose one of the lower three ,
have a go at all the stuff but don't edit any of the entries already there.
Here is your first useful Registry edit and a chance for you to try out your
skills (only in deleting though - more advanced stuff in later sections I
promise)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson One: Edit the uninstall list:
Sometimes programs don't remove all traces of themselves when you uninstall
them or you can't uninstall them properly because a file has become corrupt 
or whatever. This is really annoying and untidy and editing The Registry is the
only way to take them out of the Add/Remove programs list (without buying 
some expensive program that just automates the process anyways).

1.Again open RegEdit from "Run" by typing "RegEdit.exe" in the box.
2.Click on "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINES"
3.Now click on "Software" then "Microsoft", "Current Version" and finally
  "Uninstall"
4.Each entry in the right window corresponds to an application
5.Highlight the entries you no longer need and press delete (on your 
keyboard)

As you can see it's actually not that difficult and when you've got a backup
there's absolutely nothing to worry about.
------------------------Here endeth the lesson-----------------------------
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
III. Explanation of how programs use The Registry
=======================================================================
Programs look to The Registry for all sorts of things. Most of the 
Preferences that you choose in programs (look in 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ControlPanel\desktop 
to see what kind of stuff is stored) are stored in The Registry. These Registry
keys are usually created when the program is installed. It is used as an
alternative to .INI files which were used in previous versions of Windows
(although kept for backward compatibility). Basically it is just a way of
storing values of importance, such as whether options are turned on or off,
so they can be retrieved later especially on subsequent runnings of the
program (I.E. possibly after the computer has been re-booted and any 
settings stored in memory would be lost)

It is quite simple to write programs in Visual BASIC (VB) which alter/ 
Lookup values in The Registry. A short example of how this can be done is included
below, remember that many programs designed for use in Windows are developed
using VB (hence similar appearances - menus, maximise/minimise/X buttons 
etc.)
a commercial program would be a compiled version so even if you use a hex
editor the .executable would look nothing like this :

------------------------------RegUse.VB-------------------------------------
Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.RegWrite ("HKCU\MyNewKey\", 1 ,"REG_DWORD")
WshShell.RegWrite ("HKCU\MyNewKey\MyValue", "Hello world!")

WScript.Echo WshShell.RegRead("HKCU\MyNewKey\MyValue")
WScript.Echo WshShell.RegRead("HKCU\MyNewKey\")

WshShell.RegDelete "HKCU\MyNewKey\MyValue"
WshShell.RegDelete "HKCU\MyNewKey\"
----------------------Here endeth the VB script---------------------------

NOTES: HKCU is an abbreviation of HKEY_CURRENT_USERS, the first line loads
the WshShell object since it is not called automatically upon script
execution (probably to save memory).

Here are the VB processes (and their general syntax) that I have so far come
across, they are all used in the above example:

To delete a portion of The Registry use RegDelete
Syntax: WshShell.RegDelete strName

To read a portion of The Registry use RegRead
Syntax: WshShell.RegRead(strName)

To write a new entry into The Registry use RegWrite
Syntax: WshShell.RegWrite strName, varValue [,strType]


However Micro$oft applications aren't the only languages around that can use
The Registry. This Perl Script can extract data from the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
key, it could then be operated on and added back into The Registry but the
below is just an example.

-----------------------------------regedit.pl------------------------------

#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exeuse

Win32::Registry;

$p = "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
\\CurrentVersion";
$main::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Open($p, $CurrVer) ||
die "Open:  $!\n";
$CurrVer->GetValues(\%vals);
foreach $k (keys %vals) {
$key = $vals{$k};
print "$$key[0] = $$key[2]\n";
}

-------------------------here endeth the Perl Script------------------------

When you create or alter a value in The Registry you alter the information
passed to a program (when you create a value this usually means that there 
is a default value stored in the program which it uses if there is no Registry
value) that is why when you created a new entry called ScrewUp it didn't do
anything - however if some Micro$oft programmer had decided to add a routine
that crashes the computer which runs if an entry with the value of 1 is 
found then we would have had to revert to backups.

IV.  M$Internet Explorer title hack
=======================================================================
This is something many people want to, maybe because it is so easy a lot of
people do it and others see it and want to do it as well (this is the kind 
of thing corporate types think makes their company look more professional - 
like having the company name/logo spinning round *really* fast as a screensaver).
Chances are you will have seen this, at the top of Micro$oft Internet 
Explorer (M$IE). In the title bar there are 2 things, the title of the site 
(specified in the HTML, Java etc.) and the words "Microsoft Internet Explorer" 
(separated by a hyphen). However if you got your M$IE off an ISP CD it might say 
"<Title of site> - MSIE provided by <ISP name>". It is quite simple to change this,
start RegEdit and search for whatever text they have added and you should 
find the string in no time. If you want to spoil it here's the exact procedure :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Click to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main]
Edit "Window Title" to whatever you want (size permitting)
----------------------Here endeth the procedure------------------------

Now there is nothing difficult about finding out this kind of hack (per se).
It is on the Micro$oft Knowledge Base(MSKB) - sort of (Article ID: Q176497 
If you're interested) the article begins by talking about changing the tile 
with the <TITLE></TITLE> HTML tags (I actually thought I had the wrong article at
first) and then goes on to say :

"the window title can be customized by Internet content providers (ICPs),
Internet service providers (ISPs), or corporate administrators by using
Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK)."

which sounds interesting (but probably quite expensive) I don't think
Micro$oft like you doing this but the article includes some brilliant and
crazy pieces of not very helpful advice such as:

"This section describes how to add or remove a custom Internet Explorer
window title by manually editing The Registry. To do this, use the 
appropriate method."

They also don't tell you the whole truth they only tell you about editing 
the value in [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main] which
as they admit:

"Customizing the Internet Explorer window title adds "provided by <your 
custom title>" to the default Internet Explorer window title as follows:  
Page title - Microsoft Internet Explorer provided by Custom title"

this isn't strictly lying only withholding information - but it is very 
sneaky by telling us about this little hack and not telling us about the other 
(which they obviously know about since they coded the damn thing) they imply that
there is no other hack. Now would be a good time to call up Micro$oft and 
tell them what you think of them (only if you've registered the software though 
!)
This is an example of the program having a default value programmed into it
because if you remove The Registry entry the title reverts back.

V.   Example Registry edits
=======================================================================
This is the probably the most fun section. If you are totally lame this will
be the only section you read. If you are cool then this will show you what 
the Registry can do and hopefully give you an idea of what you want to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change the name of the recycling bin
In RegEdit press "F3" (in the row at the top of the keyboard) or choose 
search from the menu and search for "Recycle Bin" there should be 3 occurrences, 
you need to change each one to get it to work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete a directory which Windows Explorer won't let you delete
Basically search for the name of the directory (by pressing F3) in RegEdit
when you find it you can either delete it or rename it and this will become
the directory the program saves its files to (My Documents is an example of
this - it the default saving directory for Office).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Removing Desktop Icons
Go to 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINES\Software\Microsoft\WindowsCurrentVersion\Explorer\De
sktop\NameSpace, the keys in the right Windows have very long names but just
select them to see what they are and delete the ones you don't want.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove the shortcut arrows
In HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Inkfile there's a value called IsShortcut delete it 
then go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Pif and do the same.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add new sound effect events
In the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps add a new key (right 
click on a blank area of the window) called the filename of whatever application
you want the effect to be used with (e.g. Windows explore is 
"Explorer.exe").
Then within that key add new keys named with the events you want the sound
effects to be attached to (e.g. "Open" and "Close").
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instant start menu access
Go to HKEY_CURENT_USER\ControlPanel\Desktop make a New StringValue (right
click to open menu) named MenuShowDelay and give it a value of 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change the name that your PC is registered in
Just double click on RegisteredOwner in 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion and change it to your own details.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get rid of the network neighbourhood icon
Go all the way through to 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsodt\Windows\Current
Vesrsion\Policies\Explorer right click in the right window select New
DWORDValue from the popup menu and call it NoNetHood, double click on it to
change its value to 1 - if at some later stage you want it back change the
value to 0 or delete it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DVD-ROM region coding
Chances are you DVD region is set to a specific value but you want to take
advantage of your currencies excellent exchange rate with another country 
but they are in different region to you - change the region of your DVD-drive
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion look for
DVD_Region on the right hand side and change its value so you can watch 
films that only cost you 3.50 + packing (yay!) - may not work on all drives
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change log-on message
Click to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsCurentVersion\Winlogon
and add two keys "LegalNoticeCaption" (the title of the box) and
"LegalNoticeText" (the text in the box) - the text displayed can be added by
changing their values (double clicking).
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
VI.  How to create your own Registry edits
=======================================================================
Hopefully you have some idea from the above examples of what kind of things
you can do, and you should have performed all the skills you need (e.g.
creating word, changing values, searching etc.) at least once. The hardest
hacks are when you create new strings because you have to guess what they
would be called (since these programs are really high profile they follow
patterns especially the Micro$oft ones). Easier hacks are the ones where you
would have had to revert to backups. When editing existing entries they 
always follow these rules, a value of 1 is usually means "true" or "yes" and 0 is
conversely "false" or "no" (this comes from Boolean values in many 
programming languages) - however it is possible for a programmer to screw up  and 
these values to be reversed, also 1 and 0 are 1 and 0 in any numbering system
(binary, denary , hex etc. - no-one has as yet designed a system based 
solely on zeros). If you wanted to know every possible Registry entry a program 
could be influenced by you would need to see the source code (not very likely) so
just stick to editing values in already present strings.


Here is full list of default trees you should find within all Registries and
the types of values they contain:


HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT:
Contains software settings about drag-and-drop operations, handles shortcut
information, and other user interface information. There is a subkey here 
for every file association that has been defined.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER:
Contains information regarding the currently logged-on user.

AppEvents: Settings for assigned sounds to play for system and applications
sound events.
Control Panel: Control Panel settings, similar to those defined in 
System.ini,
			   Win.ini and Control.ini in Windows 3.xx.
InstallLocationsMRU: Contains the paths for the Startup folder programs.
Keyboard layout: Specifies current keyboard layout.
Network: Network connection information.
RemoteAccess: Current log-on location information, if using Dial-Up
Networking.
Software: Software configuration settings for the currently logged-on user.


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:
Contains information about the hardware and software settings that are
generic to all users of this particular computer.

Config: Configuration information/settings.
Enum: Hardware device information/settings.
Hardware: Serial communication port(s) information/settings.
Network: Information about network(s) the user is currently logged on to.
Security: Network security settings.
Software: Software specific information/settings.
System: System startup and device driver information and operating system
		settings.


HKEY_USERS: Contains information about desktop and user settings for each 
user that logs onto the same Windows 95 system. Each user will have a  subkey 
under this heading. If there is only one user, the subkey is "default"



HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG: Contains information about the current hardware
configuration, pointing to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.


HKEY_DYN_DATA:
Contains dynamic information about the plug-and-play devices installed on 
the
system. The data here changes if devices are added or removed on-the-fly.

When you've done some really cool stuff you might want to try making a
Registry patch. A Registry patch is a simple text file with the .REG 
extension that contains one or more keys or values. If you double-click on a .REG 
file, the patch is applied to The Registry. This is a good way to share or back up
small portions of The Registry for use on your own computer, or someone
else's, because it's much simpler and less dangerous than manually editing
The Registry. You can create a Registry patch by opening The Registry 
Editor, selecting a branch, and choosing Export from the File menu. Then, specify a
filename, and press OK. You can then view The Registry patch file by opening
it in Notepad (right-click on it and select Edit). Again, just double-click 
on a Registry patch file (or use Import in The Registry Editor's File menu) to
apply it to The Registry (this is the one time RegEdit will be user friendly
- it will ask you to confirm the merge of the file into The Registry, 
however there are reg patches out there that disable this function :->). A reg patch
will look something like this

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGEDIT4

; This is a comment and is not read by the machine you can add them so
; people reading it can find out what the patch does before they merge it
; You can lie and put some backdoor in someone's system if you don't like
; them, but if they have an ounce of sense they will understand the patch
;
; The REGEDIT4 part means this is a win9x Registry file

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]
"LegalNoticeCaption"="How Are You Gentlemen"
"LegalNoticeText"="All your base are belong to us"

-----------------------Here endeth the reg patch---------------------------

And hopefully this example will go some way to explaining how they work and
you will be able to write them straight off:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REGEDIT4 


	  [HKEY_...\PATH\IN\REGISTRY\TREE\TO\KEY1]

	  "NameOfKey1Value1"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)

	  [HKEY_...\PATH\IN\REGISTRY\TREE\TO\KEY2]

	  "NameOfKey2Value1"="blahblah"        (String value, text)
	  "NameOfKey2Value2"=hex:ff,00,20,1c...(Hexadecimal Bytes)
	  "NameOfKey2Value3"=dword:xxxxxxxx    (Hexadecimal)
-----------------------Here endeth the example reg patch-------------------

Obviously as a supplement to these a search engine will come up with lots of
interesting results (I checked Google - http:\\www.google.com - and got
absolutely hundreds of interesting pages), the authors of these pages have
invariably read the books suggested above and written their own pages which
are basically the same thing in their own words with their own particular
expertise thrown in for good measure. Hence these can be used as a 
supplement to the knowledge you have gained from reading the books\ your own registry
experiences or they can work as an alternative (for those of us who have
better things to spend are money on !)
==========================================================================
Well that's about it now if you do something really cool or want some help
then send me an e-mail (Monkey_Zee@hotmail.com)


Questions/comments/constructive criticism to Monkey_Zee@hotmail - I'm really
interested to find out any other languages which give you uncomplicated
access to The Registry, you can also find out about any new Registry edit 
I've done or possibly get my views if your having trouble with something you're
trying to do. If I get any requests to do articles more in-depth about
particular aspects that are only slightly explored in this one I will try to
comply.

Flames to /dev/null (that includes mail about Registry editing not being
						  'hacking' - I know already)

This text was finished as you see on 11 Sep 2001, but if you find it 
Floating around in 2005 and you feel like sending me an e-mail about it then please 
do.
This file is not copyrighted in any way, if you do want to pretend you wrote
it make sure you change the name/ e-mail address, if you put any sort of
copyright on it then you are extremely lame. Any additions are welcome but I
would also like to hear from you if you think you have some additional
information I'd be interested in.

"xhaze man, im not getting any chicks, the last chick that touched me was this
13yr old girl at school who beat me up and stole my lunch money :`(, i need
help on macking them f00s," gl0bal explained. "I really need help!"  As eye
listened to gl0bal i felt pity 4 him and replied "HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!$!@"
After about three days of laughing and tormenting gl0bal eye contacted him
again with good news, "Sure man i'll help you get some hoes, infact heaps of
b0ggers are a lot like j00, pathetic, sad, and seks0rless," i told him to
make him feel better, "I will write a multiple step program on how to get
them hoes, and fuck them tew!"  gl0bal gleefully said "Oh thank you uber,
elite one, im not worthy of your seksyness and/or ways of life, how can i ever
repay you?!"  "Just get out of my sight." I replied while flicking my wrist in
the direction of the door and i continued getting hand fed by 4 exotic seksi
bitchez.

Seeing I am a max gangseks/leperseks/honkhonkseks h4x0r, I am going to shed
light on all of you sadassmofo's.  Here is my multiple step program on picking
up chicks.

Welcome to my 31337[-31329] Program for 'Macking Them Bitchez'

STEP ONE: The Unthinkable

First we need to delete all of our pr0n collection. This is so your futile balls,
can for once, carry their intended amount of semen. Seeing most of you milk
yourself dry every few hours :(((



>XD             :D                 :o                :)               :(
|\ .'`~.        |\ .~~.            |\ . .            |\               |\
|¯      `.      |¯     `.          |¯     .          |¯ `.            |¯

9:00am        10:30am             1:05pm            3:30pm           8:28pm
Wake up   After Breakfast      After Lunch     During S-Club7   Before The 830
                                                 TV Program          Movie


Hint0.1: If you cannot bring yourself to deleting your pr0n, put it on CD-R/W
and hide them &/OR give them to a mate to hold onto while your on my
31337[-31329] step program.




STEP TWO: The Self-Secure

Find a mirror somewhere and look into it.
Now tell yourself daily, "Eye am a pjearless xhaze follower and eye can mack
the hotteyze..strait serve!!!"  Take off your clothes and look at your
body... See how your right arm is much muscular than your left arm, this is
one of the reasons why we have STEP ONE. Also note that your pathetic flaccid
penith curves right..  also why we have STEP ONE.

     d88P              _             "Y88b             ______            8888

     Y88b             |_|               888           |______|           8888
      Y88bb.                         .dd88Y                            .£8888D.
      Y88888b                       .d8888Y                             £8888D
      `'UY8                         'Y8YU'`                             'e88b

     BOOMER-WANG       +        COUNTER-WANK             =          SUPER PENITH



Hint0.2: If you want to (bare in mind that you will be 6 months behind) you can
get your pr0n back however you 'disposed' of it, and if you really did dispose
of it, you lame fuck, download more.  I can never emphasize this enough...WANK
WITH j00R LEFT ARM EACH AND EVERYTYME for 6 MONTHS (± 4 months depending on your
wanking schedule.) This will even up your arm sizes, and hopefully counter-wank
your penith back to straightness.





STEP THREE: THE HOE-DIGERTY-HO-DOWN

Goto a social gathering...that has the opposite seks there!!!
I know what you were thinking....and no, not this weeks LAN, but a place where
you consume alcohol &/OR drugs, like the only LAN i've been to...but NOT A LAN!

                             DANCE!!         SKULL


Hint0.3:

Helpful place suggestions:-
  1) The Pub - Where all the maynegy butch bitches hang and drink more beer
               that j00.
  2) A School - For people like odin, but for gods sake don't make a 'mistake'
                like him as you cannot complete this program inside jail.
  3) Town - Exactly that...town, you get all kinds here.
     Hint0.70WN: Best place is sitting outside a surf/skate/snow shop, as all
                 the foxee gurleez are the s/s/s chixxx
  4) Nightclub - Where all the hot beetcheez dance in sk1mpee clothes.
     Hint0.C1U8: For advanced users only, as if you are a newbie/#!/pr0gram
                 kiddie, you will not be able to keep you vital full load..full..
  5) Party - This is where a large group of friends get together to socialize
             to load music.  Well heard-about parties work like a triangle scam.
             bigger chance for you to pick upp0r a chick0r. 






STEP FOUR: CONTACT

Engage verbal contact with the ch1x0r.


DO'S:   Tell her how hawt and seksy she is.
        Compliment her.
        Mention the name 'xhaze' somewhere as she'll be sure to know me.
        [Only use if talking to ++HAWT++ATH00>CHICK]
        complement her b0g dot org


DONT'S: Tell her she looks like a porn star that you’ve wanked over.
        Talk about your oc129 rootshell's, or anything computer related.
        Just stare at her tits.
	Don't fondle yourself. For satan's sake don't fondle yourself.





STEP FI5E R.I.P: TAKE ME AWAY!@

If she shows interest, invite her back to j00r uber bachelor pad.

You can tell she's interested if...
1) She plays with her hair.
2) Asks you for a farq. (Usually only asked once you hab mentioned 'xhaze')
3) Actually talks to you for longer than 5 minutes.
4) She starts fondling herself.

Once baque to j00r max-pad, take her into j00r FLATMATES rooms...not yours$!@ as
the empty coke bottles and chip packets that are covering the floor, won't turn
her on that much.
Instead j0UR flatmat, who should be MUCH k00-er than you, will hab a solid room.
Which will suit her needs more than your room.

Hint0.5MAC: Play that barry white that's sitting 'the drawer' or even S.O.A.D
            seeing its almost fucking mainstream :(





STEP SIX-6-SIX: THE SEQSING PART

Just replicate the copious amounts of 0!!!!!_XxX_HARDCORE-DiVX.AVI porn
your've watched and your home free.  If this max 8aY8e is a FREAK then this
is where STEP ONE comes into play.  Before withdrawing your week++ deposit
of   <    \/   |\/|   pull out your penith from her love c/anal and bl0w it
all over her fayceORbrearstsORst0mache.  Your mega-saved-up-load will almost
drown her, and also impress her!!!!


STEP SE7EN: THE MOURNING AFTER

If she was a bad /r00t then here are a few pointers on av0id4nCE...

OPTIONS
  1) Seeing it's your flatmates room, sneeq out and back to j00r room. She'll
     think itwas your flatmate that did the blashsphemous and no-matter what he
     tells her, she'll think he's a 'rotten lying pig' h0h0.
     Hint0.r00m: Werx best if she was drunk the night before, which she most
                 likely was if _YOU_ g0t tew fuqq'er.
  2) Pretend j00r dead.
  3) Tell her your ghey and re-enforce that statement by putting a broom up
     j00r ass
  4) Beat her till she's unconscious and take her to a womans refuge with a
     note stuk to her saying
     "My boyfriend beats me daily because eye gib bad head"

If you cannot av0id her, then reveal the _REAL_YOU_ and show her your computer
ridden room and how much of a _LOSER_YOU_ARE_.  For the extremely rare cases
where she is tew find out if she ICQ/MSN/IRC/ETC and P4QU37 HER ASS...again ;)

Question:  So once I drown the bitch in my cum.. she complains about the taste
           what should I do?
Answer:    Easy. If you drink lots of beer, cum tastes like beer,  if you smoke
           heaps of weed, cum tastes like weed.  From this i assume if you eat
           enough of anything your cum will have a slight taste of that object
           ...ask her what she likes.......hopefully she is bisexual and
           replies "pussy!"


Question:  Ok, I had my penis removed by an africian tribe voodoo doctor..
           What should I fondle?

           the shower to pee
<Phiddler> if she's happy with the very mild play, just peeing in each other's
           presence, then you can work up to the more interesting games
<eks-club7> like what sort of games can i play?  submerge? golden submarine?

I know this is probably minor stuff to you, but my former "boyfriend" has been 
getting my mail and into my computer files...I think he is doing it from his own 
computer at his house..He doesn't have access to my computer..He says he is "coming 
in the back door" ..of my computer to do it.  He also said that I could change my 
password everyday and he could still get in.  I know that he reads my mail, etc. 
because he has read it to me verbatim.  He is no genius, and I am not totally 
stupid..so can you give me your best guess as to how he is doing this?  Can I ever 
get any of my internet, computer privacy back?  What do I have to do?  I have a 
firewall, etc.  It doesn't seem to help!  Help!

Hi, this is a thing we are going to be doing. It's my attempt at teaching PHP to all 
you. I am no expert, however our TRESS is. I am going to start at the basics. This is 
not advanced, or even for people who got a clue. This is starting out at nothing and 
stuff.

First thing, you gotta have php installed. I hate when people try to run php without 
php. Whoa. Php isnt like HTML, HTML IS TEXT sent to your browser that your browser 
takes and makes pretty. Php is the server side stuff that makes the calls. A few 
examples of this could be a bulletin board, a counter, or even a news manager ;) Once 
you have php installed[php.net] you can start the shit. First thing is first, all 
your php code should be inside php tags. These tags let the webserver execute the 
code before sending out data. These tags are by default "<?php" and "?>" you can 
optionally use <? ?> tags and also ASP style tags if they are configured in your php 
configuration. Ok got it? Now with the stuff that you might want.

I have noticed that working with existing code is the easiest way to learn. Also 
writing the code all over again as opposed to copy + pasting is makes it stick 
better...It's harder but works.

Well as i write this, and watch tv i know its gonna suck and be a failure but 
whatever you can go fuck a horse, im a ninja.

Lets set some shit strait, strings contain a value.

$string = "data";

makes $string contain the word 'data' GET IT?
so now you could make a script like

<?php
$string = "data";
echo $string;
?>

that will ECHO $string wich is 'data' so your web browser will display that elite 4 
letter word.
Now alot of people ask about shit like: 
http://www.domain.tld/index.php?string=data&string2=data2

That is just like saying:
$string = "data";
$string2 = "data2";

you can pile them up as much as you want, just seperate them with &'s,
next example will be
http://www.blah.tld/index.php?string=hello&string2=world
<?php
echo $string . $string2;
?>
that will as you guesses[i sure fucking hope] hello world
A . combines strings so just figure it out.

Uhm im watching a show about some child whos got like 50 parents cause of sperm 
mismatches and shit. SO uhm lets try to learn something new.

include and require. Include will include another script, file or whatever...it is 
just like taking the file you have, cutting it in half where the include statement 
is, and puts the included file in. This means all variables, and everything set 
before the include will be effective in the included file, and all variables from the 
file will be included in the rest of the script. This example will include a 
file...thats all

1.php:
<?php
$file2 = $file1;
?>

index.php:
<?php
$file1 = "whoa";
include("1.php");
echo $file2;
?>

As you see, $file2 doesnt exist in that script but uhh it does in the other thats 
included, and it will pass as 'whoa' cause $file1 is 'whoa' and $file2 = $file1 so uh 
yeah you get it.

if, time for if. IF will execute commands and stuff if things match up in the 
statement.
ie:
<?
$status = "tak";
if(isset($status)) { echo "uh yeah its tak"; )
?>

see if it is tak, it does whats in the {}'s, you can also have an else, or elseif.
elseif acts just like if, but after the initial if. Else is when everything else 
fails, do this shit in there.

BTW, isset($string) checks to see if $string contains a value, if it doesnt it will 
go to else.

So lets look at a couple bigger examples dealing with redirecting include if thingys!

you ever see like http://www.b0g.org/index.php?sec=pr0n or something like that? well 
lets show you how. Well that is the example type thing, but first ill show you 
something else

<?php
if(isset($sec))
{
include($sec);
}else{
echo "You dont have a sec, so this is index.php without stuff";
}
?>

That will basically check to see if $sec exists, if it does it will include it, if it 
doesnt it will echo that other crap. This isnt too safe, cause php doesnt use virtual 
directories... / is not DocumentRoot, it is your hard drive root. So if someone was 
to index.php?sec=/etc/passwd things might get a bit tricky, but you get the idea. Now 
lets look at something a little better and more complex.

For each of these examples, you need a php script or HTML page containing the data 
you want. And another thing, .php scripts can contain HTML aslong as its not in php 
tags. This leads to another thing, you can be in the middle of PHP and break out of 
it and throw in HTML. Here is our next example:

<?php
// This is index.php
if($sec == "pr0n") { include("pr0n/setuptheporn.php"); }
elseif($sec == "images") { include("images/images.php"); }
elseif($sec == "mp3") { include("mp3/mp3.php"); }
elseif($sec == "logs") { include("logs/logs.php"); }
else {
?>
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>b0g</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
WHATS UP IT SEEMS YOU DIDNT HIT SHIT, SO UHH YEAH, CHECK IT OUT
IF YOU WANT TO SEE OUR MAD PRON, GO TO:
http://www.b0g.org/index.php?sec=pr0n and pr0n/pr0n.php will be displayed for you
now im gona thor php back up and finish my else tag, so wham.
<?php
     }
// END OF THE REDIRECT STUFF
?>

That should be easy enough cause its laid out like that. The scripts checks to see i 
$sec is equal to "pr0n" if it is, the script includes pr0n/pr0n.php. It did the same 
for all of those, and if in the end $sec didnt match up, or was null, it would 
display the default stuff for the index page in an HTML breakout, then it picked up 
the end. You may ned to put an exit(0); after the includes to end the current script 
if you have anything AFTER the else, or it will include the page, then do whatever is 
down below.

That script puts your HTML right in the script, you may want to include it to be more 
organized or whatever. IT also puts the default HTML for no sec, and also any sec 
that doesnt match. You may want to display an error if they try something sneaky. Try 
this.


<?php
if(isset($sec))
{
// This is the stuff we display if they have a ?sec=something
if($sec == "pr0n") { include("pr0n/setuptheporn.php"); }
elseif($sec == "images") { include("images/images.php"); }
elseif($sec == "mp3") { include("mp3/mp3.php"); }
elseif($sec == "logs") { include("logs/logs.php"); }
else { echo "We do not have a section named $sec, please try again."; }
// That is the end, now we will show the index page
// because no $sec was even attempted
}else{
include("index2.php");
}
?>

The next thing is require. Require acts just like include, but require will stop the 
whole thing if it cant be done, it is requires shit works out or stuff gets screwed. 
This is good for things like including mandentory scripts or something...include will 
not halt the program, it will just pass over.



Uhh i did so much writing and nothing got done but yeah. Check out php.net and like 
plebian.com for max script by the tressmaster.

HOW TO KEEP A HEALTHY LEVEL OF INSANITY IN THE WORKPLACE

 

Page yourself over the intercom. (Don't disguise your voice.)

Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits.  Always
wear them one day after your boss does. (This is especially effective if
your boss is a different gender than you are.)

Make up nicknames for all your coworkers and refer to them only by these
names. "That's a good point, Sparky."   "No I'm sorry I'm going to have
to disagree with you there, Chachi."

Send email to the rest of the company telling them what you're doing.
For example "If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom."

"Hi-lite" your shoes. Tell people that you haven't lost your shoes since
you did this.

While sitting at your desk, soak your fingers in "Palmolive."

Put up mosquito netting around your cubicle.

Put a chair facing a printer, sit there all day and tell people you're
waiting for your document.

Arrive at a meeting late, say you're sorry, but you didn't have time for
lunch, and you're going to be nibbling during the meeting. During the
meeting eat 5 entire raw potatoes.

Insist that your e-mail address be
"zena_goddess_of_fire@companyname.com"

Every time someone asks you to do something, ask them if they want fries
with that.

Send email to yourself engaging yourself in an intelligent debate about
the direction of one of your company's products. Forward the mail to a
co-worker and ask her to settle the disagreement.

Suggest that beer be put in the soda machine.

Put your garbage can on your desk. Label it "IN."

Determine how many cups of coffee is "too many."

Develop an unnatural fear of staplers.


For a relaxing break, get away from it all with a mask and snorkel in
the fish tank. If no one notices, take out your snorkel and see how many
you can catch in your mouth.

Send e-mail messages saying free pizza, free donuts etc... in the
lunchroom, when people complain that there was none... Just lean back,
pat your stomach, and say, "Oh you've got to be faster than that."




OFFICE LANGUAGE

It has been brought to management's attention that some individuals throughout the 
company have been using foul language during the course of normal conversation with 
their co-workers. Due to complaints received from some employees who may be easily 
offended, this type of language will be no longer be tolerated. We do however, 
realize the critical importance of being able to accurately express your feelings 
when communicating with co-workers. 

Therefore, a list of "TRY SAYING" new phrases has been provided so that proper 
exchange of ideas and information can continue in an effective manner without risk of 
offending our more sensitive employees. 

TRY SAYING:

INSTEAD OF:
And when the fuck do you expect me to do this?

TRY SAYING:
I'm certain that isn't feasible.
INSTEAD OF:

        Be assured that you can be cured of your difficulty.  Many have been,
both male and female, and you can be also if you determine that it must be so.

        This determination is the first step.  That is where we begin.  You
must decide that you will end this practice, and when you make that decision,
the problem will be greatly reduced at once.

        But it must be more than a hope or a whish, more than knowing that it
is good for you.  It must be actually a DECISION.  If you truly make up your
mind that you will be cured, then you will have the strength to resist any
tendencies which you may have and any temptations which may come to you.

        After you have made this decision, then observe the following specific
guidelines:



                       A Guide to Self-Control:

    1.  Never touch the intimate parts of your body except during
        normal toilet processes.

    2.  Avoid being alone as much as possible.  Find good company
        and stay in this good company.

    3.  If you are associated with other persons having this same
        problem, YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP.  Never
        associate with other people having the same weakness.  Don't
        suppose that two of you will quit together, you never will.
        You must get away from people of that kind.  Just to be in
        their presence will keep your problem foremost in your mind.
        The problem must be taken OUT OF YOUR MIND for that is where
        it really exists.  Your mind must be on other and more
        wholesome things. 


    4.  When you bathe, do not admire yourself in a mirror.  Never
        stay in the bath more than five or six minutes -- just long
        enough to bathe and dry and dress AND THEN GET OUT OF THE
        BATHROOM into a room where you will have some member of your
        family present.

    5.  When in bed, if that is where you have your problem for the
        most part, dress yourself for the night so securely that you
        cannot easily touch your vital parts, and so that it would
        be difficult and time consuming for you to remove those
        clothes.  By the time you started to remove protective
        clothing you would have sufficiently controlled your
        thinking that the temptation would leave you.

    6.  If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed,
        GET OUT OF BED AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND FIX YOURSELF A
        SNACK, even if it is in the middle of the night, and even if
        you are not hungry, and despite your fears of gaining
        weight.  The purpose behind this suggestion is that you GET
        YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE.  You are the subject of your
        thoughts, so to speak.

    7.  Never read pornographic material.  Never read about your
        problem.  Keep it out of mind.  Remember -- "First a
        thought, then an act."
                The thought pattern must be changed.  You must not
        allow this problem to remain in your mid.  When you
        accomplish that, you soon will be free of the act.

    8.  Put wholesome thoughts into your mind at all times.  Read
        good books -- Church books -- Scriptures -- Sermons of the
        Brethern [sic, Cistern too?].  Make a daily habit of reading
        at least one chapter of Scripture, preferably from one of the
        four Gospels in the New Testament, or the Book of Mormon.  The
        four Gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- above
        anything else in the Bible can be helpful because of their
        uplifting qualities.

    9.  Pray.  But when you pray, don't pray about this problem, for
        that will tend to keep [it] in your mind more than ever.  Pray
        for faith, pray for understanding of the Scriptures, pray
        for the Missionaries, the General Authorities, your friends,
        your families, BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT
        MENTIONING IT EVER -- NOT IN CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS, NOT
        IN YOUR PRAYERS.  KEEP IT _OUT_ of your mind!



        The attitude of a person toward his problem has an affect [sic] on how
easy it is to overcome.  It is essential that a firm commitment be made to
control the habit.  As a person understands his reasons for the behavior, and
is sensitive to the conditions or situations that may trigger a desire for the
act, he develops the power to control it.

        We are taught that our bodies are temples of God, and are to be clean
so that the Holy Ghost may dwell within us.  Masturbation is a sinful habit
that robs one of the Spirit and creates guilt and emotional stress.  It is not
physically harmful unless practiced in the extreme. It is a habit that is
totally self-centered, and secretive, and in no way expresses the proper use of
the procreative power given to man to fulfill eternal purposes.  It therefore
separates a person from God and defeats the gospel plan.

        This self-gratifying activity will cause one to lose his self-respect
testimony becomes weak, and missionary work and other Church callings become
burdensome, offerins.

        To help in planning an effective program to overcome the problem a
brieation is given of how the reproductive organs in a young man function.

        The testes in your body are continually producing hundreds of millions
of reproductive cells call _spermatozoa_.  These are moved up a tube called the
_vas deferens_ to a place called the _ampulla_ where they are mixed with fluids
from two membranous pouches called _seminal vesicles_ and the _prostate gland_.
 The resultant fluid is calleeminal vesicles are full a signa to the _central
nervous system_ indicating they are ready to benother, depending on such
thingsexercise, state of health, etc. everal times a week, for others
        It is normal for the vesicles to be emptied occasionally at night
durise the emptying come from the cetral nervous system. Often an erotic dream
is experienced at the same time, and is a part of this normal process. nstead
ourse, the reproductive system is operating at a more rapid pace, trying to
keep up with the loss of semen.  When he stops the habit, the body will
continue to produce ahis increased rate, for an indefese are not harmful and
are to be endured until the normal central nervous system pathway of rel

       As one meets with his Priesthood Leader, a program for overcoming
masturbation can be implemented using some of t Remember it is essential that a
regur report program be agreed on, so progress can be recognized and failures
understood and eliminated.


                             Suggestions:

    1.  Pray daily, ask for the gifts of the Spirit, that which will
        strengthen you against temptation.  Pray fervently and out
        lout when the temptations are the strongest.

    2.  Follow a program of vigorous daily exercise.  The exercises
        reduce emotional tension and depression and are absolutely
        basic to the solution of this problem.  Double your physical
        activity when you feel stress increasing.

    3.  When the temptation to masturbate is strong, yell _STOP_ to
        those thoughts as loudly as you can in your mind and then
        recite a prechosen Scripture or sing an inspirational hymn.
        It is important to turn your thoughts away from the selfish
        need to indulge.

    4.  Set goals of abstinence, begin with a day, then a week,
        month, year and finally commit to never doing it again.
        Until you commit yourself to _never again_ you will always be
        open to temptation.

    5.  Change in behavior and attitude is most easily achieved
        through a changed self-image.  Spend time every day
        imagining yourself strong and in control, easily overcoming
        tempting situations.

    6.  Begin to work daily on a self-improvement program.  Relate
        this plan to improving your Church service, to improving your
        relationships with your family, God and others.  Strive to
        enhance your strengths and talents.

    7.  Be outgoing and friendly.  Force yourself to be with others
        and learn to enjoy working and talking to them.  Use
        principles of developing friendships found in books such as
        _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ by Dale Carnegie.

    8.  Be aware of situations that depress you or that cause you to
        feel lonely, bored, frustrated or discouraged.  These
        emotional states can trigger the desire to masturbate as a
        way of escape.  Plan in advance to counter these low periods
        through various activities, such as reading a book, visiting
        a friend, doing something athletic, etc.

    9.  Make a pocket calendar for a month on a small card.  Carry
        it with you, but show it to no one.  If you have a lapse of
        self control, color the day black.  Your goal will be to
        have _no black days_.   The calendar becomes a strong visual
        reminder of self control and should be looked at when you
        are tempted to add another black day.  Keep your calendar up
        until you have at least three clear months.

   10.  A careful study will indicate you have had the problem at
        certain times and under certain conditions.  Try and recall,
        in detail, what your particular times and conditions were.
        Now that you understand how it happens, plan to break the
        pattern through counter activities.

   11.  In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective
        technique called _aversion therapy_.  When we associate
        or think of something very distasteful with something which has
        been pleasurable, but undesirable, the distasteful thought
        and feeling will begin to cancel out that which was
        pleasurable.  If you associate something very distasteful
        with your loss of self-control it will help you to stop the
        act.  For example, if you are tempted to masturbate, think
        of having to bathe in a tub of worms, and eat several of
        them as you do the act.

   12.  During your toileting and shower activities leave the
        bathroom door or shower curtain partly open, to discourage
        being alone in total privacy.  Take cool brief showers.

   13.  Arise immediately in the mornings.  Do not lie in bed awake,
        no matter what time of day it is.  Get up and do something.
        Start each day with an enthusiastic activity.

   14.  Keep your bladder empty.  Refrain from drinking large
        amounts of fluids before retiring.

   15.  Reduce the amount of spices and condiments in your food.
        Eat as lightly as possible at night.

   16.  Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose and 

        not binding.

   17.  Avoid people, situations, pictures or reading materials that
        might create sexual excitement.

   18.  It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use
        in overcoming this problem.  A Book of Mormon, firmly held in
        hand, even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme
        cases.

   19.  In very severe cases it may be necessary to tie a hand to
        the bed frame with a tie in order that the habit of
        masturbating in a semi-sleep condition can be broken.  This
        can also be accomplished by wearing several layers of
        clothing which would be difficult to remove while half
        asleep.

   20.  Set up a reward system for your successes.  It does not have
        to be a big reward.  A quarter in a receptacle each time you
        overcome or reach a goal.  Spend it on something which
        delights you and will be a continuing reminder of your
        progress.

   21.  Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude
        patterns which were part of your problem.  _Satan Never Gives
        Up_.  Be calmly and confidently on guard.  Keep a positive
        mental attitude.  You can win this fight!  The joy and
        strength you will feel when you do will give your whole life
        a radiant and spiritual glow of satisfaction and fulfillment.

[15:. - [ Ugly Chick's Guide To Getting A Man ]         [begezze] :. ]
 ____________________________________________________________________


Ok, begezze's guide for ugly chicks to get guys.  This should be simple, I am a
guy and have had my fair share of ugly chicks.  Many of these methods have not
been tested .. but they would work on me, so I am pretty sure they would work
for most guys.  There are a few factors that will change the outcome of this.
If you are very, very fat you will only be able to give head, guys don't like
screwing fat chicks.  If you are very unpopular some guys will not even talk to
you, this is because they are idiots and judge people on that crap.  If you
have alot of friends and talk to them and spread rumors this is a BAD THING.
I'd much rather screw an ugly chick with no friends who isn't going to tell
anyone about it than the town gossip telling everyone exactly what happened.
A guy will pretty much screw anything if they know that no one else will ever
hear about it.

With these things in mind here are some ways even the ugliest of girls can have
a chance of scoring with an average guy.  Do things guys like.  Drink beer,
watch sports, listen to the same kind of music as them, know computers, talk
about sex, and just hang out.  A girl who drinks beer is awesome in my eyes, I
don't know why they are.. but they are. Also, if you drink you can tell the guy
you want "hey, I got some beer over at my house, lets go drink it."  If you
think this won't work, you are wrong.  Guys will go after any free beer
possible.  Girls get free beer all the time, so it's no big deal to them, but
if a guy gets free beer he's gonna go after it!  Also, when a guy is drunk he
will screw anything.. anything.  Don't get the guy too drunk though, they won't
be able to get hard and they will just sit there semi-passed out (not fun for
you).  Just keep talking about sex and talking about sex and how you like to
have sex and that you think he is sexy and you'd like feel his cock.  Girls
don't like it when you say "let me see your cooter", but a guy will let you
see his cock if you flash him or if you play a game with him.  Try playing this
 little game, it's called "nerves".  What you do is you try to make the other
person nervous, when they are they lose.  So you like slowly feel his chest and
go down to his belt then slowly undo it.  You keep playing until you don't have
a shirt and he is feeling your boobs, or until you have his dick out and hard.
Just be a fucking slut.  Guys don't care when they are drunk or alone, sit on
his lap, tell him you love sex, tell him that your parents are gone for the
night.  Change into your night outfit.. dont' be in jeans or anything like that.
Or another sure thing is dance with him.  After 2 songs of grinding he'll want
you for sure.

Now if the one night stand thing doesn't work out you can try to slowly get him
to like you.  This is more complicated and pretty much depends on luck.  Where
as the other one is totally guaranteed.  But as I said earlier be into the same
things he is.  I once hated a girl and thought she was annoying.  Then she came
and talked to me about a band I liked and said that she just installed linux
and needed some help.  After like a week of talking to her about stuff I liked
I thought she was cool.  Of course she wasn't bad looking, but even if she was
I would have got with her just because she was so cool and she said anytime I
wanted a blow job I could have one.  This is key, give out blow jobs.  No
matter how ugly you are if you give blow jobs like a crazied druggy you'll get
the guy you want.. no matter how ugly you are.

Also another technique that seems to work is to let him see you all the time
for like a week, then stay away from him for awhile (2 weeks).  He will think
about you and when you think of things in the past they are always better than
they really were.  Also he will probably be like "I could be fucking her right
now.. damnit, why didn't I do it when I had the chance."  So like the next time
you see him you could get him no problem.  JUST BE SLUTTY WITH HIM.

So in conclusion, even the ugliest chicks can get a guy by doing the following:
beer alone at your house, liking the same things he does, be interested in him,
don't be into silly girl things like cheerleading or your nails, don't be stuck
up, have cool hair, be fucking crazy (but not a psycho), don't be slow and
romantic and kissy kissy, and the number one thing:  BE VERY SLUTTY WITH HIM!!!

Hope some girl is getting some from the man of her dreams because of this
article.  (note: the guy might not want to sleep with you more than once.. don't
be a bitch and freak out and cry or anything)

If you want to be a girlfriend to this guy.. be nice all the time, don't cry
over everything, cook good food, give lots of back rubs, give lots of blow jobs,
and read b0g!!@#@!

 ____________________________________________________________________



When you are forced to spend most of your life in solidarity, either because you are 
a freak of nature, antisocial or an uberleet hax0r like myself, you sometimes 
discover that you can go to extremes to gain sexual experiences. These are some of 
the tricks that I use instead of the actual act.

The first trick is as simple as it is fun. The only bad thing about it is that you 
seldom get enough sexual contact to actually reach orgasm, but then again you get 
some pretty good jackoff material so save those moments for your mental pr0n playback 
for all those lonely nights. 

        The handicap trick

For this trick you need scissors or a sharp knife, bandage or some sort of leet 
disguise and a worthless pair of pants. Use the scissors to completely remove at 
least two thirds of one of your front pockets. It’s a good idea to choose the one 
your penis has a tendency to lean towards. 
When the pants are ready take off your underwear and put on your new leet hax0r 
pants.
Then put some money in your undamaged pocket.
Now comes the tricky part. The key to success is faking a serious injury to both your 
hands. Wear them in folds and have them dangle helplessly or just bandage the hell 
out of your hands.
When that’s done leave your house and go to the desired destination.
For this example I’ll use the cinema. You can really strike gold at malls because 
they tend to have hot chicks working in at least 20% of the stores. 

Now, if at the cinema simply get in line in a both that has a really hot chick in it. 
When it’s your turn simply fake a blush and act shy and ashamed. Tell her that you 
can’t use your hands and your ticket is in your pants pocket.
Be sure to indicate that the ticket is in the bottomless pocket!
This trick has a tendency to be most likely to succeed when being pulled off at older 
ladies because they feel this motherly thing and because they tend to be more 
helpful. If she refuses just yell at her and demand to see the manager or something. 
If she actually gets the manager then just make a minor scene and walk out of there 
and look around for a new target.
Now if she does reach for your ticket she’s going to be in for a surprise!@
The look on her face when she realizes that her hand is actually groping your penis 
is priceless.
Run before she calls security.



        The fly trick

The tricky part about this trick is to get a live fly. Snatch the fattest fly you can 
find and put it in a jar or something. if your lucky just get as many flies as you 
manage to get.
Now get ready for a nice bath!
Get nekkid and fill the tub, lie in it and relax until you’re comfortable and ready 
for some loving.
Now take the fly and gently tear its wings off. Try not to make any lethal damage to 
it.

When that’s done simply elevate the head of your erected penis above water so that 
the entire head of it is up above water. Take the fly and place it on your penis. 
Close your eyes and enjoy as it walks around desperately searching for an escape.


        Fun with fruits

Since im straight im going to talk about fruit that you can penetrate and not fruit 
that penetrates you, you sick fucker!
The best fruit for sexual joy are in my opinion the orange.
The only thing about them that sucks is the fact that they contain acid that burn 
your penis pretty bad.
To overcome this, simply boil the orange gently in water. When that’s done you can 
penetrate it all you want!


        Picking up chicks that work at the mall

Now if you’re at an actual store this is much easier but a bit more embarrassing. 
Especially if the chick is someone you would like to date but you are too shy to ask 
her. Walk in and seize her when she’s available. Tell her that you can’t use your 
hands and ask if she can walk around the store with you for a bit and help you carry 
the shit you’re going buy. If it’s slow at the moment she’ll be forced to do so. 
Now since it’s a uberhot chick you want to get jiggy with see if you can get some 
sympathy out of her. It’s pretty easy to start a casual conversation with even the 
hottest chick if you follow this approach. Ask her stuff about whatever you’re 
pretending to buy, try to make small talk. Smile at her and if she’s smiling back at 
you that’s a really good sign. Now, if she asks you how you hurt your hands just say 
you did a 960 backflip ninja ollie or something. Don’t say they’re strained because 
you irc too much. Now its time to make a choice. If things are going well and she’s 
actually talking to you and being nice and helpful its time to move for plan B. If 
she’s being ignorant and mean then go for it. Move to the counter, have her type the 
shit up and when she says how much it is you do the embarrassing “I cant use my hands 
my money is in my pockets” routine. Now if she smiles wickedly to you while she’s 
going for your pockets immediately go for plan B. If not then just lean back and 
enjoy as her fleshy palm have a close encounter with your mighty penis. When she 
shrieks and pulls her hand in disgust yell “OWNED!%# ” then make a run for it before 
she calls security. 

However if she’s actually being genuinely nice and you think you can actually make a 
move on her then go for plan B, which is as follows:

Go to the counter, have her type it all up then direct her to the pocket that 
contains the money.
I’m sure you can take it from here.



Thanks to bored for testing, proof reading, and a trick or two.

FROM THE AUTHOR OF "MASTURBATING WITH LIZARDS"
AND "SHOULD I STICK IT IN MY ASS"


CHAPTER 1 "FURNITURE SEX IS NATURAL, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF K-RAD-BOB"

Ever get those urges? You are just watching tv and BOOM, it hits
you. That desire of mating begins to swell in your testicles.
Your body begins to sink into the recliner as your mind begins
to wonder "Should I masturbate or fuck the dog again?". Your
hand begins to impulsively undo your pants and grab your
rock-hard penis, what next? Suddenly a primitive urge springs 
into your mind (and penis) and you tell yourself, "I'm going to
fuck the recliner and I'm going to down it NOW". Without any
delay you quickly stand up and straddle the recliner. You fuck
that recliner until it doesn't recline any more. If this is
your life, than this -free- text file is just right for you!
Continue reading, what are you waiting for???

CHAPTER 2 "THERE ARE SO MANY, WHICH ONE SHOULD I CHOOSE?"

Nowadays, just about every civilized human being has some sort
of furniture in their house. Be it a leather couch, a recliner, 
a desk, a coffee table, night stand, or a dinner table. If you 
are still living a Neanderthal lifestyle and you don't have any
furniture in your "dwelling", then I would suggest chopping off
your genitals with a fork so you don't make the mistake of
reproducing. Now with that said, I would suggest that you pick
out a piece of furniture that you find attractive, even if 
it's interracial. (Your white and the chair is black). Your
second step would be to "grease it up", so rub some lotion 
all your genitals (KY and Vaseline work too). Putting a limp
penis into a recliner or sofa could possibly give your penis 
some rug burn, so be careful. You don't want to have to explain 
to your doctor why your penis is suddenly missing it's foreskin.
Now find a visible crack where the chair or sofa comes together.
Carefully slide your manhood into the crack, it will feel
tight at first because the chair/sofa is probably a virgin.
Make sure to slide your penis into the crack slowly, yet
firmly and be aware of rogue wood or metals within the chair's
seaming. Now simulating a fucking motion with your hips.
If you are approaching orgasm, speed up your thrusts.
REMEMBER, you don't have to pull out! Go ahead and shoot
your wad into the chair or sofa and enjoy it! If you aren't
approaching orgasm, than KEEP TRYING SOLDIER!

CHAPTER 3 "OMG SONIK, YOU ARE MY HERO... THAT WAS GREAT! WHAT NEXT?"

Now pull your love tool out of the piece of furniture. 
House guests and friend's would probably be grossed out if
white stains were found all over the furniture, so be sure
to clean it up effectively! The "oh sorry, I spilt some milk
there last night" routine only works once, so use it wisely!

CHAPTER 4 "WHAT IF MY FRIENDS DON'T BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT MILK STORY?"

Then your friends must be very smart, or they might have read
this text file themselves. If you sense that they are aware of
your elaborate furniture sex scheme, ask them to join you. 
However, if you think they wouldn't be interested, tell them
that Halle Berry came over to your house and wanted to tell
you about operation SWORDFISH. Tell your gullible friends that
she got completely naked and ordered you to have sex with her
before she explained the operation, and during the heat of the
moment, Halle Berry started leaking cum out of her pussy, 
hence the stains. Your friends should go "Wow <name here>, 
you are fucking cool", and since it was a hot bitch, they 
won't mind sitting on top of it. If they don't believe it,
RUN REALLY FAST. This story only works once or twice. Use hot
women like Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera.
If you are under 18, say some trendy bitch like Mandy Moore.

CHAPTER 5 "DOES THE b0g.org CREW HAVE SEX WITH FURNITURE?"

Yes, indeed they do. I attempted to ask a b0g.org chatter
their opinions about this controversial issue, and this is the
reply I received: <phyrewyre> HI IM A BASTARD FUCK - Thus,
proving that the b0g.org crew mates with furniture! More proof: 
<k-rad-bob> i rubbed bodylotion all over myself yesterday 
<k-rad-bob> then i had sex with my leather coutch
Need I say more?

CHAPTER 6 "SONIK, DO YOU HAVE SEX WITH FURNITURE?"

Yes, but I prefer masturbating with DOGS LEGS and other bizarre 
ANAL TOOLERY. (quoted) Thank you for your concern.

 ____________________________________________________________________



Welcome.. or as we say in German "Velcummmue".  After sitting in the #b0g chatroom 
for many hours watching the natives swear and 
curse about people from other countries I thought "self.. you should write an article 
that will help these morons learn a little 
bit about those other countries".  So that is what I shall do!

I will be teaching German.  I know you might think it is hard to teach german in only 
6 short paragraphs, but if hitler could 
do it, so can I!  By the end of this article you will not only appreciate Germany as 
a culture but you'll also be able to make 
fun of your friends without them knowing.  Example:

-:- GecKo_ [~rair@visp172-26.visp.co.nz] has joined #b0g
<b0ilmatic> Valis tucki GibbUrios GecKo_ !!
<GecKo_> ok loser
<b0ilmatic> HAHA, I just called you a flaming dog shit in German.. had you known the 
German language you could have responded with a better insult.

now "Valis tucki GibbUrios" does not mean flaming dog shit.. but GecKo_ doesn't know 
german, so it doesn't really matter what 
Valis tucki GibbUrios means does it?  DOES IT!?!@?!  Now I am already tired of 
teaching you all the german I know, so I'll 
pass this part on to xhaze to help teach you common German words you may or may not 
know from your old and dying Grandparents:

<b0iler> xhaze: what does Dampfkessel mean?  you are german right?
<xhaze> GERMAN? OF COURSE I AM YOU FUK
<xhaze> Dampfkessel are tassles that big tittied butch strippers wear man!
<b0iler> really?  my german grampa said he used Dampfkessels in the war.  he sure is 
a strange old man.
<b0iler> is it normal for german solders to wear Dampfkessels?
<xhaze> ohhhh those Dampfkessels !!!
<xhaze> Dampfkessels are session of satan, where they get possessed and shit
<xhaze> the germans used it a lot in the war, thats where they got their balls from
<b0iler> hilter used Dampfkessels to mind trick people into worshiping him and his 
brother olli?
<xhaze> as they taught me in german school, olli used this power for bad, and seduced 
young boys.
<xhaze> as hitler used it for good.that was his down fall.
<b0iler> oh

as you can see.. germans not only know about german words but also alot about german 
history!  Remember this as you can use 
german people online to help cheat on homework.  I would suggest asking xhaze since 
he seems to have alot of answers about 
germany's past (<xhaze> and this is how hilter and olli's mechanical clone won the 
world war 4).  Now time for more german 
fun.

To say "b0g is better than a roll of paper" use this german phrase:
das es good.

To say "b0g!@#" use this:
motherfuckingb0ginthehizzzouse!!!!!

see how german is so much like English?  so close infact that scientists have been 
researching for years to see if hilter 
actually did steal English during world war 4.  Last I heard there was inconclusive 
evidence to prove this theory.. but 
since they found the remains of hilter's body in the trunk of a new jersey man's car 
last wednesday I think the case may be 
revived!  Well Mr. Hitler.. just to prove you aren't  so smart to think up the german 
language here is an example of how 
smart #b0g is:

<b0iler> malkav: make up a german word pls.
<malkav> deulerscheusen
<b0iler> and what does this word mean?
<malkav> a building where one would eat fecal matter

The End.  This article has taught much to many people, I just hope you send your 
emails to me in German so that you get 
practice and I can easily delete them by looking at their subject.  Until next time, 
this is b0iler saying "das es 
unchatchen bu la crachen".

here is an 0day exploit for crossword puzzles:
go to edit->find or press ctrl+f and type in the word you are looking for.
You will find it!#$^#$!@@# .. unless the word is backwards or horizontal, but
I wasn't smart enough to make them backwards or horizontal :D  Also another
0day: I left out the last word.. har har har, hope you read this before trying
the puzzle.

<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ops
<cf> i heard you were turning into a hacker tho
<cf> with that baddass ping command
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> well, I just wanna learn
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> experimenting is good
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> and I was glad
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I used m3th as my genie pig
<cf> YOU PING'D M3TH?!
<cf> oh man
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> yeah, that was a mistake
<cf> i hope for your sake he doesn't find out
<cf> that seriously fucks up their computer dude
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> why does every1 fear him?
<cf> because he's powerful
<cf> !
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> What do you mean
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I don't understand
<cf> i just hope
<cf> he doesn't find out it was you
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I think he already knows
<cf> oh shit!!@
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> why
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> what can he do?
<cf> dude
<cf> he's gonna kill you
<cf> he'll crash your computer like that!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> really?
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I guess I'll have to say sorry
<cf> too late!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> cf
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> teach me something
<cf> i can't
<cf> you'll just abuse it
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> no
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I promise I wont
<cf> no
<cf> you've done too much damage already
<cf> i can't risk further damage
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> no, I swear I wont
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I'm jsut a guy who wants to learn
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> that's all
<cf> how do i know?
<cf> i've got no way to know what you can do
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> well, I didn't know ping is dangerous
<cf> yes
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> trust me
<cf> and now you have to learn the hard way
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> please don't experiment from me
<cf> anyway
<cf> i can't teach you anything more
<cf> you can take out the entire internet with the ping command!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> one thing
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> really
<cf> yea
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I didn't know that
<cf> its really bad
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I'm new to linux
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> so..
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> don't think I'm some kinda pro
-> [Halfbreed_Harroldson] VERSION
<cf> ...
<cf> [04:52 am] <Halfbreed_Harroldson> VERSION mIRC32 v5.7 K.Mardam-Bey
<cf> you're not using linux retard.
<cf> mirc is windows.
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I'm not
<cf> *slap*
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I'm not using linux
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> But I use it at my friends
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> how did you know that?
<cf> i am all seeing.
<cf> and all knowing.
<cf> i am the internet.
<cf> do you want to know...
<cf> what the matrix is?
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> yeah
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> pls
<cf> i can only show you the door.
<cf> you must walk through it.
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok
<cf> i will teach you one command
<cf> and one command only
<cf> it's a dangerous program
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok thanx
<cf> but if you wish to learn
<cf> i can teach you
<cf> this is like
<cf> ten times worse than ping
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok, tell me than
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> then
<cf> the command is pong
<cf> instead of ping
<cf> if you get caught using this
<cf> YOU DID NOT LEARN IT FROM ME
<cf> ..!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I won't
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok
<cf> the way you use it is
<cf> /ctcp <nickname you want to fuck up> pong
<cf> for example
<cf> /ctcp cf pong
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> yeah?
<cf> i've got a pong protector
<cf> so you can try it on me
<cf> but be careful
<cf> the internet police watch for this kind of thing!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> what exactly does it do?
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> really?
<cf> it reroutes depacketized information through the distributor vortex, causing a 
ion chain overflow
<cf> my pong protector only guards against one pong though
<cf> so you can only do it once
<cf> ok?
<cf> more than one pong would completely destroy my computer
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> english pls
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> is that so?
<cf> yes!
<cf> its a powerful command!
<cf> so only use it once on me
<cf> i wouldn't be able to withstand more than that
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok, can I try now
<cf> yes
<cf> Just once!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok, so I type /ctcp cf pong?
<cf> yes
<cf> once!
<cf> no more than that!
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> ok, but please don't reflect it back to me
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> I'm not protected
<Halfbreed_Harroldson> hello
<cf> yes

        Some words from the editor
        
Hi.
I'm sick of editing.
Don’t let me wait another 11 months before throwing together an issue.
Write articles, and email them to me. How hard is that?

Thanks to those who did just that. And thank you, dear reader, for reading.

Until next time. 
Hacking, drugs, and naked people.
