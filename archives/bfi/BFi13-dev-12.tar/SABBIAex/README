SABBIA example,

This software acts as anonymizer for low latency connections, it works making a
continuos and costant padding over the net. the security of this anonymous
network relies on the presence of a lot of clients, any client appears to 
have the same amount of traffic with the core and this "always the same and for
anyone" traffic, hide the connections. this is only a testing implementation of
this security continuos padding system. this is a proof of concept about the 
technique described at http://www.s0ftpj.org and BFi zine/article at
http://bfi.s0ftpj.org, this code is published with the BFi special issue
released for MOCA (http://moca.olografix.org). you can find more codes,
analysis and illines at http://www.s0ftpj.org, a deep explaination is included
in the article published at s0ftpj.org, if for some reason you could not find
this article translated on our site, try to search google with this keyword:

"vecna SABBIA low latency anonymous".

this software requires openvpn installed and root access 
(or capability to open tun/tap device!) to run.

this software is an EXAMPLE, a SIMPLE PROOF OF CONCEPT and MUST NOT BE
USED FOR SERIOUS ANONYMOUS NETWORKING.
