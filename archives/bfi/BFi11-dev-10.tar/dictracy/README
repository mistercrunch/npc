The Dictracy LKM is a tool to investigate/dump/modifiy/search arbitrary memory
of a process running over a linux box.
Its code has been part of the article "Linux Virtual Memory Tripping" written originally for BFi e-zine (www.s0ftpj.org/bfi/) and that you can find (in Italian) inside dictracy package (lvmt.txt).
This package contains : 

  -- dictracy.c    -   The code of the LKM
  -- memdig.c      -   The userspace interface to dictracy module
  -- saled.c       -   Application of module : simple disassembler
  -- fakeflow.c    -   Application of module : change program flow
  -- lvmt.txt      -   The article (in Italian) the code has been part of 
                       (It can be useful also to not italian people willing to 
                        have some examples of use of codes... a more detailed
                        README is on TODO list :) )
  -- parse.s       -   Asmcodes to call syscalls exported by dictracy
  -- dictracy.h    -   Declares a struct to pass data from module to userspace 
  -- Makefile      -   Quite self-explanatory, isn't it ? :)
  -- README        -   Even more self-explanatory :)  

Inside package there's also "libdisasm_src_mod-0.16.tgz", this is a slightly modified version of the libdisasm (part of bastard project - bastard.sourceforge.net) that, at the moment of release of dictracy, isn't online on official site.
I want to thank here mammon_ for his disponibility in discussing some implementation and implementing them in a really little time, making possible to concentrate over dictracy.
Probably you'll find the "modified" new libdisasm soon on bastard official page, and that will become the "official" libdisasm :)

fakeflow.c is just a demostrative code, so it hasn't a nice and confortable interface to make handy his use (you'll have mostly to change values inside .c code to adapt it to your situation... check the article for more info or just wait... a better version is on TODO list too :) ). 

As usual bugs and bugfixes, comments, feedback, suggestion and everything linked to the project is wellcome.
