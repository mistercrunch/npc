[Editorial]======================================================[Digital Ebola]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ahh.. I put together almost half of this issue before thinking of a proper 
editorial for KV12. I am slipping in my old age... Lets see, the date 
of this editorials writing is 7-27-2002, it has been a LONG time since we 
released a Keen Veracity, and alot has happened. Lots of new legislation, 
lots of new antics by the RIAA and the MPAA.. now they seem to want a law 
that allows them to hack into your computer if they suspect you of pirating..
Stranger things have happened, but laughable all the same...

Hmmm.. okay, let's be controversial. Right now, the way I see things, is there
is a war in the "underground". On one side of the house, we have these 
so-called "whitehat" hackers. And on the otherside, we have these so called 
"blackhat" hackers. Basically, the blackhats are hacking the shit out of the 
whitehats, saying that the whitehats have soldout. 

This in its self is quite laughable. 

From what I see, the blackhats actually moonlight as whitehats. Alot of them
do it for free, its their passion.. but they also do the same things for a
living... no they may not be so apt to whore for attention on bugtraq, or 
whatever, but they are working in security all the same. At this point, its
no longer a war with blackhat vs whitehat; rather its a "calling out" - 
the whores are being called out, some are shown for their actual skillsets,
some are being shown in lies, and all skeletons are out of the closet. 

Some anarchy is always good for progress. 

Is this still what it seems? Maybe.. maybe not. Let me change subjects for 
a second... One of the many written gripes I have seen among the "underground"
is that the security industry is driven by the script kiddies and the security
companies... Yes, I would have to agree here. This is something akin to 
the window guy in NYC who had bad business, so he went down 5th avenue breaking
out windows... Integrity in the industry is often questionable, and it has 
nothing to do with a background check, or who the person knows.. 

It's all about the Benjamins baby. 

Selling out is NOT doing what you love  for a living. Selling out is NOT 
publishing you work. Selling out is NOT putting your all into your 
hobbie/profession; your heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears. 

No. Selling out is craving attention so bad, that you will sit down and 
write a "killer virus" - and then release it a couple weeks later... and 
THEN, "discover" it.  THAT is selling out. I am not talking about just 
individules here.. but entire security companies... 

Selling out is discrediting your competitors thru illegal means so your 
company can get a piece of the pie. When a company issues "hits" against
key individules in a security organization in order to de-throne that 
organizations market share... THAT is selling out. 

Of course, all of these examples are pure fiction.. none of this really
happens... what was I talking about again? 

Oh.. I was getting ready to get on my OpenBSD rant. I love OpenBSD. Not
for its "security model" but rather because its compact BSD that runs on 
a sparc. The "security" is a added feature, that according to some 
sources in the "industry/underground" was never a feature at all. I know 
of people that have possessed bugs and exploits for the OS that were never 
published. I know people that have gotten flame emails for finding problems.
This is not security. This is madness. 

Let's get down to brass tacks. Everything can be hacked. Just because you say
you havent had a remote exploit in X amount of years, doesn't mean it is so.
Just because you say there isn't a problem, doesn't make it so. 

If you have a ego about it, you WILL be tested. You have to have complete
integrity, hold nothing back, and have full disclosure. There is nothing 
wrong about being wrong, but the minute you refuse to accept your error, 
you are worse then being wrong; you have lost integrity. 

So, I guess this issue's editorial is a little off the wall, pay no 
attention, it is just me blowing off steam. All that I ask of the reader 
is to not forget why we all got started playing this game in the first 
place; because we love the game, and we love technology. Blessed is the 
person that can be paid to do what they love. 

By the way, selling out, IS SACRIFICING FULL DISCLOSURE FOR THE ALMIGHTY
DOLLAR. 

With that mindless rant, I give you Keen Veracity 12. =)

P.S. We will see everyone at Defcon X, this one is sure to be interesting!

#20 BOTHA CRESCENT,
SADTON,JOHANNESBURG,
SOUTH AFRICA.
kingstown417@hotmail.com
Dear sir,

In order to transfer out (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars) from African
Development Bank. I have the courage to ask you to
look for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable for this important business believing that you
will never let me down either now or in future.

I am MR.kings town,the Chief auditor of African
Development Bank (ADB).
There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and
since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again.
After going through some old files in the records, I
discovered that if I do not remit this money out
urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas, a foreigner,
and a miner at kruger gold co., a geologist by
profession and he died since 1990. No other person
knows about this account or any thing concerning it,
the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that this company
does not know anything about this account and the
amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and twenty
six million United States Dollars million dollars.

I want to first transfer USDM twenty six million
United States Dollars from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner.
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can
only be approved to any foreign account because the
money is in us dollars and the former owner of the
account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas he is a foreigner too.

I know that this message will come to you as a
surprise as we don't know ourselves before. We will
sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a
genuine business.

I only got your contact address from my secretary
who operates computer, with believe in God that you
will never let me down in this business. You are the
only person that I have contacted in this business; so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take immediately.
Send also your private telephone and fax number
including the full details of the account to be used
for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or
sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that
you can receive this money into a foreign account or
any account of your choice where the fund will be
safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal
and sharing and other investments.

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner with foreign account and foreign
beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make
this work fine because the management is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you
later immediately, if you are able and with capability
to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust
according to my instructions and advice for our mutual
benefit because this opportunity will never come again
in my life. I need truthful person in this business
because I don't want to make mistake I need your
strong assurance and trust.

With my position now in the office I can transfer this
money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you
can provide with assurance that this money will be
intact pending my physical arrival in your country for
sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to
any place. You can also come to discuss with me face
to face after which I will make this remittance in
your presence and two of us will fly to your country
at least two days ahead of the money going into the
account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to effect legal approvals and onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and
foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply.
Yours truly,
kings town

Hi,
      
I am wondering where I could download ipsorc.1.0.tar.gz please ? as
I'm writing an automated tool for testing firewalls and am interested in
your packet generator. Its really nice that you have TTL :) My tool will
try and throw all sorts of variations on the firewall by default or the
administrator can choose what packets to form for the test. I am hoping
to compelety automate it, ie. to go from writing the security policy to
testing using a designed language, so it would be great to try out your
packet generator </thnx>

    o Changing the SSID requires communicating the change to all users of the network
    o Unfortunately, SSID is broadcasted in the clear


---> 4.2.6 IV (key) reuse <---
Lack of replay protection allows IV values to be reused Collisions made possible
by small  IV space  in WEP  Enables statistical  attack against ciphertexts with
replayed IVs

---> 4.2.7 Known plaintext attack <---
Lots of known plaintext in IP traffic:  ICMP, ARP, TCP ACK, etc. Can send  pings
from Internet through AP to snooping attacker Enables recovery of key stream  of
length N for a given IV [Arbaugh] Enables statistical attack and recovery of Key
with known IVs [Fluhrer]

---> 4.2.8 Partial known plaintext <---
May only  know a  portion of  the plaintext  (e.g. IP  header, SNAP) Possible to
recover M octets of the keystream,  M < N Statistical analysis of  plaintext and
IV shows keystream bias [Shamir] Statistical analysis of plaintext and IV allows
Key recovery [Fluhrer] Via  repeated probing, can extend  keystream from M to  N

    o Recovery of key stream for a given IV enables re-use

---> 4.2.11 Denial of service <---

---> 4.2.12 Dictionary attack <---

---> 4.2.13 Realtime decryption <---

---> 4.2.14 Passive Attack to Decrypt Traffic <---
The  first  attack  follows  directly  from  the  above  observation.  A passive
eavesdropper can intercept all wireless  traffic, until an IV collision  occurs.
By XORing two packets that use the same IV, the attacker obtains the XOR of  the
two plaintext messages. The  resulting XOR can be  used to infer data  about the
contents of the two messages. IP traffic is often very predictable and  includes
a lot of redundancy. This redundancy can be used to eliminate many possibilities
for the contents of messages.

---> 4.2.15 Active Attack to Inject Traffic <---
The following attack is also a  direct consequence of the problems described  in
the previous  section. Suppose  an attacker  knows the  exact plaintext  for one
encrypted message.  He can  use this  knowledge to  construct correct  encrypted
packets. The procedure involves constructing a new message, calculating the  CRC
-32, and performing bit  flips on the original  encrypted message to change  the
plaintext to the new message.  The basic property is that  RC4(X) xor X xor Y  =
RC4(Y).

---> 4.2.16 Active Attack from Both Ends <---
The previous  attack can  be extended  further to  decrypt arbitrary traffic. In
this case, the  attacker makes a  guess about not  the contents, but  rather the
headers of a packet. This information is usually quite easy to obtain or  guess;
in particular, all  that is necessary  to guess is  the destination IP  address.
Armed with this knowledge, the  attacker can flip appropriate bits  to transform
the  destination  IP  address to  send  the  packet to  a  machine  he controls,
somewhere in the Internet, and transmit it using a rogue mobile station.

---> 4.2.17 Table-based Attack <---
The small space of possible initialization vectors allows an attacker to build a
decryption table. Once he learns the  plaintext for some packet, he can  compute
the RC4 key  stream generated by  the IV used.  This key stream  can be used  to
decrypt all other  packets that use  the same IV.  Over time, perhaps  using the
techniques above, the attacker can build up a table of IVs and corresponding key
streams. This table requires a fairly  small amount of storage (~15GB); once  it
is built, the attacker can decrypt  every packet that is sent over  the wireless
link

[XMMS-Winamp How-To for Gentoo Linux]========[feach <blie@cylentkreationz.com> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok so you want to run Winamp plugins with XMMS on your Gentoo system?

First thing first.
If you do not have wine installed you will need to install it

# emerge --clean rsync;emerge wine

If you have a older version of wine then

# emerge --clean rsync;emerge -u wine

After thats all done,
You will need to download this plugin ( I am assuming you already have XMMS )

http://www.emulinks.de/xmms-winamp/xmms-winamp-0.4.tar.gz

You will need to extract the files and cd into the plugin source directory

        $ tar xvfz xmms-winamp-0.4.tar.gz;cd xmms-winamp-0.4


Then edit the configure file

        $ nano -w configure

Change line 5 to        ( You can find what line your at by pressing  Ctrl+c )

       for i in /usr/wine/bin

Then Change line 30 to

       for j in "" -L/usr/wine/lib

Then change line 46 to

       for i in /usr/wine/include

Then change line 64 to

       for i in /usr/wine/lib/wine

Press Ctrl+x and hit Y to save the file. Now run configure

        $ ./configure

Then you need to edit config.mak

        $ nano -w config.mak

Change line 3 to

        WINEINCLUDES = /usr/wine/include

Press Ctrl+x and hit Y to save the file. Now open Makfile

        $ nano -w Makefile

Change line 32 to

        winebuild -fPIC -DSTRICT -sym winamp.tmp.o -o winamp.spec.c -exe winamp -mgui -L/usr/wine/lib/wine -lkernel32 -luser32 -lgdi32

Then change line 35 to
					
        winebuild -L/usr/wine/lib/wine -L/usr/wine/lib -spec winamp.spec -o winamp.spec.c

Press Ctrl+x and hit Y to save. Then type

        $ make;su -c "make install"

After make is done it will ask you for the root password
so you can run the command      make install

WooHoo after that you got it compiled.     :-)

Now you need to download a version of Winamp ( XMMS does not tell you this. )

I tried several and only got winamp 2.24 to work for me

        http://68.14.155.25:538/win/
I'm not going to directly link you to the file,
Please look for it in there or on some other website.
Now Type

        $ wine winamp224.exe


Go ahead and install it. Now download winamp plugins you like from winamp.com
or some other website of your choice and install the same way as you did Winamp.

        $ wine pluginName.exe


After that is done start XMMS and hit Ctrl+v
You should see

        Winamp Meta-Plugin  [libwinamp.so]

as a option, select it, hit configure and fill in your values for the
plugin directory and plugin dll you need. Hit  OK and then OK from the
previous screen then go to your XMMS menu and then visualization options
and start up your plugin.

[Your Privacy and HP]===============================[b0ld <submit@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ever call tech support for an HP product that you owned? Well maybe you might 
want to keep on reading this article.Technical support is one of those lovely 
features that each and every software / computer industry giant has to service 
customers. Like any other company the agents go by a call script. One of the 
main parts is to have your first and last name as well as your telephone 
number with the area code first. This is actually optional, Remember that 
"YOU" are giving them the information. You can actually remain anonymous 
unless its a "serious" issue in which the product would actually need to be
repaired, then they will require all of your information. The agents "CANNOT" 
refuse technical support if your product is within warranty.

Now onto some interesting info.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

HP's call routing systems works off an actual VoIP. Even though
you maybe calling the phone number for technical support it then gets
routed to a VoIP terminal. The VoIP terminal is primarily being used to
cut costs on machinery service and maintenance, But there are
flaws within the VoIP system that they have and what your going to learn
will interest you and may even shock you. The first loop within
there system are the voice recognition service in which they have. Simply
this is a type of service that is supposed to be "hands free"
and "high tech", however the system has proven unsuccessful. On many
occaisions you may think that your being routed to the proper product
support group. Next thing you know after being on hold for 5 minutes to
get an agent you end up finding out that your in the wrong department.
So right there you just spent 5 minutes of wasted long distance time.
Another problem as well is that sometimes you would get an "echo"
effect when your talking to an agent. This makes the situation difficult
because you can hear yourself say the same thing almost 4 times.
There is also frequent disconnects while on hold as well. Some speaker
phones and cell phones actually tend to get disconnected from the
terminal itself because there is now "activity" on the line.

Now comes the scary part.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So you just finished talking to an agent and the problem is either fixed
or not fixed... In any occasion you need to make a phone call
that basically consists of confidential information. It could be anything
from giving out a credit card number or company policy information
that you'd only talk to "authorized" people about..  Well it has come to
my attention that because of HP's routing system being so "High Tech"
It has actually done something that generally is against the law. What
tends to happen periodically during the day is that after a customer
hangs up normally the terminal would receive the data that the customer
hung up so it should close that open line, how ever it would keep itself
open which acts like a "tapping" device. The agent on the other end could
have there mic on mute and they can now listen to any of your phone
calls. This issue has been raised alot during meetings but its seemed
that it basically brushed off anyone except for the individual reports
this issue. The only way that you can really see whether they were
actually listening in is if you have one of those devices that would
light up telling you that the line is already being used..

Another interesting fact.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Another flaw in the VoIP terminal is if you end up getting an agent and
the agent puts you on hold and then you hear a dial tone, then
there is chance for you to use the terminal open line and make and out
going calling call anywhere without it affecting your phone bill. Its
been basically proven after I decided to do some investigating with the
terminal. It would be a charge that would go on hp's bill and not yours.
And to be quite honest I wouldn't doubt that you can hold up a party line
and go undetected.

Another scary part
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

HP has adopted a new system to do there servicing on there products. The
agents use a "web-based" script that enters the necessary information in
order to either service a machine or even purchase a machine. What really
caught my attention on this matter is when a simple question was asked.
Someone asked one of the key people who is in charge of this system "what
encryption are you using", and the scary thing is is that they could not
positively answer that question. Although they claimed that the
information is being "piped" directly into the system and no outside
sources can penetrate. Well that theory was actually challenged
and the system failed horribly. What's logged on this system is very
sensitive data about the customer which includes credit card numbers,
names, address's, and phone numbers. Infact an agent can actually punch
in a credit card number into this database to try and find someone. The
odds of thinking a number just out of the blue is very slim however it
CAN be done, and with the data that is being sent and received by the
server is really isn't that all secure either. It just takes the right
person to find out the right block of ip's and sniff out the data. There
is so much data being sent across that network that even though you may
not use the proper stealth methods, you'll most likely be undetected
anyways. The server itself is also very unstable when trying to work with
it. It crashes all the time making information either saved uncorrectly
or lost. Its really to bad that they use this system. They are killing
off the old system that is actually unix based. They programed win32
shell to work with this system and it has always been reliable. Believe
it or not the mainframe of the old system actually
works off a Sun Microsystems server machine which is probably the most
reliable piece of computer machinery out there.

Closing remarks
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So I hope you've learned a little something here, sure its not all that
technical but it basically makes you think twice before you actually give
out your information out there. Really you don't know who is on the other
line and how poorly secure your information is being held within the
company's database but now you know.

[Phone Phreaking Lives with AT&T]==================[Cobra <cobra@hfactorx.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So with phreaking slowly on the decrease, and the building of tools &
boxes to use on phone networks is gettig fewer and further between. So why
not just use there own network against them, to make your free calls. Who
or What network would be stupid enough to allow such a feat. Well people
look no further than your own country. AT&T. Below I explain how one would
make free calls through AT&T's calling card service.

To start with You will need to find the number for AT&T's calling card
service, that you need to dial from your country. Now thankfully AT&T have
been thoughtful here, and you can obtain this list from there website at
www.att.com. Now for this example I am going to use the number that I
would dial from Ireland. So here we go.
 
From a payphone, Cell phone or even your house phone, you dial 1800 55
0000 from Ireland. *I think it is 1800 555 0000 for the US but check
first*. Now after dialing that number you will get 'Welcome to AT&T please
enter the number you are calling now'. So enter in your number
here. Keeping in mind people that for international calls you replace the
00 on the country code for a 01. So for example, The Irish country code is
00353, so you would instead dial 01353. Right now that that's cleared up,
we shall move on. After entering your number it will ask you 'Please enter
your calling card number and pin  or credit card number and expiration
date'. If you are calling anywhere outside the US you will only be asked
to enter your calling card. Now here comes the fun. When entering the fake
calling card, you must remember a few rules;
 

1) Calling card ALWAYS begins with 2124 or 2123 (2124 is best)

2) Never use a 0 after the 2124. So no 21240.

3) Calling cards are only 10 digits long.

So when entering your calling card, you punch in 2124<6 random
digits>. Then straight after you enter your calling card number, you then
need to enter a pin. So for your pin you enter 4 pound keys. such as # # #
#. It will then ask you to re-enter your pin # # # #. Now for some weird
reason there system HATES the # key. And it comes up on there system that
you have been disconnected from your call and you are trying reconnect. So
now after you have dialed in your pin number twice you will get through to
an AT&T operator. Now for god sake DONT PANIC!!. This is where you shine
up your social egineering skills. You will be greeted with a 'AT&T How may
I help you'. Now keeping it REALLY polite and in yourmost posh and
business like voice you say ' Hello! Could you redial the same number for
me please.. Thank You!'. Now 8 times out of 10 you will get the response '
Certainly, One second, Sorry you had trouble' and you will be through. But
there is still the other 2 times out of 10 where you wont get through and
you will have to ring back and try again. Trust me though you will get
through may take a few trys. But it is well worth it. Because if you are
ringing Australia which costs like 50 cents a minute, through at&t you can
stay on the phone as long as you like and the bill goes straight back to
at&t. So you can now call anywhere in the world and put it on AT&T's tab.

Now to add a little story to all this, I will explain a few problems I
have had an how I got around it. Before my girlfriend moved here with me,
she used to live in Canada. So naturally I was calling her everyday for
like 5 hours at a time. Now AT&T will catch on to this volume of usage if
it is being directed to one number. Now on Feb 12th this year(2001) at&t
banned all calls from Ireland to Canada through there calling card
service. The ban was online active for 2 days untill they found away of
stopping the calling. On Feb 15th I was arrested for theft of service. But
because AT&T could never prove that I was doing illegal acts. The case got
dropped. But there was an outcome. I was now no longer able to dial my
girlfriends number from anywhere in the country from any phone. It had
been banned through the IPC (Irish Phone Companies). Now the way I got
around this was simple. I remembered that there was an AT&T Canada. So
basically what I did there was. Ring AT&T America and dialed AT&T Canada
through them *as the ban was lifted*. So from AT&T Canada I was able to
use a similar trick to the AT&T US to get my call to go through. And bobs
your uncle. I was back on the track.

For people living in Ireland, It is worth investing in an Unregistered
SpeakEasy Cellphone and leave CLI off. Keeps you that little bit more
anonnymous when making your calls.

[Security Method and Technique]==============[Digital Ebola <digi@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/* Welcome to the corperate rant. =) */

Security is a word that most corperations fear. They would like to sweep it
under the rug, and rightly so. Security costs money, security costs time, 
and security brings skeletons out of closets that people would rather 
remained shut. Not to mention, that highly specialized security engineers
are hard to find. It's more then training; it's a knack. You are either good
or your not. Even the good can be compromised; the posing parties will be
compromised everytime.  

Justification of security, should not be a hard task. Millions of dollars
of present revenue can be lost due to a breach. Billons of dollars of 
FUTURE revenue can be lost to that same breach. In the digital world, you
have to protect your investments, you clients investments, and all data 
associated with each. 

The blood of the security world, is information. The person that has the 
information, will win the battle. A properly secured network can go from 
properly secured to blantantly open in the matter of minutes. This is why
it is important to take any information you can get, no matter the source.
Once aquired, the information can be double checked for its authenticity,
and acted upon. 

My personal methodolgy is the "Less is More" set of methods. Your security 
policy should be written custom against the set of users or tasks that will
be utilizing the resources. You give exactly enough for the set tasks to 
be completed and nothing more. Default installations, will result in a 
compromise. Default policies, will result in a compromise. The only way 
is to customize each service or resource for the job. 

This methodolgy is a hard one; you at once notice the fine line between 
security and usability. The more flexible the system is to it's users, the
more vulnerable it is to its attackers. It is important that such things 
be included in the policy as password management techniques, password 
scheming techniques, and password transport should ALWAYS be held in 
encrypted media when being sent over the wire. Sending it thru email or 
writing it on the whiteboard can result in a breach. 

Employees should not have their day to day activities hampered as to how 
they should utilize resources. Instead, they should be trained on the dangers
and be taught to look for signs of digital agression, or inconsistencies. 
They should be taught the whys of the security policies, and the only 
hampering they should have to suffer through, should be the use of the 
right tools to keep themselves in check with the security policy.
In the end, this works better, because the employee can use that knowledge 
and common sense to avoid problems. Keep in mind, this ties right in with 
password control, the human factor is responsible for 3/4 of all breaches.
At no point should censorship be included with the policy, as you turn your 
employees into sheep that follow directions; if any other aspect was missed
in the policy, then you are still compromised. If trained, the employee is 
no longer a sheep, they can actually aid you in security knowledge, because
they are utilizing resources firsthand.

There are many technical tricks and methods that can be incorperated into 
your security policy. The first thing most overlooked, is not technical 
at all; inventory control. Most companies do not have good inventory control,
and this is one of the most crucial things to have. You must know what the 
machine is, how it is configured, what services are running, and who has 
access to it. Patch revisions need to be noted, along with a set of 
identifiers that are machine specific. IP, MAC Address, and a physical serial
number, are very important pieces of information. If you don't know what you
have on your network, you don't know what to fix if there is a new exploit 
or advisory released. The security policy in itself should also contain 
guidelines for each operating system or piece of equipment. What the 
acceptable configurations are, and how they should be used. This, of course
takes alot of time, and alot of meetings. Everyone involved has to agree. 
It is important to secure each OS on a individule basis. In a large network,
this is next to impossible. This is why the OS guidelines are needed. 

In addition to having a secure OS, you should also consider writing IDS 
requirements into the policy. Host-based IDS is a very useful item to have,
just in case the unthinkable happens. Secure logging mechanisms and kernel 
monitoring are essential to tracking down the source of the breach. There 
are many good free software packages in the industry that accomplish this.

On the network side of things, there should be a Network Based IDS. This
gives you a perspective on what kind of traffic is running across your 
network, and gives the ability in most instances, to trend attack patterns.
This aids your research in some ways, because if you start seeing alot of 
scans on a certain port, chances are that something new has been released, 
and you are going to have to patch. I will also touch lightly on firewalls;
a firewall is NOT security. Firewalls are icing on the cake. A lot of 
companies depend on firewalls to protect them, and often there are ways
to either circumvent the firewall (UDP can yield interesting results) or 
maybe there is another access point that is more vulnerable (vpn, dial-in).
The point, is to keep track of everyone authorized to enter the network, 
and to keep track of all access points, not just the front door. And, 
remember, sometimes the front door can be kicked in. If a attacker breaches,
and you have secured the hosts behind the firewall, and you are running 
vlans.. there is not going to be anything to do. They will be dead in the
water, and your company does secure business for another day.

I hope this writing can be of some use to someone. It is not EVERYTHING, but
it is alot of things I consider important to security. I find that companies
tend to overlook these things, and it has become quite a pet peeve.

Are we: public ?  do we have: class ? so begin the: Rambling {


As is standard practise for anyone writing anything now, I'd like to
thank O'Reilley for publishing books on CD-Rom, which everyone is always
happy to pay 50 upwards for... or for about half the price they
could get a lot more useful information AND O'Reilly texts from their
next door neighbour and other internet users... I DO NOT SUPPORT PIRACY
of ANY kind..... Archatos stfu now before i slap that FTP is

Viruses? In Java? Surely not! Isnt the world made of Milk and Honey?
(and more milk ;)

What would the point of writing a virus in Java be?

How could that muppet approach the problem(s)?

Oh come on! It's Java!! what do you mean what would the point be, a well
written Java virus would be able to sit in anything from your Mobile
telephone *cough Nokia 92xx* through your BMW engine monitoring
systems, home PC, Flight navigation gear and most importantly.....
The Beer refrigerator.

Java exists on so many platforms already (and has almost infinite
possibility to be implemented on almost anything with enough room for a
VM, such as your handy wrist watch using the J2ME.)

If Someone was to write a virus, one which just reversed all text
displayed by the System.out.* classes, what would happen? Would we end up
reading the time and the atmospheric temperature through a mirror?

What do you think about when someone says "secure"? No Digi, not a
chastity belt.

Java is a "Secure" language, take all your thoughts about what you think
security is and then write them down (ya right) and compare them to
these:

SUN implemented only 2 major security aspects in Java 1.0, these being
that Java programs should be "Safe from malevolent Programs" (Trojan
horses etc) and that Java Programs should be "Non-intrusive", ie they
shouldnt have the ability to gather personal information on the host
computer or the hosts network.

The ability for authentication of Java programs was made in Java 1.1 and
when Java 2 (Java 1.2) came out they added the ability for encryption.

What does all this mean?

Java just ain't as secure as everyone makes out?

You decide.

Lets look at one feature, when running applets the JVM only allows
communication with the server, and the client, no third parties or calls
to third parties are allowed by the applet.

Now then, all Java code installed locally on the system is trusted
implicitly. All code downloaded over the network, however, is untrusted
and run in a restricted environment called the "sandbox" (all you
VX'ers who need this explaining to you should be shot, CRETINS!)

This Sandbox basically, and briefly takes the form of the Java Security
Manager (herein JVMSM)

How/Can do you Bypass this?

Well, the Java SecurityManager is probably the best place to start, but
in Java Developers words "Use of a custom SecurityManager is highly
discouraged" basically meaning you may well screw up and leave
yourself open to malicious content, now WHO would want that!

http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.
html

One thing to bear in mind is that to date, the JVM released itself isnt
flawed...only implementations of it, IE / Nutscrape. (Sounds a bit like
NT4 being designated a Secure Operating system by the US DoD...didnt note
that it had no NIC, Modem, Floppy disk or CD-rom drive in it at the time
did they?)

The pretty much only way to be garuanteed bypassing of the
Applet SecurityManager is to overwright the target's JVMSM, if you can do
this on a host you already have a manner of which to upload pretty much
anything, be it a rootkit or another executable....now THERE is a
tangent...Java as a multi platform rootkit../*notes for future
ramblings/*

What I consider as the most evident "Virus" written with Java is Brown
Orifice, a proof on concept code which once again, doesnt actually flaw
the JVM...but Nutscrape itself.

--

People are turning to Java, now more noticably (to me atleast) for
writing exploits, no longer will you need to worry about the fact that
your not running x operating system or Y operating system...just:
]$ java file

and there you have a exploit working on whatever platform. (admittadly
some of the exploits written in Java have been written using depreciated
methods..one word, slackers!)

*/for reference, when initiating use of the keyboard the structure now
is:
BufferedReader k = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))
/*

How do we want to spread virii?

The JVMSM when it comes to locally running applets is somewhat
different.

Well, if we can get the target to run the .class file locally, and
within the "normal" program is our friendly infector/executor then we
have the ability to do whatever we want..

For those who just woke up scroll up a it to where I mention that
locally installed Java Applications are trusted implicitly. So anything
your user profile can access, the java code can access (yes it is
possible to run all Java code in a sandbox, be it a JavaBean, servlet of
a full blown app, but for most lusers its just not something that they
will be thinking about when accessing their databases etc...or
running your P2P client which happens to have a bit more P2P about it
that they think.) As with most other languages there are methods to use
external processes, in Java this comes in the form of the
java.lang.Process (see the lang reference if you want to know more about
it in particular), so to do a bit or an O'Reilly-ism {
..
java.util.Properties config:
String cmd = config.getProperty("sysloadcmd");
if (cmd != null){

Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
ImputStream pin = p.getInputStream();
InputStreamReader cin = new InputStreamReader(pin);
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(cin);
String load = in.readLine();
in.close();
}
....
}

Use your imagination...can you pipe chargen to a completly different
process? (from DoS methods we know that yes we can dont we) Can one
create buffer overflows locally in order to execute other
commands which you want to use as you can in c or c++...?

Could all of this facilitate in the spreading or a virus?

There are enough brains in the world to solve third world debt, use
water as fuel and devise practical one use key encryption... if someone
hasnt got it working by now it wont be long.

Wont be long before our Governments cover it up that is.

}

All complaints can be sent to digi@legions.org
Anything else can be sent to me.

Next time maybe I should start writing a bit more in advance...

[The Scene Is Seen As Absolute Shit]==============[2dHero <submit@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With each passing year as the internet grows more, and more,
finding specific information your looking for becomes increasingly
harder. Not because it's no longer in existance, but because
it's surrounded by garbage. It's becoming more, and more like searching
through a wastebasket for important documents that you threw away on
accident. The same can be said for the hacking community.

Often people wonder why these kids email them asking for a mentor to
teach them about hacking, or how they hack hotmail, or how do they get in
their girlfriends webpage at angelfire.com to do a defacement. I'll tell
you why. The ones who are serious about hacking in
general who are using the W3 as their portal to knowledge search for
hours on search-engines, and repeatedly get flooded with websites
containing nothing but ICMP Ping Flooders, ICQ Flooders, Email Bombers,
and docs on how to card a brand new Dell Laptop. Yeah, it's annoying to
get five emails from kids in Romania asking you to teach them a thing or
two, but can you really blame them? Their searching for a needle in a
haystack. The others who are only interested in Hotmail, and Trojan
Horses know no better. Everything they find leads them to that direction,
and they have absolutely no clue that theres a whole hell of alot more to
hacking than things of that nature. It's the idiots who are supplying
this garbage that should be flamed more so than the kids.

Look at IRC; so sweet, and sour. The public channels have become so
infested with bullshit some days it's almost sickening to look at the
conversations. What could be a great way to share information pertaining
to the subject..is not for the most part. It's no longer about what you
know, or what your willing to share. It's about flirting, making an
online girlfriend, thirty year old women playing house to pass the time,
kissing ass for Operator Status in a big 'hacking' channel, or idling for
the sole purpose of having a longer idle time than Z3r0wk3wl. Off topic
discussion is fine by all means, but when it's all you have, why not
/part, and /join #chataway? People who are contributing absolutely
nothing to the community, and know absolutely nothing more than how to
boot, connect, and fire up mIRC with ops in these channels /kb-ing what
could be knowledgible people, because they think their music sucks or for
no reason at all. What the fuck? Why even op these people in channels
like that when you KNOW they know absolutely nothing. Listen, the vagina
they may possess halfway across the globe will never serve you any
purpose. Even the +s/p channels now days are about the same way.

This article is obviously a rant, and nothing more. It will change
absolutely nothing, but maybe it will get a few thinking about exactly
where the scene is going; to hell. Not all websites, and IRC Channels are
full of shit. There are a...few IRC Channels around that are
worthwhile, and lots of webpages, but the scriptkids, carders, power
tripping cluebag ops, digital teenage pranksters, and horny
thirty-something year old women by far outnumber any of the legit
contributors.

[Linux C Socket Programming]=====================[??????? <submit@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Editor's note: Who the hell sent this article? */

Opening a socket
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

In unix environments sockets are labeled as file descriptors or fd's for
short, so in essence open a socket is the same as opening a file, because
you are reading and writing to an Input/Output stream or IO stream. File
descriptors are refrenced as integers, which the socket call returns.

-------------------------------------------------
int fd;
fd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
-------------------------------------------------

In this code section we declare an integer fd and use it to store the
descriptor returned from socket() for later use. The first argument in
socket() is the domain or address family or protocol family, usaully
PF_INET or AF_INET(both the same as defined
in /usr/include/linux/socket.h or /usr/include/bits/socket.h) PF_INET is
protocol family IPv4 Internet Protocols. The next argument type, is the
type of packet to send, usually SOCK_STREAM, which is used for TCP or
SOCK_DGRAM for UDP(these can also be found defined in
/usr/include/bits/socket.h). The next field is the protocol, if we use 0
for this field the kernel should automatically enter the right value for
us, you can also, grep 'protocol' /etc/protocols which will give you the
number, which would help make the code more portable. I used IPPROTO_TCP
which is defined in /usr/include/linux/in.h as 6, which is the same
number the /etc/protocols would give. UDP is 17 or IPPROTO_UDP is equal
to 17. socket() returns socket file desciptor on success, -1 on error.

Making connections
int connect(int socket_file_descriptor, struct sockaddr *server_address,
int address_length);

Connect is used to make UDP and TCP connections. After we have
successfully created a socket(we need the socket file descriptor for
connect()) we can make a connection, but not before we fill in the
struct sockaddr_in.

-------------------------------------------
int fd;
struct sockaddr_in target;

fd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
memset(&target, '\0', sizeof(sockaddr_in));
target.sin_family = PF_INET;
target.sin_port = htons(23);
inet_aton("127.0.0.1", &target.sin_addr);
connect(fd, &target, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
-------------------------------------------

First we declare an int to store the return value of socket(), next we
declare a struct sockaddr_in. The reason we declare a struct sockaddr_in
is connect takes a struct sockaddr value as one of it's arguements to
fill this struct we use the corresponding protocol structure from
/usr/include/netinet/in.h, ours being Internet. we open a socket which
was explained before and store the return file descriptor value in fd.
struct sockaddr_in is padded so it is the same size as sockaddr so we use
memset to NULL out and fill the padded struct(man memset for more info).
We now enter value for the members in this structure, target.sin_family,
which is the protocol family again we want IPv4 Internet so we specify
PF_INET.

Next is target.sin_port, which is the port number we want to connect to.
We use htons or host to network short which it stands for, the reason we
use this is our host byte order is least significant byte first, the
Internet use most significant byte first. For example for our address
127.0.0.1 the hex value would be 0x7f000001, most significant byte first
would store it as 0x100000f7, thats an IP address though which is a long
integer which we would use htonl for(host to network long) a port is a
short int, between 0 and 65535, same idea smaller value. Next we use
inet_aton to convert our IP address 127.0.0.1 from numbers and dots into
binary and store it in a struct in_addr. Well we are lucky sockaddr_in(as
declared in /usr/include/netinet/in.h) has a struct in_addr member, it is
sin_addr. But since inet_ntoa is looking for a struct in_addr pointer we
need to use the & symbol to store it in the address of, like a pointer
points into an address. Now last but not least we are on connect. connect
take 3 arguments the first being our opened socket, which we stored in fd
so fd is our first argument, the second argument is a struct sockaddr
*server_address. we use &target to simulate a pointer to our struct
sockaddr_in which is a compatible struct with sockaddr, it is padded to
be the same size, the last argument is the address length which is stored
in struct sockaddr so we use a simple sizeof(struct sockaddr) to get
that. connect() returns 0 on success, -1 on error.

Simple Program to make a TCP connection to 127.0.0.1 port 23
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
/* these next two are for socket() and connect() */
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
/* for struct sockaddr_in */
#include <netinet/in.h>

int main()
{
  int fd;
  struct sockaddr_in target;

  /*
     this creates our TCP socket, and checks and see if it returns -1,
     if it does we print the error it recieved and exit the program,
     for UDP instead of SOCK_STREAM, use SOCK_DGRAM
  */
  if((fd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1)
    {
      perror("Socket");
      exit(-1);
    }

  memset(&target, '\0', sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
  target.sin_family = PF_INET;
  target.sin_port = htons(23);
  inet_ntoa("127.0.0.1", &target.sin_addr);

  /*
     we make our connect call and check and see if it fails if it does
     we print the error and exit
  */
  if((connect(fd, &target, sizeof(struct sockaddr))) == -1)
    {
      perror("Connect");
      exit(-1);
    }

  printf("Connection completed to 127.0.0.1 port 23\n");
  /* close our socket file descriptor */
  close(fd);

return 0;

}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sending and Receiving Data
-For TCP or UDP-
send(int socket_file_descriptor, char what_to_send[], int message_length,
int flags);
recv(int socket_file_descriptor, char receive_buffer[], int buffer_size,
int flags);
-For UDP-
sendto(int socket_file_descriptor, char what_to_send[], int
message_length
, int flags, struct sockaddr *to, int to_length);
recvfrom(int socket_file_descriptor, char receive_buffer[], int
buffer_size
, int flags, struct sockaddr *from, int from_length);

After we have established a TCP connection or a peer to peer UDP
connection(UDP is a connectionless protocol but connect calls can be made
using it, the sendto() and recvfrom() can be used without a connect call
on UDP sockets), we can send and receive data across the connection using
send and receive calls. Both a realativly easy to use, we plug in our
already connected file descriptor as the first argument for both, next we
supply a buffer or a message, both just storage variables one for sending
in send() and one for receving in recv(). The third argument these differ
in that send wants the message length while recv wants the buffer size,
so for send we just do a strlen(message); to return the string length of
the message and for receive we do a sizeof(buffer); to get ther size of
our buffer. The last argument is if we want to use flags, we really
shouldn't bother with these unless we have a specific intent, but if you
want to know the flags can be found in the man pages for send and recv.

  buffer[bytes] = '\0';
  printf("We received:\n%s\n", buffer);

  /* close our socket file descriptor */

Well thats all for now, maybe next KV issue I will go further in detail
on the use of sockets we will see, but for now back to hacking out some
code.

1. Yahoo. Why can't they make a client right? Ever join a Yahoo! chat channel?
   Damn thing blows up when you are accepting other people's fonts... just 
   give it a <font size=www.www.www.www.www.www. and on and on> and watch their
   newest client die. Force YOUR font settings in the preferences to stop this.

2. P2P networks. Stop backdooring shit! gator.com sucks and so do you. Is it

   sniff what people browse? 

3. OpenBSD. How many hours since remote hole in the default install? Forcing 
   people to adopt your methods (i.e. PrivSep) will not help the industry, it
   will only hurt it. Do you think the commercial operating systems are going 
   to change just because YOU say so? No. Get a clue. PrivSep is a good idea
   poorly implemented. 2500 lines of root owned code is still 2500 lines of 
   overflowable code, and word on the street has it, PrivSep has already been
   defeated. Please discuss with full disclosure.

   next time a employee tells you that your security sucks a goat (1999)

[Travel - Tips for Visiting Holland]=============[Rewben <ruben@generation.nl> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Never use the word "Dutch" in front of a Hollander. It reminds him too much
of the word "Deutsch" which is a word for Germans and other things he doesn't
like. A Dutchman is a Hollander or a Nederlander. 

2. Never ever try to speak Hollands even if you have lived in Holland for more
than five years. Not only will it give you a splitting headache but also
Hollanders won't understand a single word of what you are trying to say. 
Foreigners are expected to speak English or gibberish. Speaking gibberish they
are easy prey for pickpockets since they can't make a report to the police. 

3. Also never try to eat "drop". Drop is a kind of licorice that only 
Hollanders can eat. It can be recognized by its colour: black. The taste is a 
cross between printer ink (blue) and earwax. Hollanders absolutely love it and
eat kilos of the revolting stuff. There is a nationwide conspiracy to look at 
the faces of foreigners who are tricked into believing it is edible. 

4. Do not buy wooden shoes. They will look absolutely silly on you. Which is 
ofcourse the main reason for selling them to you in the first place. A 
Hollander himself wouldn't like to be found dead in them. (As a matter of 
fact, they wouldn't like to be found dead at all) 

5. Do not make holes in dikes. Behaviour like that is not only frowned upon 
but in certain cases can get you stoned to death with wooden shoes by an 
angry mob. You may feel free however to stick a finger in any dike you like. 
It'll get you a few good laughs from the natives. 

6. A Hollander is always right and he knows it. With this in the back of your 
mind it is easy to deal with most of them. If ever you get into an argument 
with a Hollander, tell him that he is absolutely right and that you see the 
error of your ways. This will drive him absolutely crazy: Since you are a 
foreigner you can't be right. You agree with him. Therefore he also cannot be
right. Impossible! He is a Hollander. But.. why.. he.. At this point you may 
want to stand back and watch him try to strangle himself with a tulip. 

7. Windmills are unavoidable. 


8. It is not necessary to show an interest in tulips, windmills, wooden shoes
or cheese. Every Hollander knows that you came for the softdrugs or the Amsterdam red light district, the Walletjes. Both are available in a large quantity 
and are easy to find. Ask any Hollander age six or older or any French tourist 
(see items 19 & 20) 

9. Avoid fans of soccer games at all cost. Soccer in Holland is merely an
excuse used for bashing in the brains of just about everyone else, including 
yours, after the game is won. ...Or lost...Or if it is a draw. It is also 
very unwise to stand near a policeman during these festivities. (see item 10) 
Also, whenever there's a Hollander around: "Don't mention the '74 final!". 
You'll end up in an ongoing discussion about how well the Orange team played 
and how marvellous it is that a small country like Holland has such a good 
team and blah-de-blah-de-blah. 

10. Policemen in Holland may be used for throwing things at. If you feel like 
hitting someone or something, use a policeman. No Hollander will pay any 
attention if you decide to hit, maim, or kick a policeman in the groin. 
Policemen represent authority and no Hollander recognizes any authority 
higher than himself. You may also note that a lot of Hollandse policemen are 
in fact foreigners tricked into taking the job. 

11. Hollanders do not like to spend money, they'd sooner cut off their own 
ears. A Hollander will become a friend for life if you give him something for 
free. (Note: Social diseases are an exception) LOL This might explain the 
success of MacDonald's in Holland. The story that copper wire is an invention 
of two Hollanders fighting over a found cent is absolutely true. 

12. Holland is small. There is a rumour that Holland is put inside during 
rainstorms. Not true, but that is mainly because it rains about 365 days each 
year. This might also explain those wooden shoes: They float. Yes, Holland is 
small and Hollanders are proud of it. They will grab every opportunity to 
point out to you that the nation has accomplished great things, despite of it 
being so small. A suitable answer to this swank is the Hollander's 
imperialistic past. Wich brings us -rather nicely- to item 13. 

13. If you wish to insult a Hollander -and sooner or later you will - simply 
tell him you don't think he is a pacifist. Now immediately start running for 
your life. He'll want to prove to you that he is a peace loving person and he 
won't stop proving this until your intestines are scattered all over the 
floor. However, mentioning a supposedly imperialistic past considering 
Surinam and/or Indonesia, will instantly reduce a Hollander to a pathetic, 
sniffing and crying child, begging for forgiveness. 

14. The Hollanders are supposed to be tolerant. They are not. They simply make
too much money from the sale of soft- and hard-drugs, Malaysian women and 
pornography to foreigners to let an opportunity for making a good profit go by. 

15. The main form of public transportation in Holland is bikes. Feel free to 
take any bike of which you are able to pick the lock. Don't expect your own 
bike however to be where you left it three minutes earlier. The hunting season
for bikes is open 365 days a year. Have fun. 

16. At nearly every meal in Holland you will find a small vicious looking 
blade with a slit in it. It is called a "kaasschaaf" and is used for taking 
very thin (the see-through kind) slices of the cheese. Yes, it is indeed an 
invention made by a Nederlander. Never cut cheese with a knife, you'll make 
an utter fool of yourself. Another peculiar dinner tool is the
 "flessenlikker", which literally means "bottle-licker", but which is best 
translated by "yoghurt-scraper". Note that this tool is not meant to get rid 
of an itchy back or for your nightly escapades. It's designed to clean out 
bottles of yoghurt or "vla" which is a sort of custard. The Nederlanders 
wants to use absolutely every millilitre of the yoghurt or 'vla' he bought. 
He paid for all of it and he'll jolly well eat all of it. 

17. At the time of this writing, the Hollandse economy is doing quite well. 
The Hollanders say that this is the result of extensive negotiating between 
parties like the unions, the employers and the government. They even have a 
name for this: The polder model. Foreigners are made to believe that this 
polder model is the key to a healthy economy and if others should follow this 
polder model, their economy's will also improve dramatically. This is utter 
nonsense. Hollanders just love to talk and talk and talk. Calling all this 
talking negotiations only gives them a sense of doing something useful. Talk 
is not cheap in Holland. 

18. Hollanders like to drown fried potato's in litres of mayonnaise and put 
it in small paper bags. This is called "een patatje met". One of these bags 
can sustain life over an indefinite period. Not everyone agrees if it is the 
sort of life worth living. Some foreigners however are reported to have 
actually liked eating it. 

19. Hollanders have a special and unique service for -mainly- French tourists.
As soon as they cross the border between Belgium and Holland, they are 
welcomed enthusiastically by young men in fast cars. These young people wish 
to point out to the French tourist where the more interesting touristy places 
in Holland can be found. Strangely enough they always seem to end up in a 
coffee shop (see item 20). Funny people those French. 

20. There is a fast and guaranteed way of making a complete fool of yourself 
in Holland: Enter a coffee shop and ask for a cappuccino. Coffee shops do not
 -remember this- do not sell coffee. You can however get a good number of 
other stimulating drugs there. For some unknown reason coffee shops are 
extremely popular with French tourists. 

21. A Fries is a semi-detached sort of Nederlander, living in the north of 
the country in a province all for himself. He is fond of frozen water, 
Beerenburg (which is a form of euthanasia with alcohol) and continuously 
pointing out to non-Fries Hollanders that they are -indeed- not Fries. The 
rest of the Hollanders look upon this behaviour with the good natured 
ambivalent feelings that parents have for an obstinate child. 

22. On the matter of what books to buy before you come to Holland, I can 
recommend the following: The complete works of William Shakespeare or a 
leather-bound volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (the 1913 copy: 
Fr to He). In my experience these two books have just about the right weight 
for clubbing a pushy drug dealer or pimp on the head without leaving any 
marks. After hitting you might want to drop the book you were carrying at 
that moment for a more speedy retreat. Bring plenty of books. 

23. Do not bother to hire a car. Not only can you steal more bikes than you 
will need but car-traffic in Holland is not something you will enjoy. In the 
rest of the world traffic jams are measured in miles or kilometres, 
Nederlandse traffic jams are measured in weeks. As a matter of fact, the more 
persistent traffic-jams are well worth a touristic visit. The sight of 
starving people in an expensive Mercedes can be quite uplifting if you are of 
a philosophic nature. You may want to bring some pieces of bread with you to 
throw through open car windows. The resulting fights can often be worth 
>watching. 

24. Contrary to popular belief, you may not bring your mother-in- law to 
Holland for do-it-yourself euthanasia. Tourists are warned not to take these 
matters into their own hands. 

25. Whether you are catholic, Muslim or worshipper of Urrrgl, god of all 
honest politicians, in Holland you are likely to run into a church, temple or 
oak-tree-and-virgin of your liking. Hollanders are supposed to be very 
tolerant of other believes, ways of life and religious convictions. 
They are not. The only reason for there being so many different churches, 
sects and cults is the fact that Hollanders disagree on just about anything. 
A Hollander is always right (see item 6) and anyone who thinks different than 
him can jolly well bugger off and start his own church. 

26. Holland is a kingdom. It has no king but a queen and her husband is no 
king but a prince. The queen doesn't rule the country -well, not much anyway- 
but she is very good at opening bridges, roads and visiting other countries. 
She is also very decorative at state banquets. Her son, the crown prince, 
will be king as soon as she stops queening (nice word eh?). Now his wife 
won't be a queen but she will be a princess because Nederland is much too 
small for a king and a queen at the same time. On April the 30th its Queen's 
Day, which is not the birthday of the queen, but the birthday of princess 
Juliana the queen's mother (who used to be the queen). It is no wonder that 
more and more Nederlanders wish to make Holland a republic. Queen's Day, by 
the way, has nothing to do with royal festivities. It's just a Hollander's 
excuse to drink large quantities of alcohol. On Queen's Day Hollanders also 
sell garbage in the streets. 

27. It might be wise to learn how to swim if you visit Holland. No, the dikes 
will hold, that is not the problem. The huge amount of ditches, moats, 
canals, rivers and brooks can however lead to mistakes. The shiny nice new 
asphalt road that you wish to drive your car on during a rainstorm, may in 
fact not be a road at all. 

28. The Hollandse art. Most Nederlandse painters get to be famous only after 
they have died. That is a very sensible arrangement from the publics point of 
view. Not only do you get large quantities of paintings -a man has got to eat,
right?- but it also makes a nice investment for art-lovers. The painters 
themselves do not share this view at all but are unable to do anything about 
it. In at least one case the frustration has led to self-mutilation involving
an ear. 

29. If one of your Hollandse friends invites you for a birthday party, 
prepare yourself for a unique experience. Unique, because it can only be 
compared to taking place on a wooden chair which has a sharp nail driven 
through the underside of the seat, and not being able to move for a month. 
More than one foreigner has been driven to the brink of insanity in just one 
evening. A Hollandse birthday party consists of sitting in a chair, talking 
to other Hollanders about your work, your car, foreigners and politics. You 
are expected to leave at 11 pm and you'll gladly do so. 

30. Do not get sick in Nederland. Over the last ten years, the famous 
Hollandse healthcare has been privatised. These days some operations, like 
open heart surgery, have a waiting list of more than six months. The doctors 
don't think that is a problem, "More than half of our patients for open heart 
surgery never even show up anyway" they say. Some Nederlandse patients who 
have become desperate, move to a country like Mozambique, Iraq or Pakistan 
where healthcare is infinitely better. 

31. Nederlanders leave their curtains open in the evening. This used to be so 
that the neighbours could always check if your family didn't gamble or drink 
alcohol. These days it is a precaution against junkies trying to steal the 
stereo from the family car, parked in front of the house. It has the 
fortunate side effect that you can watch Hollanders in their natural 
surroundings, in front of the television, watching soaps. 

32. Holland has more cities than only Amsterdam. ike ..erm. ..Well, it has!! 

33. Hollandse beer has made quite a reputation for itself over the years. 
Some people even drink it. Brewing is indeed one of the things Hollanders 
traditionaly do very well. Holland never used to be a country with anything 
more interesting to do than to drink oneself blind in new and interesting 
ways or make paintings. This made the beer industry very popular. Experts 
claim that once you have drank Hollandse beer like Heineken, Grolsch or 
Amstel, all other beers taste like the tapwater in a Rotterdam hotel. 

34. Hollandse tapwater is safe to drink. This is quite remarkable considering 
that most drinking water comes from poluted rivers like the Rhine. Plans to 
improve the quality of the riverwater, so that fish like salmon will return 
to Hollandse rivers to spawn, can count on strong resistance from the 
Nederlanders. They don't like the idea of animals having sex in their 
drinking water.

[Sex and Geeks Do Not Mix]======================[Vecna <vecna@insertcoint.net> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<vecna> mmhh... articles for KV ... did anyone want one specific article ?
<G7> vecna..digi did want one on sex with floppy drives
<vecna:#legions> hahahahaa :) G7, ok :) I should try to write it :) with new
                 /dev/sexfd0 device driver :)

this was the start! the big bang!

make sex with a phisical device or a device driver is not difficult.
sex could be see, if not as good kind of pleasure, or phisical phenomena from
irrationals reciprocals sentiments such love, as a simple intersection from
different kind of device, that produce some kind of sound and liquid.
if we try to apply this concept over out frendly personal computer, we could
not discovery any kind of sound producer than pc speacker and the hd/floppy
head when change place and run.

my latest study about incests, is the link between floppy drivers and prawn, 
if you follow this diagram:

1) prawn live over the sand

2) from the sand we could produce silicon

3) with the silicon we could produce transistors and micro processors and
   FLOPPY DRIVER!

we could think that prawn can be victim of an illusion and make sex with
our floppy driver, for try to do some kind of sexual reproduction.
if not directly with the driver, the driver could be the place of love for
a couple of prawn in love.

DIRECT MEMORY HACKING ?

the concept is simple, any process run on virtual space of memory, you
at kernel level could read data not only on virtual space (allocated and
pagined for each process) you can read directly also from the phisical memory.

this can make you able to do a very nice hacks for read and write any process

[Hey, Big Brother]=================================[Yarddog <yard@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft has given us an idea of where they want to go with Windows XP
and .Net Server. One of these ideas that they have is to permit only
"approved" software can be installed on their operating system. This
takes them to Palladium.

In WindowsXP, Microsoft has given us the Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI). The WMI is to give the administrator the
opportunity to remove common access points for execution of software.
This should, in their opinion, increase security and privacy by limiting
the execution of malicious code or unknown code. WindowsXP allows the
administrator to define what is trusted code. This can be done
automatically by policy based approaches. 

There are 3 elements to the policy approach. One, is to define the
policy for domain using the editor. Two, is to download the policy to
the machine. Three, the OS enforces the policy when software is run.
This gives an administrator the ability to choose which software may run
on the machine.

Microsoft states that software restriction policies support the
following four ways to identify software: Hash-A cryptographic
fingerprint of the file; Certificate-A software publisher certificate
used to digitally sign a file; Path-The local or universal naming
convention (UNC) path of where the file is stored; and, the
Zone-Internet Zone.

The hash rule is important as it contains the MD-5 signature. A company
can change the certificate identifying the software by changing the
MD-5. The path rule may generate registry settings. The zone rule simply
identifies where internet explorer downloaded the file from, whether it
is the internet, intranet, trusted zone, restricted site, or my
computer. Microsoft claims the zone rule only applies to the MSI
packages.

In XP, the Group Policy Object (GPO), as we see it here, can be skipped
by using the WMI. "For example, you can create a WMI filter so that a
GPO only applies to machines with a certain service pack (John Lambert,
Microsoft Corporation)." Microsoft further states:

	It is possible to use software restriction policies in a
mixed-mode deployment. That is, 	you do not have to upgrade your
Windows 2000 domain controllers to take advantage of 	software
restriction policies. You can use a Windows XP Professional computer to
edit the 	Group Policy object and configure your software
restriction policy. Windows XP and Windows 	.NET Server machines
that download the GPO will enforce the software restriction policy.
Computers running Windows 2000 will ignore the settings. (John Lambert,
Microsoft 	Corporation).

Microsoft's project "Palladium" will expand on these ideas of
restricting software. There is a business overview white paper of the
project at
http://www.microsoft.com/PressPass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.a
sp. 

John Manferdelli, General Manager, Microsoft "Palladium" Business Unit,
states:

	Palladium will greatly reduce the risk of many viruses and
spyware -- software that 	captures and reports information from
inside your PC -- and other attacks. Memory in 	Palladium PCs and other
devices will run only "trusted" code that is physically isolated,
protected, and inaccessible to the rest of the system. Files within the
Palladium 	architecture will be encrypted with secret coding
specific to each PC, making them useless 	if stolen or
surreptitiously copied.
(http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-01palladium.a
sp).

Manferdelli further claims that the industry is excited about Palladium.
He admits that Microsoft is still a long way from Palladium. 

The alternative may be open source software. But, can open source
seriously compete with this hegemony? Alexandra Krasne seems to think it
might a different
potential(http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0302msoffice.html). And
Microsoft is reportedly trying to merge .Net with the competitor Apache
Server. "Software titan Microsoft is taking a significant step toward
appeasing the open source community by integrating its .NET Framework
into the Apache Web server, the world's most popular back-end software
for serving up Web pages (Linux Today, Jul 24, 2002)." 

But one must wonder just how far off Big Brother really is...

[The Escalation to Economic Turmoil]==========[OverDose <overdose@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article will briefly cover what's going on in American economy and
the repurcussions from past actions by individuals.

It all started one bright September 11th in 2001, then it happened....
terrorist attack on a few of american governmental and economic icons,
being the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  The following week 
the Dow fell over 200 points, a massive hit to the exchanges.  After this
hit, financial records were scrutinized of Enron (an energy supplier)
and Arthur Anderson (one of the"Big 5" accounting firms)'s aid in 
the deception.  We all know that there was augmentation of financial
records and upon the scouring of which, a lot of executives came under fire. 
One of which, Clifford Baxter, a former vice chairman for Enron 
committed suicide to evade legal effects.  These were two major disasters
affecting the economy.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, is a direct influence of how  investors feel
about the current status of America's economy.  When he speaks, people
listen.  He introduced a few interest rate cuts to help stimulate the
economy... which worked to a certain degree.  Then we have allegations that 
officials from Enron *AND* Arthur Anderson destroying financial records,
and a few indiscriminants being held accountable for obstruction of
justice for doing so.  After all is said and done, there is a bit of stability
in the exchange and regular trading is sustained.  After all what
happened with Enron, many other companies are scrutinized for their financial
records, as many of them inflated figures  to make their quarterly earnings to
be much higher or their debts to other entities much lower than 
they really are to make themselves look better off to investors so they
would generate capital from these outside investors.
	

	Now here we are post mid-year 2002 and things are getting
worse.  With so many companies  augmenting financial figures, there is
great uncertainty among investors, dropping the dow lower than the 
hit from September 11th.  It can be a viscious cycle: the dow drops and
incites a panic in the market and people sell all they have due to fear of 
losing all they have, and from these drops other are even more fearful 
and begin selling.  President George W. Bush was stated as selling stock
in Harken Energy as an inside trade, since he was head of the board,yet
he didn't.  He claims he filed the form with the SEC( Security and 
Exchange Comittee) and that they had lost the form, then when
questioned about it later stated that it was  Harken's lawyers that were
to blame.  This coming soon after poor corporate reform to disallow any 
mishaps of changing financial information and creating ethical ENFORCABLE
standards.  All of these things are bleeding the trust of investors and
are being felt on wall street and all around the world, as the  Dow drops
bit by bit.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I beleive a good enough synopses
to understand what exactly is affecting trading and inherently affecting
the economy of the USA and indirectly the world.  If you want to 
read about other things that Pres Bush has done go to

Title: How To Hack your Way Out Of A Paper Box <b>4 R33t0ddz<b>

Contents:

I.   Introduction

III.  Hanky Panky

1. You Put you Right foot out
2. And you shake it all about ...
3. Conclusion
4. Shouts, Insults & Enemies !@#$


I.Introduction

Greetings everyone, welcome to my very first article of "4 R33t0ddz" for 
Legions. This article was developed for personal reasons I would like to
explain here. IRC Is a place where people can communicate with each other over
the net in a single room. There are lamers among us who act like idiots
and think there elite hackers. This goes out to all the lamers out there
who have been flamed at by others because you can't hack your way out of
a paper box. Well this is for you to get back at them :D~


II.The Box

In order to hack the box and show all your elite friends or others that you
are elite too, you must have a map of the box inside, the tools and ways
to us them to be free.
	
1. Structure & Layout
		  
First analyze the box from the inside (since you are inside already).
Look at its hieght, its widthm its dimensions and every corner of the box
to get an understanding of the structure & layout of this box's fingerprints.
There are different boxes out there, from corbord box to wooden box.
		   
2. Tools of the Trade
		
Now we have a concept of the box's structure & layout. We need to use the right
tools to crack open the box. First and foremost, you need a pocket lights so
you can see what your doing obviously :P . Second we need an axe to hack
your way out. Third we need porn magazines (since we are going to stay a
while inside, just something to have "fun" while you rest) . Lastly the
last tool we need (which is an exception for most ) is a geometric ruler
to cut the right size or you could use your fingers or any other parts of
your body.
		
3. Exploiting
	
Yey we got the tools now we need to learn how to use them. Turn on that pocket
lights or flash lights (whatever you wanna call it, this is 4 R33t0ddz)
and hold it with your left hand to have an angle of where your
"hacking".  Get that geo-ruler out or your fingers and start doodling.
Now take that time to rest a bit and take out that porn magazine I
told you to bring and jizz like you never jizzed before (You are half way 
there :P~) . Once you have layed out yout diagram on the wall box start
hacking !@# Get that axe out and hack away, hack every side, every width
and every hieght you made with doodle. 

III.   Hanky Panky

1. You Put your Right foot out (I can't explain that enough 4 R33t0ddz)
		
2. And you shake it all about 
			
You must shake it all about because you where all crippled inside the box
and you need the blood to circulate all around your body :)

3. Conclusion

I hope you have learned something today, because if you haven't that's still ok
your very very very special little boy/girl :) . Your friends, enemies and elite
hackers out there will think your real cool and all and when they say "you can't
hack your way out of a paper box" you can tell them "I read "How To Hack your 
Way Out Of A Paper Box <b>4 R33t0ddz<b>" " :) . Make sure you tell them
it's 4 R33t0ddz so they will think your very very very special boy/girl
and they will fear you ;) .

4. Shouts, Insults & Enemies !@#$
	
Shouts go out to everyone on #legions & #isecurity 
Insults go out to 4 <b>r33t0ddz<b> fans :]
Enemies go out to all the bullies out there ... :P~

[Delirious IDS]==============================[Digital Ebola <digi@legions.org> ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. This is part technical paper, part rant, and part silliness. I am
very very tired. Please forgive me if I get loopy. I came home today, 
and decide to start kludging together a host based IDS script. One part
tripwire, one part common sense, and one part crazyness. I am obviously
expecting a attack on one of my boxen at his moment, and because of all
the craziness going on with the OpenBSD project as of late, I feel that
my paranoia is appropiate. Granted, I will save that discussion for another
rant, but let's just say, I am not at all pleased with what is one of my
most favorite operating systems. I don't like OpenBSD for its 
"security model"; I like it because its compact and runs well on Sparc 
architecture.. Again, that is another rant. I have lost faith. 

As I worked on this mythical IDS script, my thoughts began to wonder 
to kernel trojans, and to Tim Lawless's Saint Jude project. So, I got
a flash of inspiration (or insanity).. and I am not sure if this is quite
a original thought, if it already exists, or anything. 

I want to see a host based IDS built of a artifical intelligence type
model. What I mean by that, I want a HID that is intelligent enough to
not only check MD5 sums on certain things, file sizes on other things,
AND presence of certain files, but I also want the thing to defend itself
if a breach occurs. 

Imagine this: Joe Hax0r Kiddy breaks into your box via a user account.
(Damn users!, *sigh, another rant) Now Joe is working on his root 
transition. Well, we can detect this. Just ask Lawless. Now, imagine 
the HID fighting back. Joe gains root, and starts replacing files. The 
HID logs into another machine and copies backups into place - ON THE FLY.

This is going to gain us several advantages. First, we have a record of 
the intrusion on a offsite machine. Second, Joe Hax0r Kiddy thinks that
he has successfully backdoored the machine. He may just leave the system
with that impression. Third, if this pans out correctly, no future attackers
can penetrate the machine after Joe leaves.

In essence, the HID is protecting the machine proactively in real time. 
Something a IDS is generally not supposed to be able to do. 

A list of features would be as follows:

1. Joe loads a kernel module. HID unloads it. (Time delay?)
2. Joe replaces files. HID replaces files from known good backup (off site)
3. Joe pounds at machine. HID calls for help. (pager, cellphone)
4. Worst case scenario - HID realizes with some unknown logic that it cannot
   cope with Joe Hax0r Kiddy. HID decides to call for help, and shut itself
   down. 
5. Email to all users on the system that data integrity has been lost. 
6. HID detects the method of root compromise and searches for a patch on 
its own. Once it finds a patch, it downloads it and installs it. (CVS?)
7. HID tracks Joe's IP of origin (IP registry, nslookup, traceroute, domain 
information) and mails a off-site email this information. 


The main issues here at present would be making this software totally stealth.
Also, we would want to be 100% sure that events are not false, prompting
a crazy HAL-like HID... I believe this last point is quite possible with 
host-based intrusion. 

Also, there are several obvious ways to defeat the HID:

1. Know that is is present and unload it. Perhaps have a second module to
   call for help when this happens? 
2. Unknown kernel rootkits. 
3. Off-site backup is unreachable. 
4. Total loss of network connectivity. 

I think that what I am describing is possible. Hell, it might already 
exist. I have not slept in a long time, and maybe this is causing a 
effect on me. This paper is to provoke discussion, and happy engineering. 

Look for a more technical paper in next KV.. (I hope theres a next KV)

[Custom TCP Port Scanning using IP Sorcery]==========[Case <phric@legions.org> ]

Custom TCP Port Scanning using IP Sorcery

By Phriction aka Case (phric@legions.org)

Ingredients
-----
IP Sorcery 
http://www.legions.org/~phric/ipsorcery.html
http://www.freshmeat.net/ipsorcery

Paul Oakenfold of course

Also maybe tcpdump we will see.. http://www.tcpdump.org
-----

I think the weakness most port scans have today is the ability to intertwine
with regular traffic. They leave huge fingerprints because of their packet
values. 

For Example:
# nmap -sS -p19 -P0 127.0.0.1 -D192.168.0.8

tcpdump output

As you might have noticed my decoy could be easily noticed, both packets
sent have the same sequence number same window size, same ttl. Neither have
a Don't Fragment bit set. Try it yourself the decoys always send the same
data as the normal host. Don't get me wrong nmap is a great scanner and
definitely a great use for quick port scans. I personally think a great job
was done on it but use it wisely young padowin learner.

IP Sorcery is shamelessly promoted in this article please forgive me ;)
IP Sorcery is a commandline or GTK packet generator. The console version
has built in sniffing well in the development version the GTK version will
also have this ability relatively soon as I continue to hack code amongst
other endeavours.

OK lets test this baby out. 

#./ipmagic -is 192.168.0.10 -id www.legions.org -io D -td 22




Received TCP Packet: 
           Src Port: 22	Dst Port: 1920
              Flags: SYN ACK 

----
Oh Happy day the port is open. it is you say, ow can you tell... break;

From IP Sorcery README
TCP--
Usually when you send a SYN packet to an open port it will send
a SYN ACK back to you if it's open, a RST ACK if it's closed
When you send a SYN FIN it will usually send a SYN ACK back if it's open,
or a RST ACK if it's closed.
SYN PSH will send a SYN ACK back if it's open, a RST ACK if it's closed
FIN will send back a RST ACK if it's closed
PSH will send nothing if it's open or RST ACK if it's closed
ACK will usually get a RST back no matter if it's open or closed
No flags will return nothing if it's open, or a RST ACK if it's closed

Now this is if there is no firewall or ipchains or anything of
that nature running. Usually you can tell if a port is denying
access if there is no response to any packets you send at all

----

Ok back to the game, now since we know the basics lets see what this thing can
do.

#for i in 21 22 23 do ./ipmagic -td $i >> scan; done
#fgrep "SYN ACK" -B 1 scan

           Src Port: 22	Dst Port: 1940
              Flags: SYN ACK 
--
           Src Port: 23	Dst Port: 2251
              Flags: SYN ACK 

----
Wow simple easy as that and we see we have two open ports. IP Sorcery
does random generation of values for each packet or you can specify them
yourself the GTK interface is beautiful for doing that. You can also
specify data payload and other things make the traffic look lively. If
4 guys wearing all black trench coats and black sun glasses walk into some
place people will notice but guys dressed different will be passed up.

Anyway screw this article with prejudice blah blah
IP Sorcery 1.7.9beta should be out in a week or so, so hold your panties

[Preface]

This is the first edition version of my guide to supplementing your income by
way of a personal buisness.  As of this version, this guide is geared
towards those looking into Sole Propriatorships, or buisness run by one
person in their entirity.  This all in all is not exactly the most profitable
way of running a buisness, but seeing that i have no buisness background at 
all this is where i chose to start my guide.  Id like to note that none
of these methods mentioned herein have been put to the grindstone by
myself just yet so as far as I know, their not necessarily true to the real
world.  I am however working on a startup as an experimential project, to
actually see whats 'really' required to own and run a buisness.  I plan
to update this guide on a regular basis with the evolution
or de-evolution of my buisness, making note of my successes and failures
etc to give you an idea of what it actually takes to be successful. Oh, and 
if it seems like im writing it for toddlers its because I am.  This
article is for anyone looking into starting a buisness. If you feel you have
a decent understanding of the general overview (which im sure most of you
do) feel free to skip around and whatnot.  I just tried to include
everything i could think of. Yup..  K im done. haha. Enjoy the read.

[Before Capital is Aquired (or put to use)]

(Skills Assessment)

What gave me the idea of starting a personal buisness originally wasnt the 
prospect of financial gain really.  It was an epiphanie i had while taking a 
huge shit a few days ago.  It pertained to the idea that all one really
needed to have a successful buisness was the ability to produce in such a
way that was unique or semi-unique to possible consumers.  Things that most 
people in their complacent lifestyles choose to outsourse as to avoid
getting their hands dirty.  Things that a decent amount of people in
#Legions do for fun on a regular basis.  So i just drew the logical conclusion 
and decided that if we have whats in demand, whats to stop us from taking 
advantage of what we know and make it work for us.  Its a somewhat
infantile discovery but still a valid one.  Even if you dont
plan to be self-employed for any long period of time it still makes sense to 
have a side buisness if just to have the ability to use it for its
intangible benifits (ie. for your resume, for writeoffs etc).  Ya, after
contemplating the idea for a good many hours ive come to the conclusion that 
with all the give and take within the buisness itself, there is no real
drawback to owning your own buisness as long as you have the time to keep
up with the up keep.  haha.  But ya anyway lets start with the basics, or in
other words, finding what interests you (which actually if you loiter in
#Legions is a given but for the all inclusive purposes of this article
will be just whatever).  Heres a few questions I stole from one of the
books in the bibliography.  They help you identify your stronger intresets.  
The underlying use is relatively simple, er extremely simple.  Get a
handful of your current intrests and use them in place of said
'$interest' rating each on a scale of one to ten, ten being your highest 
intrest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 1.1 Interest Assessment

How interested are you in $interest?                                    [1-10]

How knowledgable are you in $interest at this point?                    [1-10]

How much time would it take you to become an expert at $interest?         [1-10]

How many people would be willing to pay for your experteese in $interest.[1-10]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The usual choice is simple logicstics, the higher the resultant number the 
better the choice would seem. But if you feel that you really wanna do
something your not quite knowledgeable about at the moment and feel the
want to learn something new before deciding then ya.. self-explanatory.  If 
you feel comfortable in your decision then its time to figure out what
category of buisness your intrest falls into.


(Relating Your Skills to a Buisness Venture)

Buisness are typically cut into three relative areas,  Manufacturing 
Buisnesses, Retail Buisnesses, and  Service Buisnesses, all of which
having their own respective advanatages and disadvantages.

Manufacturing Buisnesses typically have the least competition and the highest
profit margins, yet they have disgustingly large startup fees and costs
associated with managment.  Theres so much to account for when starting a
manufacturing buisness that i honestly wouldnt recommend it unless you have 
enormous financial backing and previous experience.  Both of which this
article assumes your not in possession of, which leads us to the next
logical choice, the Retail Buisness.

Now the Retail Buisness usually specializes in resale stuff.  Think Walmart
and Target and 7-11 etc..  Buisnesses which function off the general
consumer.  These buisnesses are just fucking stupid, and i refuse to even
discuss competing against retail giants.  The only way a Retail Buisness
could possibly become a worthwhile endevor is if you target either
extremely small towns or environments where you dont go into direct
competition with any of the above said giants, or if you offer goods
that cannot be purchaced elsewhere which are in demand.. ie patented
stuff etc etc..

So all in all that leaves us with only one real choice, the service buisness,
the best choice in my oppinion. You need no real product to sell which
means the costs associated with manufacturing your good is really not an
issue at all.  Start-up fees can vary from place to place but usually dont 
exceed $100.00 and all you need is a client base to begin making profits
(which if you posess any tiny ammount of wit really shouldnt be a big deal).
Its amazing that more people dont actually invest the time to create such 
buisnesses, when we talk of deductables in Section 3, accounting, you'll
understand why to an even greater degree.

But in any case ya, choose your poison and continue, im gonna try and 
incorporate the general assumption that you have chosen any of the three
when writing the rest of the paper, so dont worry about my personal oppinion.
Just trying to point ya in the right direction.  Haha.


(Creating a Mission Statement and Buisness Plan)

Ok... so, so far we have an idea and a general outline of the type of buisness
we'll be creating. What comes next is creating a plan of action. 
Something to show to possible future investors what your goals are and 
something to keep you on track with your plans.  I really cant stress
enough how imporatant it actually is to have a well composed Mission
Statement/Buisness Plan.  It helps for recognition later on, of wayfaring and
sidetracking from your original goals.  Mission Statements can
be modified upon idea/epiphanie but make sure you know your sidetracking
will prove benificial.  Make sure you include in your mission statement 
assorted goals and desires for the success of your buisness.  Know the
paths you want to travel, and follow them as explicitly as you can.
Mathmatics will determine your luck, so if your making any changes in your
mission statement make sure they add up.  It is said that risks make for
the most successful of industry tycoons, but im gonna state right fucking now
that RISK ALSO CREATES PAUPERS.  So keep things as stable as possible and try
to follow your buisness plan as to the best of your ability.  Figure 1.2
shows the parts of a standardised buisness plan.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 1.2 Business Plans

Executive Summary
- Synopsis of all the other parts of your buisness plan, typically
  written last, but should be numerically first.

Marketplace Analysis
- The results of a study preformed to determine your target market, and that 
targets succeptability to accept your services/goods.

Competitive Environment
- A study to show whos in direct competition with your company at the time of 
  its composition.

Marketing Plan
- No buisness can possibly succede w/o bringing in customers, so here's where 
  you describe exactly how you plan to
- inform your client base of your intentions and possibly recruit them as actual clients.

Financial Statements
- (assumptions)
-    Your assumptions are your general estimations for profits within a given 
     time frame and the costs associated with aquiring those profits.
- (cash flow)
-    The cash flow aspect of your Buisness Plan just shows where your money is
     going within a said period of time.
-    Usually done in monthly increments.  This part of your plan can actually 
     be included within your assumptions
-    but for reasons involving convention should actually be given its own 
     place.

Appendixes
- This is where you place varied information regarding your buisness, possibly
  to keep full documentation of ideas
- mentioned earlier in the buisness plan.  Your appendixes are usually used 
  for holding information that is either
- too lengthy to be placed in the earlier sections, or have no real other 
  place to be mentioned in the plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So ya.. use that table to actually compose your buisness plan and whatnot.  
Make sure your analysis is accurate or do i really even need to state
that, it is your money after all.  Haha.. but ya.. after you've comprised your
buisness plan the next logical step, if everything seems peachy, is to 
possibly take a week or so to contemplate what your doing.  Understand
the responsibilitys your about to place on yourself, and make sure your ready
to set your feet in the water.  Once you feel you have a firm
understanding of your own buisness plan and you feel ready to progress
then by all means, progress.  The next part of this guide is aimed at taking
those internal clockworkings and turning them into actual mechanized
gears.


[Setting Your Plans Into Motion]



(Obtaining Capital)

There are quite a few ways to obtain capital when starting a buisness as you 
are probabaly aware of.  You have loans, investors, your personal bank
account, personal credit, stocks you can sell, donations, etc.  Just remember
that with borrowed capital, your ass is on the line.  If things go awry you 
have no recourse except to deal with your losses and possibly lose
personal equity.  Using your own monetary resources is definately the path to
larger profits, but is not something to be taken lightly.  If you have the 
money and feel that if you lost the capital it wouldnt impact you
heavily than its the way to go.  If you'd rather not put your finances on the
line then typically the general idea is to get someone else to do it for
you.

Investors are usually looking to actually put their asses on the line for you
but a share of the buisness in the end, goes into their pockets. 
Take for example an investor who's willing to give you 10% of your reqired 
startup costs for 10% of all profits that go thru your company. Now in
the case of a manufacturing buisness that might sound pretty good if
your startup costs are somewhere around $10 million, i mean that kind of 
capital is hard to come by.  But on the other hand if your startup costs are 
only $2,000 and your your investors are putting up $200 for a buisness 
that will make over $5,000 a month its ludacris to think that you'd be giving
$500 back to your investor every month there after for his original
investment of only $200.  So ya, it really depends on your buisness and your 
situation, etc.



(Obtaining a Fictious Name Licence)
(Obtaining a Resale License)
(Obtaining a Buisness License)

For these next sections, due to their variations between U.S. States im gonna
recommend you call SCORE.  The acronym stands for Service Core of Retired
Executives and actually is a government funded program.  Your tax dollars
at work, heh.   But ya in any case they can direct you on how to obtain said 
licenses in your state, and will give you anything reqired to obtain them
besides the actual fees associated with them, which also vary state
to state.  The number for contacting SCORES as of the writing of this paper 
is:

1-800-827-5722

Besides telling you where to obtain these licenses they also give general 
advice and are usually old decrepid bastards looking to just generally
converse with anyone.  This is because of the fact that their signifigant
others usually have left them by this point on account of their analy 
rententive buisness practices.  Ya, its worth a call. But ya anyway, once
you have those three licences your pretty much a buisness in all respects, 
except for the fact that you have no actual buisness yet.  The next section 
deals with actually dealing with your buisness when you actually get some
and what you need to keep as far as record keeping goes and likewise what 
you can disgard.




[Managment and Accounting/Record keeping]



(Accounting Methods)
Two systems of accounting are used for record-keeping purposes, cash basis and
accrual basis.  Which one will be best for your buisness depends on your
sales volume, the legal form under which you operate, and whether you extend
credit.

In cash basis accounting, you do buisness and pay taxes according to your real
time cash flow.  Cash income begins as soon as you ring it up on the
register or recieve it by check.  Expenses are paid as they occur.  Both 
income and expences are put on the books and charged to the period
in which they are paid or recieved.  You can also defer income to the
following year as long as it isn't actually or constructively recieved by you
in the present year. A check recieved by you in the present year but not
cashed until the following year is still income to you for the present
year.  Therefore, if you want to shift income to the following year, you will
either have to delay billing untill the following year or bill so late in
the present year that a present-year payment is unlikely.

If you want to accelerate expenses to the present year, you should pay those
bills recieved and log them as the present year year's expenses.  An
expense charged to your credit card will count as an expense in the year it
was charged and not when you pay the card company.

On the other hand, with accrual basis accounting, income and expenses are 
charged to the period to which they should apply, regardless of whether
money has been recieved.  For instance, if you are a contractor using accural 
basis accounting and have done work for which you haven't been paid, you
recognise all expenses incurred in connection with that contract during
the period in which it was supposed to have been completely paid and expensed,
regardless of whether you have been paid for it yet.  Its a more
logically structured approach to accounting and takes into consideration
for estamatitive accounting, which really in the end saves you time.  This is
my preferred method but again, my oppinion is just that, my oppinion. 
Either method works so ya.. whatever.

(Record Keeping)

Double-entry bookkeeping is the preferred method of keeping buisness records. 
You would first enter transactions in a journal, then post monthly totals
of the transactions to the appropriate ledger accounts.  There are five 
categorigories of ledger accounts respectively being, Income, Expenses,
Assets, Liability, and Net worth.  Each of these seperate accounts
contain the information corrosponding to the accounts themselves 
(ie. putting incoming transactions into income, and expenditures in
expenses, etc etc).  At the end of each fiscial year or accounting period, 
accounts are balanced and closed. The income and expense accounts are
transferred to the income statement for use in the summary of revenue and 
expenses.

Its extremely important that you have records for almost every transaction due
to the possibility of audits of your businesses tax deductions etc. 
Getting caught with your pants down, although fun at  times when with a
female companion, can grow afully tiresome when your pants are actually
around your fettered ankles and theres some fucking man beast named killer 
attacking you from behind with no escape from his ravishings.  Dont
i just paint a fucking lovely picture.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 3.1 Records to keep
1. Sales Records
2. Cash Recipts
3. Cash disbursements
4. Accounts Receivable
5. Capital Equipment
6. Insurance
7. Payroll
(*) You should also keep copies of all federal income tax returns. (*)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:

The automation of the recording and preperation of such data is also a 
terrific boon to any business and within the next few months I will be
developing some open source software possibly to preform said tasks if i cant 
find any already in the public domain.


(Taxation and Deductables)

As a buisness owner and employer, you will be responsile for collecting 
various state and federal taxes and remitting theses to the proper
agencies.  In addition, you will be required to pay certin taxes yourself.  
These are givens.  As far as the actual taxes your required to pay to
keep your butt killer free, they are as follows in Figure 3.2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure 3.2 Taxation

Income Taxes - If you have employees, its the actual ammount to withhold
               from their paychecks. 

Social Security (FICA) Tax - Percentages vary with the size and income of
                             your buisness.

State Payroll Taxes - Again, only applicable if you have employees.

Sales Taxes - The sales tax is only applicable to sold goods in most
              cases,  not sold services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a sole propriator of a buisness there is really no special taxes to pay 
besides those stated above.  You apply for a federal ID number and your
pretty much set.  The income from such a buisness flows through the owner 
(ie you) into an individual tax return.  Seeing how state taxes differ
from place to place its usually a good idea to contact the IRS as to find out 
what taxes you need to pay explicitly, to avoid possible oversight.

With all these taxes one might think that owning a buisness is a ludacris 
venture with only minimal profitability.  This is the presupposition of
an unweary mind.  The main plus to owning a buisness besides the ability to 
make an income without having to hear shit from an asshole of a boss is
the idea of TAX DEDUCTIONS.  hah!.. You can in all actuallity write off damn 
near anything pertaining to your buisness.  Planning a trip to vegas, use
the company car for the trip and meet a client there. Deduct the cost of
your lodgings as a buisness expense.  Deduct the cost of dinner as a buisness 
expense (note: currently only 50% of entertainment expenses are
deductable, the remaining 50% is not deductable but still, that 50% cheaper).
Deduct everything pertaining to the buisness as a buisness expense.  As
long as you maintain proper documentation and the corresponding 
accounting you should have no problem easily getting back what you've paid 
for in taxes.  Also because im short on time at the moment im not gonna
cover depreciation but i highly recommend you look into it to take advantage 
of the maximum allowable deduction permitted by law.


(Managing Finances)

As far as managing your finances goes, theres really not much to be said 
except to make sure you dont flagrantly waste your resources. Invest
whayt you can back into the buisness making more of your current situation.  
There will be time for flagrant spending later when your ultimately
successful and overwhelmingly wealthy.  So ya, dont go out and get the lease 
to own mercedes with your first monthly income.  Take your time, and make
sound wise investments they ultimately will all in all benifit only you in 
the end.


(Conclusion)

To conclude this first version id like to state that yes it is a rough 
overview of buisnesses in general and again i have no actual buisness
background myself.  But im taking steps even as i type to change that, to 
better myself and those i associate myself with by understanding standard
buisness practices and the likes there in.  And again.. i will be updating 
this guide with my experiences and such with any change or understanding. 
I wouldnt use this guide at the moment to start a buisness of your own.  Im 
just trying to get your gears rotating, to possibly intrest you in
buisness and get you to actually do your own homework.  I plan to make this 
guide quite a bit more comprehensive in the near future and possibly
include buisness software/templates to make this process a relatively painless
process. Think of me as your own personal buisness Jesus, ill nail myself
to a plank and let you reap the benifits.  haha.. k.. i got shit to do.

/* Digital Ebola <digi@legions.org> */



Another one got busted today
Not for what you would think
I nod my head in silence, yet I am crying inside
Another idea stolen
Another idea lost
Another advance defeated

I stand in the mall 
and I see sheep
The flock doesnt know, and the flock doesnt care
I am not like you
I want to know where something comes from
I want to know how something works
I watch the flock blindly consume what it doesnt understand

My world is not like your world
I scream out, but none of you will listen
when I do something creative 
it gets stolen, or shoved aside
You do not care 
You only care about the almighty dollar
You will stop at nothing to preserve it

I give you my ideas freely
You give me the DMCA
I give you information security
You give me the Patriot Act
I have been called every name in the book
smartass, hacker, cracker, terrorist
You give me a hat and a cliche

This madness has to stop
Information no longer wants to be free
Information IS free
No matter what you do to quench it
you squash 1 idea
and 1000 more ideas will take its place
Why fight it?

This is and has always been our world
You fear what you do not understand
You steal what you cannot dream
Your lawyers fight until the end
Your money flows to what you think is the problem
But I am not the problem
YOU are the problem. 
YOU are scared and you want control
In our world, WE have the control
We hold the ideas and we carry the keys
In this digital world of mortals 
we walk as gods

We will not back down
You can fight us, you can jail us 
you can quote your DMCA to us
You can force code off one site 
and it will be mirrored a million times
This world is full of people like me
Awkward, antisocial, rebellious
For I am hacker, one that uses his mind for any idea
Not your bought-out media's definition
but something that you will never comprehend
You will never control what we say or think
You will never win against us all
This is our new manifesto 
and while you may silence me
You wont get us all.
