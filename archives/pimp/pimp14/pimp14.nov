         1.  Editorial - Chicago Homegrown

×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×x×

         .... Over the pass 7 or so years i've been "around" the h/p
scene, i've seen alotta changes.. for years i saw the europe scene
boom outta control and i saw bbses here that went from 500 new 
messages a day down to 10 new messages a day over a weeks period.. 
things are wacky in the world.. the underworld has so many benefits 
for those that dwell within.. however there are downfalls.  these 
include annoying irc kiddies and pompous eleetists.. essentially they 
are just kids who want not only an identity, but THEE identity.

   well, i'm bored with the whole rat race aspect of the scene..
i've always just been in it for the "being in the know" aspect of it
all.. and basically that is what we all need to realize; if you really
want to be a part of any society, you must respect it and hold a 
decent understandin of how it works before you dive in and try to act
the socialite.  slowly you will become part, and you will be in the
know.. in the chicago h/p vicinity.. i'm one of the sysops of 
apocalypse 2000.. the board has had good times and bad times.. right
now it's going thru a pretty decent time message activity wise.. but
the activity pertains to things not all too underworld related..
about 97% of the original h/p affiliated users we had ceased calling
since the board first went up about 5 years back.  i don't know if
chicago peoples tend to have identity crisis'  and just keep changin'
their handles or if people are just dying off from the scene, while
the new kiddies enter after catchin the movie hackers.. 

    all i can say is.. i'm glad i've stuck around and although the 
scene isn't all that active in chicagoland for it being such a large 
city, i know i have benefitted from being here.. and i basikally wrote
this just to tell the chicago scene to respect what you have and 
utilize it.. many h/p peoples i know aren't so fortunate.. being in 
little hick towns and easily findable.  we have so many resources in 
chitown it's insane to think so much of them are going to waste.  keep
with the scene, keep the boards alive.. keep the convo alive.. and try
to be as active as you can or you may just see big brother win. yeah..
i'll stop bitchin' now. 

   what we got for youse in dis here mag.. is good stuff.. for 
starters.. we have a mondo-huge acronym list.. in relation to 
telephony, radio, computer, and other interesting items to read
about.. i feel like we've become a huge glossary/acronym mag..
you'll understand what i mean.. in the next few issues i have a 
500k cellular glossary i'm going to release.. anyways.. we then
gots a huge cdma glossary.. and although this does probably
overlap with the acronym list a little.. don't cry because of some
redundancies.. the cdma glossary is in reference to Code Division
Multiple Access, the digital telephony service offered thru providers
such as PrimeCo and Sprint.(ref:issue 11).. at the bottom there's 
always some news regarding technology, busts.. and whatever.. and 
then comes the bbs listing.

next issue will have the bank info and recon info we promised for
this issue.. things happened.. things are moving slow.. not good..
but we will have them for the next issue..  of course, the following
next issue will most likely have the phatass cellular glossary and
we'll prolly leave it at that for that issue. the following issue
will have a background on how to use a SecurID card and dialup and
other good stuff too.. really.

later peoples - fringe pimpin'

     for user and signaling traffic. The term Traffic Channel implies a
     Forward Traffic Channel and Reverse Traffic Channel pair. See also
     Forward Traffic Channel and Reverse Traffic Channel.

Traffic Channel Preamble
     A sequence of all-zero frames that is sent at the 9600 bps rate by the
     personal station on the Reverse Traffic Channel. The Traffic Channel
     preamble is sent during initialization of the Traffic Channel.

Transmit Objective Loudness Rating
     (TOLR) A perceptually weighted transducer gain of telephone
     transmitters relating sound pressure at the microphone to voltage at a
     reference electrical termination. It is normally specified in dB
     relative to one millivolt per Pascal. See IEEE Standard 269-1992, IEEE
     Standard 661-1979, CCITT Recommendation P.76, and CCITT Recommendation
     P.79.

Trunk
     A communication path between two switches that carries one telephone
     call. Each digital trunk occupies one DSO.

U Interface
     A two-wire interface required by the FCC (not CCITT) between the Local
     Exchange Carrier (LEC) and the customer's NT1. Specification completed
     during 1Q87 by ANSI T1D1.3.

UNI
     See User Network Interface .

Unique Challenge-Response Procedure
     An exchange of information between a personal station and a base
     station for the purpose of confirming the personal station's identity.
     The procedure is initiated by the base station and is characterized by
     the use of a challenge- specific random number (i.e., RANDU) instead of
     the random variable broadcast globally (RAND).

Unique Random Variable
     (RANDU) A 24-bit random number generated by the base station in support
     of the Unique Challenge-Response procedure.

Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
     An internationally agreed-upon time scale maintained by the Bureau
     International de l'Heure (BIH) used as the time reference by nearly all
     commonly available time and frequency distribution systems i.e., WWV,
     WWVH, LORAN-C, Transit, Omega, and GPS.

Universal Personal Telecommunications (UPT)
     The CCITT term for the network architecture and capabilities to support
     PCS.

UPT
     See Universal Personal Telecommunications.

User Network Interface (UNI)
     Point of access by the customer to the ISDN (narrowband or broadband)
     network.

UTC
     Universal Temps Coordine. See Universal Coordinated Time.

Visitor Location Register (VLR)
     An entity which provides a temporary register for subscriber
     information for a visiting subscriber. Often a part of the MSC.

Voice Privacy
     The process by which user voice transmitted over a CDMA Traffic Channel
     is afforded a modest degree of protection against eavesdropping over
     the air.

Virtual Private Network (VPN)
     Uses information stored in the signaling network regarding customer
     configurations and dialing plans to allow the use of public network
     facilities as if they were dedicated to a specific private network.
     Usually includes special billing arrangements, company specific dialing
     plans and some limited end-to-end feature transparency.

VLR
     See Visitor Location Register.

VPN
     See Virtual Private Network.

WACS
     Wireless Access Communications System.

Walsh Chip
     The shortest identifiable component of a Walsh function. There are 2N
     Walsh chips in one Walsh function where N is the order of the Walsh
     function. On the Forward CDMA Channel, one Walsh chip equals 1/1.2288
     MHz, or 813.802 ns. On the Reverse CDMA Channel, one Walsh chip equals
     4/1.2288 MHz, or 3.255 µs

Walsh Function
     One of 2N time orthogonal binary functions (note that the functions are
     orthogonal after mapping '0' to 1 and '1' to -1).

WARC
     See World Administrative Radio Conference.

World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC)
     A World Conference called by the CCIR to get international 
     agreement on Spectrum Allocation.

Zone-Based Registration
     An autonomous registration method in which the personal station
     registers whenever it enters a zone that is not in the personal
     station's zone list.

Is no news good news? not really.. there is news.. but i haven't
bothered to get it together for this issue.. however.. there is

Local News <+> 10/97

	Jello Biafra, the main SysOp of Apocalypse 2000, has left for
Israel.  He will be there for approximately two years and hopefully
won't get shot.  Now, normally, I don't think he would get shot except
for the fact that he is enlisted into their military.  As we get back
interesting stories from him and what not.. we will relay the info.. 
however at this time we do not have any means of communication to 
reach him where he is at.. you can send him email thru pimp@dope.org 
or to subhuman or fringe on the board.. we will forward it to him as
soon as we can.. and please.. make sure it's not something stupid like
"hey what's up dood?" because it's not worth our stamps.  Jello will
be back in the spring for a short visit.. and we will most likely be
having a huge gathering for this event.  for more information please
hit this site:  http://www.dope.org/fringe/apoc.html, the apocalypse
home page.  If we can get a fone number to reach him at, there will
be a teleconference set up for peoples to dialin to.
