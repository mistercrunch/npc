    Welcome to the biggest cellular glossary you will
    ever need.. hopefully this will teach people cellco
    jargon and maybe help them understand things better.
    
    When pimp received this file, there were no marks
    on it as to who owned it or whether or not it was
    considered confidential.. so it isn't.. it's just
    definitions that are hard to get.

     One of the major interfaces from the MSC. Connects the MSC to the SC
     9600 system at the CBSC XC. The interface is comprised of E1 or T1 span
     lines. Each span line represents a single carrier, and provides a
     number of timeslots which can be used for signaling links with BSSAP
     (LAPD or LAPB) control or traffic circuit channels as required.

Abbreviated Mobile Usage Record (ABMUR)
     The record sent to the billing medium in each machine that a mobile
     passes through, with the exception of the originating switch. It
     contains the originating switch, current switch, air time on this
     switch, and a few other essential fields for correlating back to the
     original record. This record is an operator's receipt for air time used
     on his switch.

ABEND
     Abnormal ending of a process.

ACB

     Information.

ACIA
     Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter

ACK
     Acknowledgement.

Acknowledge (ACK)
     (1) The ACK signal is an active low pulse from the active Control Bus
     Interface (CBI) to the Switch Matrix Processor (SMP). The signal
     indicates that the board(s) addressed for the current bus cycle have
     responded. Failure to receive the ACK signal during control bus state 7
     causes the requesting SMP to generate a bus timeout interrupt. (2) A
     message sent from a mobile to a base site to indicate that it has
     received a page.

Acknowledged Alarm
     The operator has an acknowledged alarm condition, but the condition
     itself has not yet been resolved. The audible alarm (for this alarm) is
     turned off. However, the alarm status remains on until the alarm
     condition is resolved. The audible alarm will remain on if there are
     other posted unacknowledged alarms.

Active-Duplex (ACT-DUP)
     This is an EMX twin processor and control system state in which the
     processor performs the normal active processor functions. These
     functions include, but are not limited to:

   * All call processing activities.
   * All human/machine activities.
   * And all data collection activities.

In addition to:

   * Monitors the standby processor alarms.
   * Executes sanity checks on the standby processor.
   * Formats and sends checkpointed data for data base updates (as
     required).
   * Responds to standby processor reconfiguration directives.
   * Manages twin processor Dynamic-Duplex fault detection exercises between
     the active and standby processors.

Active Operation
     This mode of operation implies that the system can properly complete a
     significant percentage of call attempts. If the operator places the
     system in a state (by removing the second of a dual processor pair)
     that prevents the processing of telephone traffic, it is not active but
     still on-line. The Administration Complex is not required for the
     processing of telephone traffic and may not be operational, although
     the system may be active.

Active Process
     Process which is executable by having its entry in the active process
     table set. (See Active Process Table.)

Active Process Table
     Table which indicates for each process:

   * Whether the process is active in the processor containing the table,
   * Whether the process is active in the other processor of the pair, and
   * Any special activity restrictions, such as active for initiation only,
     etc.

Active Processor
     The processor in control of a node.

Active-Simplex (ACT-SIMP)
     This is an EMX twin processor and control system state in which the
     processor performs the normal active processor functions. These
     functions include, but are not limited to:

   * All call processing activities.
   * All human/machine activities.
   * All data collection activities.

In addition, if the node/system is in static-duplex, it monitors the
following:

   * Standby processor alarms.
   * Execution of sanity checks on the standby processor.
   * Response to standby processor reconfiguration directives.

     The severity level of the alarm condition. The values are minor, major,
     and catastrophic.

Alarm Display
     The top five lines of the CAMP screen are reserved for the alarm
     notification display. The minor, major, and catastrophic alarm counts
     and an alarm text for the most recently posted unacknowledged ON alarm
     of the highest alarm class are displayed for each alarm type. There is
     also a frame alarm.

Alarm Indicator Messages
     Messages sent to EMX alarm and status panels to turn off various LEDs
     or audible alarms. Alarm messages can also be printed on the
     teleprinters.

Alarm Indicators
     Messages sent to EMX alarm and status panels to turn on or off various
     LEDs or audible alarms.

Alarm and Status Electronics Board (ASEB)
     The ASEB is located at the rear of each alarm and status cage. It
     accepts display data in a differential mode from the alarm and status
     interface board, decodes the display module address and forwards the
     TTL display data to the Alarm and Status Lamp Module (ASLM) and Alarm
     and Status Switch Module (ASSM).

Alarm and Status Electronics and Relay Board (ASERB)
     The ASERB is located at the rear of each alarm and status cage. It
     accepts display data in a differential mode from the ASI card, decodes
     the display module address, and forwards the TTL display data to the
     ASLM and ASSM boards. It also provides an interface between the EMX and
     the customer audible and visual alarm circuitry. The board includes
     eight Form-C relays whose contacts may be configured either normally
     closed or open as required.

Alarm and Status Handler (ASH)
     A group of software processes that report the results of activities
     performed by devices which have been affected by maintenance commands,
     as well as reports changes in service states due to failures and
     reports changes in the base site controller mobile communications
     interface via the Alarm and Status Panels (ASP) RF channel display.
     These processes use translation tables for the generation of
     teleprinter messages and activating lights on the Alarm and Status
     Panel (ASP) LED displays.

Alarm and Status Interface (ASI)
     Two ASI cards are used in the Maintenance and Status Unit (MSU). One
     ASI card is associated with the Maintenance Processor (MPROC) and the
     other with the System Status Register (SSR). There are two main
     functions provided by the ASI board. The first is to provide a Watchdog
     Timer (WDT) to the processor with which it is associated. Secondly, ASI
     provides TTL to differential conversion and multiplexes the display
     address and data information to the Alarm and Status Electronics Board
     (ASEB) or Alarm and Status Electronics Relay Board (ASERB).

Alarm and Status Lamp Module (ASLM)
     A card in the Alarm and Status Panel (ASP) which provides alarm and
     system status displays under control of the Maintenance and Status Unit
     (MSU).

Alarm and Status Panel (ASP)
     An indicating display which has specific information concerning the
     state of alarms and status in the system.

Alarm and Status Switch Module (ASSM)
     A card in the alarm and status panel which provides alarm and system
     status displays under control of the Maintenance and Status Unit (MSU).
     This card also provides facilities for manually operated switch inputs
     to the system.

Alarm Maintenance Multiplexer (AMM-1)
     Serial digital I/O interface which monitors all power supplies, fuses,
     circuit breaker distribution, and the system power plant. Also provides
     audible and visual alarm indications.

Alarm Management
     A subsystem that provides reference information on monitoring and
     managing alarms and events from the Craft Workstation that occur on the
     TSCP-2000 node.

Alarm Message
     A printed report on the system maintenance teleprinter indicating a
     status change, reconfiguration or alarm of a component of the EMX. Some
     alarm messages may be accompanied by changes in the Alarm and Status
     Panel light display.

Alarm Multiplex Communication Adapter-1 (AMCA-1)
     Board Provides the interface between the AMM-1 and COM-1 Boards and
     controls the audible alarm.

Alarm Relay Interface (ARI) Card
     The ARI card is the interface between the EMX and the customer audible
     and visual alarm circuitry. This board incorporates the watchdog timer
     circuitry and functions as if it were two Alarm and Status Interface
     (ASI) circuits on one board except the address and data information
     controls relays rather than displays. The board provides eight Form-C
     relays. Contacts may be configured for normally open or normally
     closed, as required by the customer interface. (These boards have been
     deleted in later systems.)

Alarm MUX
     A serial interface device for monitoring inputs and outputs. It
     consists of an alarm multiplex communication adapter (AMCA) and up to
     128 alarms maintenance multiplexers (AMM). The AMCA is controlled via a
     COMM-1 on the maintenance bus. Typically, each equipment frame houses
     one AMM. One output of each AMM is connected to a frame fault light. An
     output of one of the AMMs is reserved for the audible alarms and three
     outputs of another for the alarm lights. Inputs are used to monitor
     miscellaneous alarm conditions at each frame.

Alarm Panel
     A device mounted to the front of one of the equipment frames. It
     contains the audible and visual alarms.

Alarm Status
     The status of an alarm is either ON, OFF, acknowledged (ACK), or
     unacknowledged (UNACK).

Alarm Reports
     Printed output resulting from hardware or software fault conditions.
     Reports are formatted by teleprinter executive software and printed at
     assigned teleprinters.

Alarm Severity
     One of five levels of severity associated with an ALARM, STATUS or
     RECON message printed on the system maintenance teleprinter. The level
     of alarm severity of the message is indicated by the presence of 0 to 4
     asterisks preceding the alarm message, as follows:

   * Major 1
     System is down, all call processing capability lost (****).

   * Major 2

     checkpointed periodically, as required, and only processed data is
     checkpointed. When checkpointing is turned-on, information is updated
     in write-protected memory on the active side of the EMX, identical data
     are entered into the corresponding write-protected memory on the other
     side. The checkpointing function is turned on or off automatically by
     the operating software depending upon the current and previous states
     of the processors. For example, checkpointing is not desired and is
     turned off when the two processing systems ("A" side and "B" side)

     being broadcast over the signaling channels. This information is used
     by all mobile units that can "hear" it to determine their status (home,
     roam), and determine how they react to various other pieces of control
     information they see on the signaling channel. The system
     identification is assigned by the FCC and should be unique to every
     system. The only reason this information would need to be displayed
     would be to verify that everyone is in sync within the system (BSCs,
     mobiles, etc.).

Display Topology

     topology may be of interest if handoffs are not functioning properly.
     For example, a cell may be specified in the handoff topology that is
     geographically too far away to be a good handoff candidate. This would
     result in subscribers "ping ponging" between cells. Another reason
     topology may be displayed is when adding or deleting cells that may be
     adjacent to a given cell to ensure they are in or out of the topology
     map.

     sectors of the receive antenna are used to provide diversity. See
     Maximal-Ratio Combining.

Diversity Reception
     Redundant reception method. The use of two RX antenna input signals to
     minimize effects of fading. Depending upon the cell and channel type,
     diversity reception involves either one or two signal pairs. One pair
     is based on the primary antenna plus the stronger of the adjacent
     antennas. Two pairs are based on the primary plus one of each of the
     adjacent antennas. The signals are sent to the XCVR. Pairs are sent to
     master and slave XCVRs. Diversity reception requires duplicate antennas
     in omni configurations.

     subordinate SCPs that are not directly connected and is called the
     standby master. It is ready to take over the master functions in the
     event of failure of the active master or when a command is initiated.

Mobile Acknowledge Timeout

Mobile Attenuation
     The power of DYNA TAC mobile can be adjusted (or attenuated) to one of
     seven discrete power levels. This is done so that when a mobile comes
     closer to a base receiver its power is reduced to prevent the chance of
     interfering with other mobiles operating on the same voice channel in
     another cell. Additionally, this is of even more importance to portable
     units in that it keeps the transmit power at a minimum to increase the
     usage time before the batteries expire. See Mobile Attenuation Value.

Mobile Attenuation Value
     The mobile attenuation table is used for initially estimating what
     power level to give a mobile when it is first assigned a voice channel
     in a cell. The following describes how this works:

   * A mobile accesses the signaling channel indicating an origination
     attempt. In addition to all of the mobile origination data (MIN1, MIN2,
     dialed digits) the signaling processor also gets a power reading on the
     mobile (the mobile broadcasts on the signaling channel at full power).
   * The BSC takes the received power level and starts comparing it with
     power levels in the mobile attenuation table to try to determine how
     much the mobile power should be reduced when it is given the voice
     channel assignment.
   * If, for example, the received mobile power level were 85, the mobile
     power would not be reduced at all when given a channel assignment since
     its power was less than MA1. If its power level were 0D8, it would be
     assigned the channel, and the power attenuated five steps because 0D8
     is greater than MA5.

Signal Bit Processor (SBP-24 or SBP-30)
     The main function of the SBP card is to extract line signaling from
     inbound data and to insert line signaling in outbound data.

Signal-to-Noise Ratio
     The ratio of the magnitude of the signal to that of the noise with no
     signal present, usually expressed in dB.

Signal Operated Noise Adjusting Device (SONAD)
     In some systems, used in the mobile-to-land audio path to minimize the
     audible effects of path loss variations and poor signal-to-noise ratio.

Signal Strength Indication (SSI)
     A value representing the received signal strength for each channel from
     each sector antenna. This value is used by the BSC to determine which
     are the two strongest sectors (so they can be supplied to the
     maximal-ratio combiner in the voice I-F module) and by the EMX to
     determine inter-cell handoffs.

Signaling
     The exchange of electrical information (other than by speech)
     specifically concerned with the establishment and control of connection
     and management supervision in a communication network.

Signaling Channel
     A channel used by a land station to transmit digital control
     information (including pages) to a mobile station, and a radio channel
     used by mobile stations to access a system to obtain service and to
     transmit control data to a land station. The land station's
     transmitting channel is called the forward control channel; the mobile
     station's transmitting channel is called the reverse control channel.

Signaling Channel Controller (SCC)
     In the LD series base station, controls the cell site signaling
     transceiver, decodes and corrects data received from the mobile and
     makes an initial estimate of the mobile's signal strength for use in
     call setup.

Signaling Channel Controller (SIG)
     The SIG ends paging and overhead messages to mobiles under control of
     the site control processor in DYNA TAC systems. It decodes and corrects
     data received from mobiles, and uses information from the RF equipment
     to make an initial estimate of the mobile's direction.

     Used in the DYNA TAC base station to recover signaling data and SSI
     from the calling channel for the BSC.

Signaling Link
     See link.

Signaling Protocol
     The method of coordinating signaling between two switching machines. A
     signaling protocol is used to ensure information about a call is
     transmitted when the receiving machine is prepared to receive the
     information. Under the dial tone signaling protocol, the transmitting
     switch will not pass digits to the receiving switch until the receiving
     switch has returned dial tone. The receiving switch will not return
     dial tone until it has completed the necessary processing, like
     assigning the attaching a digit receiver to prepare for incoming digit
     reception.

Signaling System 7 (SS7)
     An open-ended common channel signaling standard which defines the
     protocol for signaling used by switches within the digital network.
     Used over a wide variety of digital circuit switched networks. Provides
     internal control and network intelligence.

     supervisory signaling.

Single Trunk Circuit Outage
     A class of outage where a single trunk circuit outage affects service
     on an individual circuit originating or terminating on the EMX 2500
     system. This type of outage pertains to a hardware fault of a
     particular trunk interface circuit.

     measurements needed to determine the cell with the best reception (for
     handoffs).
  2. Activates all site control functions (as ordered by the EMX) and sends
     alarm indicators to the EMX. The SSU can communicate with the EMX in
     two ways: either via a data line, a channel signaling interface, etc.,
     or via a Base Control Unit (BCU) at the same site and a BCU-SSU
     communication link.

     value and will be reported if it is logged. An IPR in the exception
     state has reached its threshold value and will not be reported if it is
     logged again during the remainder of the reporting period. All
     exception IPRs are reset to the enabled state at the end of a reporting
     period (30 minutes). A disabled IPR will not be reported if it is
     logged, and will not be reset to the enabled state at the end of the
     reporting period. An IPR is put into the disabled state via the DISABLE
     IPR MMI or a simplex restart.

     the status of all of its component parts.

Static-Duplex
     A temporary EMX twin processor node and control system mode of
     operation in which the EMX processing system is configured for a high
     level of fault tolerance. The primary purpose of this mode of operation
     is for bringing up new generic software load on a live system. In this
     state, the twin processor nodes maintain independent copies of all data
     stored in the memories of the active and standby processors. Not only
     are call processing and data stores not backed up, but customer and
     system data bases are also kept separate on both sides of each
     processing node. Active and standby processors continuously monitor
     each other's performance. The standby processor is capable of assuming
     complete control of the EMX, but will cause a system restart if it does
     take over. In a takeover by the standby processor, customer features,
     in effect, will be preserved.

EPHEDRA MAY GET GANKED FOR GOOD!!
11/07/97

	Ephedra is an herb which is used for dieting and for stimulation.
For years people have used it for many reasons.  Years back, the 
chicago scene recognized it for it's stimulating effects almost giving
a "rolling effect".  This was experimented with about two years ago
by people in the pimp crew and it worked slightly.  Taking enough of
this herb will make you feel a little different and it is even known
to help induced lucid dreaming.  This is a completely legal herb sold
in most health food and gnc stores. This herb has also been used in 
Herbal Ecstasy, a fake, yet slightly working version of the drug MDMA 
used in real Ecstasy.  It may be true that the uprise of "herbal e" 
has led to this accusations and warnings issued by the government.
You can still find herbal ecstasy at most raves in chicago, although
it's popularity is dying out due to the high price for the low roll.
MDMA still proves much more sincere to the effects of ecstasy.

	Early this November, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 
decided to issue warnings against this herb, and as a result many
stores are pulling it off of their shelf.  CNN (Cable News Network)
had a talk show over this to notify the world of these warnings. The
FDA is saying the drug is linked to cardiac (heart) problems and quite
possibly has even lead to some deaths.  Since it is not an illegal
substance in any aspect, it has not been banned; but most likely it
will be.  CNN actually discussed Ephedra Phen-Phen, or something to
the sort of that name, a drug utilizing Ephedra for dietary purposes.
The FDA felt it will severely damage, if not kill, dieters.
Once again, it's a case of whether or not people should listen to the 
government trying to tell you what is right or listening to what you 
know personally. Hopefully the choice remains with the people.
