                          .Anti-Social Magazine.
			      .Instalation.

        This is really easy and you will easily figure it out but just 
in case someone out there gets stuck here's a quick run through.
                1.) Create a new Directory  e.g. A-S
                2.) Place the A-S.zip file into that directory
                3.) Unzip the file  e.g. with PKunzip
                4.) Run by typing "a-s" from dos 
				or
                    Go to that directory and click on the A-S.exe icon.

Notes:
         Anti-Social Mag is 3 files
			A-S.exe    -the main program
		        IssueX.dat -Essential DON'T delete
			register.exe -Reuseable from issue to issue.

register.exe
	On its own this won't do anything at all but A-S.exe checks for its
presence in its directory, if it ain't there then it won't run the mag.
Once you've downloaded your first copy of the magazine -Issue 1- or have
downloaded the viewing software on its own.  You'll have a copy of a-s.exe & 
register.exe  and you can just use those files over and over again with every 
issue you download.   This will reduce your download time by 2/3's for future 
issues.   Just put the register.exe & in a-s.exe the directory of the issueX.dat 
file of the mag you want to read and your ready to read.


IssueX.dat
	Don't fuck with this because its where A-S.exe gets its infomation
from.  A damaged .dat file will result in a damaged copy of the magazine. 
                X= the issue of the magazine  e.g. Issue2.dat
