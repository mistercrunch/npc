    At long last, welcome to Blackzine 7.


Okay, so it's fuckin late. It's been more than late. It sorta died.  I know most of you have bitched at me at some point or another. Anyhow, it takes work, when you're almost all alone. It takes the ability to sit down and finish what you start. I'm lazy and got into other stuff
for a little while. Vacation is over. I guess I'm back. I've also run out of excuses.

Greets out to Phone Phantom who's submitted another file again.. It's been a while, so I'm
going to talk for a while. I've been through a lot since the last issue about a year ago.. Traveled a bit.. Seen some of the people behind the phone. Been in touble on more than one occasion. Greetz out to Childzplay for the ascii. Looks like I may have another perm ascii 
artist here.

The website is new since the last issue. It's been out a while now, I threw a counter up and
I'm getting some hits.. Kinda cool. Now you get to see how much interest there is in my stuff.
Man o man.. I have another purpose for this stuff. Check out the personals section on my
website. Take some time at least to check it out (http://poz.8m.com). You may be able to
find a couple of people within your area. You may also want to add yourself so that other
people can find you as well. I'd suggest checking out Phone Phantoms website, as well
as everyone elses on there. Check out Childzplay's site as well.

People! We have had 2600 meetings for quite some time. They died, now they're alive again.
Here's some advertising for the Alberta 2600 meetings.. Calgary also made it onto the 2600 list.
It's about goddamn time. Years ago, we had three times as many people who would show up, 
and they refused to put us in due to either ignorance on their part, or stupidity on our part.
I'm still not sure.

Calgary: Eau Claire Market Milk Wall (by the Garage Bar), 5:30 - whenever, usually
with some activites afterwards for whoever wants to join in. I advertise this on my
website as well. Http://poz.8m.com in the lower right hand corner. Click on 2600 on my page.
I have a big fuckin picture of it so you can't come up with bullshit excuses.

If you're in Edmonton: Sidetrack Cafe, 10333 112 Street, 4 - 7pm Go visit the
HackCanada (www.hackcanada.com) website.

Someone asked me to throw this in at some point. Not sure who, and I don't know who
the contact name is.. There is no website for this either. 
Halifax, Nova Scotia: it starts at 7:00pm. Place is the Scotia Square food court.

What's comming up next? I've started BkZ 8. I want to do some type of a Voice Mail
Security Advisory. Mabye a movie or something. Expect a BBS to go up some lifetime.
Dialup and Telnet. 

So here is the works, after all that long winded bullshit.. I don't know if it was 
worth waiting a year for. Probably not, but nevertheless I hope you enjoy this issue
of Blackzine 7. Please note that all files herein have been scribed by myself unless
otherwise stated.

Well, at long last, over the past while, I took the liberty to scan out a good portion of the 800's and some local numbers within Calgary. Some are probably dead. Some probably aren't dead. Oh well. I hand scanned every single fucking number out there. Also, for those of you within
the Calgary area I included a summary of all the carriers found within the 530 (Telus) prefix. This was done with a little work, so as not to attract some attention to ourselves. 

Also, in case that didn't give you enough fun to look through, after that scan, I included
the normal part of the WATS! section: a bunch of numbers which I haven't a clue where I got,
but since they were here in some directory when I started the file again, I figure I may as
well use it. Anyhow.. Keep in mind that these were all hand skanned.. Why did I start 
something this crazy? Well, believe it or not, I was looking for a loop, and it just continued onwards. Out of all that fucking work, however, I didn't find a single one. Loops, or tie
lines, (as I know them) are obviously not held within the 800-xxxx-9995-0000 range.

Of course, there are some secret numbers out of it all which I left out.. If you want the other numbers I left out badly enough, catch me somewhere and give me a reason why you want them, and if I can find the sheet of paper they're on, I'll send them too you.

Now, for greets for this section. I should give definate shout outs to Phone Phantom, Blotch, Dismaster, the Zencor crew, and Nitro. The Interceptor (of 423), Mega Elite, Iconoclast and
a few others off of both the Defcon voice bridge and the 2600 voice BBS really kept me 
going on those hours of scanning. I can see some of you reading the greets over again..
Yea, Mega Elite is in there.. Haven't laughed at someone like that in a while. Never met
a wanna be elite hacker of cable TV either. Anyhow, I probably would have given up on this skanning stuff if it wasn't for your conversation and attitude towards others in the scene.

This file was started about two years ago. I made it about halfway, and only recently have undertaken the project again to complete it. This is what came out of all of 800-XXX-9995 
- 9999 numbers. This is my prefix skanning. 

800 numbers per prefix, that would give you around, 4000 numbers which were manually scanned. Greets out to dismaster, who dissappeared so long ago for scanning part of 9997 with me. All of these were scanned from 403 and this was a project which took a long time.. The numbers I had abused in these suffixes, are no longer available for your enjoyment. Mabye you were looking
for numbers? Here they are.. Lots to fuck with so you don't have to look for them yourself.
It's released now, so its still fresh. I didn't abuse much of the stuff in here.

Along with 800's, I did some scanning around the local Calgary area.
Here are my findings. This was a manual scan from xxx-9995 to 
xxx-0000. Six numbers of the prefix. For a list of prefixes scanned,
go check you phone book accoriding to the area I listed. I'll include
an extra file which you can add into your blacklisted numbers file
from blackzine 3. It'll save you some time when you're scanning. About
five numbers per prefix.

 Legend is the same, TDis is temporairily disconnected. Note that this 
 is all local to Calgary, alberta. The NPA is 403. NFIC is "not in 
 service for incoming calls". The legend for this, is the same as for the
 WATS scan. I also broke it up as to what area the nmber is located in.
 The nearby towns were scanned as well.

Here's a list and scan of all the carriers found within the Telus Prefix of 530
within Calgary. Greets out to Drule Tesseract, Diabolical God (Vivesectionist)
and some guy who's phone line it was done on. I threw in most of my Telus numbers
from my phreak book. These I gathered over the past little while. Everyone I dealt
with directly for some reason or another in Telus had their name and number put in there.

I'm sure most of, if not all of you have seen the movie hackers.. Haxors, you'll all
remember at the very end, had a neat little light show, where he flashed their nicks
with the internal lights of a building. Although it's really got nothing to do with 
haxoring, it's got a bit to do with phreaking. I would have liked to inclued a video 
or a sound clip of this being carried out. I probably will. Mabye in a later issue
if anyone wants me to. Mabye I'll throw that in my movie.

Most of you thought that was a crock of shit and couldn't be done. Surprise surprise..
Although you can't do that, exactly, you can do something similar, where you can flash
and remotely control the lights from an entire building, for either a floor, or certain
sections of a room. If you are quick enough, you can make it look like the entire building strobe, or several floors. It's quite a light show when you look at it from a distance.
Unfortunately, unless you look at it from a distance, you may not get the full effect. 
The company which does the one I am familiar with is Seimens. Their Landis & Staefa 
division handle these systems.

There are programs which have been put in place for various reasons, most of them none
other than to save money. For some buildings, they spend an excess of an average of 
two or three million dollars a year on people who leave their lights on when they go
home from work. That's a lot for something which could be easily solved. They implemented
a system which turns on the lights from one to four hours at a time, and automatically 
shuts off after that. With it, comes zoning, billing, passwords and all the rest.

Other things which are usually implemented in a building, is a maintenance or
shift operator, who's in charge of operations and controlling the entire 
building. They do reports, turn on the AC, adjust heat, boilers etc... Much 
of this can also be controlled remotely. In my city, I have found that public
pools customairily have this implemented. I will cover this later in the article.


Building Automation System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Building Automation System (BAS) will automatically turn lights on and off daily
except for weekends and statutory holidays. In the morning, the lights turn on as per
the set schedule. At nights, they usually stay on until after the cleaning crew covers
their rounds. On weekends, statutory holidays and after hours the Telephone Override 
System (TOS) is to be used for the lights.

To access this, you would have to phone the TOS using any TDMF keypad and phone line..
Being all automated, it has pre recorded messages prompting for a Lighting Zone Number
and then a password. It then prompts for a command, "1 to 4 for the number of hours
the lights should stay on, 5 to turn the lights off, or 0 to cancel the operation".
With each command being followed by the pound sign (#).

The TOS doesn't control the lights during regular hours, but commands can be entered at
any time during the day and will be in effect after the end of the regular time of their
occupancy schedule.

When a system turns the lights at the end of the regular schedule, or at the end where the override command hours are about to end, the lights blink off for a fraction of a second.
It is designed to inform anyone on the floor that the lights will be turning off in a few minutes. It gives someone time to either leave the area, or use the TOS to add more hours.

If you find such a number in your scans, you won't notice it by use of a modem scanner,
since it is all voice. Some companies are kind enough to list this information in their
elevator lobbies (on the floors themselves), usually around the area where a courtesy
phone is available. It may look like a floor plan, with zone numbers, a phone number 
and a password. Write all that information down, and proceed to the next floor. You don't
need to get on the other areas of the floor. If anyone questions you, tell them
you are from building maintenance from Landis & Staefa or Seimens. Nobody should. Anyhow,
see if you can take the elevator to the next floor and proceed with the above plan until
all the floors are done.

Chances are, that if one floor has it, all the others do. If you can find most of them, 
but can't find several, see if you can get a name somewhere on that floor. Mabye find out
what company and go through their voice mail box or something.. go to their mail room after hours.. I dunno. If you can get a name, phone the management for the building and ask for 
that information. "Hi, this is so and so from the 18th floor, from such and such a company..
I can't turn my lights on.. what's my zone and password?" You may also want to try security.
Rent-a-cops making 6-8 bucks an hour aren't usually too bright.


Password Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you 0wn their lighting system... not just yet.. you'll need to change the passwords to seriously fuck around with and possibly bring an entire company to a halt. If people can't
see on a floor, they can't work. That will bring to a stand still anyone it affects and
cause a lot of headaches for people.. Beware.. If you piss someone off enough, they may not
care about the amount of time, money and energy it takes to come after you.

Anyhow it's very important not to lose old and new passwords, becuase if you do, everyone will 
be fucked and will have loads of fun changing them back.

Procedures for changing passwords are as follows:
	
        1) dial into the system
	2) Enter the telephone override ID number for the floor or zone to
           be changed (ex. 102 for the 10th floor, South zone followed by #)
	3) Enter the existing password followed by #
	4) The automation system will prompt the user for a command enter 9, #
	5) At this point, the automation system will prompt the user to enter
           in the new password number
	6) The automation will ask to enter the new password again
	7) The automation system will go back to asking for a command for 1-4 hours
           for the lights. Enter 0, #
	8) "Bad Command" response will occur. Enter 0,# again. And then 0,# again.
	9) The automation will now respond "Bye" and disconnect. The new password 
           will be enabled and the old password disabled.

I haven't had the priveledge of obtaining much information on this.. But, here are some
logs which you may find interesting, funny, or worth your while to scan for. Take a look
at the point value report, and remember that you can control things remotely. Got
ideas? Also note that it goes on for a while (an entire building's worth), so I cut
out a large chunk of it. No big deal.

Message is to send a message. 
Each node is called a cabinet. When you want to send am essage, you have to specify 
the cabinet number or node number you want to send it to. Some places have 15 or 20 
different cabinet numbers, always in sequential order from each other. This doesn't
mean that the system has more than one dial up, but rather it has more than one 
terminal.

I don't see or feel a need to go into everything in great detail. If you're stupid,
you won't have a clue anyways. If you have a couple of cells, you'll be able out 
figure it out once you get in and not kill anyone while dicking around. Keep in 
mind this can be very serious stuff, very fast. If you need help, mail me. Catch me
somewhere. I'll be glad to if I can.

You kids want passwords? Don't ask me for them. Figure out your own ways. I'm
not giving out a key to something like this. I showed you the door, now it's up
to you to open it.


Program Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As before the logs started, each lighting zone has four points associated with it.
The six characters point names are structured to indicate their function. 

The first character is:
L = Zone Control Points 
T = Time of Day Points
C = Charge Out Points
O = Override Timer Points

The next two indicate a floor number
The fourth character is a letter, "S" for South, "W" for West etc..
The last two indicate a zone number between 01 and 04.

The "L" points are points which physically control the lighting zones. Under a normal
schedule, these points will follow the "T" points which are the points controlled by 
the Time of Day schedule.

When someone enters in an override code for the TOS the override time is translated 
into minutes and this value is stored in a corresponding "O" point. If this is done 
during normal hours the command is stored for later execution. If the command is 
entered outside regular schedule an appropriate "L" point will be turned on and the 
lights will turn on for the time duration equal to the value of the "O" point.. In the
same time, the "C" is turned on and stays on for as long as the lights ar on outside the 
regular schedule. The "C" points are totalized in hours and can be used to track after
hours use of lights.

All that so that big buisness and building owners can charge you for the goddamn lights. 
How fucking stingy can you be, considering they jump rent rates everywhere for providing
nothing.

If another override command is entered through the Telephone Override System before the 
override time for the override time for that zone has elapsed, the timer is reset to 
conform to the new command.

In case of emergency, all lights can be commanded on with a single command by commanding 
on point LEALL for the East building or LS for the South building (you get the idea). 
With they are commanded off, the lights return to the status determined by the Time of
Day schedule and or override system.

One last note. I've seen printers printing off everything which happens, so they have 
records of everything. I don't know for sure if it's everything which happens, or just
periodical logs and whatever the maintenance staff desire to be printed, but you have 
been arned in advance.

There's the shit you hear security say on the radio, if they can get their codes right.
The police use this as well.. Of course, there have been times where security guards will
make up their own codes, and use them, which can be a little odd if you are comparing it 
to this text. Unfortunately, I can't give you any real life examples, because that may
link who this is about to who I am, which would not be preferred due to my past 
professions. I haven't seen anything like this for the city of Calgary. There's lots for
the USA, so Canada, here you go.

                               Sky-Tel in Depth
                                  Scribed by 
                              The Phone  Phantom

   In the following article I will attempt too educate you on getting your own
Skytel Box, as well as how too use some of it's many functions. Let me begin by
telling you that phreaking your own box is no easy task, but well worth the effort
if you succeed. In my opinion Skytel is the most versatile, feature packed, 
toll-free VMB System available. Before I begin I would like too apologize too Lord
Narayana for taking so long too write this article, work is taking it's toll.

                           -=Methods Of Obtaining a Box=-
   A couple of methods which have worked for me are social engineering and good
old password guessing. To social engineer a box, simply call Skytel customer 
service (800-SKY-8737)and question them as too why you can no longer access 
your messages. They will ask you your name, which of course you are happy too
give them. The name of course will not match the real owner, and they will grow
suspicious. Answer thier questions, however grow impatient and keep asking them
how such a thing could happen. If this doesn't seem like it's going to work or 
they will not change the access code for you, inform them you are extremly 
disappointed and you must access your messages IMMEDIATELY! (This usually works....)
Since the name that you gave them doesn't match the real subscriber, tell them
it's a company owned box. (Nearly 32% Of all Skytel's are owned by large corporations.)
Let them feed you as much information as possible. Suggesting you are a 3rd party 
consulting firm has worked for me in the past, they usually even surrender the company 
name and or box holders name!

Pasword guessing is accomplished by hitting *Passcode#
Skytel is fairly smart has has enforced only a few restrictions. Just follow this guide.
No sequential numbers, no repeating numbers and your pass cannot contain any part of 
your pin. Passwords must be Minimum 4 digits & max 13 .... 
                                    
                                   -=Sky Codez=-
	Once you have entered your Pin & password successfully heres a command
listing. Remember, if you want out of any
menu, press *

	From the paging menu (#1)
	1#-Send a page
	2#-Time Of Day Page
	3#-Next PIN
	5#-Page Recall
		1#-Retransmit
		2#-Skip Ahead

		7#-Previous
		8#-Redirect
		9#-Reply Directly too PIN
		67#- ANI Of Sender

	Subscriber Funtions
   From the main menu press 20#. This lets you change your personal options. One
of the most important is your personal greetings, after all you want people too 
know who you are right? 

	1# lets you record your greetings
		1# - Your Name
		2# - Pager Greeting
		3# - Skytalk Greeting (If Available)
		4# - Voice Message Greeting
	Press *, too get out of the menu.
	2# - Speak Long or Short Menu's
	3# - Forward Pages/Msgs too another PIN
	4# - Security Menu. Lets you change PIN
	5# - Forwarding
	6# - Enable Disable time Stamping
	* to get out.

   These are just some of the many features that the system offers. However I have
listed the most important/useful. There is also an option within the Skybox that
allows you to Out-Dial. However, I forget the command... <sigh> if you know it, 
please email me.  Well, that just about wraps it up.

Moments of boredom while waiting at work, in someone's office, or anywhere where they
have these popular phones. Here's the features I came up with. This should probably be
used in conjunction with the SL1 file, since they are similar, but I didn't really
feel that it fits in. These codes need no explanation.

                             Trashing at Lord N's

Not too much for this section, as there isn't too much trash that I'd like to share 
with you. Sorry.. better luck next time. Guess you'll have to do some trashing at
my house in the interim to find my neat shit.

Another thing. Seems like a lot of you shits out there haven't a clue what you'd find
trashing.. I took the liberty of going and doing a bit of a log after a trashing run.
July 6-7.
Trashing.. quick run through of the usual strip downtown, didn't find much.
Did find a "mini communication planner" which was k-rad. Pocketful of garbage papers from different companies.. have to do some scanning; looks like a couple of names and passwords
but no dialup.. Guess these people just hired a bunch. And a poster of something.. looks 
like a pipe of some sort. Somewhat alternative I suppose.. Mabye I can get ten bucks for 
it at cash convertors. Nice frame on it though. Found 8 megs of ram, split it with Kweiheri.
It works. Some other junk, a stereo and a tape.. a few mini cassettes. Mostly a useless night. Might make a few bucks off the stuff I found at a pawn shop. Someone found a credit card slip.
Carding is bad, kidz.

Interesting note in some recent garbage.. The Pacific POP revitalization plan
Office Insepction checklist did not did have security listed, but what was listed
was there to ensure that the doors and windows were secure, and that the doors
were equipped with alarms.. That's recent as of August, 1998. So, since it was only
a year ago, I would imagine that nobody has taught them a good lesson yet. Fuck with
AT&T while you can. They now have barbed wire on their fence.. ooooohhh!!! scaaaarrrry.

Nothing for vmb.. just pabx addons. hav to talk with octel it seems.

                Telephone tie trunks and off premises extensions

 Both CNr and CPR in their daily coast to coast operations make great use of
long distance telephone circuits between Headquarters, Regions, Areas, and
Branch Offices.

 For greater convenience and for cost effictive economies in aggregate
telephone tolls, dedicated "telephone tie trunks" are provided by the
Telco. These facilities interconnect between Centrex, PBX offices, and
off premises extensions.

Interconnect
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This should provide some insight into:

Circuit layouts between Centrex and Centrex Offices, Centrex and PBX 
offices, Centrex and off premises extensions, PBX and PBX offices, PBX 
and off premises extensions, levels between indicated test points, and 
the type of signalling used.

Most telephone tie truncks and off premises extensions vary greatly in 
their make up from one circuit to another and that no definite standards
have been reached in this regard. There are many variables involved
when connecting Railway ld telephone trunks or off premises extensions
with telco's, ie: 2 wire, 4 wire, loop dialing, ACRD (AC Ring Down),
simplex or composite signalling...

The Telco does the connections in a way that will invest the least amount 
of equipment to meet their long distance circuit requirements. They provide 
compatible interfacing equipment.

Most interfaces will be on a 2 wire basis, however, in some applications 
4 wires are needed. 2 for voice, and 2 for E&M signalling, or 4 for
voice with simplex signalling.

The choice of equipment/facilities depend on the terminal equipment available
at the telco or telcos involved, trunking equipment at the test center,
signalling at both the telco and test center, loop make up and availability
between the centrex PBX and test center.

Levels
~~~~~~
It should be noticed that at present there is no standard level within the 
Canadian telco's in and out of PBX and Centrex Exchanges when connecting 
with Toll trunks or tie trunks.

A telephone company may have it's own standard, having variations within
it's various Plants, because of different types of equipment used. Refer to
the CLRC cards for circuits involving telephone tie trunks. 

It's just like a Meet Me Conference. It can provide a large conference bridge
and directory number for conferees to dial at a specified time to hold a conference.

To use:

At the specified conference time, all potential conferees dial the conference bridge 
directory number. the conf begins with the first two calls that reach the conf bridge.
When a new conferee is added to the conference, all conferees, excluding the new
conferee, recieve a confirmation tone to indicate that a new conferee has been added.

As a further primary security measure, any conferee may lock out further dialins by
flashing the hookswitch. 

When a conferee disconnects from the conf bridge, a conf tone is sent to the remaining 
conferees to advise them of the change in the number of conferees.

When a conference is in an unlocked state, a flash of the hookswitch by any member of
the conference signals the switch to lock the conference, denying access to any 
subsequent callers. Usually one member of the conf is the leader, or the chairman
and assumes responsibility for locking the conf if required. 

At any time, at least one member of the conf must be a Centron line or a trunk in the 
customer group that owns the meet-me directory number. Because of these constrints,
the DMS100 examines the characteristics of the remaining members of the conf when
a conferee leaves the conf. If the conditions are not met, the conf is taken down
by the switch.

This feature provides a six party conference bridge and directory number for conferees
to dial at a specified time to hold a conference.

To use:

At the specified conference time, all potential conferees dial the conference bridge 
directory number. the conf begins with the first two calls that reach the conf bridge.
When a new conferee is added to the conference, all conferees, excluding the new
conferee, recieve a confirmation tone to indicate that a new conferee has been added.

As a further primary security measure, any conferee may lock out further dialins by
flashing the hookswitch. 

When a conferee disconnects from the conf bridge, a conf tone is sent to the remaining 
conferees to advise them of the change in the number of conferees.

When a conference is in an unlocked state, a flash of the hookswitch by any member of
the conference signals the switch to lock the conference, denying access to any 
subsequent callers. Usually one member of the conf is the leader, or the chairman
and assumes responsibility for locking the conf if required. 

At any time, at least one member of the conf must be a Centron line or a trunk in the 
customer group that owns the meet-me directory number. Because of these constrints, 
the DMS100 examines the characteristics of the remaining members of the conf when a
conferee leaves the conf. If the conditions are not met, the conf is taken down by
the switch.

Anyhow.. a big fuck off goes out to Lucky255 on Dalnet #phreaks because
he killed the code we all used for the one reason that he felt the need
to harrass the owners of the code, and call it collect so he could
talk to his lamer friends.. You and your friends are pretty fuckin lame.
Go waste your own codez.

                     The Phone Book, a Gift for all Time.

Costs for ordering someone a phone book. All your kiddies talk about sending
someone 50 phone books in the mail, or you've probably read about it on PLA
and seen other copys of the file in other zines. Nobody really considered how 
much all this would cost.

With the new year approaching rapidly, we all face the dilemma of buying
gifts for your loved, and not so loved ones.. What better way to show your
appreciation and friendship for a person than a phone book? Even if it's
someone you aren't to fond of, it's an alltime perfect gift for anyone.

(I'm assuming at this point we all know how to call an operator and order
a phone book for someone else. There are plenty of files about it.)

You can contact the Canwest Distributors directly at 1-800-973-2223
(248-6018) and can also complain about your service to Susan Mercier at
530-5530.

I didn't bother to include the Alberta Price list, you might as well bring
them in from further away places, simply because it costs more money, and
causes more hassle on both ends. 

Some of the questions they will ask you, to summarise their schpeel, would
be for an account or invoice number. In this case, make a six or seven
digit or alphanumeric number up. 

A guarantee number, with an expiry. They will obviously ask you for the
customers name, the name of the peron requesting the phone books, as well
as a contact telephone number. Along with that, is the delivery address,
and billing address, where the delivery, is there the books are delivered
to, and the billing address, is where the cost of the books will be billed
to. If you want to cause some havoc, get a credit card number, and give it
to them, if they take credit cards, and have the delievery and billing
addresses at two different locations.

After you give them you information which you have carefully gathered,
they will ask you for  the directory of the province or state (in the
case, province) and you might as well give them a code, quantity, month
and year, so you can sound like you've ordered them before. (althgouht
they might question why you don't have an account setup, it shouldn't be
hard to bullshit yourself out of that one.) They might also end off asking
you how you heard about the foreign directory at Telus. Just them that
you heard about it from someone else, and are just fulfilling a request
form in your company. Other than that, there shouldn't be any problems.

I've always wondered how much such a bill would be, after the dump truck
delivers their newly ordered phone boks to their door. Here's a 97 price

                             Hacking Office Depot

To start out, this was something I had found, hacked and then brought the Clone in on
as a joint project.. This is a (slightly edited) copy of what I had mailed him when I 
explained to thim about the system. I fixed a couple of typos and added a couple of
spaces here and there. Mabye you'll find it useful. It was run-at-the-mouth type of
email. Some of you new kids should find it helpful. Should igve you an idea on what
goes on in every other day of life.

-BOF-

<I removed the email header>

Don't like, pass all this shit to all kinds of people and stuff.. no point in giving 
it out if they aren't:
            a) on your side
            b) able to benefit you in any way by sharing all sorts of info
            c) able to make you look elite when they fuck up and you get caught
            d) a phreak
            e) cool.

heh.. sorry about the list.. I'm going to add one or two people to my system and
see if I can get a good group of three or four people going together. I think certain
stuff should be taught, not written out for everyone, as well as security telco people
to use. At the very least it keeps the teaching people somewhat active. This is like, 
shit people like us come up with.. We should be also making money off of it, not them.
I don't see "the man" running out to give me a job. If they can't figure this out on
their own, then great. If they can, well, mabye they're getting smarter, or just reading
our files. 

800-543-0270 - Office Depot.

format: logon/password

100/100, 233/233, 366/366, 244/244, 299/299, 377/377
277/277, 399/399, 355/???, 

512/512, empty box? listen to it for a week or two and you'll know.. Don't take it 
over right away.. I can't remember wether it's a night only vmb. (well, voice mail 
system, (VMS), but vms was taken by vax.., let's call it tVMS, for Tele Voice Mail 
System).

555/555, (main box.. wanna fuck them up? you can change all the greets and shit on
this, but it's not the admin box..)

Go to a payphone for scanning boxes..

What you want to find is an administrator box. These usually have some sort of 
default message or something. Sometimes it's easy, like, "administrator box" or
"Bell Guy" or whatnot, other times, it's not as easily guessable. It may be
as touch as "System Manager".. I hope you get the drift.

So you call it, it goes through all the babble it usually does. You can enter * to
call an extension, and # to enter our own extension. We'll look at # first.

When you press # it will welcome you to "the message system". Cool.. You now know
what kind it is.. See if you can dig up some defaults off the net. Or, look in 
blackzine 3. (The Voice Mail System - 1111) Hmm.. n/m, I don't have anything for
the message center tVMS's. The first notable feature of this voice mail system is
that the voice doesn't have to end or reach a certain point for you to push bottons
and get through. Also, it's not too hard to figure out that all boxes are 3 digit 
extensions. Press * after pressing a digit or two and it should tell you. Another 
way to tell is how the system doesn't let you enter in extensions or vmb's (let's 
call them nodes) beyond three digits.

Press #, and then you start your scan. This works by pressing #, 100. it will ask
you either for a password or tell you it's an invalid node. You don't need to listen
to the entire message of how it says, "invalid extension, please try another etc.." 
because that would take too much time. Just hit # again and enter in another number.

Their s00prr d00prr security will disconnect you after three or four invalid 
guesses. How can you be sure? You can hear it rudly click off without saying 
goodbye. What you have to do to bypass this to an extent is press * after you try
two boxes. the main menu will come back on, and then you hit # and continue entering
extensions.. Let's say you're at a payphone. How would this look? I'll use the , as 
a small pause.

18005430270 ,,, 
<it picks up & you puch bottons right away> # 100 #101 * #102 #103 * #104 #105 * #106 #107,,, 

<let's say it asks you for a password, guess the box number, and write the box down, then continue scanning> 108#, #109 * #110 #111 <etc..>

So bascially you are entering in number after number with virtually no pause in 
between.. This quickens things up for sure. Their security is smart enough to 
disconnect you after a certain amount of this bullshit above.. Somewhere from 10-15
numbers.. I'm not sure off hand. 

I think you have your extensions and boxes a little confused..

When you call into one of theses pbx's (or pabx, whichever you prefer) you
can call out to an extension. if there is noone at the extension, ie. No one
picks up, there is no phone, no extension is setup, it will give you some sort
of message.

If you were to try calling out to an extension which is invalid, you won't be able to
do much.. it'll tell you most likely to try again. Now, if the extension is valid, it
may go to the voice mail box, so that you can leave a message, or someone else can 
pick up, like the operator.

With this system, it doesn't seem like you can just call out to an extension and leave
a message as you normally could, which sorta sucks. You have to set it up. I was
having problems with people picking up, such as their operator, when I would try to
make a call to an extension.

I setup box 666 so that people could log in, and then leave me a message. This serves
several purposes:
   
1) Nobody picks up when they leave a message from box 666 to my box at 3999.
2) Nobody notices odd calls, and an increased number of: wrong numbers hangups.

      (these are commonly looked for when security is analysing a pbx)

3) You have to figure out how to leave a message to my extension (which doesn't have
   a phone, and hasn't  been physically setup, so it defaults to my voice mail box 
   (VMB). This prevents lamers.

4) It allows for me to setup boxes without having to worry about all sorts of people 
   calling into to an extension for the user whom I set a box up for. This way, it's 
   mostly internal people, and I can sort of keep track of who's on my system, possibly          preventing further abuse from other people (other than myself).

5) If people start harrassing me by leaving all sorts of messages from box 666, then I
   can shut it down and setup a new one. If need be, I can shut my extension and voice
   mail down, and setup a new one. This would delete all trace of myself (and possibly
   others).

6) So long as you don't list yourself in the main directory, nobody will have a chance 
   of knowing you are there. As it doesn't accept incomming calls (just messages internally
   from other extensions) then if someone mistakingly dials my extension, then they will
   not here my voice.

7) It can sort of give the next couple of people a kick in the ass to start doing stuff as 
   a team, ie. leave messages for each other. You can setup a mailing list on your box and       include other extensions so that you can send a message to several people at once (this
   was the bbs idea).

8) Setting up extensions which are not physically there prevents fuckups from happening, 
   such as: a company has 50 people in an office, and an extra 10 offices. They have 60
   extensions setup, and you can still call to the 10 offices which aren't being used. The       problem arises when you have someone who has taken over an office with nobody in it.
   Leave a message for the phreaker at the empty office extension, and a little
   light will flash on the phone. It looks odd to anyone who notices it. (Why
   would an office which isn't being used receive messages?)

Anyhow, I didn't really explain much I guess, but that's my reasoning.

And extension is a line you can call to, a vmb is where you leave a message, in a nutshell.
Since there is no existing extension IT get's put through to the vmb.

What have you done? You have saved yourself an insane amount of time on calling the 
system back, as well as lowered their call detail logs. You can dial a possible 100 number
in about 10 - 15 calls, opposed to 50 (where you'd call the system back without using my 
k-rad method). 

Now, what about the * button? this can be used as well to add several extra calls - or 
not. At times, this will try an extension (great for giving your fingers a break while 
being productive scanning nodes). One of three things will happen at this point while you
are resting for a couple of seconds. 

1) It will go through to an extension and someone will pick up, or their vmb will. 
   Cancel out of this and continue scanning.
2) It will tell you it's an invalid node (no box or extension there.., continue scanning.)
3) It will give you a pile of wierd tones at which point you should phreak out and 
   plug in your aqua box because you are being traced (kidding about the trace, but
   you can't get back to the system, so hang up and call back and continue scanning.)

Anyhow, that's the Office Depot System in a nutshell..

                                  Calgary CO's

This is all Telus stuff relevant to Calgary. I'll include addresses for them 
all so you can trash there too.. If you see me in their garbage, be sure to say
hi and share your night's findings.  I'll hopefully finish this off one day.
I expect to start updating it so that I can get a complete list of all the CO's
in Calgary. Look for updates periodically on my website, or if you want to be 
notified of updates, mail me. This is also my first file to be on HackCanada..

Bonavista CO
Switching area of the main floor is full, a section of the main floor has
been segregated off for office environment. This area has minimal space 
available. The basement also has space available. Parking is minimal. LAN
is available at this site. Fax machine, copiers and printers are also on 
site. Trashing here, if the gate isn't open, you'll have to scale a 
cement wall and hop a chainlink fence after that. There are usually a lot
of police which drive around the roads at times, so watch the streets.
On the corner of Acadia Drive and Bonaventure Drive, right across from
the Lake Bonavista shopping center.

Bowness CO
No space avail on main floor. Some space avail in the basement, with minimal
parking. LAN is not available, so a dialup is required.

which I don't like. Open access to vehicles. 534 Heritage Drive SW T2V5B4

Mount Royal CO
Main floor is approx 90% full with switching equpiment, but has some area
for system furniture as does the basement. The second floor has 4 enclosed 
offices. 2 of these offices are currently being used by local staff, and
the remainder of floor space is all avail (Space for 60-70 cubicles).
Parking is not available. LAN is not avail, so a dialup wouls be required.

Oakridge CO 
1 enclosed office on the main floor, and is use by the local staff. 
Switching area has room for system furniture as does the basement. They
have great parking. LAN is not avail, so a dialup would be required.

Ogden CO
Switching area on the main floor is completely full. A section of the main
floor has been segregated off at the front of the building from the switch 
area. In this segregated area there is substantial room for system furniture
and there is also one enclosed empty office. The basement has space as well.
Parking is great. No LAN so a dialup is needed..

Temple CO 
2 enclosed offices on the main floor, and is currently being used by local 
staff.  Substantial room for other stuff in the switching area, and the 
basement of the building. Parking is excellent. LAN is not avail at the site,
so a dialup would be required. This is in the Temple/Forest Lawn area. You can
access it right off of 17th Ave. going East, it's on your left hand side, 
around some pawn shops and other stuff. I'll have to get an address.

Douglasdale CO
This one looks like a house.. it sucks and has next to no garbage. There is
some switch around the back (hop the wood fence) which you can pull. Dunno
what it does yet or why they have it. Pull it anyways. Parking is minimal. 
This is a new area, so the CO is fairly new. I'll have to get an address.
