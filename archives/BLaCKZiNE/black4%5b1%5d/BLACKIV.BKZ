1.Intro
~~~~~~~

So the fourth magazine is out, and it has a bunch of new stuff, but the 
whole of it should be pretty much origional. Not much more skanning talk, 
as in the past three issues; there's more out there than skanning, and you
should be able to find something with that.

It took an extra long time, because of other things which had been happening,
like waiting for something to be done, or getting back in touch with someone
who insists that they will do something for the mag, so you give an extra 
week and all kinds of other things like that. Those who've ever ran a mag, or
anything along that line, should have an idea of what I mean. I also edited
out a few files at the last moment.. They may or may not appear in the fifth
issue.

Some recent events, Mighty Mouse [CiA] came to town a while back, for the 
Briar held at the saddledome. Several of us hung out with him down at Husky 
House, got buzzed on a LOT of coffee, and had a great time. 

It's interesting talking to some of the people you meet on conferences, or 
through irc.. It's completely different from what you usually expect.
Some of those who attended were myself, Vlad the Impailed, Kewheri Tron, 
Artemis Entreri, and a few others. Like usual it was snowing and fucking 
cold out, so there wasn't much for the idea of a crime spree across the 
city, as much fun as it may have been thought to have been. 

Kweiheri Tron and myself were going to start a new mag, Heresy, but like
the network, there was a lack of communication, and the joint venture died
shortly thereafter. Noname is supposed to die. Some art group I thought I 
should mention. Are U gay [PHAUG] was released in August. Also, the scene 
still sucks. But it would seem that there is hope yet. 

Cellular remodifications are being made somewhere in this great city, carders
are awry, bbses, and some systems are being hacked, and they are being a 
little more public about it, like listening in on people's conversations.. 
Hope whoever is doing that isn't beiging to eavesdrop.. It's a shimmer of 
light, but it's getting better than it was several months ago. Not surprisingly
just about all of those who are involved in this, are not "sceners" on the 
bbses, but rather mostly on the internet. It must say something about how 
much people are restricting themselves around here to the limited facilities 
at their disposal.

Onwards, one can never forget the sudden and drastic change to the telco
of 403. Alberta Government Telephone, AGT, turned into Telus, and merged
with the Edmonton telco, Ed Tel (go figure). Now, being Telus, the only 
significant difference, other than a two or three cent difference in the 
provincial rates, is the ugly green and purple colors flying in the sky
of downtown Calgary. Otherwise, they still are clueless, occasionally accept 
two line conferences, pay you for overpayments on payphones, and are way 
to expensive - but that's in a file to come. 
   
Otherwise, everything is the same as it was a year ago. Mitnick is still 
in jail, Emmanuel Goldstein is still running 2600. Donald Trump can't be 
reached at the Trump hotel, but ask at (800-234-5678). I think there's a 
new editor for phrack. I can't remember. I might be wrong. Ides of March 
was up and down about four times. I still don't have my own personal 
internet account, and my computer dissappears on a regular basis. I went 
threw a few jobs, such as telemarketing. It's fun being paid to scan, 
and if you want to find tones, just look for anyone's mark of "fax" next 
to a number on their scan sheet.. The job lasted four days, before I quit 
out of boredom. If you're going to do something, make sure you enjoy it.

Alhough being unemployed sucks, when you have school, you can at least 
find something to do. (That can be good or bad..) But I won't say who. 
Some of the dumber ideas were done, even with conferences and accessing 
inet accounts. (I hear of a few people have been traced on conferences 
recently.) Others have been getting into trouble with credit cards. But I 
suppose one learns with experience, mabye sometimes the hard way, that you 
gotta think before you act.

In my brief search for a job a short while ago, I found out from another 
telemarketing agency, that skanning sequentially, is illegal. It is not, 
however, should you be skanning randomly. If you're bored, here's some 
number you can call, if you want to listen to some dumb or wierd answering 
machine messages. They're (807) 4735310, 6259382, 6228171. Also, here's a 
tone 807-9392870. I know, I know, your mommy won't let you call long distance,
and you suck and can't phreak to listen to an answering machine.. Oh well,
if I find where I put my local number list, I'll stick it in later.
                    
I now have someone who has taken up the position of doing all the ascii
for the ZiNE, Shamen, so thanks go out to him, for his good ascii work.
I've recieved a few acceptable articles from a new coder, Mookie, and another
person, Seylon Freylith. It was a great relief to see something acceptable, 
opposed to the "how to be elite and theoretically break into a porche" 
garbage I had seen from others. Greetz also to Kweiheri Tron; too bad we 
couldn't come to any agreements on anything. Greetz to all those who did 
something with the last mag and skans, and everything else in there, who
I have forgotten, wether on purpose or not. 

Regarding the future of BLaCKZiNE, judging from the intense feedback from 
everyone, it definately appears that it should now be around for a while, 
if I can keep in finding new stuff to play with. It's good to new something 
new once in a while from the users, opposed to the same old files everyone 
has. Again, as usual, I am still looking for new good talent in the hpacv 
field, and if you feel you want to write, do keep in mind that I will not 
accept any articles that are unoriginal, plagiarized, or contain invalid or 
false information. Articles will be accepted from anyone who meets that and 
a few other criteria.

There's not really much to this entire magazine if you are looking for
some profound discovery to be released to CERT, or remove the telephone
services for an extended period of time. This is not it. I know a great 
deal of time was spent on gathering some of this information, and 
talking to others to acquire the information needed. Gathering, because 
we had to learn it first, to pass the knowledge to you. A lot has gone on 
behind the scenes with the production of this. It's somewhat of a 
collaboration between a few of us, on some rather novel material which 
was covered.

Some of the information began to be relatively cumbersome and a bother 
to get, for the amount of time it took. With the conferencing file, I 
lost most of Canada's conferencing information, by an accidental deletion. 
Other portions of it were rather enjoyable doing, like the telus 
information. The telus information was rather fun to do. It builds 
character, self esteem, glory, an ego, a file - well - okay, it got 
me a few laughs after and little after that.. 

Metronet was giving out a few five minute calling cards a while
ago. These are legally obtained, and I do not know if you can recharge them.

Dialup: 1-888-824-3500
Support: 1-800-890-6965
Pin: 10 digits (ie. 098-267-5548)
Control Code: 8 digits.

Other PINS:065-207-4235
           305-137-1695
           081-031-2967
           152-498-7147

You can have two people using the same card, at the same time, but it will 
give you a message saying that someone else is presently using the card, and 
give you the option of talking to one of their security members. I suppose
I could have tried that and bitched about how their calling cards were no 
good, in the hopes that they would give me another one, but I don't it's 
worth the effort for five extra minutes. You should know how to go about 
recharging them. I believe I talked about this in blackzine three. 

For the interesting systems and info I came upon, regarding the 800 and 
newly implemented 888 service, using the EWSD switches, around March of 1996 
with the introduction of 888 toll free dialing, is that Bell Atlantic is now 
processing most 888 calls today. While the new 888 toll free service 
has become essential because of the "seemingly" emminent exhaustion of the 
800 code, it was assumed that the 888 service itself will push into additional 
codes (877 service etc..) sometime in late `97.

If you've ever been in an elevator before, you've seen that right under 
the elevator floor control-panel there's a telephone. Now,if you've seen
these before you've probably already wondered about them or have even 
used/tried to use them. Most of the elevator phones have little or no 
protection so to be able to call out from them all you need to do is dial 
the number and sometimes you might need to dial a 9 or pound before hand. 
The others can either be only be used to call the front desk, call the 
front desk unless a 4 digit code is punched in before-hand or only be used 
to call 911. Like to find numbers to these phones? Call an ANI from them,
or try looking up the building numbers in the phone book. I'm sure
the receptionist would be glad to give you them.

A few new systems are discussed, as well as a few old topics. Some of 
the more interesting areas you might want to play around with would be 
the the custom announcements, making your fake id.. Some of the older 
topics would include conferencing, getting money from the telco from 
calls, and harrassing people. Hopefully, it would be a refereshing change 
from some the standard files already readily available on the bbses.

So enjoy the mag, read about it, it's not the most technical mag around, 
but you can likely use it to your own ends. There is no set release date 
for the mag, so it might be a quarterly, yearly, or monthly. It depends 
on how much I have bothered myself with finding new stuff for you kids.
If there's nothing new to show, then it might be a while. Hopefully, if I 
can get on things often enough, these should be released at the latest, 
quarterly. If this is the case, the next mag should be out around August.

I should probably help out and take this present time to advertise a little 
for the 2600 meet held out in Eau Claire Market (Next to the Eye Max Theater).
It's on the first friday of every month, 5:30 - 8:30 at the food court, at 
the back end, around the milk wall in the smoking section. 

The mag is still accepting comments, questions, articles, reviews, 
corrections, whatever. Nothing will be overlooked. All the articles 
contained herein, are totally original unless otherwise stated. For 
those writers out there, we will not accept any articles that are 
unoriginal, plagiarized, or contain invalid or false information. Articles 
will be accepted from anyone who meets those criteria, as well as ours. 
It would also be nice to have a distro site, or some sort of HQ, if 
any sysop is willing. Criteria? Well, it would be nice if you have some 
sort of hpacv material with messages bases available, and can stay up
for a reasonable amount of time.

Unfortunately some corrections, have to be made from the last issue. I don't
know how I missed them, in my usual tired, semi stupor, but nevertheless, 
they were pretty bad errors. In the skan list of mine, I meant to put out 
information you could use to your own benefit, abuse, or whatever. This was
located shortly after the introduction in the skanlist, where there was a big
gap. It was not intended as a joke.. Seylon Freylith had provided me with 
some extensive information. I won't be correcting it, however, because you 
can just as easily look in the phone book while at a payphone and use that 
information given to your right there. You won't be asked for much more 
than what is in the phone book.

2. Alaskan Numbers -Scribed By Seylon Freylith
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being bored as most hackers usually are, I found myself with an unusually
large amount of time on my hands, and the idea of coming up with finding a
lot of interesting or insane numbers (ie. the TDD voice line) and figured I
might as well give them out. How'd I get them? Well, say that I just looked 
them up... and I'm pretty sure all of them are for Alaska.

This also came to a few military numbers, which are also posted for your 
harrassing enjoyment, should you ever get a calling card, want to place a 
few collect calls, seize a line or something of that sort. Going through 
these, a lot of lame Husky dog jokes came to mind... You can peice together 
what you want to do. The 800's are all correct, and can be reached from 
Alberta. In case you're wondering what a 907 number is, 907 is the area 
code...

800 ALASKAN NUMBERS

4. Custom Announcements Remote Access - Scribed By Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                          Not all tones are pbx's...

   Well,  mind  you,  I  have never been on a loop with tones either, every 
   loop I've been on had  dead silence, and waited for another user to come
   on  the  other end. No entry tones, no change in anything, just silence.
   But that's another file, so on with the topic.

   Note that this system may also be known as a DRAM, or Digitally Recorded
   Announcement Machine.  This may also provide announcements like, "Please
   deposit $.25 cents for to place your call."  And of course, the messages
   will vary from system to system.

   To remotely access the announcer, dial the number, wait for the phone to 
   answer, and  then  you will hear  a  tone. After the tone, you have less 
   than five seconds to start keying the password of the desired message or 
   it  will  hang  up. Each announcer  can  hold up to 6 different messages
   each with it's own password.

   The password, naturally  is  set to it's  default value at first, but is 
   usually changed. A master  remote  access  code is retained by AGT/Telus 
   ( Centron Service Center ) which will allow fault diagnosis and password
   re-setting capabilities to assist with all sorts of troubles.

   REMOTE RECORDING

   To record a message:

   1. Dial into announcer, confirmation tone (high) should be heard.
   2. Key in the password for the message, (less than five seconds).  If it 
   is invalid, then a low tone is heard. You should then press  "0"  and
   then hang up. (Redial again after, duh....)
   3. Confirmation tone is heard (high).
   4. Press "7"
   5. After second tone is heard, begin speaking.

   Note:The maximum length  for an announcement, is about 20 to
        25 seconds. (Pretty shitty for the telco equipment,eh?) 
        If you run out of time, then you will hear another tone
        you're  shit  outta  luck, and you'll have to make your 
        greeting shorter.

   7. Press "8" to end recording.
   8. Confirmation tone is heard.
   9. Listen to message by pressing "8" or press "0" to hang up.


   LISTENING TO A MESSAGE

   To play a recorded message:

   1. Dial into the announcer, high tone is heard.
   2. Key in the password for the message (less then five seconds).

   Note:If you enter a wrong passcode, you will hear a low tone
        press "0" and hang up. Then redial it. 

   3. Correct passcode, high tone is heard.
   4. Press 8 to listen to the message.
   5. Press 8 to stop listening to the message.
   6. Tone is heard.
   7. To change the message, press "7" or press "0" to hang up.

   And that covers it. They can be found in usually downtown prefixes, and
   you  can  find  them  all  over;  I  got  a  couple  toll  phree  ones. 
   I have  not  bothered these 888's as of yet (too lazy) but will provide 
   codes in some  other release  of  another file. I don't know what shape 
   these numbers will be in by the  time they reach you, but here are two:
   
   1-888-326-4444                  
   1-888-752-6646
   
   The local ones, I will not give out, because I'm sure some of you
   shit disturbers out there will be leaving k-rad greetings, and that 
   might put my ass on the line.

   Usually, it's used for messages such as: "Were sorry, all of our 
   representatives  are busy. Please call back later. Thank you for
   calling." 
    or
   "Thank you for calling our corporation. We're sorry, but you 
   have called  us  after buisness hours. We  will be open from 
   8:00 to 5:00 weekdays. Please call back  during  this time."

   These are the messages you hear, when the line is busy, you've called
   after hours, or some other  unimportant  announcement. All it does is 
   save money for an answering machine,  and  it doesn't record messages 
   from you. you can get your kicks by switching messages around,  like,
   "Were sorry, but we  don't feel  like answering  your  call  at  this 
   present  time.  Mabye, at  our  earliest  inconvienience,  we  may be 
   interested, but that  is  not  likely, as you have already bought our 
   product. So if you have problems,  or wish to talk our representative 
   then you are just plain SOL." The advantage of something like this is 
   that you do not  get  a busy  signal, so it may be important for some 
   companies to have this message on their service.
   
   Likewise, "Asshole, we  are closed. Why are you trying to get through 
   when  you know that  the work day  is over?  Why  should we spend our 
   valuable time, helping you, when you are most likely too dumb to read 
   the  damn instructions  and  figure it  out yourself? As this is most 
   likely the case, our technicians will not be bothered by you and your 
   ignorance. Thank you and have a nice day." 

   And if you want to be a shit disturber, if it is for a big company or 
   corporation, then  try  something like, "Hello, you have just reached 
   <company name>. We are sorry but  nobody  can answer  the phone right 
   now, because they have just been hacked,  by <your alias>.  Greetz to 
   these  people  <list people,  and be sure to include Mitnick>.  Thank 
   you, and have a nice day." Then turn around, and CBV as many pd bbses 
   you can think of to their main number where people  will be  sure  to 
   reach  that  as  a  message. This way, the line will be busy, with pd 
   boards calling, so  should  any customer attempt to try to call, then 
   they  would  be forwarded  to  recieve that  message.  Call any tv or 
   radio  stations,  newspapers,  anyone else  in  the press, and  mabye 
   even the police.... If it's a big one, people will ask questions, and
   shit will fly. 
   
   If you really want  results,  do the same  thing only  for some other 
   people's  answering  machines.  If  your neighbour was to have his AM 
   hacked,  as well  as fifty  others, then  someone is guaranteed to do 
   something should any nasty messages left on them. If some buisness is 
   involved, then it makes it look all the better. Hacking a local AM is 
   a different file though and those aren't too hard to find.

   It  is  bound  to make the news, and piss a lot of people off. Either 
   that or you'll gain a lot of popularity,  look cool,  and win friends
   and influence people.

   Either way, these are sure to get a few reactions. You should get the 
   idea by now. 




5. Starting Out With Viruses - Scribed By Mookie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        This is a really brief overview of what virus writing is, but with
this information and a dedicated effort to learning, eventually virus writing
will come naturally.  There is no textfile that will ever make you a virus
coder just by reading that one file.   
 
        First of all, if you're going to get into viruses, you need to keep
backups.  You will get hit with a virus if you mess around with them for 
long enough.  Ask anybody in the art of coding, and you'll see it.  Simple
as that.  Just due to the nature of viruses, you aren't going to want a top
of the line computer mess around with.  Personally, I started with an XT, do
all of my testing on it.  You'll spend countless hours reinstalling every
thing if you code on your "good" computer.

        Secondly, you will need to know what a virus is, and what it isn't.
It's absurd now to see what is being written by the media, and what their
defintions of hacking and viruses are.  Just recently, I saw an article that
said, "A virus is a program written by mischevous hackers who want to ruin
your computer..." 
        
        A) Hackers do not write viruses. (usually)
        B) A Hacker isn't necessarily maelovent.
      
        A virus is a part of code that reproduces itself.  It copies itself
in part or in whole to another file.  What the "harmful" part is, is called        
the bomb.  A bomb may do a number of interesting things, display a message,
play a tune, erase your files, blow up your computer and send glass shrapnel
from your montior into your face, possible killing you (No, not as of yet, 
but maybe someday).  A trojan is something entirely different from a virus.
Ever hear of the story of Trojan soldiers getting into Troy because they 
filled a wooden horse full of soldiers?  It was a trap set by them to fool
the others into willfully accepting them. The horse was let through the walls 
of Troy, and let them attack the inhabitants of the city.  A Trojan is a 
program that is supposed to do or be something but really is another.  For 
instance, you might write a Trojan that is supposedly some great game, and 
then when the user runs it, a nice little message displays, "Say goodbye 
to your hard drive! :)"  And corrupts all the files.  
 
        So, a virus reproduces itself, while a trojan pretends to be some
thing else.  Finally, there is a logic bomb.  A logic bomb may be put into
a trojan or virus.  It waits until a/some parameters is/are met like a 
certain day, or how many times the file has been executed.  When these have
been met, the bomb part activates.  This is useful for delaying a bomb, and
is sometimes known as a boolean.  
 
        Well, now that you know the different part of a viruses, you need 
to know how to program.  All virus programming is done in Assembly.  I 
would recommend that you get some books from your library about the language
and reading .ASM source, which is the extension for Assembly language files.
They can be fairly easy to obtain. Secondly, as you're not going to start 
off programming viruses from the books, you're going to need some examples.  
The Virus Creation Lab by Nowhere Man is an excellent starting point.  The 
program is pretty self explanatory, providing you read the docs.  
 
        If you have programmed in QBasic, one major change you will notice
with Assembly language is that you don't just load up your QBasic editor 
and hit F5 to run your program.  Basic is called an interpreter.  In other
words, you must have Basic to run your program.  With Assembly, you must 
assemble and link your files so that they can be used on all computers, not
just computers that have Basic on them.  So, say that you have your .ASM
source.  To compile it, you need a copy of TASM.EXE and TLINK.EXE.  These
are (C) by Borland, but I'm sure if you're into viruses, than copying 
these files won't bother you either.  

        Once you have your .ASM file, you need to assemble it first.  This 
is done with TASM.EXE.  Usually with viruses, you need to add some 
parameters, but I won't go into that, you'll learn eventually what you need 
for parameters and when.  Assembling the file will give you a .OBJ, or object 
file, prodviding that the assembler didn't find any thing wrong with your 
code.  After compiling, you must link it, using TLINK.EXE.  With a virus, 
you will always use /t option, which produces a .COM file for execution 
instead of .EXE.  The difference between these two types of files is the way 
that the computer reads the file.  As well as this, .EXE files are 
hexadecimally created while .COM files are in a binary sort of format.

Here's a relatively simple diagram of the steps involved to creating a 
virus:


        VIRUS.ASM ------------> VIRUS.OBJ -------------> VIRUS.COM
                    TASM.EXE                TLINK.EXE


        You might be wondering why you have to use two steps in assembling
a virus, or any other Assembly source.  When you assemble the source code,
the object file is produced, as mentioned earlier.  However, assembly 
programming was meant for more complex programming.  You may have a few
.OBJ files in a single program, which need to be linked together with TLINK.
TridenT's Polymorphic Engine provides a .OBJ file which can be linked to a
virus that you write, producing interesting results, described in it's 
documentation.  Anyways, it's a small necessary step.  The only way to 
jump around this is to obtain a copy of A86, which combines the two steps
into one.  The disadvantage to this though, is that it is not nearly as 
versitile as Borland's Turbo Assembler's utilities, and you can not link
.OBJ files together.
        
        Finally, here is a simple batch file that you will want to use if 
you test your viruses.  What it does is use the DOS SUBST.EXE command to 
manipulate your computer into believing your A: is your C: and your D:.
This prevents any writing to or reading from the C: and D: drives to be 
redirected to the A:.  This is about as safe as using a condom.  I'll leave
that up to you, however you want to interpret that.  Incredibly easy to 
use to use, just type in the following to create the batch file:
 
COPY CON SWCHDRV.BAT
@ECHO OFF
SUBST A: C:\
SUBST A: D:\
<Ctrl+Z>
 
To switch the drives back to the original:

SUBST A: /D


Encryption

    Encryption is one of the key parts of writing a virus.  Say for example
you have a virus that displays a string on the screen, you obviously don't 
want the infected files to contain that string.

    XOR is one of the easiest and common ways to encrypt your virus.  What 
it is is a matamatical algorithm that can be used to encode and decode data 
with the same key.  You can find this function on any scientific calucaltor.

ex.

              FF  xor  A1  =  5E

Where FF is the byte to encrypt, A1 is the key and 5E is the result.  The 
decrypt would look like this:

              5E  xor  A1  =  FF

So as you can see an easy way to encrypt/decrypt sensitve data is with the
XOR function, which is why 98% of all viruses use this method. Any good
heuristics virus scanner, will therefore pick this up.

A popular virus that demonstrates this teqnique is Leprosy-B.  A portion 
of it has been included so that you can see the use of XOR in actual code.

encrypt_val     db      00h             ;  Hold value to encrypt by here

; <snip> <snip> <snip>

encrypt_decrypt:
        mov     bx,offset virus_code    ;  Get address to start enc/dec
xor_loop:                               ;  Start cycle here
        mov     ah,[bx]                 ;  Get the current byte
        xor     ah,encrypt_val          ;  Engage/disengage XOR scheme 
        mov     [bx],ah                 ;  Put it back where we got it
        inc     bx                      ;  Move BX ahead a byte
        cmp     bx,offset virus_code+virus_size  ;  Are we at the end?
        jle     xor_loop                ;  If not, do another cycle
        ret                             ;  and go back where we came from

encrypt_method: 
        db      "Encryption taken from Leprosy-B."  ; Ripped code! 

This encrytion method could be included in a different virus, with little 
or no modification.
                                                                      
"While the -virus- is no great wonder the simple encryption method is what 
is used by almost all viruses." -HR

Source Section
 
        This part will include a part of the source of a virus. This will 
focus on the NuKE's Random Life Generator MBR (Master Boot Record) Bomb.  
It is has been chosen as it was one that I hit myself with accidently last 
month, and figure that it's annonying as hell if you don't know how to get 
rid of it.  Thanks and greetz out to Kweiheri Tron for helping me out on 
this.
 
        Unfortunately, the comments are quite poor, as Azrael, the author
of N.R.L.G. speaks English as his second language.  If ran in March, the
MBR is allowed to boot, but all data on the hard drive is lost.  If ran any
other month, the bomb prevents the computer from booting, but a simple boot
disk can get around this.  The problem is that any shelling out of programs
requires reading from COMMAND.COM which is found on the floppy.  Thus, 
shelling is greatly slowed down, and the use of your A: is occupied by the 
boot disk. 
 
        The bomb sits on the MBR until it is cleaned, which is painfully 
easily, but unless you are familiar with the command and its options, you       
aren't going to get rid of it.  FDISK /MBR wipes clean the Master Boot 
Record.  Simple as that.  But since people so rarely use FDISK (used to 
partiton your hard drive), most people don't know much about the options.  
Anyways, on with the code, which is taken from the Nuke Randomic Life 
Generator, written by Azrael.

        Well, that about covers it.  I hope that you don't mess yourself 
too badly in the first few days of experimenting with viruses, but keep in        
mind that eventually, it will happen.  Just keep backups, and don't bother
yourself with massive amounts of software on your test computer.  Lastly,
and most importantly, until you write your own source code, or majorly 
overhaul somebody else's, do not say that you have writen a virus.  In the
latter case, you have created a strain.  Do not remove sombody's markers 
from a virus and say that it's your own.  With a computers, it's extremely
easy to change something without somebody knowing, but there are ways of
finding out.  Somebody could de-compile yours and find it awfully similar 
to somebody else's virus.  Other than looking bad, it cheats the original 
writers out of their hard work in creation.

6. Conferencing -Scribed By Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear  Mr. Narayana,

in choosing a service to meet your teleconferencing demands. I believe

Our only buisness is providing high quality, cost effective, telephone
conference calls. we focus on what each customer wants; then design a 
service to meet those requirements. You'll find our attendants friendly,
helpful, and committed to exceptional service.

I'm looking forward to contacting you shortly to discuss and quesitons you 
might have. Should you have any questions or concernes before you hear from 
me, please call, 1-800-xxx-xxxx

(Signed...)
Gill Grack,
Telecommunications Manager.


Now, what wonderful people. They are there to help you out. What more could
you ask for? This was a personal letter sent to me by a private conferancing 
company. This text was done rather quickly, so you'll have to excuse my lack
of indepth explanations, regarding things like the junction box and workings
of a conferance or beige box.. I'll get around to that next time. It's my 
believe that any wanna-be phreak getting into it should experience the phun 
of a conference at one point in their lives. 

First off, to answer what is a conference? It is a voice bridge set up, by
the operator, to allow you to talk to your friends at the listed prices, or
you can get it for free, and then pass an 800 number dialin out to everyone.
It's like a chatline, except it's voice.

All to often, I have heard questions about, what to do to set this up?"
It's not that hard, all you need is a little speed, brains, and the ability 
to ask for what you want from an operator.

There are many methods of talking to the operator, if you are doing it through
your local telco, what you do is dial 0, and then ask for the teleconferencing
operator. From there, tell her that you are intrested in setting up a 
conference, and want her to tell you about them. This might be good to start.
Call right now, and ask for information about their conferences. It's their
job to answer your questions. If you're friendly, they will be really nice
to you. Then after, when your questions have all bween answered, tell them 
you will call back, and then hang up. 

Go get a file on beige boxing, and read that. However, it is best that you do 
NOT do it from someone's house, as in my experience, not because you might 
cause their fone to unwittingly ring, but because you might get caught. From 
my experience, it is best to get a good cordless phone, attach it to the 
junction box in the alley, and wait in a car or some distance away. With 
various companies, you can have conferences set up for several months in 
advance. Also, if you were to have a conference, and everything went okay, 
then you would be able to use the host pin later on in the week, to set 
another up. Just make sure you remember all the personal information you 
gave the conference operator earlier. In the sequel to this, I intend to 
cover all the parts of a junction box, it's workings, as well as the 
working of a conference itself.

So once your cordless is hooked up, call one telco, and ask for the tele-
conference operator, say you would like a 10 port conference, with an 800
dialin, to start relatively soon. It's usually best to try to keep them
small, so that if the operator comes in or listens in on the conference,
it doesn't raise suspicion to a bunch of kids (if this is the case) fucking
around. It's not very day they have a 50 port conference, to last twelve hours. 
After that conference is set up, ask if you can have two for that week, so 
one for Sunday, and another one for Tuesday. Then, call the next conference
operator. It could be from the same telco, I doubt you'd get the same operator
twice. But after you have gone through about twenty or thirty operators,
you should have at least two months worth of daily conferenceing going.

One note on going through junction boxes, if you ever see a white line, in 
big large mess of wires, DO NOT TOUCH! This is a dedicated line, and if it
should get disconnected, if it cannot reset the connection within 16 seconds
or so, it alerts the telco. Within one hour, they will launch an investigation,
and have a telco official out there. I believe that after a certain amount
of time passes by, the head of telecommunications, will recieve a phone call
reporting this event, no matter what time of day it is.. This is going to 
piss a lot of people off... 

If you don't like going to junction boxes, go into a few parking lots with 
several levels in them. Go up and down the stairs, or if you need a key
or code, wait for someone to hold the door for you, and you follow them in.
go up and down the stairs, mabye through their furnace rooms, or whatever,
and you might find their phone box... This should have one hell of a lot of
lines for you to play with. There's all sorts of methods, which you can go
and find in most areas regarding teleconferences, and beige boxing. If you
do not know what beige boxing is, you can try this little experiment. Take
an phone. Cut off the ends of the wires going to the jack in the wall.
Attach some alligator clips to two of the wires. (Red and Blue) take off
the cover to the jack in your wall. Attach the clips to the insides of
the jack, so you create a connection. Voila, it is done. Do this on someone
else's line. In a junction box, open it up with a wrench, stick one clip one
one side of the metal post inside, and the other, just drag down the opposite
side. If you see a small spark, then you have found youself a connection to
use and abuse. You might want to try opening one to get a better idea. I
really don't want to go through the details of a junction box right now.

When the phone bill comes around, the owners of that line usually bitch and
complain that they never called any form of 900 number or had a conference, 
and after a while, it would seem that the Telco drops the entire case, and
puts a flag on their phone line, not to allow any more conferancing from 
that line. Eventually, they will get smart, should you live in a town of 
200 people, when everyone but you get's a conference billed to them. You 
might want to try setting up a conference from your own phone line and 
then denying it later. But, that's not recommended, cause they are expensive,
and you might get charged for it.

Here are several teleconferencing people... Some accept credit cards,
others insist on phoneing you back. You can probably bullshit them out of
calling you back, if you are going to card a conference. Tell them you are
out of town, or set it up at 2:30 am, and tell them you don't want to wake 
your family, and can they call in a few hours (after the conf is setup). If 
you have a kids voice, then don't bother either way. She'll probably just ask 
directly if you are going to fraud this conference if you sound like a child.
I've included the addresses, so it might be interesting to trash around those
areas. You might be able to steal a conference, or continue one later after
the host pin has been used.

Also, if you want to start a conference for us, that would be great to. We 
could answer any questions you have .. voice! Just drop us the info, at least 
a week ahead of time, and we'll let you know if we'll be on.

1. Identify yourself by name and location.
2. Use the "Mute" button when not speaking for extended periods of time.
3. Refrain from side conversations and keep background noise (paper 
   shuffling) to a minimum.

7. Thieving Free Fone From The Calling Card Thieves -Scribed By Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Also submitted to 2600 magazine, summer issue..)

                          Calling Card Enterprises
                             822 Evergreen Drive
                              Catham, Illinois
                                    62629
                               1-800-707-4056

  
  This is a group which has swindled many ignorant yet probably undeserving
customers out of money for long distance. The customers often pay money,
<gasp> for a calling card, only to find that the dialin is unreachable, and
the company itself does nothing to reimburse them. This, as far as I'm
concerned is worse than your local telco. At least the local telco will give
you money back, tell you how much they are going to swindle you for, and
most of the time their systems will work...

  This is a file on how to get yourself a few calling cards form CCE, should
you be able to reach the dialin from your calling area. CCE provides long
distance for about $0.19 a minute, anywhere, anytime. It works just like a
regular calling card, but it does have a few extra added features, like
horoscopes and stock rates. With which you nonetheless have to pay long
distance for... So if you run out of numbers to scan, and people to call,
you can do this to waste time. Order one for yourself, a few for school,
teachers, and everyone you can think of. Mabye all of the conservative
political party members you have info on.

  You can usually get two mailed to your house, mabye three. They record
your name and address, so if you have a drop box, you can get a few more.
I ordered a card, and got them to send me a second one a few months later,
and they did, but attached was a note that they already mailed me one and
to tell them if there was a problem. They should catch on after a few times.

  Also, if you are unemployed, this can be a great way to make money...
It only takes a few steps, and really doesn't require any social engineering
and is, even legal. Call 1-800-707-4056, and leave a message for Curt
Christensen regarding becoming a distributor, with a name and address. He will
mail you a bunch of useless information, so throw away all the paper and grab
that little plastic card glued to one of the sheets. Amongst the garbage is
a flyer, and a letter, personally signed by him. You can sign up to be a
distributor, and help these unlawful people, or you can help cost them money.

  The card had $1.90 US on it, so this should last quite some time in Canada.
In Canada, you may find this doesn't last as long... run out to your local
payphone with a credit card, and recharge it.

  You do NOT need full information, unlike 7-11 or Mac's calling cards. And,
another great thing is that they can all be recharged without the help of
Habib, your friendly 7-11 employee, because it's all automated. So long
as your credit card has over a $25 limit, you can get over two hours of
phun. They take Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, and Discover.

  Even if you are using this from home, it should be substantially cheaper
than normal home fone, should you be paying for your calls on a more direct
basis. But the dialin must be reachable.... 

                    ...So reach out and phreak someone...

  The dial-in number for the cards is 1-800-332-6606 and they have 12 digit
pins, along with a control code 7 digits long. I haven't had to use the
control code yet, so who knows what it may be for. A serial number? The cards
expire if not activated in 6 months. If you want to test the balance of them
should you get lucky and find a card, is " * * ". You can use " * * " also
to make additional calls, rather than hanging up. The format is usually
5xxx-xxxx-4xx9, should you rather scan for them.

8. Fake ID -Scribed by Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you want to change who you are for some reason. You might want to evade 
the law, or just buy some smokes and beer. There could be problems with your 
drivers record. The possibilites are endless. At any rate, there's really no 
point in changing your drivers liscence to add a few years onto your age, 
because if some cops pull you over, you're busted if he checks up on it. 
You can probably tell the liscence office that you lost your wallet, and get
them to issue a new one, but that still doesn't change your name or anything
else. Being bored one night, I came up with a quick plan for new id, and
it can be achieved in anywhere between 5 minutes to an hour. All you need to 
do this, is half a brain (left or right, doesn't matter) and a few things you
can rip off from the store. 

Find the following: fax machine, scissors, white out, felt ink pen, stamps,
                    ruler, bleach, Q-tips, half a brain         

Most people save their birth records. It's usually your parents who do. If
you were born in a hospital, then it should be on a nicely printed sheet
of paper, with a few people's signatures on it, as well as your city of birth,
your parent's names, their country of birth, and a few other menial things.
try asking your parent's nicely, if they would be willing to show you yours,
and tell you a bit about when you were born. They shouldn't hesitate to pull
out the albums, and your old records. Just make sure your know where they
place the birth cirtificate. Not the laminated card, but rather something like
the big long sheet with a gold stamp on it, and your footprints. Along
with thiat, should be another sheet of paper, probably photocopied should the
hosiptals keep the origionals with all the information I listed above.
It should say "Certificate of live birth" on the top. 

Take the fax machine, and copy it through. Now you have a fax of your 
origional birth certificate as well as the origional copy. (We'll call
this copy one.) Run it though the machine again. Now you have two copies. 
(We'll call this copy two.) The problem is, is that you need to alter it a 
little. What you will be taking advantage of, is the clarity of your fax, 
and the "computer" printout of it. It is unable to distinguish between a lot 
of the lines, so they either come through as being really obvious, or they 
do not show up at all. You can notice this yourself, by looking closely at 
the writing of the faxed copy, and comparing it to your origional.

Take the scissors, and cut carefully all the letters, from copy one, that 
you are going to have to change. If you are just after your DOB, then look 
for the nubmers you want to change it to. If you were born in 1980, and want 
to change it to 1978, then you would look for both a 7 and an 8 and cut them 
out. Likewise, if you want to change your name. It is recommended that you 
change the serial numbers on it as well. You can even do it with other 
people's handwriting. You will have to cut the letters finely, and not have 
a lot of paper left surrounding them. The reason for this, is because you 
want to simulate it as to look as if a typewriter had done it. If it is 
uneven, or the letters are not showing through clearly, then it will look 
like crap and you will look like a dumbass trying to pull this off.

For the typed letters you want to change, it is sometimes better to stick a 
bit of white out on copy two, so they do not show through if the letter does 
not fully cover it all up. With your glue, put a little dab on the back of 
the letters (it might be best to use tweesers to handle the cut letter.) 
Then, carefully take the letter you cut out, and put it on the whited out 
area. Make sure the underneath is not at all visible, or else you will have a 
few lines show up around the letters and it will not look realistic. Don't 
worry about glue, however, the whiteout can cover it up if it shows through 
later when you copy it again. Just blot and wipe off any excess, so you don't 
have glue blotches all over the copy two.Change all the numbers on the second 
copy, your name, all the rest you need to, using the cut letters from the 
first faxed copy onto the second. To align them naturally, it is best to use 
edge of a ruler, to maintain that they are all straight and together. It 
obviously would not look natural should one work be out of alignment
with another at the other end of the line, so make sure you watch for this.

However, if you haven't a hope in hell of passing for over 18, and you 
intend to use this file for that purpose, then I'd say that there is just 
no point. Nobody will belive you on a fax, unless you can actually get 
some sort of picture to this file for you, and you can only get 
yourself in trouble. Move onto the next file.

Anyhow, so you've redone your identification card, and changed everything
you want to. Run it through the fax again. This is copy three. It might 
appear a little bit faint, but that's okay. Just take the bic ink pen (not 
ballpoint) and go over slightly each of the fine letters on copy two. You'll 
have to compare them a bit. Don't worry if some do not show up at all. This is
a commonality wih use of a fax.

If there are any faint lines between letters you have spliced, then just put 
a bit of whiteout between the letters and it should cover up nicely.  Then, 
take the copy two, and run it through it again. You should now have you're 
own fake id. It won't have your picture on it, but that's okay. Most people 
will accept it. You're better off using a fax, because most photocopiers will 
show the whiteout, and it will look phony. Also, you can add a few other 
things, like in fine print, where the fax was from and stuff, just to make 
it look origional. Make sure you have an adequate story to go along with the 
fax. 

Things like, I had to take a few tests for applying at Mount Royal, lost my 
wallet and got a fax of my birth certificate from my parents... no one will 
think that you got a fax from a hospital in some other city, and that you've 
been able to change it. Some of the other things which work are, "I was 
spending a few weeks with some buddies of mine, and I lost my wallet on the
Transit System. I got my parents to fax me my birth certificate so I could
go out to the bars with them." If you do give a story, make sure you stick
with it, and don't be hesitant about it. If you believe yourself, then others
will have a better chance of believing you.

If you are too lazy to spend the hour it takes, then you can go ahead and 
modify your driver's license. To do this, you can rip off some nail polish
remover from your mom, and put a fine coating over the year you were born in.
Then, slowly scratch it off, so that only the ink gets removed. Then, go get
from Shoppers Drug Mart some stencils which you can rub off onto your card.
Put the numbers where they should, rub the back, and they will come off onto
the plasic id. The letters will vary slightly in size in comparison to the 
others on the card, but it doesn't matter. Most bars are dimly lit, so no one
should notice. The only problem you'd encounter is if the police were to run 
a check on it, they would see the discrepancy bettween their records and yours.

If you want to take this a bit further, then it is very possible to create 
your own new identity.. To do this, you would have to start out very lightly, 
can gradually create your own person and give him the appearance of being 
realistic. Start out with things like a library card, and work up. That way, 
when you start out slowly, you can have other forms of id to back your 
fictitious character up. Now many people might ask for proof that you have 
been living in the same location for some time. The library is characteristic 
of this. Usually some piece of mail will do, so you can take you chances with 
real mail which you have, or, you can use your felt pen, and send yourself 
some mail.  Just say you were applying for a job at that place if anyone 
asks, and your letter got returned.. When writing your address, do NOT press 
to firmly on the envelope, you'll have to redo the lettering later. Also, 
make sure you write yourself a letter of a sort to go in the envelope. It's 
rather suspicious should someone recieve an empty envelope. Anyhow, it can 
take up to a week to recieve your own mail, so to make sure you don't fuck  
anything up later, send yourself three or four pieces. 

If you use a phony name, (ie. the one on your new birth records) then make 
sure you recieve the letter before your parents do. It would suck if they 
were to either open it (no return address) or if they were to drop it back 
in the mailbox, as a wrong address, or "moved address unknown". It might be 
best to send it to yourself, as you can remove the name as we shall see.

When you recieve your mail under your name, take some bleach and wet Qtip end
and lightly rub off the address, postal code, and whatever else you have to. 
Try filling in an abandoned house's address, if there is someone you are 
impersonating, or is your mark, then use theirs.. There may be a tint of 
yellow, but you have to over it agin with the bleach to get rid of this. I
sure hope you used the felt.. If you used a ballpoint, this will not work.
Don't use too much either, the paper will warp. After everything is cleared,
then fill in the information you have to. What you will have when you 
are finished, is proof of where you live, via altered mail.

Another easy method is to use your neighbours information, and steal their
mail. It facilitates everything greatly, but it might be a bit more difficult 
pull off. Let's say you go for a drivers, and they say that you are already 
registered with them, as being 20 years older. Then you would not be able to 
access that form of id. From my experience, it is best to go make your own
character.

Now that you've got a fax of your birth certificate, and proof of address,
get some more id cards showing that you are who you want to be... Try to 
get some other things like a community card, get all the library cards you 
want if you don't want to pay their overdue charges, even go get a learner's 
driver's licence, if you don't want an actual drivers. (I bring this up 
a lot because it is probably the best form of id you can get. No place will
ever turn that down, and it's also a picture id. This will add to the realism 
of who you now are if someone asks for other forms of id. Hell, go all the way, 
and get an ATM card, and as many credit cards as you can. But that you'd have 
to do at the end. You should aim for things which have your date of birth,
address, and picture. Try to even get your own SIN number. You can try to
collect two pensions with it later on, if they're still around.If you have 
a phriend with a fax, give him a fake copy as well. If you should run into 
troubles, then you can call him, say you phoned mommy to the people you're 
trying to scam, and let him fax (heh, long-distance) a copy of your new id. 
Just remember that sending a fax usually includes the senders number, and 
the recievers number.

So now that you're someone else, make sure that you also are this new person's
life, by having some sort of a story to go along with who you are. MEMORIZE 
it. There is nothing more embarassing than someone forgetting their own age 
or where they were born. Even worse, when someone asks you where you were 
living before, and you don't know shit all about that place, you can also 
look dumb. You can't avoid all questions about your past. Something you might 
want to consider, is using the same first name. Makes life easier if you are 
ever called by two people - one who knows the fake you, someone who knows
the real you - avoiding this and similar jams which might arise.

If you are smart enough, and manage to get your own money card, hang onto 
it for a while and make sure you always keep money on that card's account to 
make it look valid. In a year or three, you can ask to have your access 
upgraded so you may withdraw a higher limit. This may be tricky as they send 
you a new ATM card for this, but if you are successful, you can get quite a 
bit of cash on a long holiday in which no one will be around to check your 
deposits... Anyways, it'll help you get out of town faster if you would ever 
have the reason to run. 

A few things which may help you out, would be if you are making an id which
presents that you are from out of town, it may be wise to know a little about 
that area, about your parents (if you are living at home), why you are in 
this town, know your past and present address, about the fax and a story to
go with it, and to stick with the story, no matter what happens. I'm obviously
skipping over a lot, but the last point is what I will emphasize the most. If
you have a story, then believe it. The worst which will happen is that you 
may be refused, because you need picture id instead of a fax... 



9. Telus Customer Satisfaction Survey in Alberta -Scribed By Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *Thanx go out to Stratix Research, Angus Reid, and a few other*
  *researchers and customers for their participation and assistance.*

Has the telco, with it's change from AGT, to TELUS, changed much? Six
years, ago, they went private, and witheld "TELUS" until the full 
amalgomation with AGT (Alberta Government Telephone) and EDTEL, (Edmonton
Telephone) was complete. We all know the name had differed in it's respects, 
but has anything else? You decide for yourself with a few small comparisons 
of now, to back when they were still using the name AGT earlier last year.
   
   NOTE: AGTD - Alberta Government Telephone.
         Y/P  - Yellow Pages
         (I was hoping not to recieve any questions regarding 
         this. ie: "It's not in my acronym list..")

But before I begin, I got to get something out in the open 
about the most noticable and probably greatest change about 
the Alberta telco.
 
We had a change, with the AGT, getting rid of ED TEL and all the rest,
and it was indeed "designed" to "bring us better service" from  $.228
to $.201 (within Alberta), and likewise, a similar change of about 
.027 cents per minute elsewhere in Canada and North America... Wow. I 
still haven't noticed any difference. That's great and all, but there 
are other issues at hand with them. They still send you change for 
overpayments at a pay telephone, and the operators are the same. 
    
But, who's the faggot who came up with purple and green for the telco 
sign? Ever look downtown and see that shit beaming from the top of 
their tower? It looks like hell.  Next time you're really bored and 
have nothing to do, make calls complaining about the butt ugly sign on 
their trucks and building. Hopefully, after many many many calls, they 
will consider changing it. Either way, let them know. Just call your 
local operator, complaints dept, suggestions, main switchboard, repair, 
(Yeah, we got a problem on the top of a building here... can you come 
and fix it?) anyone who you can get to, tell them that their logo leaves
much to be desired, and they should change it. Give them anyone's info 
if they ask, putting in suggestions, and giving advice is only illegal 
in communist countries. We don't want to be like that now, do we? 
Speaking with unsatisfied customers...

The following should show the irony of them improving their service,
this took a while, but it was fun talking with a lot of people. 
Names and companies are not released in order protect the victims.

-customers who recieve personalized attention or have less complex needs 
 are most likely to be satisfied with the service they recieve from AGT 
 directory.

-customers who had any of the following problems: difficulty contacting AGT 
 representative, found the representative could not answer all their 
 questions, did not recieve a proof of their display advertisement, or 
 were not satisfied with the final version of the advertisementtended to 
 rate their overall service satisfaction low.

-70% of customers who contacted AGTD to discuss the problems they had, did
 not feel that the matter was resolved to their full satisfaction.

-the third largest response for increasing their overall satisfaction was
 "more contact with representative"

-average of 8/10 rating for reps returning calls promptly.

-average of 8/10 rating for spending enough time with the advertiser.

-main complaint mentioned by a significant percentage of customers was that
 they did not have enough contact with their representative, that there was
 a lack of communication.

-for respondents who contacted AGTD, 85% did not have any difficulty 
 contacting the y/p representative.

-firms 25-100, 25% had difficulty contacting a y/p representative when they
 first called AGTD.

-firms 100+ 50% had difficulty contacting a y/p rep when they first called
 AGTD. 

-20% of display advertisers had difficulty contacting a y/p rep.

-25% of medium to large display advertisers had difficulty contacting y/p rep

-55% of respondents who said they had difficulty accessing their rep, said
 the trouble they experienced was getting the rep to return their calls.

-firms 25-100 split their response 50/50 with reps not returning calls and not
 finding the right person to help.

-firms 100+ had 100% of their troubles concerning reps not returning calls
 as did the medium-large size display advertisers.

-the quality that was ranked third for determining excellent service from 
 their y/p is a regular contact/personal contact.

-overall 35% of respondents rated their reps a score of 7 or less on 
 returning calls promptly.

-45% of firms 100+ rated their reps a score of 7 or less

-30% of firms 100+ and 31% of medium size display advertisers rated their 
 reps a score of 7 or less for their reps spending enough time with them.

-when the respondents informed AGTD of a problem or error, an overall 70%
 total said the matter was not resolved to their full satisfaction, and 100% 
 of firms 25-100 and 100+ said their problem resolution was unsatisfactory
 as well.

 AGT Yellow pages Directory Service Quality Criteria and Usage

-advertisers appear to be dissatisfied wit hthe level of service provided by
 AGT Yellow Pages sales representatives.
 (Call them up and bitch... "Hello operator, put me through to a Calgary
 yellow pages salesman." "But sir, the yellow pages are free.")

-advertisers identified they want sales reps to return phone calls quickly 
 and to be easily accessable. ("Yes, I'm inquiring about purchasing a redbox.
 could you phone me back at...")

-they also want the guarantee of follow up calls after the Yellow Pages are
 published to ensure their satisfaction. (Like they'll change it, after the
 phone book comes out)

-participants dissatisfaction with service they recieve from AGT sales reps 
 appears to be dependent on the percieved quality and amount of contact.

-one of the participants suggested improvements to AGT Yellow Pages 
 advertising was to provide more attentive sales representatives who conduct
 follow-up activities to ensure customer satisfaction. (ie: customer 
 appreciation night, with a big party to follow)

 Exploring Consumer and Advertising Reactions to AGT Directories

-one of the issues which surfaced in the course of the discussions is the 
 lack of responsiveness of some ad sales reps. ("Sir? You still awake?")

-most advertisers noted that they would like to see more of a feedback 
 mechanism instituted, in which the performance of ad sales reps could be
 rated, and have AGT respond to some of their concerns.

-advertisers want guidance, or feedback about what has happened in previous
 years in their section ("Normally sir, you list your companies name and
 phone number, and mabye even a picture. That usually worked great.")

 Advertiser quotes.
 (May not be completely exact, but yes, these are from real people.)

 Nov 8, approx 6:00pm
"That was one of my biggest issues was the rep. I've had nothing but problems
with them for six years. When we first opened up, they wouldn't come and see
me. I had to go to AGT to place my ads. The next year I insisted that someone
come and see me and I find their attitude deplorable. I've never had a good
AGT representative come and see me, you make an appointment with them and
they don't show up, or they say, I'll get there when I get there... When 
they show up, they are extremely rude, they stand at the counter and go, 
"well hurry up, I've got to go", and then throw the ad at you. Six years and 
I've had no one that I would give any kind of good approval to. Basically 
they stink."

"Sometimes I wonder if AGT doesn't try to pass the buck because I've phoned 
their customer service and talked to the managers and one of the ladies that
was helping us all the way through this was told to shut her mouth, she has
nothing to do with the file and she better no have any more conversations
about it. The sales rep was very helpful, but a lot of the times I'm finding
that you phone AGT and you ask a question, if you ask for the head guy, they
won't put you through. This guy came down to me and said what do you want to 
do, and I said well, short of cancelling all my phone numbers what can I do?
they have no answering machines, they say they will get back to you and they
don't get back to you. The rep was the only good thing that the yellow pages
did. But this rep and that one other lady whose name I won't mention
because she's still employed there, they were the only good things but when
they tried to help me they were very quickly told to stay away from it."

"He had a nice ad for me, he had misspelled it, I told him how to spell it 
for me, and he said he got it. I never got the proof back, I phoned for two 
months, every second day I was phoning up the rep, and then he was out of
town and then I got a hold of him and he said yeah, it was fixed up 
and they'd send me some proof. No proof came. And now I'm selling flowers
instead of furniture. I'm selling credencias instead of credenzas."

 Most commonly heard:

-respondents in the advertisers group reported that it was important for
 than to develop rapport with their sales rep.

-the general impression given to the advertisers by their sales rep is that
 they "don't care" about them.

-they indicated that sales reps behaviour and service does little to show
 that they are an individual customer and that their sastisfaction is of
 primary concern.
                         

10. Making Money From Telus -Scribed By Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number available, and published in several skan lists already, by 2600,
by the Jolly Roger, by BTR, and a few others, provides you with an operator
recorded greeting with a request of $0.25! It's great for hours of fun, if
you want to disturb operators. Call them up from your home phone, and tell
them you have inserted quarter after quarter, but the call just is not going
through.. Oddly enough, they do not catch on to that you are at your home 
phone, and not at a payphone. (of course, this will work much better, if you
bounce operators.) If they do ask if you are at a payphone, then just tell 
them you aren't, and either give them your number as the payphone number, if 
they request it, or just say you don't know what it is, as someone usually
scratches out the number on the front of the payphone.

This recording, you might realize, can be used for collecting on overpayments
of a telephone call... Just dial the operator, preferably from a payphone,
and tell them that you put in quite a bit of money, but the call is not going
through. If they place the call for you, then it will be quite the surprise
for them.. Ask if they can insert a quarter for you. After a bit of searching
around, they will take your name, address, and send you money in the mail.

Often times, they offer to reimburse your telephone account. The way around
this - if you do not want to surprise your parents by paying off their phone
bill - is that you politely explain that you do not have an account, and
that is the reason why you were using a payphone to place this call.

There are a few things you should do before calling the operator.

This is calling the number from a payphone, directly. If you are on a 
Millenium payphone (with digital display), then a recorded voice will tell 
you to deposit $2.50. On the older payphones, a live operator will request 
that you deposit $2.50. The reason for this, is so that you can sound as if 
you were trying to place the call. If they ask for how much you deposited, 
and and you do not know the initial amount, then you might not seem to be 
authentic in your request for a refund. After telling them you inserted 
$2.50 as the recording requested, make it a point that the recording began 
requesting another coin, which you faithfully deposited. Tell them that you 
deposited another $2.50, because you thought you had to pay for the long 
distance time, ahead of time. Of course, it asked for more coins, so you 
inserted another dollar into the payphone before giving up, realizing that 
something was wrong with the payphone. You then phoned the operator.

The operator will become rather confused, but ask her to see if she can
connect with the number, just to make sure. She will, and will likely 
follow up with some sort of investigation for the number, attempting to
find out what the number is to, for, and who owns it. If she asks for
a name to who the number belongs to, then make something up. Tell her
that it is a number to a guy you met over the internet, named Sam Lewis,
and you aren't sure what state the number is in either.. Of course, when 
she phones the inward operators in Texas, or Arizona, and the operators 
there cannot come up with an answer, then she will come back and explain 
the entire situation to you, and give you your refund.

So if you follow the suggested plan, you can make six dollars, in a few 
minutes. It's probably higher than some of you are getting paid, if any
of you are working. If you don't believe that this can be done, leave me 
your name, address, and/or phone number and I'll have Telus provide you
with a full reimbursement for an overpayment at a telephone.

What do you recieve from Telus? No letter, just a piece of hard Telus
paper, with coins taped to it's holes... It's great that no questions are
asked. It makes our life a lot easier.



11. Fun Phone Things -Scribed by Lord Narayana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As there is more to hp than just technicalities, and being elite, some 
of you may discover some things on your own to try with the operators or
other users of the telecommunications systems. Sometimes it's great to 
practice these things, because it also let's you practice social engineering
should you ever want to use that dying art or skill in the future.

I. 
Something I did at a 2600 meet with a few people a long time ago, in my 
brief period of boredom, was rush out the the nearest payphone, only
to call " 0 " with the question, "How do I use this phone?"
After the brief initial confusion of how I placed the call (Dialed 0, duh)
she knew it was a Millenium, payphone I was at, and asked, "What does it 
say in the window, sir?" Looking around dumbfoundedly, I replied, "Ah, er... 
On sale! Only 4.99!" She paused for a while, then said, "No. What does it 
say in the telephone window?" Again, I looked at the phone, "Uhm... There 
is no window." As I passed my hand through the empty space in front of the 
phone. Again, the operator paused, probably thinking, "Is this guy for real?" 

This carried on for a while, before I gave in, "Oh, you mean the window with 
the writing?" She seemed somewhat relieved, "Yes, that's right. What does it
say?" I waited, squinting at the sheet of plastic above the keypad, "I dunno. 
It's all in another language. It must be French or Spanish or something. 
Operator Marie, I just don't get it, what do I need to do?" She seemed to 
skip a heartbeat, as she realized that now she could not hang up on me, for 
I knew her name. What would she do? If she hung up, I could report her to 
her supervisor... She had to continue on, in a seemingly endless, and somewhat
desperate struggle of using the payphone. "Do I have to lift something on the 
window?" I queried, hoping she would enlighten me in my difficult endeavour 
of usage of the phone. 

This continued on for about twenty to thirty minutes, likely the most time 
I have ever had an operator on line with me, voice. To cut the story short, 
I helped her out, and gave in, leaving her with the parting words, "sorry to 
have taken up so much of your time, ma'am. It's just that I'm from out of 
town, and am not used to these things. It's really so much different from 
the telephones they used to have, with the handle which you would have to 
turn... It was all done by the operator back then." I could hear her smile,
either in glee or on mockery, with her reply of, "I know what you mean. I
had trouble myself when I first tried one of them. All I can do is say that
you should practice using them for a while, and you'll eventually get the
hang of them. Thank you for using Telus."

II.
One of my favorite things to do is to play operator. (Gee, sounds like a 
sex fantasy...)  This would mean that as an operator, you would have to
try to get people to do things they wouldn't normally do from their phone.
Look in your phone book, and get someone's name, address, postal code,
as well as their phone number. Make sure you have this handy.

I believe I got this origional idea from George Hayduke, author of "Get Even"
and a few other revenge books. If anything, get his book from the library.
I redid the idea, and speech to better suit my needs. Anyhow, on with it.

Playing operator, you have to sound mature in your voice. If your sounding
like a kid, then forget it, because nobody will fall for this.

What you would have is:

[RING]

"Hello?"

"Good afternoon sir, this is John Sampsel from Telus calling. Is Mr.Law 
available?"

"Speaking."

"We'd just like to report that we have discovered the source of your 
telephone problems which you have been having for the past few days."

"I haven't reported anything..."

"Do you live in the (the area he lives at <address> <read off his address>?"

"Well, yes. Will this take long? I'm rather busy.."

"I assure you sir, it will only take a minute of your time."

"Okay."

"Well sir, we have had several complaints from people in your area, and in
order to satify our customers, we are requesting everyone within the area
to follow specific instructions, so as not to inconvenience you later. Would
this be a problem? Or would you rather have us send someone out to your 
location?"

[If he says for you to send someone out, ask if he is aware of the 52 dollar
service charge for sending out a repairman. They will most likely do what 
you want them to after that to avoid being billed.]

"Uhm... well what do you mean? What's the problem? What do I have to do?"

"Not much sir. The static in your phone line has been attributed to some dust
in the phone lines. What we would like you to do, is to take either a plastic
or paper bag... do you have either of those?"

"Yes, I think so."

"Alright, take the bag and wrap it around bother ends of the phone reciever,
while we are cleaning out the dust. This is just to ensure that there is no 
dust or dirt spread around on your counter after we are finished with our
maintenace. Also, we need you to make sure that it is possible to have a 
connection with your phone line, so would you please leave the phone off 
the hook for the next little while? We will be glad to phone you back when
we are finished."

"Well, I don't think is should be a problem. When will you phone back?"

"It should take no more than an hour from now, sir."

"Oh, okay."

"Thank you very much sir, and thank you for using Telus, as your 
telecommunications and long distance provider. We look forward to serving 
you again in the future."

[If he asks about how you will phone him back with the reciever off hook,
then it is up to you to make something up. After all, you are the phone 
company, so you can do what ever you want. Try telling him that it's a 
sudden surge of electricity that makes the phone ring. With the phone off
hook, you are reducing the electricity in the lines, because it is used for 
the operation of your phone. So if you were to increase the voltage in your
line, you could therefore cause the phone to ring when it is off hook.]

The great part, now, is if you want to check to see if you are successful,
call the number back, in about twenty or thirty minutes. If the line
is busy, then phone back in an hour. if it is still busy, then you probably 
have someone who took in your story. (It should be good practice for social 
engineering.) If you call back in two hours, and it is still busy, then try
to picture someone with a bag wrapped around their phone, waiting patiently
for the Telco to phone back. When they finally run out of patience, it would
be interesting to see if they phone the Telco to complain about some guy 
named Jon Enstrom.

If you build this skit up for a while, try throwing in a few things, and
mix in another story or two. Go through the dust part, and try something
of the following, "Now take your ear away from the phone sir... <pause, take
a deep breath, and blow steadily and hard into the phone. Do this two or
three times. If you can't blow hard for about twenty seconds, then move
onto somethign else.>  "Sir? Sir?" <he comes on and says> "yes" and
reply, in the most sincere voice, "Now we need your assistance. Could you
blow as hard as you can into the reciever of the phone?" 
Of course, if the challange anything you request, tell them that you could
always send a repair man over to do this, at the cost of 52 dollars per
visit.

You can also try, "We are sending someone to come into the phone line..
he is getting inot the phone line.. okay, he is coming into the phone
line.. <they will listen intently for this> pth.. pth.. pth.. he is
coming into the phone line.. pth.. pth.. pth.. he is coming into the
phone line.. <they'll be like, Uh huh, okay> he is comeing into the
phone line.. <you breath a faint sigh of relief and come back on> okay,
thank you sir. He has finished cumming into the phone line." Of course,
you can get people to listen to a lot of possible things, if it sounds 
realistic. It is rude and crass, but it will amaze you what you can get 
people to do over the phone with a little bit of authority in your voice.

So that's the fourth issue of this mag. The fifth one, whenever it comes out,
will probably be slightly mroe serious, with more technical information.
Hope you enjoyed this one, so watch for the next one in a few months!
