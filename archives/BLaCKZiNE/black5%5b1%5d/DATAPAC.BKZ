               -Pieced together (and plajurized)by Lord Narayana-
                          this is a blackzine prodoktion

Note a lot of this was taken from logs and various information
systems, so it wasn't entirely my work. But I did spend some time 
putting it all together and editing it. IT's only in it's beta version,
so it's not entirely done.. When it is finished, I'll release it as
a file separate from the blackzine it's included in. 
                                                                               

I'd like to thank quite a few people whom I'm thankful were willing to
write a few things, which I have added into this partial compilation of PSN
material. I've also added a few files without the origional author's consent, 
but I'm giving them credit so I don't think they will mind. This should 
provide some insight and perhaps a bit of incentive to others in their 
search of the hack. 

They are as follows: Mad Max for use of the telenet information, Herd Beast
with the information on both dialcom and infocom, Phreak Accident, The Source
JPowlesland and members of the UCIS, Datapac and Tymnet security for not 
noticing my scanning, and John Hawkinson. Of course, there are few other 
individuals whos assistance has gone unnoticed.

I'd also recommend for anyone who is further interested in the Datapac to 
find Deicides' files. In his Datapac text, many of the NUA's he listed in 
his scans are still active. Also, the Neophyte's guide to hacking should
give someone who is willing a good push in the right direction. If anything,
it tells how to spot the system, and lists a great deal of defaults. Another 
suggestion I would also make, would be to get on the internet and do your 
scanning from there. It is much more difficult to trace someone on the 
internet, and accounts are easily available to ensure your anonymity. Use 
nslookup to find an X25 gateway, and you should be in a much safer world.

VI.   Conclusion.

I. INTRODUCTION.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WHAT IS DATAPAC? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datapac International service is quite simply described as the connection
of Datapac to foreign packet switching networks. Public data networks (PSDN) 
have been operational around the world and many more are currently being 
developed by a number of countries.

By interconnecting these PSPDNs, international data services are offered
to network users all around the world.

Study Group 7 of the CCITT has developed a specification of a universally 
accepted internetwork protocol: 'Recommendation X.75'.  X.75 defines the 
signalling system between two PSPDNs, but can more simply be defined as a 
network to network interface.

The CCITT is the Comite Consultatif Internationale de Telegraphique et
Telephonique. (Or International Telephone an Telegraph Committee, if you 
can't speak french.)  They are part of the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) that creates standards and procedures.

The CCITT has also developed a world-wide numbering plan, named as
'Recommendation X.121'.  According to this plan, international addresses
consist of between four to 14 digits.  The first four digits of the address, 
known as a DNIC or Data Network Identification Code is unique for each 
packet switching network in the world.  The remaining digits are the address 
of a DTE within that network.  In this manner X.121 ensures unique addresses 
for all data terminal equipment in the world.

Using both X.75 and X.121 standards, Datapac also connects to U.S. packet 
switching networks (SprintNet, BT Tymnet, AT&T Accunet, Fedex, Net Express 
and Western Union and through Teleglobe Canada to more than 100 networks 
throughout the world.


WHY DO PEOPLE USE IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Office Administration: Preparation of reports, presentations, posting notices,
inter-company communication, file transfer, database access..
  
Sales: Cash, credit verification, sales, independant agents, order processing,
tracking..
   
Other possibilities: Inventory control, shipping/tracking, dispatch, 
electronic data interexchange (Email, sending files..), electronic funds 
transfer..
   
 


II. GETTING ON THE DATAPAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PUBLIC ACCESS DIALINS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are listed in Canada's phone books, under the name Datapac. 
There are at least three others in Calgary. Check the phone book.

(403)265-4081     9600 baud. 
     264-9340      300 baud.

When you connect, you will have a blank screen. Press  ..  and hit enter.
You will be presented with something like:

DATAPAC: 8480 2642

At this point, you can now start entering the numbers for systems located
on the datapac.

WHAT'S AN NUA?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Datapac provides outgoing and incoming access to at least 6 U.S. based 
Networks and to over 100 other packet-switched networks around the world.  
To successfully complete such calls, Datapac has implemented the 
International CCITT X.75 procedures and X.121 International numbering 
plan. Thus, the Datapac user originating an international call must use 
the following format:

                                          (1) (DNIC) (FOREIGN ADDRESS)
                                           :     :          :
     One defines the Datapac International.:     :          :
     Prefix.                                     :          :
                                                 :          :
     Packet networks are identified by a ........:          :
     four digit number called a DNIC                        :
     (data network identification code)                     :
                                                            :
     The foreign national address is .......................:
     expressed as an eight to ten digit
     address.

Calls to international networks, other than those to the U.S., must be pre-
paid; that is, placed from dedicated or private dial access, or the customer
must use a NUI with public dial access. 

For calls within the datapac, (within the country), they need not be prefixed 
with a DNIC.

What's a NUI?

NETWORK USER IDENTIFIER (NUI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     DESCRIPTION
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     A Network User Identifier (NUI) is a 6-8 character alphanumeric code
     which is entered at call set-up time.  It is used to identify an account
     to which calls from Datapac 3000 and Datapac 3101 (dedicated and dial)
     are to be billed.  (Similar to a long distance 'Calling Card').

     Associated with each NUI is a password which is used as a security
     check when establishing a connection to the Datapac network.

     NUI benefits the user by allowing access to Datapac without the
     requirement for a dedicated connection.


     PURPOSE
     ~~~~~~~

     There are many useful applications for NUI.

     * NUI, when provided to authorized users, can eliminate the need for
       the host to accept reverse charge calls.

     * NUI is required by users of public dial who are placing calls to a host
       application with the reverse charge blocking option.

     * NUI permits subscribers of dedicated and private dial Datapac services
       to "Third Party" usage charges to a NUI account.  For example, some
       users may decide that they do not want usage charged to the dedicated
       access line which they are using.

     * NUI permits sender paid calls to domestic Datapac network addresses
       and to foreign networks.  Users can make international calls to
       overseas networks and charge the call usage to their NUI when using
       public dial ports.  Overseas networks accessed via Teleglobe do not
       accept collect calls.  Users also have the capability of placing
       sender paid calls to Domestic Datapac address, Sprintnet, BT Tymnet,
       Accunet, Autonet, Netexpress, Fedex and Western Union in the United
       States.

     * NUI is required to complete calls using Datapac indial/outdial ports

     * NUI can be used to achieve benefits of departmental accounting.  The
       Datapac bill is itemized to indicate the charges related to each NUI.
       This will assist in determining which department has generated usage
       and the associated charges.



     NUI TYPES
     ~~~~~~~~~

     There are 3 types of NUIs which can be subscribed to:

                      * General NUI
                      * Corporate NUI
                      * Sub NUI

          General NUI
          ~~~~~~~~~~~
          A general NUI is designed to serve the needs of the individual user
          or organizations which require only a small number of NUIs. The
          General NUI subscriber has the ability to perform "ONLINE" password
          changes to view and/or reset NUI system generated statistics.

          Corporate NUI
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          A Corporate NUI is designed for organizations that require several
          NUIs.  The Corporate NUI would typically be assigned to a designated
          individual (Corporate Administrator) within an organization.  Using
          this Corporate NUI, the designated Administrator would have the
          following "ONLINE" capabilities:

          * Change Corporate NUI passwords
          * View Corporate NUI Statistics
          * Add and Delete "SUB" NUIs as required
          * Activate/Deactivate Sub NUIs
          * Enable/Disable Sub NUIs
          * Perform Sub NUI password resets
          * View Sub NUI statistics
          * Modify Sub NUI profile information
          * Display complete profile for a given Sub NUI

          SUB NUI
          ~~~~~~~
          The Sub NUI has the same functionality as the General NUI.  Users
          of a Sub NUI can perform online password changes in addition to
          viewing and/or resetting their statistics.


     HOW TO USE AN NUI
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The following illustrates how you would initiate a call through Datapac
     and bill network usage to a NUI.

          Steps to ACTIVATE a NUI using Datapac 3101 (Asyncronous service)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Step 1   Turn on your terminal and modem.
          Step 2   If using DIAL, look up Datapac in the white pages of
                   your phone directory (for Async see Datapac 3101, for
                   Sync X.25 find Datapac 3000).  Select the appropriate
                   number for your correct modem speed, and dial. At the
                   tone place the modem in 'DATA MODE'.
          Step 3   Enter three periods and a carriage return
          Step 4   Datapac will identify itself with the network address
                   of the dial port you are connected to.
          Step 5   

Enter your General or Sub-NUI ID.
          
          Step 6   Datapac will prompt for the NUI password.
          Step 7   For security reasons, Datapac will overprint 'MMMMMM'
                   on the password
          Step 8   If the NUI/password has been correctly validated,
                   Datapac will respond with an ACTIVE response.

          example session...
          
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
          ...                                                  Step 3
          DATAPAC: 1234 5678                                   Step 4
          NUI abcdef       (note: abcdef is an example NUI)    Step 5
          DATAPAC: password
          XXXXXX                                               Step 6
          MMMMMM                                               Step 7
          DATAPAC: network user identifier abcdef active       Step 8
                   NUI status
          ------------------------------------------------------------------


          At this point the NUI is active and the user should enter the
          destination address of the desired application.

          Note:  All subsequent calls during the same session will be billed
                 to the NUI account until the NUI is deactivated. Users of
                 dedicated access should deactivate their NUIs following
                 following terminal session.

          If users wish to change their NUI password and view or reset
          their statistics they must enter the network address of the NUI
          SYSTEM.


          How to ACTIVATE a NUI using Datapac 3000 (X25)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Commands for specifying a NUI for Datapac 3000 Dedicated and/or Dial
          is specific to the X.25 vendor application.  Please refer to Vendor
          documentation for the applicable commands.  Although each vendor
          package is unique, the use or activation of a NUI for a given call
          typically requires interaction with the software running the PAD
          prior to call initiation.  The NUI facility is turned on and the
          NUI ID always precedes the NUI password in filling in the 'NUI'
          field defined in the software package.  Most packages will adjust
          the technical requirements for field length and appropriate
          positioning in the call request packet.  For technical information,
          please refer to the Datapac 3000 specification.  User's wishing to
          change their password and/or view their statistics should proceed
          to section titled 'How to Change NUI password and/or clear
          Statistics'.


          How to Determine if your NUI is ACTIVE (using Datapac 3101)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          The NUI query command is used to determine if the NUI is active
          or inactive.  For example, a user may already have a Datapac call
          set up and may have forgotten if the NUI had been entered.  Using
          the 'QUERY' command, the user can determine if the NUI had been
          activated prior to placing the Datapac call.

          Step 1   Enter NUI? followed by a carriage return
          Step 2   Datapac will respond by displaying either an 'active'
                   or 'not active' network message.

          example session...
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
          NUI?                                                 Step 1
          DATAPAC: network user identifier abcdef active       Step 2

          or

          NUI?                                                 Step 1
          DATAPAC: network user identifier not active          Step 2
          ------------------------------------------------------------------


          How to DEACTIVATE a NUI (using Datapac 3101)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          The NUI cancel command is used to deactivate a NUI.  For
          example, a user who was using a NUI on the first call of his/her
          session, may wish to place a collect call to another host on the
          second call of the session.  The user could, with the NUI cancel
          command, 'turn off' (deactivate) the NUI.

          Step 1   Enter 'NUI OFF' followed by a carriage return
          Step 2   Datapac will respond with a not active network
                   message

          example session...
          
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
          NUI OFF                                              Step 1
          DATAPAC: network user identifier not active          Step 2
          ------------------------------------------------------------------


          How to DEACTIVATE a NUI (using Datapac 3000)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          User's must place the call without specifying NUI facility.  A
          Datapac 3000 user would typically interact with his/her X.25
          package to remove/deactivate NUI charging request, NUI ID and
          associated password for any give call in a similar way to
          activiation.


          How to access the NUI system
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          The following illustrates how NUI users can access the NUI system
          in order to perform online password changes and view and/or reset
          their statistics.

          Step 1   If using Datapac 3101 dedicated or dial - follow Steps 1
                   to 8 in the Section titled 'How to ACTIVATE a NUI'.  If
                   using Datapac X.25 (CCITT) proceed to Step 2.

          Step 2   Enter one of the following eight-digit Data Network
                   Addresses plus carriage return to establish a connection
                   with the NUI-SYSTEM.  20800096 or 20600377
          Step 3   The System will respond by displaying the NUI Herald.
          Step 4   The System will prompt the user to enter their NUI ID
          Step 5   The System will prompt for the associated password
                   of the NUI ID entered.
          Step 6   For security reasons, Datapac will overprint 'XXXXXX'
                   on the password.
          Step 7   If the NUI/password has been correctly validated,
                   the System will display logon statistics.

          example session...
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
          DATAPAC: 1234 5678                                   Step 1
          
          20800096  <carriage return>                          Step 2

          DATAPAC: call connected to 2080 0096                 Step 3
                   (001) (n, NUI abcdef charging, packet
                   size: 256)

          Note:
          If the NUI/password do not match, the system will respond with
          an 'Invalid NUI or password' error message.  After the third
          unsuccessful NUI/pasword entry attempt, the system will respond
          with a logoff message.

          At this point, it is recommended that Sub NUI users contact
          their Corporate Administrator while General NUI users contact
          the Datapac Customer Assistance Centre (CAC).

          If the system displays a message indicating that you are unable
          to change your password, this indicates that the user's NUI
          has been 'DISABLED', which means that users do not have the
          capability of changing their passwords.  Sub NUI users should
          call their Corporate Administrator for assistance, while General
          Nui user's should call the Customer Assistance Centre.

          How to Change NUI password and/or Clear Statistics
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          At this point the user has successfully entered the NUI System
          and can now perform online password changes and view and/or reset
          their statistics.

          Step 1   The system will request indication on whether or not
                   a NUI password change is desired.  If YES (Y) is entered
                   the system will prompt for NUI/password changes as shown
                   in the following steps.  If NO (N) is entered, the
                   system will generate the next command prompt regarding
                   a change to NUI statistics. If QUIT (Q) is entered
                   the system will LOGOFF.
          Step 2   If the user enters 'Y', the system will prompt for a new
                   NUI password.
          Step 3   For security reasons, the system will overprint 'XXXXXX'
                   on the password.
          Step 4   The system will then request re-entry of the new password
          Step 5   Having re-entered the new NUI password, the system will
                   again overprint the password with 'XXXXXX'.
          Step 6   If the password change is successful, the system will
                   generate a message indicating so.

          Note:
          If the password change is unsuccessful, users are given one more
          chance to enter their new password, preceded by a message indicating
          that the nui password must be 6 alphanumeric characters long
          from the allowable character set '(A-Z), (0-9), (.), (/)'.
          Your new NUI password must also differ from your current NUI
          password.

          After the second unsuccessful entry attempt, the system will
          a Password-unchanged message.


          Step 7   Following a successful response to the system prompt for
                   NUI password, the system will ask users if they wish
                   to clear their statistics. [Y/N/Q]?

OUTDIALS
~~~~~~~~
    SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Approximately 18 centers (DPSA) are being served by datapac outdials.
    They are Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Winnigep,
    Toronto, Clarkson, London, Windsor, Kitchener, Hamilton, Ottawa,
    Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, St. John, (NB) and St. John's(NFLD). 
    Speeds of an outdial vary, but are usually at 300 or 1200 BPS.
    The outdial service will only accepy sent paid calls. The originating 
    end must use a dedicated access, or use a network user identifier (NUI).
    Calling at the terminating end, is restricted to the local calling area,
    (LATA) for the DPSA reached.
    
    For calls, the reciever must be set at even parity in order to recieve
    the outdial call. Once connected, the dpac 3000 user can set and read
    parameters by sending level 1 packets (X.29).

    OUTDIAL PROCEDURES
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1)  Connect to the dpac dialin, or through some inet gateway.
        Anybody using a dialin must have an nui for the outdial
        to be accessible, so if you can obtain one, use must have it
        activated before you connect to the outdial.

    2)  Enter the address of the outdial.

    3)  Datapac will respond with:

                         DATAPAC:  CALL CONNECTED
                         ENTER DESTINATION TELEPHONE NUMBER/ENTRER LE
                         NUMERO DE TELEPHONE DU DESTINAIRE

    4)  Enter the 7-digit telephone number (unless it's a global outdial (GOD)
        it will be a local outdial, so you don't need to enter an area code) 
        of the destination.

    5)  Datapac will respond with:

                         DIALING/COMPOSITION DU NUMERO (XXX-XXXX)
        PRINTING THE DESTINATION TELEPHONE NUMBER AS IT IS DIALED.

    6)  Datapac will then indicate:

                         RINGING/SONNERIE

        as the modem detects ringback tone.

    7)  When the destination modem answers the call, Datapac will send
        the following message to the origination end:

                          CALL CONNECTED/COMMUNICATION ETABLIE

    8)  Continue on with your call.


    9)  To clear the call when you are finished, enter a clear command:

                          (CONTROL P) CLEAR (CR)

        Datapac will respond with:

                          DATAPAC:  CALL CLEARED - REMOTE DIRECTIVE
                          DATAPAC:  TERMINAL ADDRESS

        NOTE:  turn the NUI off before leaving the network with the command:

                           NUI OFF (CR)

               Datapac will respond with:

                           DATAPAC:  NETWORK USER IDENTIFIER NOT ACTIVE

III. Datapac systems.

DATAPAC 3000 (SYNC/X.25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datapac 3000 is synchronous, application independent service that allows data
terminals (DTE's) and data communicating equipment (DCE) to exchange data in 
a pack-mode over a public switching network.

The DTE/DCE interface connection, disconnection and transmission rules are
defined in a packet switching protocol call X.25 recommendation which is
developed and governed by the International Telephone and Telegraph
Consultative Committee (CCITT).

X.25 protocol is a bit oriented framing structure based on the high level data
link control (HDLC).  The CCITT recommendations for X.25 are divided into three
levels, namely:

     - the Physical Interface (Level 1);
     - the Frame Level Logical Interface (Level 2);
     - the Packet Level Logical Interface (Level 3).

Level 1

Specifies the use of four-wire, point-to-point synchronous circuit between the
DTE and the Network (DCE).  This circuit includes two modems or data sets (one
connected to the DTE and the other connected to the Network).

Typical characteristics are:

- 4-wirepoint-to-point or dial via a V.22 BIS modem;
- full duplex;
- EIA RS232 convention.


Modem/Dataset

Level 2

Defnes the frame level link procedures used to synchronize transmission,
initiate the handshaking necessary to establish the R-U-There / Yes-I-Am
Sequence, flow control mechanism and perform error checking of data exchange 
across the DTE/DCE interface (link).  The DTE is usually located at the 
customer premises while the DCE is located in the Network.  The procedures
used to control the link are defined as commands and responses.

Characteristics are:

- HDLC;
- Link Access Procedure - balanced (LAPS);
- X.25 (80 or X.25 (84).

Level 3

Defines the packet formats and control procedures required to establish a
logical path (call request), exchange information (data packets) and for
removing the logical path (clear request) between the DTE and DCE.

Characteristics are:

- Logical Channels (LCN's);
- packet size;
- window size
- throughput class;
- etc.


HOW IT WORKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The customer's terminal is connected to a local modem which, in turn, is
connected to a second modem (remote) in the Central Office by 4 wires which, in
turn, is connected to a line processing module in the Datapac Network.  This
configuration is called the DTE/DCE Link and can be assigned speeds of 1,200
bps through 56,000 bps.

This DTE/DCE link is assigned a unique Datapac Network Address (DNA) and other
link parameters such as line speed, modem type, flow control and security by
Telecom Canada.

When the electrical signals are in the correct state as specified in Level 1,
the Datapac line processing module continuously transmits a CCITT command
called SABM (Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode) to the customer's terminal every
three seconds.  If the DTE is ready, it responds to the SABM with a CCITT
response UA (unnumbered acknowledgement).  When this occurs, the link is
initialized (Level 2 ready), the DTE and Datapac module exchange restarts or
restart/restart confirmation commands.  When this occurs, the DTE/DCE link
generates a transition to the next X.25 level (Level 3).

The DTE then signals the address it wishes to communicate with in a CCITT
defined call request format (8 digits), 10 digits if using 9th and 10th digit
subaddressing on a logical channel (LCN).  Datapac then routes the call request
to the appropriate destination (National or International) and waits a CCITT
defined call accept packet.  If this occurs, the accept packet is transmitted
back to the originating Host and both DTE's may now exchange CCITT defined data
packets.  This is called a Switched  Virtual Call (SVC); Permanent Virtual

Calls (PVC's) are also offered.  At the end of the session, either DTE can
terminate the SVC by transmitting a CCITT defined clear request packet.  Up 
to 255 SVC's may supported simultaneously.

Dial access service is also offered at 2400 bps with a maximum of eight LCN's
over the public telephone network.

DATAPAC 3101 (ASYNC/ITI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datapac 3101 is a network access service which enables teletypewriter
compatible devices, such as time-sharing terminals, to access the Datapac
Network.

Low speed, asynchronous devices are supported through an Interactive Terminal
Interface (ITI) in a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD), which allows the
devices to access the Network over dial-up (DDD) or Dedicated Access Lines.

ITI, the end-to-end protocol for Datapac 3101, conforms to the CCITT
recommendations X.3, X.28 and X.29 and supports access to the Datapac Network
for asynchronous, start-stop character mode terminals.

     X.3 specifies the operation of the PAD.  It contains the specifications
for the twenty-two International parameters and their operation.

     X.25 specifies the command language between the terminal and the PAD.  It
also specifies the conditions which define the command mode and the data
transfer mode.

     X.29 specifies the procedures to be followed by an X.25 DTE to access and
modify the parameters in the PAD as well as the data transfer procedure.

The Datapac 3101 service provides for terminal to Host (user's computer) and
terminal to terminal communication.  The Host access should conform with the
X.25 protocol, using the Datapac 3000 access service, and also support the
higher level protocol conventions for ITI. Host  access may also be provided
via the Datapac 3101 service for some applications.  The Datapac  3101 service
also provides block mode and tape support.

INTERNATIONAL PAD PARAMETERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1)   Ability to Escape from Data Transfer State*

     The setting of this parameter allows the user to interrupt the
communication of his or her application (data transfer mode) and interact with
the PAD (common mode).  The character to do this is "ControlJP".  To return to
data transfer mode, press the carriage return or enter a blank command line.
If the user wants to send a "ControlJP" to the Host, with this parameter set
set to one, simply hit ControlJP twice and the second ControlJP will go to the
Host and the user will remain in data transfer mode.  This also applies to the
user data field in the call request command line.

Parameter Number:  1
Possible Values:   0 = Escape not possible.
                   1 = Escape is possible.

*Note:  Escape from Data transfer mode may also be possible using the break
signal if parameter seven is set to eight.
2)   Echo*

     This parameter indicates to the PAD whether or not the terminal input
data must be echoed.  This may be required if the user's terminal cannot echo
back what is being entered.

Parameter Number:  1
Possible Values:   0 = No echo.
                   1 = Echo.

*Note:  Echo will also be affected by the setting of Parameter 20.


3)   Selection of Data Forwarding Signal

     This parameter indicates to the PAD the set to terminal generated
characters or conditions that will cause data to be forwarded to the
destination.  For example, (CR) can be used as a data forwarding signal on
receipt of a (CR) from the local DTE Y, the PAD will forward all characters in
its buffer to the remote end, including the (CR).  If P13 is set to 6.7, 22 or
23, a (LF) will be included in the packet and will delimit it.  Data is also
forwarded when the buffer is full whether or not a forwarding character is
received.

Parameter Number:  3
Possible Values:   0 = No data forwarding signal.
                   2 = Forward on carriage return.
                   2 = Carriage return.
                 126 = All characters in columns 0 and 1
                       of ASCII table and the character
                       del of International alphabet #5.
                       (See Appendix 1.)

4)   Selection of Idle Timer Delay

      This parameter is used to determine the idle timer limit value when data
forwarding is based on timeouts.  To optimize packetizing of data, no data
forwarding signal need be specified.  The PAD will then packetize data based on
packet size specified (256 or 128 characters).  The idle timer is used to send
any packets that are not fully filled.  If idle timer is activated and the Host
requires the (CR) to input data, it still must be provided before the data send
is accepted by the Host.  The idle timer does not send any empty packets.


Parameter Number:  4
Possible Values:   0 = No data forwarding on timeout is
                       required.
               1-255 = Indicates value of the delay in
                       twenties of a second.  (i.e., a
                       value of 250 makes the time wait
                       10 seconds)

*Note:  When editing is on (P15:1), the idle timer is inactive.  If this is
the only data forwarding condition, turning the editing function on could cause
a user terminal to hand or data not to be forwarded.

5)   Auxiliary Device Control*

     This is used for flow control of data coming from either a PC or
auxiliary device, e.g.:  a paper tape machine.  When set to 1 it indicates to
the PAD that the data is to be read an auxiliary I/O device connected to the
terminal.  This parameter set to 2 indicates that the data is coming from an
intelligent device, i.e., a PC, and that the PAD must exert flow control
differently.

Parameter Number:  5
Possible Values:   0 = No use of X-on/X-off.
                   1 = Use of X-on/X-off for auxiliary
                       devices.
                   2 = Use of X-on/X-off for
                       intelligent terminals.

*Note:  A value of 2 is recommended for PC's.


6)   Suppress Network Messages

     This parameter indicates to the PAD whether or not Network generated
messages are to be transmitted to the terminal.

Parameter Number:  6
Possible Values:   0 = Suppress message.
                   1 = Transmit message.
                   5 = PAD prompt (*) follows Datapac
                       service signals.

7)   Procedure on Break

     This parameter is used to indicate how the PAD should process a break
signal that is received from the terminal while the terminal is in data
transfer state.

Parameter Number:  7
Possible Values:   0 = Nothing. (remain in data transfer
                       mode)
                   1 = Interrupt. (remain in data
                       transfer mode)
                   2 = Reset. (remain in data transfer
                       mode)
                   4 = Send an "indication of break"
                       message to the packet mode DTE.
                       (remain in data transfer mode)
                   8 = Escape from, data transfer ,mode
                       (i.e., enter command mode)
                  16 = Discard output to terminal
                       activate Parameter 8 (P8:1)
                       (remain in data transfer mode)
                  21 = A combination of 1, 4 and 16.


*Note:  The break signal is ignored if the virtual circuit is not established
while in command state.  The break signal will delete the current line.

         The valid values for P7 are 0, 1, 2, 8 and 21.

8)   Discard Output

     This parameter is used in conjunction with Parameter 7.  Depending upon
the break procedure selected, this parameter may be set by the PAD when the
terminal user requests that terminal data be discarded.  This parameter must
then be reset by the destination computer to allow normal delivery.  The PAD
will discard all packets destined for the terminal from the time the PAD sets
this parameter (i.e., it receives a break signal when Parameter 7 is set to 21)
to the time the parameter is reset by the destination.  It can only be reset by
the destination.

Parameter Number:  8
Possible Values:   0 = Normal delivery of output to
                       terminal.
                   1 = Discard output to terminal.

9)   Padding after Carriage Return

     This parameter is used to specify the number of padding characters to be
inserted by the PAD following a CR R transmitted to the terminal.  Padding
allows time for the carriage to return on mechanical printing devices.


Parameter Number:  9
Possible Values:   0 = 2 padding characters will be
                       inserted at 110 bps and 4
                       padding characters will be
                       inserted at higher speeds, in
                       command mode only.  (no padding
                       is done in data transfer mode)
               1-255 = The number of padding characters
                       to be inserted in both data
                       transfer and command mode.

10)  Line Folding

     This parameter indicates the maximum number of printable characters that
can be displayed on the terminal before the PAD must send a format effector
(i.e.., <CR><LF>).  This permits more data to be transmitted in one packet
while still letting the user print out more than one line, i.e., printing out
forms.

11)  Transmission Speed (Read only)

     This parameter is set by the PAD as a result of transmission speed
detection if the terminal accesses an autobaud port.  When a private port with
fixed speed is used, this parameter is set based on the pre-stored information
selected at subscription time.

Parameter Number:  11
Possible Values:    0 = 110 bps
                    2 = 300 bps
                    3 = 1200 bps
                    4 = 2400 bps


12   FLOW CONTROL

     This parameter allows the terminal user to signal the PAD that the
terminal cannot receive any more data, i.e., to flow control data coming from
the network.  When it is set to 1, the terminal user can request that the PAD
stop sending data by transmitting a "Control S". the PAD then suspends
transmission of the data until a "control Q" is received.

Parameter Number:  12
Possible Values:    0 = No use of X-on/X-off for flow
                        control.
                    1 = Use X-on/X-off for flow control.

                             a PAD generated<CR>.
                        17 = Insert <LF> to terminal after
                             a PAD generated<CR> or Host
                             generated <CR>.
                        20 = Insert <LF> to terminal on <CR>
                             from terminal.
                        21 = Insert <LF> to terminal on <CR>
                             from terminal to host
                        22 = Insert <LF> to terminal on <CR>
                             from terminal.  Insert <LF> in

Parameter Number:    16
Possible Values:      0 = Turn off the character
                          editing (command and data
                          transfer mode).
                  1-127 = Character delete character
                          (Appendix K).

17)  Line Deletion
     (Similar to National Parameter 119)

     This parameter specifies the ASCII character to be used as a "line
delete" character for local editing by the PAD.  The default value is set to 24
(Control X).  On some older terminal the Control X key will clear the screen as
well as delete the line.

*Note:  Value 1 is recommended for printing terminals and Value 2 when PAD
echo is off (P2 = 0) and the character "delete" character is defined as <BS>
(P16 = 8).  The PAD does not send an editing service signal to the terminal
upon execution to the character delete editing function; however, the character
will still be deleted from the PAD buffer.

         For video display terminal product a <BS>, but the character will
still be deleted from the PAD.

Possible Values:      0 = No page wait.
                  1-255 = Page wait size.

     The PAD will resume normal transmission when any of the following occurs:

          - on receipt of the page wait cancellation (X-on); or
          - on resetting Parameter 22 to zero.


NATIONAL PARAMETERS

interface (Datapac 3101 Service).

P118 Character Deletion

P119 Line Deletion

P120 Line Display

P12, 122 Additional Data Forwarding Signals

These parameters 121 and 122 allow the definition of one or two additional
data forwarding signals.  These signals are in addition to any that are
specified by Parameter 3 and 4.


Parameter Number:  121, 122
Possible Values:          0 = None.
                      1-127 = ASCII code of additional data

GENERAL NOTES ABOUT PARAMETERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The setting of any of parameters 16 (118), 17 (119), or 18 (120) to a non-zero
value will also set Parameter 15 to 1 when  Parameter 4 is zero.  In the 1984
software level, setting both editing (P15) is off.  This operation is according
to CCITT 1984 standards.

If the character chosen for a certain parameter has already been selected to
be used with another parameter, then the function with the highest priority is
selected upon receipt of the character.  This priority scheme is as follows:

     1) escape from command state;
     2) flow control;
     3) line display;
     4) line delete;
     5) character delete;
     6) packet forwarding.

All of the above parameters are changeable by the user. However, it should be
noted that the Host computer can also change these parameters.

DATAPAC 3201 (API)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~

Datapac 3201, a network access service offered throughout Canada by members of
Telecom Canada, enables various terminals, controllers, mini-computers, and
concentrators that are buffered, pollable and operate asynchronously, to
communicate with host and mini-computers using the Datapac network.  In the
initial years, this service was typically used by the general merchandise,
specialty and variety sectors of the retail industry in Canada.  However, in
recent years, other industry segments such as financial, drug retail and
petroleum sectors have begun to use the service.

Datapac 3201 provides support at the customer's terminal end (i.e. retail
store) by means of a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) located in a telephone
company central office.  The PAD is manufacturered by Northern Telecom and is
known as an AM (Access Module).  The PAD polls the various devices for
information in an on-line, real-time environment.  Communications between the
PAD and the terminal is carried out according to the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) X3.28 - 1976 (A4/D1).   The terminal-PAD procedure
is also compatible with the International Standards Organization (ISO)
POLL/SELECT asynchronous transmission line protocol.  Telecom Canada will
support most terminals that adhere to these protocols on the Datapac 3201
service.  Coformance testing of a terminal is undertaken by Telecom Canada
prior to approving it for use on the Datapac 3201 network.  For more specific
information, refer to the "Point of Sale (POS) End-to-End Protocol", and "AM to
Terminal" protocol documents.

Communications between the customer's host computer location and the Datapac
network is accomplished by the use of an X.25 (Datapac 3000) interface which
also supports a Datapac 3201 end-to-end protocol.  The Datapac 3000 access line
must have the appropriate number of virtual circuits (logical channels) to
support the remote locations of the Datapac 3201 network.  Usually for every
pollable device in the customer's 3201 network, there is an equivalent number
of virtual circuits included on the host access line.  This one to one
relationship of host virtual circuits to remote POS devices allows for
simultaneous virtual calls to be set up through the Datapac network.  For more
information, refer to the "AM-Terminal Communication Protocol" document.

BASIC FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACCESS ARRANGEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SHARED ACCESS SERVICE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each Datapac 3201 shared service user accesses the Datapac network over a
private access line which is connected to a Multi-Access Trunk (MAT).  The
multi-access trunks are shared by several different customersand are configured
by Telecom Canada to meet specific response time criteria.  It should be noted
that Datapac 3201 shared service is not a point-to-point service (e.g. one
dedicated access on a MAT).  The shared concept of the service permits Telecom
Canada to pass on the cost benefits to our customers.

DEDICATED ACCESS SERVICE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With each dedicated access service, a Datapac 3201 user accesses the Datapac
network over a dedicated point to point line.  This non-shared access is
designed to provide customers with an alternative and migration path from
Datapac 3201 shared service.  Dedicated access lines can support 3201
applications that have higher traffic volumes and longer message lengths.

TRANSMISSION SPEEDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The transmission speed for shared access service is 1200 bit per second (bps)
asynchronous, four wire, half duplex.  The transmission speeds for dedicated
access service are 1200 and 2400 bps asynchronous, four wire, half duplex.

The optimum transmission speed on the Datapac 3000 host access line is
recommended by Telecom Canada following a detailed traffic analysis of the
user's application, and will be one of 2400, 4800, 9600, 19,200 or 56,000 bps.

The transmission speed within the Datapac network is up to 112,000 bps.

MSSAGE SIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~
Datapac 3201 shared service is designed primarily for inquiry/response type
applications (i.e. credit verification) with short messages and low traffic
volumes.  The typical Datapac 3201 shared access has an average combined (to
and from the host) message size of less than 120 characters and an average
combined packet volume of less than 2200 packets per day.

Datapac 3201 dedicated access service is designed to accommodate higher
customer volumes, longer message lengths, and to satisfy those customers whose
traffic pattern has grown beyond the shared service parameters.

MESSAGE SIZE - ACCESS MODULE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Packet sizes on the Datapac 3201 Access Module are limited to 252 characters
for input or output messages.

COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSE TIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The communications response time for Datapac 3201 is defined as the period
that elapses between the moment a terminal buffer is ready for transmission and
the instant the first character of the response is displayed.  The
communications response time excludes host queuing and host processing time.

There are three basic components of data transfer delay which comprise the
communications response time.  These data transfer delays occur at:

i)the terminal-PAD access line (MAT line delay)
ii)the host access line
iii)and through the Datapac network (including the PAD)

The definition above applies only to inquiry/response applications, such as
credit/debit checks, inventory enquiries, etc., as these transactions require a
response from the host back through the network.  Data collection transactions
have no response sent back through the network from the host.  Although they
are only "one-way" transactions, they still experience typical delays in being
sent to the PAD and then on to the host.

In a typical retail application with short input and output message sizes
(i.e. 50 characters) and a transaction rate that averages one perminute, the
response time during the retailer's busy hour(s) can be expected to be in the
vicinity of 4.5 seconds for a shared access line.  Prior to recommending
Datapac 3201 service to any customer, Telecom Canada will analyze the specific
customer's traffic profile (i.e. transaction rate, message sizes, busy hours,
etc.) and based on the results will provide the customer with anticipated
response times.  There is no charge for the completion of this study.

ERROR CHECKING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The error checking mechanism depends on whether the terminal to PAD
communication is in non-transparent (A4) or transparent (D1) mode.  With
non-transparent (A4) mode, longitudinal redundancy checking (LRC) is used for
detecting transmission errors while in transparent mode (D1) cyclic redundancy
checking (CRC-CCITT) is used.

AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Customers of Datapac 3201 benefit from the high network reliability and
availability synonomous with Datapac.  The Datapac network is available for use
by customers twenty-four hours a day, seven days as week.  The National Data
Network Centre (NDNC) located in Ottawa constantly monitors system performance
24 hours per day to ensure maximum reliability and availability is maintained.

On-Net Availability

Datapac 3201 is offere
d in all Datapac Serving Areas (DPSA)
located throughout Canada.  These are considered "on-net" locations.  A
detailed listed of DPSAs is provided on the Datapac Information System.

Off-Net Availability

Network connection to Datapac 3201 shared service from outside of a DPSA is a
standard option, provided the distance does not exceed 450 miles in a Telecom
Canada territory.  Special "all-inclusive" off-net rates for shared service can
be obtained from your sales representative.  Connection to Datapac 3201
dedicated service is charged on a "distance sensitive" basis between the
Datapac Serving Area and the customer's "off-net" location.

It should be noted that every year more and more off-net locations become
DPSAs (each location subject to CRTC approval).  If a customer is using Datapac
3201 service in an off-net area which he knows has become a DPSA, he should
contact his sales representative to ensure that his monthly bill reflects the
lower standard rate for the DPSA.

BILLING PERIOD AND RATE COMPONENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum billing period is one month.

The following components comprise the monthly rates that are charged for
Datapac 3201 service:

a)Access charge(on-net or off-net).  The access charge does not include 
 the cost of amodem at the terminal location.  Most pollable devices have 
 integrated modems and are supplied by the hardware vendor.  However, for
 some devices an external modem is required.  If a Telecom Canada provided 
 modem is used, the modem is charged at tariff.  Also, in some customer 
 locations with multiple pollable devices, a bridge is required to permit
 the polling of these devices while still only utilizing one access line.  
 Telecom Canada installed bridges are supplied at an additional charge.

b)PAD usage charges are based on the number of kilosegments (1000 packets) 
 passing through the PAD.

c)Network usage charges are based on the number of kilosegments (1000 
 packets) passing through the network multiplied by a distance sensitive 
 and grade of DPSA rate.

d)The first poll code on a 3201 access arrangement is free. There is a charge 
 for each additional poll code. The maximum number of poll codes allowed per 
 shared access is 5 and per dedicated access is 32.

e)Charges for optional features ( if applicable).

f)There is a one-time service charge for each customer installation.  A 
 service charge will also apply to all customer initiated subscription 
 feature change(s) which are requested after the initial installation of 
 the Datapac 3201 service.

OPTIONAL FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BILLING
~~~~~~~
As an alternative to the Datapac 3201 access being billed, the host location
can be charged for its own service (i.e. Datapac 3000) and for the following
Datapac 3201 charges:

i)fixed and usage charges, or
ii)usage charges

At subscription time, customers must indicate whether they want the host or
Datapac 3201 end billed.  In order for the host to pay for all usage, calls
initiated by the Datapac 3201 terminal end must be sent reversed charged each
time a call is set up.  It should be noted that a different Billing Account
Number is required for each customer location that receives a bill.

REVERSE CHARGE CALL BLOCKING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Datapac 3201 pollable device specifying this feature at subscription time,
will have calls requesting reverse charging blocked by the network, at a fixed
monthly charge per device.

CLOSED USER GROUPS (CUGs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This feature, if specified at subscription time, allows devices within one
group to communicate only with accredited devices of the same group, resulting
in a high degree of data security.

SERVICE RESTRICTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datapac 3201 shared service was originally designed to provide on-line, cost
effective communication capabilities for point-of-sale (POS) applications.
Typical examples include the retail, petroleum, financial sectors for
debit/credit verification, inventory update and sales draft data capture.
Applications with short message sizes and low transaction volumes can
benefit from Datapac 3201 shared service.

Datapac 3201 (shared and dedicated access) is slightly different from the
other Datapac access services as outlined below.

-The service supports a shared access line speed of 1200
bps asynchronous and dedicated access line speeds of
1200 or 2400 bps asynchronous.

-Remote devices can only place calls to one host address,
unless equipped with a clustered poll code feature.

-The Datapac 3201 shared access lines are connected to
Multi-Access Trunks (MATs) which are to be shared
by different users.

-A network Datapac Design Request (DDR) must be com-
pleted prior to acceptance of a customer application on
the Datapac 3201 shared access network.

-The shared access concept of the service restricts the
maximum message sizes and volumes that can be sup-
ported on one Datapac 3201 access line.

CONFORMANCE TESTING FOR DATAPAC 3201 TERMINALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All products connected to the Datapac 3201 network must comply with the
AM-Terminal Communication Protocol and have successfully completed conformance
tests in Telecom Canada's Ottawa lab.  These tests are conducted free of charge
and can be set up through your sales representative or the Telecom Canada 3201
Product Manager.

Datapac 3201 conformance testing is mandatory for all new products and
existing products that undergo protocol, firmware or hardware (all electronic
components, including PC boards) changes.  Customer application software
changes do not apply to this stipulation, unless they are changes which
directly affect the AM-Terminal Communications Protocol.

DATAPAC 3303 (SDLC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are currently 2 services under Datapac 3303 (SDLC).  They are

     1) Datapac 3303/SDLC and
     2) Datapac 3303/SDLC plus

IV. CONNECTING TO U.S. NETWORKS.

The following provides a brief description of access procedures for
each of the U.S. networks.

1)   Sprintnet/Telenet
     -----------------

     To reach Sprintnet enter:

                 13110XXXXXXXXXX <CR>

     Note: 3110 is the Sprintnet DNIC

     If the Sprintnet address has only five digits it should be
     expanded to eight digits by adding three zeroes in the
     middle.  For instance, if the network address is 54321,
     the following must be entered: 54300021.

     In addition to providing access to and from the continental U.S.
     Alaska and Hawaii, Sprintnet also provides access to:

           Bell South - DNIC 3143  and   Centel - DNIC 3148

If you notice carefully, there is online to the host and 4 users. That
is how its packaged, for instance the first 100 mills. will be from user
on then two etc.. The way telenet can tell which is user is which, is
simply by the time. Time is of the essense. data is constantly been
packed, anywhere from 100 mils. to 760 mils. The trick to trap tapping
and piping, a lead off of telenet, is to have as system running four
processes and the same time, and have a master prgm. That switch's at
the appropriate delays... As you can see this is where a 10 Mhz +
system, is needed.
 
On the host end.
 
The host end consists of three things..
 
1)  9600 baud modem
2)  a dedicated telcue line
3)  a network pad..
 
I doubt know one needs a lesson on the first two, but lets take a look
at telenets, "weakest" link..
 
Network Pad
----------
 
There are three types of network pads   a 4 pad 12 pad and 32 pad
They really do not make a diffrence, it only changes the amount
of users, capable of using on line..
 
example. if you have a 4 network pad.  you system will be able to handle
four users from telenet   etc...
 
The network pad is Such a piece of shit you have no idea..
 
All parameters are set remotly by a telenet eng..
 
This is important...
 
If the pad is every shutoff all parameters are lost.. and an eng. must
reload the pad..  (again, this is done remotly)
 
To give you a small ifea, ofthe amount of programing in thms pad (which
i might add has over 2 megs of internal RAM) for an eng. to upload it ct
9600 bps..  it took approx 38 mins.
 
The Pad is not a computer,  if ytou think about it though, if your
traveling at 1200 on telenet, your actually travling at 9600 and back to
1200.. when x.25 is unpacked..
 
How is the pad set remotly..
 
lets take an example...
 
c 2122
 
now c 2122  /(?this is an example)
 
The four nodes its a siml divester to the next node. however you can
specify, the node you want
 
c 212.01
c 212.02
   etc....
 
nodes can also"be stated as  2122a  is the same as "2122.01
and 2122.03 is the same as 2122c
 
Now that we know how to access the indiv. nodes. let me show you a small
secret...
 
Theres a programing node.. so an eng. can upload, to your network pad..
 
every address has it...
it always ends in  99
 
so, if i wanted to trap and tap c 2122
 
i would enter   c 2122.99
 
You would get a connected.. but do you notice nothing happens?
 
At this point do not touch any keys.. a wrong key stroke, will most likely 
alert someone to your tampering.. (don't forget, all network pads have a 
direct alarm signal.. so follow my directions to the letter...
 
enter in :

with out a return..  you should  get    telenet
                                        
if you dont give it a min. then hit return. your actually there. but the
prompt, just didnt print.. ok..
 
Now type

set 15:0
 
when entered.. hold 15 secs.. for a time delay..
 
then type in     cont
 
to continue, with the host you broke from.....
 
you will get a message:
 
TP3005 DEBUG PORT V5.37.03
>
 
you're now directly accessed the network pad..

Please note some of these have passwords.
                                           
                                           
However if your prompted for a password, of if nothing happens, telenet 
has two standard passwords: superman
(represeting a male tech, and) 
                         $  wonderwomen
repre. a woman tech..
when in your prompt  is always a greater than sign:
                                                           >
 
type the following:
 
                        7FDS
HIT RETURN
 
    youll get a response:  $  E  01
 
NOW TYPE IN:
                                  L7FE,L,A2,R2,D
 
then you'll get a message:         R  00A626   8805
 
now enter in:                    40588
 
YOUR RESPONCE WILL BE :           E   01
 
right now you should open at least a 640K buffer.....

now type in >           R0589
 
YOU'LL GET A WHOLE LIST OF DATA THAT IS CURRENTLY CROSSING THE PADS
DUPLEX.
ONE LINE WILL LOOK LIKE THIS:
 
 
 
R 00A625   06805FF17068703  1287100230050540  0000000000000000  FF020101000000

     Ever since the early 80's GTE Telenet has been expanding their public
packet switching system to hold enormous amounts of users.  Currently GTE
SprintNet (Yes, Telenet is out, SprintNet is in.) has over 300 nodes in the
United States and over 70 other nodes abroad.  SprintNet provides private
X.25 networks for larger companies that may have the need.  These private
networks are all based on SprintNet's 3270 Dedicated Access Facility which
is currently operating for public use, Hence for the major security Sprint-
Net has aquired.

      SprintNet's security department is a common idea of what any large
public packet network should be.  With their home office located in Virgina
(703), most Hacker's who run into trouble with them would wind up talking
to Steve Mathews (Not the head of security but a prime force against the
major attacks Sprintnet recieves from Hackers anually.), who is a very
intelligable security analysist that deals with this type of problem daily.

      Because of Steve's awarness on Hackers invading "His" system (As most
security personnel refer to the system's they work for as their own.), He
often does log into Bulletin Boards accross the country looking for Sprint-
Net related contraband.  At the time of this article, Steve is running an
investigation on "Dr. Dissector's" NUAA program. (NUA attacker is a Sprint-
Net NUA scanner.)  Besides this investigation, he currently stays in contact
with many Hackers in the United States and Abroad.  It seems Steve recieves
many calls a month from selected Hackers that have interests in the Security
of SprintNet.  Wow.  Who the Hell would want to call this guy.  From many
observations of Steve Mathews, I find him to in deed be the type to feel a
bit scared of Hackers.  Of course, his fright is really quite common amoung
security personnel since most fear for their systems as well as themselves.
(Past experiences have showed them not to take Hackers lightly, Hence they
have more contacts then 60 rolodex's put together.)

       For now, let's forget Steve Mathews.  He's not important an important
influence in this article.  Trying to pin a one-person in a security depart-
ment that handles security is like finding a someone on a pirate board that
doesn't use the word "C0DE" in their daily vocabulary.

       Telenet's main form of security lies in their security software called
TAMS (Telenet Access Manager System).  The TAMS computers are located in Res-
tin, Virginia but are accessable throughout the network.  Mostly, the main
functions of TAMS are to:

       * Check to see if the NUI/Password entered is a valid one.

       * Check to see if the Host has list of NUI's that can access
            that host.  If another NUI is used, a Rejection occurs.

       * Processes SprintNet's CDR (Call Detail Recording), which
            includes Source and Destination, Time of call, Volumes
            of data recieved, and the Total time of the call.

       * Can be used by host to add an optional "ALPHA" NUA for "easy"
            access.

       * Can secure Hosts further by adding an NUA security password.

       * Restricts calls without an NUI for billing (I.E. No collect
         calls to be processed).

       * Accepts all calls to host as a prepaid call (I.E. Accepts all
         calls).


     TAMS is really for the handling of NUI and corresponding NUA's, therefore
being a security concept.  TAMS holds all the data of NUI's and restricting NUAS
for the ENTIRE network.  If one could gain the access to TAMS, one could have
the entire network at his/her disposal.  This of course if highly impossible
to SprintNet's security department, but not for a couple of hackers I have ran
into.  Yes, TAMS is quite interesting.

      In other aspects of SprintNet security, lets focus on the actual X.25
software that they use.  Anybody who tells you that Telenet can monitor the
sessions currently taking place on THEIR network is WRONG (And probably very
stupid as well).  Monitoring is a basic feature of all X.25 networks, whether
it's a little PeeShooter network or not, they can and do monitor sessions.

       Of course their are far to many calls being placed on SprintNet to be
monitored, but a scared host can always request a full CDR to be put on their
address to record all sessions comming in on that NUA.  Such as the many re-
corded sessions of the ALTOS chat(s) in Germany that was a hot-spot for many
Hackers across the United States and Abroad.  After the detection of ALTOS,
through the hundereds of illegally used NUIs, CDR's and direct host monitoring
were used on the ALTOS hosts.  As far as prosecutions concern, I doubt their
were any.

        Now, as far as other security software on SprintNet, they have a call
tracking service that is called AUTOTRAIL.  Basically, AUTOTRAIL traces the
connections through the DNIC's and back to the orginating NUI and/or NODE loca-
tion that placed the call.

        AUTOTRAIL has nothing to do with ANI.  Not at all.  In fact, the many
dialups that lead into SprintNet's PDM gateway do NOT have any type of ANI.
That is basically a telephony problem.  ALthough I would think twice about
messing with a dialup that is run on a GTE carrier.  That's up to you though.

        Another aspect of security in which Telenet offers is an ASCII tape
that can be obtained by a host customer, which contains all CDR information of
any connection to that host for the last week/month/year.  So, it is obvious
to say that SprintNet does have a hudge database of all CDRs.  Yes, another
point:  This database is located in the TAMS computer.  Hmm, ahh.. Wouldn't
that be neat.

                          TERMINAL IDENTIFIERS

  A terminal identifier indicates to the network the characteristics of your
  terminal. Most terminals can use the "A" terminal identifier.  However, if
  your terminal requires a carriage return delay, for example, then the "I"
  or the "E" identifier should be used. 

  At  'please type your terminal identifier'  please enter:


   A  for PC's and CRT terminals (SAVE parity)
   C  for 300 baud Impact Printer Terminals
   E  for Thermal Printer Terminals like the SILENT 700 series
   F  for BETA transaction terminals
   G  for the GE Terminet at 1200 baud
   I  for 300 baud Thermal Printer Terminals
   K  for EVEN/ODD parity terminals  (future implementation)
   O  for MARK/SPACE parity terminals (BBS access)
   Y  for 300 baud Transaction terminals


                            Logon Options

  At the 'please log in:' prompt the user can specify control characters
  to set the network to the needs of the user.
  For example when you are connected to a database and the data is
  coming in to fast you can backpressure the data by typing control S. The
  network however will only react on this command if you specified ^R at
  the logon step.

   ^E    - control E - Enter Full Duplex mode (future implementation)
   ^H    - control H - Enter Half Duplex mode - disable echo!!
   ^I    - control I - Build optimal circuit for Interactive traffic
   ^P    - control P - Force EVEN Parity
   ^R    - control R - Enable host backpressure X-on X-off
   ^U    - control U - Force terminal data to uppercase
   ^V    - control V - Build optimal circuit for Volume traffic
   ^W    - control W - Erase login up to last terminator
   ^X    - control X - Enable terminal backpressure X-on X-off
   ^Z    - control Z - Disconnect/Logoff
   ESC   - escape    - Discard login and get NEW please log in prompt
   BREAK - break     - Switch to CCITT X.3 X.28 X.29 PAD (selected nodes)

 Please log in. IBM

  Passwords to usernames can be easily changed if this option has been
  enabled by your account manager. Follow the 11 steps listed below.

  1.  Dial your local network access number.
  2.  Send the terminal identifier you normally use (for example 'A')
  3.  At the please log in: prompt type in 'PASSWORD' <carriage return>
  4.  A circuit will be established to the validation system, and you
      are prompted to enter the username for which you want to change
      the password.
  5.  If the name is correct, you are prompted for the old password.
  6.  Enter the old password.
  7.  If old password is correct, you are prompted for the new password.
  8.  Passwords must have a minimum length of 8 characters and must contain
      one or more non-alpha numeric character.
  9.  The new password is then checked for the valid format.
 10.  If the password format is valid, enter the new password once more.
      The system will immediately modify your password on the network.
 11.  The system disconnects, and you are back at 'please log in'

           Online CAUSE and DIAGNOSTIC Messages Database
 
Cause and diagnostic messages are sent whenever a session is terminated.
The two codes issued at the termination indicate the reason the session
was terminated. Cause 0, Diagnostic 0 is presented normally as :
 
     Host: Call cleared (c 0,d 0)
 
Means the call was cleared in a normal way, by the host.
 
This database contains all other clearing codes that normally
indicate an error condition generated or experienced by the network
or the host.

ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE is offered by a local 
Telecommunication Administration equipped with BT TYMNET technology. 
In many instances the administration is using BT TYMNET's Network 
Supervisors to operate the packet service in their area.

All ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE locations offer direct TYM2 
(TYMNET's proprietary) protocol connection to the BT TYMNET Public 
Network and thus may offer BT's comprehensive array of enhanced 
protocol services.  Most currently offer BT TYMNET asynchronous 
access and X.25 service.  Naturally, a close affinity exists between 
BT and ENHANCED GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE providers so a very high 
degree of service and support exists in these locations.  TYMUSA, a 
universal dial-up service which is billed back to the customer's home 
office, is offered from all the above locations.

BASIC GLOBAL CONNECTION SERVICE providers connect their networks to 
BT TYMNET exclusively via X.75 protocol gateways.  The CCITT 
recommendation X.75 is closely related to the better known CCITT X.25 
recommendation and provides a reliable communication channel for 
interworking between Public Data Networks.

As a supplier of network technology to US IRC's and foreign carriers 
for more than 10 years,  BT has a wealth of experience with the X.75 
standard and actively participates in its development.  BT TYMNET 
X.75 software has evolved into a sophisticated product providing 
numerous advanced features not found in other X.75 implementations.  
BT maintains and supports more X.75 gateway links than any other 
network in the world.

All of BT's X.75 gateways are supported by BT's International Network 
Services group which ensures that all the gateways are configured to  
provide  a  uniform  interface to BT TYMNET regardless of the

       TYMNET DATA SECURITY

       PURPOSE:  This document provides background, and general procedures
       and practices used to support customers with suspected security
       problems.  Field Sales is the intended audience but is a general
       document and may be useful to other customer support personnel.

       Currently, this document is in a final review.  Meanwhile, it is to
       retain the status of an internal proprietary document.

       BACKGROUND:  BT Tymnet Inc, and its Network Systems Company,
       believe information integrity is vital to ourselves and our
       customers.  One way TYMNET insures integrity is by providing good
       security.  TYMNET has a baseline security of user name, password,
       and user access profile available for all customers.  Further, there
       are two security products.  One permits the customer to limit
       password life (password automatically expires after a customer
       elected time period) and the other permits the end user to change
       his/her own password.  Since we do consider security a key issue,
       we continue to develop other security features.  Also, we work with
       Security vendors to certify their security products on our network,
       thus permitting customers to add such products, should they so
       desire.


       We have established Network Systems Company Policies which provide
       a framework for the information contained herein (see NSC Policy
       121 and 122.  More policies are in distribution as of this
       writing).  It is highly recommended that these policies be reviewed
       since they represent the framework of this document.

       Legal considerations are another key issue in any security case.
       Support, other then providing the customer with related security
       data, can only occur if law(s) have been broken.  The
       legal issues are complex and only a minimal information is
       provided herein.  At at the heart of this issue is the fact that
       the customer is the injured party, not TYMNET.  Patience and good
       communication may be required to get the customer to understand
       this fact.  The customers must act for themselves to obtain
       law enforcement support.  TYMNET will support that activity, and
       help to the degree possible, much as a "friend of the court".

       THE SUPPORT:  We provide security support as a responsible
       network service provider.  The first step in that support is for
       the field sales representative to act as a security consultant to
       the customer, at least to the extent explained below.

       The customer is well advised to plan in advance "what to do
       when Captain Midnight strikes" -- contingency planning, pure
       simple.  First there are two basic alternatives to choose from:

                              PROTECT AND PROCEED

                                       OR

                              PURSUE AND PROSECUTE

       "Protect and proceed" means 1) determine how the incident
       occurred, 2) plug the security leak/hole, and 3) go on with
       business as normal.
       (Do we want written notification of the Intent to "Pusue and
       Prosecute" from the "Injured Party?").

       "Pursue and prosecute" is just that.  The first step is having
       the customer obtain legal support, and both we and the customer
       continue to gather evidence until the suspect is apprehended.  The
       next step is the prosecution in a court of law.  (The final step is
       to return to the first alternative, e.g., now protect and
       proceed.)

       The customer needs to judge each case  on its own merits, but
       generally the first choice is the wiser one.  The second choice
       involves considerable effort, mostly by the customer and law
       enforcement agency(s), possible negative publicity for the
       customer and does not necessarily result in successful prosecution.
       Good contingency planning also includes becoming familiar with the
       laws and the local law enforcement people.

       The starting point is a suspected incident.  Herein, we will address
       the case where the customer has identified a suspected intruder.
       Generally, that occurs by a customer's detailed review of billing
       or host based security exception reports.

       At this point it is essential the field sales representative open a
       ticket containing at least the following:  1) customer name and CID,
       2) host(s) involved, 3) incident start and stop times, and 4) the
       customer's objective.  Add any other information deemed helpful.
       Other support may be an on-line trace of the call, if the
       suspect is currently on-line.  Field support should do this trace, or
       alternately, this same help can be obtained by calling network
       customer support and/or NetCon.  In any case it must be done while
       the suspect is on-line.  Such trace information should be
       included on the ticket.

       Based on the customer's position; the case will fit either
       "prevent and proceed" or, "pursue and prosecute".  The former is
       straight forward, in that TYMNET security will research the
       incidents(s), and provide data (generally user name and point of
       origin(s) to the customer via Field Sales, with recommendations
       on how to prevent any further occurrence.  We do provide this
       service as a responsible vendor, although strict interpretation
       of NSC policy 121 precludes it.  However, we do apply the policy if
       a customer continues to ask for data without taking preventative
       action.

       The "pursue and prosecute" case is complex, and is different for each
       situation.  It will be explained by using a typical scenario.  After
       the first step (as above), it is necessary to gather data sufficient
       to show a pattern of intrusion from a single TYMNET access point.
       With this information, the customer (the injured party) must contacts
       law enforcement agency(s), with the one exception noted below.

       If that intrusion point is through a gateway from a foreign
       country, for all practical purposes, the customer can do little to
       prosecute.  The law(s) of the foreign country will apply since
       extradition is most unlikely.  Therefore, action will have to be
       have to be initiated by the network service provider in the
       foreign country.  In this case, TYMNET security will have MIS
       research the session details to obtain the Network User
       Identifier, and External Network Support (Jeff Oliveto's
       organization) will communicate that information to the foreign
       network for their action (cases involving U.S. government computers
       may get special treatment - see for example - Communications of the
       ACM, May, 1988, article on "Stalking the Wiley Hacker").

       Most all security incidents on our network are caused by international
       hackers using X.121 addressing.  Frequently, our customer is unaware
       of the risk of X.121 addressing, and permits it.  BE SURE YOUR
       CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE FULL TYMNET SECURITY FEATURES,
       THEREBY PRECLUDING SUCH INTRUSIONS FROM X.121 ADDRESSING FROM
       FOREIGN NETWORKS.

       For the domestic case, the customer gets law enforcement (attorney
       general at incoming call location, secret service if credit card
       fraud is involved, or possibly the FBI, depending on the incident)
       to open a case.  Note, damage in estimated dollars is usually
       necessary to open a case, and many agencies will not take action on
       small claims.  For example, as of December, 1988, the Los Angeles
       Attorney will not open a case for less than $10,000 (they have too
       big a caseload at higher damages).

       Assuming legal support is provided, a court order for a wire tap
       and trace will be obtained, thereby determining the caller's phone
       number (this step can be very involved and time consuming for long
       distance calls).  The next legal action occurs after the calling
       number is identified.  A search warrant is obtained for searching the
       facility housing the phone location.  Normally, this search will
       gather evidence sufficient for prosecution.  Evidence is typically
       the necessary terminal equipment, printouts, diskettes, etc.  Then,
       at long last the prosecution.  Also note, again at the time the
       calling number is identified, the injured party should use the
       "protect and proceed" plan.

                   U.S. Canadian traffic is complicated by many  
                   factors.  the most common kind of traffic originates in 
                   Canada from a terminal and terminates on a host in the  
                   U.S.  This is Inbound 3101 Collect and is billed by
                   Tymnet in U.S. dollars.  Whether traffic is 3101 or 3000
                   traffic is determined soley by the nature of the   
                   connection in Canada; 3000 is a host, 3101 is a terminal.   
     
                   A username is not needed to access Tymnet from Canada

6)   Dialcom   
     -------

Introduction

Dialcom is an interesting system for hackers for two reasons:
First, it is used by business people, reporters and many other world
wide, and it offers a variety of information services, from a
bulletin board to stock market updates and news services.  Second,
Dialcom runs on Prime machines, so using Dialcom is a good way to
learn Prime.  True, it's not the best, as access is generally restricted,
but it's better than, say, learning VMS from Information America.

In these days, where everyone seems to be so centered about the
Internet and the latest Unix holes, it's important to remember that the
information super-highway is not quite here, and many interesting things
are out there and not on the Internet.  Phrack has always been a good place
to find out more about these things and places, and I wrote this article
after reading the Dialog articles in Phrack.

Well, gentle reader, I guess that my meaning-of-life crap quota is full,
so let's move on.

Accessing Dialcom and Logging In
-------------------------------

Dialcom is accessible world-wide.  It offers connection to Tymnet, Sprintnet,
and other networks as well as dialin modems.  Since I am not writing to
Washington people only, I will specify only the easiest methods -- Tymnet
and Sprintnet -- and some of the more interesting access methods.

Dialcom is basically a Primecom network.  Each user has an account on
one or more of the systems connected to that network.  To access Dialcom,
the user needs to access the machine his account is on.  First, he logs
into a public data network and follows the steps required to connect to
a remote note.  On Tymnet, this means getting to the "please log in:"
prompt, and on Sprintnet it's the famous '@' prompt.

For Tymnet, you must enter at the prompt: DIALCOM;<system number>
(eg, DIALCOM;57).  The same goes for TYMUSA connection from outside
the USA.

For Sprintnet or other PADs, you must enter the correct NUA:

   System #         Sprintnet NUA         Tymnet NUA
   ========         =============        =============
     XX             3110 301003XX        3106 004551XX
   (32, 34,
    41 - 46,
    50, 52,
    57, 61,
    63, 64)

It should be noted that Dialcom keeps its own X.25 network, Dialnet,
and the NUAs on it are those of the systems (connect to address "57"
for system 57).

Dialcom has other access methods, meant to be used from outside the
USA, but sometimes available from within as well.

One is a COMCO card, which is inserted into a reader connected to the
computer and the modem through a serial link.  The user then calls a
special dial-up number, and can connect to Dialcom (or any other NUA).
The card contains a number of "tax units" which are deducted as the
connection goes through, until they are exhausted and the card is useless.
The user calls the dial-up and types in ".<CR>".  The amount of tax units
on the card will then appear on the screen, and the user can connect to a
host.  COMCO dial-ups:

                Location                                Number
          =======================                   ==============
          Australia                                 +61-02-2813511
          Belgium                                   +32-02-5141710
          France                                    +33-1-40264075
          West Germany                              +49-069-290255
          Hong Kong                                 +852-5-8611655
          Netherlands                               +31-020-6624661
          Switzerland                               +41-022-865507
          United Kingdom                            +45-01-4077077
          USA (Toll Free)                           +1-800-777-4445
          USA                                       +1-212-747-9051

The other way is through Infonet.  I will not turn this into an Infonet
guide, save to write the logon sequence needed to access Dialcom.
At the '#' prompt, enter 'C'.  At the "Center:" prompt, enter "DC".
Dialcom NUAs are 31370093060XX, where XX is the system number.

Once the connection to a Dialcom system has been established, you will
be greeted by the Prime header:

Primecom Network 19.4Q.111 System 666

 Please Sign On
>

And the '>' prompt.  This is a limited prompt as most commands cannot
be issued at it, so you need to login.

Dialcom user id's are typically 3 alphabetic characters followed by
several digits.  The password may contain any character except for
",;/*" or spaces, and my experience shows that they tend to be of
intermediate complexity (most will not be found in a dictionary, but
could be cracked).

Password security may become useless at this point, because the Dialcom
Prime systems allow ID to take both user id and password as arguments
(which some other Primes do not) and in fact, Dialcom tutorials tell
users to log on like this --

>ID HBT007 IMEL8

-- which makes ``shoulder surfing'' easier.

One you log on, you will see:

Dialcom Computer Services 19.4Q.111(666)
On At 14:44 07/32/94 EDT
Last On At 4:09 06/44/94 EDT

>

And again, the '>' prompt.

Security at Dialcom
------------------

As mentioned, while passwords are relatively secure, the manner in
which they are entered is usually not.

As for the accounts themselves, it's important to understand the
general way accounts exist on Dialcom.  Dialcom users are usually
part of a business that has an ``account group'' on Dialcom.  Each
user gets an account from that group (HBT027, HBT054).  Each group
also has a group administrator, who controls what each account can
access.  The administrator determines which programs (provided by Dialcom)
each user can access.  A foreign correspondent for a magazine might
have access to the news services while other users might not.  The
administrator also determines how much the user can interface with
the Prime OS itself.  Each user can run a few basic commands (list
files, delete, sign off) but above that, it's up to the administrator.
The administrator may opt to remove a user from the controlling menuing
system -- in which case, the user has no restrictions forced upon him.

Group administrators, however, handle only their groups, and not the
Dialcom system.  They need, for example, to notify Dialcom staff if
they want an account removed from the system.

Another (different yet combined) part of the account/group security
are accounts' ``security levels'' (seclevs).  Seclevs range from 3
to 7, and determine the access an account has to various places.
Seclev 4 users, for example, are not restricted to seeing only users
of their group on the system, and can delete accounts from the menuing
system.

User accounts own their directories and files within (but high seclevs
can read other users' files).  Each account's security is left in some
extent to its owner, in that the user sets his own password.  When
setting a password, a user can set a secondary password.  Any user wishing
to access that user's directory will need that password.  Furthermore,
the user can allow other users to attach as owners to his directory if
they know his password (come to think of it, couldn't they just login
as him?).  This is all controlled by the PASSWD program (see ``Common
Commands'', below).

Dialcom also allows for login attempt security using the NET_LOCK
program.  NET_LOCK blocks login attempts from addresses that have
registered too many login failures over a period of time (the default
being blocking for 10 minutes of addresses that have registered more
than 10 failed login within 5 minutes).  NET_LOCK -DISPLAY is accessible
to users of Seclev 5 and shows addresses currently blocked and general
information.  Other options are accessible to Seclev 7 and are:
-ON, -OFF, -ATTEMPTS (number of attempts so that NET_LOCK will block
an address), -LOCK_PERIOD (the period in which these attempts must
occur), -LOCK_TIME (time to block), -WINDOW (a time window in which the
lockout feature is disabled).

A little unrelated is the network reconnect feature of the Prime
computers.  When a user gets disconnected from the system because
of a network failure, or for any other reason which is not the
system's fault, he can log back in and reconnect into the disconnected
job.  When this happens, the user sees, upon logging on:

You Have a Disconnected Job:

  HBT007               d09   1  109   NT   NETLINK  989898989    6 3

Do You Want to Reconnect?

Which means user's HBT007 job #9 (a NETLINK command) is waiting for
a reconnection.  At this point, the user can continue, leaving the
job to hang until the system signs it off when a certain amount of
time expires; sign the job off himself; or reconnect to that job.
(Try "HELP" at the prompt.)  This wouldn't be important, but experience
shows that many disconnections occur when someone logs into Dialcom
over a network, and then uses NETLINK (or another program) to connect
to another site over a network, and somewhere, some time, he issues
a control sequence (let's say to tell NETLINK to do something) that
gets processed by the first network, which logs him off.  So there
is potential to log into the middle of people's sessions (yeah, like
detached ttys).

Common Commands
---------------

Common commands are in reality the basic Prime commands that every
account has access to.  Here they are, in alphabetical order.

`CLEAR' Clear the screen.

`DATE'  Shows the date at which a command was entered.  Output:

        >DATE
        Proceed to next command

        >BAH

        Friday, June 38, 1994 10:01:00 AM EDT

`DEL'   Deletes a file.

`DELP'  Deletes several files based on wildcards.  Can verify deletion
        of every file, and delete only file modified before, after, or
        between certain dates.

`ED'    Is the default and simplest file editor on Dialcom (some of its
        brothers are JED and FED).  Once invoked, ED enters INPUT mode,
        in which the user just types text.  To enter EDIT mode, where
        you can issue commands, you need to press <CR> on a blank line
        (the same thing will get you from EDIT mode back to INPUT mode).
        The EDIT mode uses a pointer to a line.  All commands are carried
        on the line that the pointer points to.  "T" will bring the
        pointer to the top of the text, "B" to the bottom, "N" to the
        next line down, "U" to the next line up, and "L <word>" to
        the line containing <word>.  ED commands include:

        P:     PRINT the pointer line.  P<number> will print <number>
               of lines.
        C:     Change words.  The format is "C/old word/new word".
        A:     Appends words.  The format is "A <words>".
        R:     Retype pointer line.  The format is "R <new line>".
        SP:    Check the spelling of the text, and then point to
               the top of the text.
        SAVE:  Will save the text and exit ED.
        Q:     Will quit/abort editing and exit ED.

`F'     List all file info.  Output:

        DIALCOM.TXT  001  13/30/94  13:50  ASC  D W R

        Which means file name "DIALCOM.TXT", size of 1 file blocks,
        lat modified on 13/30/94 at 13:50, is an ASC type file, and
        the account has the permissions to D(elete), W(rite), and
        R(ead) it.

`HELP' (`?')  Displays a nicely formatted menu of available commands.

`INFO'  System info.  INFO <info-file-name> displays an information
        file, for example, INFO NETLINK.

        "INFO ?" lists info files.
        "INFO BRIEF" lists info files grouped by application
        "INFO INFO" lists info files with their descriptions.

`L'     List all file names.  Output:

        <S666-6>HBT007 (Owner)

        DIALCOM.TXT

`LS'    Display information about available segments and the account's
        access to them.  Output:

        2 Private static segments.
        segment access
        --------------
        4000    RWX
        4001    RWX

        11 Private dynamic segments.
        segment access
        --------------
        4365    RX
        4366    RX
        4367    RWX
        4370    RWX
        4371    RX
        4372    RWX
        4373    RX
        4374    RWX
        4375    RX
        4376    RX
        4377    RWX

`NAME'  Changes UFD name.  Output:

        >NAME

        Old Name: John Gacy
        UFD Name: Herd Beast
        All done

        >WHO

        Herd Beast <S666-6>HBT007

`NETWORK'  Accesses a database that contains dial-up number for Sprintnet,
           Tymnet, Datapac and Dialcom's Dialnet by State/City.

`OFF'   Sign off the system.

`ONLINE' Who's online?  The amount of data displayed depends on the
         account's seclev.  Seclevs below 4 are restricted to seeing
         only users of their group.  Output:

         HBT007      PRK017      MJR

`PAD'   Allows you to send commands to an X.29 PAD, these commands
        being the SET/SET?/PAR? commands and their parameter/value
        pairs.

`PASSWD' Change your password.  PASSWD has two forms: a short one,
         which just changes the user's password, and a long form,
         invoked by PASSWD -LONG, which allows the user to set
         a second password for other users accessing his directory,
         and also to determine if they can have owner access to
         the directory.

`PROTECT'  Protects a file (removes permissions from it).

           "PROTECT DIALCOM.TXT" will remove all three (D, W, R)
           attributes from it.  This will result in:

           >DEL DIALCOM.TXT
           Insufficient access rights.  DIALCOM.TXT (DEL:10)

           But --

           >DELETE DIALCOM.TXT
           "DIALCOM.TXT" protected, ok to force delete? y

`SECLEV' Your security level.  Output:

         Seclev=5

`SIZE'  Size information about a file.  Output:

        1 Block, 404 Words

`STORAGE'  Shows storage information.

`SY'    Show users on system.  (Same restrictions as for ONLINE apply.)
        Will show user name, time on, idle time, devices used, current
        jobs and state, etc.  Output:

    41 Users on sys 666

 Names    use idle mem State command    object    devs

 HBT007   *11   0  155   R1   SY                   6 3  from Tymnet via X.25


`SYS'   Displays account information and system number.  Output:

        <S666-6>HBT007  on system 666.

`TERM'  Used to tell the Dialcom computer what terminal the user is
        using.  A list of supported terminals is generated by "TERM
        TERMINALS".  TERM options are:

        TYPE <terminal type>         (TYPE VT100)
        WIDTH <width>                (Terminal width, if different
                                      than default)
        TOP                          (Start listings at top of screen)
        PAUSE                        (Pause listings when screen is
                                      full)

        -ERASE, -KILL <char>         (Sets the erase or kill character)
        -BREAK <ON|OFF>              (Enables or disables BREAKs)
        -HALF or -FULL               (Half duplex of full duplex)
        -DISPLAY                     (Output current terminal information)

`WHO'   Displays account information.  Output:

        <S666-6>HBT007

        Which means user HBT007 on system 666 on device 6.

Communicating on Dialcom
------------------------

Users who want to communicate on Dialcom have two choices, basically.
These are the Dialcom bulletin board and electronic mail.  The Dialcom
bulletin board has two versions.  The first consists of several message
bases (called ``categories'') which are shared between some Dialcom
systems (and mostly used by bored employees, it seems); there are also
private bulletin boards, which are not shared between the systems.  They
belong to account groups, and only users in an account group can access
that group's bulletin board system.  These version of the Dialcom board
are often empty (they have no categories defined and hence are unusable).

This is accessed by the command POST (PRPOST for the private board).
Once POST is activated, it will display a prompt:

Send, Read or Purge:

If the answer is READ, POST will ask for a category (a list of categories
will be displayed if you type HELP at that prompt).  Once a category
has been joined, you will be able to read through the messages there:

Subject:  ?
From:  HBT007             Posted:  Sat  32-July-94  16:47    Sys 666

quit
/q
/quit

Continue to Next Item?

Answering SEND at the first prompt will allow you to send a message in a
category.

Answering PURGE will allow you to delete messages post by your account.
When you enter PURGE and the category to purge message from, the system
will show you any posts that you are allowed to purge, followed by a
"Disposition:" prompt.  Enter DELETE to delete the message.

The second way to communicate is the Dialcom MAIL system.  MAIL allows
sending and receiving messages, it allows for mailing lists, filing
mail into categories, holding mail to read later and so on.  MAIL is
invoked by entering, uh... oh, yes, MAIL.

It works along similar lines to those of POST, and will display the following
prompt:

Send, Read or Scan:

SEND:  Allows you to send a message.  It will prompt with "To:",
"Subject:" and "Text:" (where you enter the actual message, followed
by ".SEND" on a blank line to end).  After a message is sent, the
"To:" prompt will appear again -- use "QUIT" to leave it.

A word about the "To:" prompt.  There are two configuration files which
make its use easier.  First the MAIL.REF file, which is really a mailing
list file.  It contains entries in the format of --

        <Nick> <Accounts>
        DOODZ DVR014 ABC0013 XYZ053

-- and at the "To:" prompt, you can just enter "DOODZ" and the message
will be sent to all three accounts.  When you enter a name, MAIL searches
through your MAIL.REF, and then through the account administrator's, and
only then parses it as an account name.  Second is the mail directory,
which contains the names and account IDs of many users the account is
in contact with.  To display it, type "DIS DIR" at the first prompt.
You'll get something like this:

HERD-BEAST            6666:HBT007      WE'RE BAD AND WE'RE KRAD

Which means you can type "HERD-BEAST" at the prompt, and not just
HBT007.  Also, there are special options for the "To:" prompt, most
notable are: CC to send a carbon copy; EX to send the message with
``express priority''; DAR to request that if the message is sent
to a user on another Dialcom system, POSTMASTER will send you a
message verifying that your message has been sent; and NOSHOW,
to keep the receiver from seeing everybody else on the "To:" list.
For example (all these people are in the mail directory),

        To: DUNKIN D.DREW CC FOLEY NOSHOW EX

You enter the message about to be sent at the "Text:" prompt.  That
mode accepts several commands (like .SEND), all of which begin with a
dot.  Any command available at the "To:" prompt is available here.
For example, you can add or remove names from to "To:" field using
".TO <ids>" or ".TO -<ids>", and add a CC using ".CC <id>".
You also have a display command, ".DIS".  ".DIS" alone shows the text
entered so far; ".DIS TO" shows the "To:" field; ".DIS HE" shows
the entire header; etc.  Finally, you have editing option.  ".ED" will
load editing mode, so you can change the text you entered.  ".LOAD
<filename>" will load <filename> into the text of the message.  ".SP"
will check the spelling of text in the message, and there are other
commands.

READ:  Allows you to read mail in your mailbox.  Once you enter READ,
MAIL will display the header of the first message in your mailbox
(or "No mail at this time") followed by a "--More--" prompt.  To
read the message, press <CR>; otherwise, enter NO.  After you are done
reading a message, you will be prompted with the "Disposition:" prompt,
where you must determine what to do with the message.  There you can enter
several commands:  AGAIN to read the message again;  AG HE to read the
header again; AP REPLY to reply to the message and append the original
message to the reply; AP FO to forward the message to someone and add
your comments to it; REPLY to reply to the sender of the message; REPLY
ALL to reply to everybody on the "To:" field; FILE to file the message;
SA to save the message into a text file; NEXT to read the next message
in your mailbox; and D to delete the message.

SCAN:  Allows you see a summary of the messages in the mailbox.  Both
READ and SCAN have options that allow you to filter the messages you
want to read:  FR <ids> to get only messages from <ids>; TO <ids> to
get only messages sent to <ids>; 'string' to get only messages containing
``string'' in the "Subject:" field; "string" to get only messages
containing ``string'' in the message itself; FILE CATEGORY to get only
messages filed into ``CATEGORY''; and DA Month/Day/Year to get only messages
in that date (adding a '-' before or after the date will get you everything
before or after that date, and it's also possible to specify two dates
separated by a '-' to get everything between those dates.  For example,
to get all of Al Gore's messages about Clipper before August 13th:

        READ FILE CLIPPER FR GOR 'Great stuff' DA -8/13/94

There is also a QS (QuickScan) command that behaves the same as SCAN,
only SCAN shows the entire header, and QS just shows the "From:" field.

However, there is more to do here than just send, read or scan.
Some of it was mentioned when explaining these commands.  Both sent
and received messages can be saved into a plain text file or into
a special mailbox file, called MAIL.FILE.  Messages filed into the
MAIL.FILE can be grouped into categories in that file.

SAVING MESSAGES:  Messages are saved by entering "SA filename" at a
prompt.  For sent message, it's the "Text:" prompt, while entering the
message, and the command is ".SA", not "SA".  For received message, it's
either the "--More--" or the "Disposition:" prompt.

FILING MESSAGES:  Messages are filed in two cases.  First, the user
can file any message into any directory, and second, the system files
read messages that lay in the mailbox for over 30 days.  Received messages
are filed by entering "FILE" at the "Disposition:" prompt.  This files
the message into a miscellaneous category called BOX.  If an optional
<category-name> is added after "FILE", the message will be filed into
that category.  If <category-name> doesn't exist, MAIL can create it
for you.  After a message has been filed, it's not removed from the
mailbox -- that's up to the user to do.  Sent messages behaved the same
way, but the command is ".FILE" from the "Text:" prompt.

To display categories of filed mail, enter DIS FILES at a prompt.  To
read or scan messages in filed, just add "FILE <category-name> after
the command (READ, SCAN, etc).  To delete a category, enter D FILE
<category-name>.  To delete a single message in a category, just use
D as you would on any other message, after you read it from the
MAIL.FILE.

Connecting via Dialcom
---------------------

Dialcom allows its customers to access other systems through it.
There are some services offered specifically through Dialcom, such as
the BRS/MENUS service, which is an electronic library with databases
about many subjects, Telebase's Cyclopean Gateway Service, which offers
access to many online database services (like Newsnet, Dialog and even BRS)
and more.  These services have a direct connection to Dialcom and software
that maps Dialcom user ids to their own ids (it's not usually possible for
someone to access one of these services without first connecting to Dialcom).

Another method is general connection to X.25 addresses.  Since Dialcom
is connected to X.25, and it allows users to use the Prime NETLINK
commands, it's possible to PAD out of Dialcom!!#!

NETLINK is invoked by entering NETLINK.  NETLINK then displays its own,
'@' prompt.  The commands available there are QUIT, to quit back to
the OS; CONTINUE, to return to an open connection; CALL, to call an
address; and D, to disconnect an open connection.

CALL takes addresses in several formats.  A system name, to connect to
a Dialcom system, or an address in the format of DNIC:NUA.  For example,

@ CALL :666
Circuit #1
666 Connected
[...]

@ CALL 3110:21300023
Circuit #2
21300023 Connected
[...]

NETLINK establishes connections in the form of circuits.  A circuit can
be broken out of into command mode (the '@' prompt), using "<CR>@<CR>",
and another can be opened, or parameters can be changed, etc.
NETLINK has other commands, to log connections into a file, or set PAD
parameters (SET, PAR), or turn on connection debugging, or change
the default '@' prompt, and more.

Things to Do on Dialcom
----------------------

Much of what Dialcom offers was not covered until now and will not
be covered.  That's because most the services could use a file each,
and because many account groups have things enabled or disabled
just for them.  Instead, I will write shortly about two of the more
interesting things online, the news service and clipping service,
and add pointers to some interesting commands to try out.

The news service, accessed with the NEWS command, is a database of
newswires from AP, Business Wire, UPI, Reuters and PR Newswire.
The user enters the database, and can search for news by keywords.

After entering NEWS, you will see a menu of all the news agencies.
Once you choose an agency, you will enter its menu, which sometimes
contains a copyright warning and terms of usage and also the list
of news categories available from that agency (National, North America,
Business, Sports, etc).  Once you choose the category, you will be
asked for the keyword to search for.  If a story (or several stories) was
found containing your desired keyword, you can read through the
stories in the order of time, or the order they appear, or reverse
order and so on, and finally mail a story to yourself, or enter new
search keywords, or jump to another story, or simply quit.

The news clipping service, available with the command NEWSTAB, allows
the user to define keyword-based rules for selecting news clippings.
The system then checks every newswire that passes through it, and if
it matches the rules, mails the newswire to the user.

After entering NEWSTAB, you are presented with a menu that allows you
to show, add, delete, and alter your rules for choosing news.  The rules
are made using words or phrases, logical operators, wildcards and
minimal punctuation.  A rule can be as simple as "HACKING", which will
get every newswire with the word "hacking" in it mailed to you, or
if you want to be more selective, "NASA HACKING".  Logical operators
are either AND or OR.  For example, "HACKING AND INTERNET".  Wildcards
are either '*' or '?' (both function as the same).  They simple replace
any number of letters.  Punctuation is permitted for initials,
abbreviations, apostrophes or hyphens, but not for question marks and
similar.  All of this is explained in the NEWSTAB service itself.

For the file hungry, Dialcom offers several file transfer programs,
including KERMIT and Dialcom's FT, which implements most popular
protocols, like Zmodem, Xmodem, etc.

A small number of other fun things to try:

NET-TALK        The ``interactive computer conferencing system'' -- build
                your private IRC!

CRYPTO          Dialcom's encryption program.  Something they're probably
                going to love on sci.crypt.

NUSAGE          By far one of the better things to do on Dialcom, it was
                left out of this file because it is simply huge.  This
                program allows the user (typically an administrator) to
                monitor network usage, sort the data, store it, peek
                into all the little details (virtual connection types,
                remote/local addresses, actions, time, commands, etc).
                Unfortunately, it's completely beyond the scope of this
                file, as there are tons of switches and options to use
                in order to put this program to effective use.

7)   MILNET 
     ------

Introduction

First of all Milnet is a system used by the Air Force and the Pentagon for 
communication use. You know you are on milnet when you see that infamous TAC 
login xxx. Milnet is run out of the University of Southern California.

Logon Info

The Milnet number is 1-800-368-2217. (Sorry.. can't reach it from Canada.)
The ISI MASTER DIAL UP IS 213-306-1366. This is a more tricky logon 
procedure but if you got balls, you're using a trunk box, or you are 
just S-T-U-P-I-D here goes:

ISIE MASTER LOGON PROCEEDURE:

call 213-306-1366
when the phone stops ringing you are connected
enter location number (9 digits) + 1 or 0
hang up and it will call you
pick up the phone and hit the '*' on your phone
hit a carriage return on the computer
at the 'what class?' prompt hit RETURN!!!
then a 'go' prompt will appear and log on as you would the
800 number.

MILNET LOGIN PROCEDURE

If you have trouble connecting try 300 bauds instead of 1200. It's a bite 
in the ass but, sometime the connection will fuck up if you don't.

When you first connect you will see:

      'WELCOME TO DDN. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. TAC LOGIN
           CALL NIC 1-800-235-3155 FOR HELP
           WRPAT TAC 113 #:36

(you type)@o 1/103YOU ALWAYS TYPE @o then other connections are:

ISIA - 3/103
ISIB - 10:3/52
ISID - 10:0/27
ISIE - 1/103 (THE EXAMPLE)
ISIF - 2/103
VAX A - 10:2/27

Next you will see a 'USER-ID' prompt. The first 4 characters vary but it 
is always followed by a '-' and what ever connection you choose.

User-Id:   (example)  CER5-ISIE or MRW1-ISIE

The first three letters are the initials of the user followed by a random 
number (1-9).

Access Code: (example) 2285UNG6A or 22L8KK5CH

An access code will never contain a ( 1, 0, G, Z).

@ USERNAME + PASSWORD i.e. USERNAME SAC.305AREFW-LGTO

THE USERNAME EXPLANATION:

The first 3 letters will be SAC. This stands for Strategic Air Command. 
Following that is a '.' Then the squadron number and the prime mission. In 
this case '305AREFW', (305TH AIR REFULING WING). Then a '-' and the 
Individual Squadron name 'LGTO' (LOGISTICS GROUND TRANSPORATION OPERATIONS), 
a fancy name for the motor pool. I'll try and get a list of these there are 
tons of names. 

The password will not be echoed back and should be entered after a the 
username. The new user password as a default is: NEW-UZER-ACNT.

THINGS TO DO:

PROGRAMS AVALIABLE TO SAC USERS and what they are for copied directly from 
the help manual:

ADUTY   aids in management of additional duty assignments.
        (International help - use the ? and <ESC> keys, HELP.)

ARCHIVE requests files to be stored on tape for later retrieval.
        (Type HELP ARCHIVE <RET> at TOPS-20.)

CHAT    Provides near real time communication between terminal users on the
        same host computer. (Use ? with CHAT.)

DAILY   Executive appointment scheduling program

DCOPY   Handles output on DIABLO and XEROX printers

EMACS   Powerful full-screen text editor

8)   Medlars
     -------

     The National Library of Medicine discontinued access to its system via 
     the TELENET communications system on January 13, 1997.  The Sept./Nov. 
     1996 Canada MEDLARS Bulletin provided details on how to make the 
     appropriate changes to access MEDLARS.  For those who may have missed 
     the original message or for new users, we are reprinting the 
     instructions below.  If you are still experiencing problems in 
     connecting to MEDLARS, please contact the MEDLARS Desk at 1-800-668-1222 
     or email to cisti.medlars@nrc.ca. NTIS 1-800-423-9255.

     Access to MEDLARS through TYMNET

     DOS and MacIntosh Grateful Med users who live in cities with a direct 
     TYMNET connection should choose TYMNET as their first mode of access.  
     See the last page of this bulletin for a list of cities with TYMNET 
     nodes.  Users should choose Canada/TYMNET as their second mode of 
     access.  (See instructions below for setting up Canada/TYMNET service). 
     Intermittent problems with TYMNET phone numbers have been reported. 

     Access to MEDLARS through DATAPAC
        1. DOS Grateful Med Users:

     If your Grateful Med phone access is set to Canada/TELENET, change it to
     Canada/TYMNET. Leave the DATAPAC telephone number and speed as they are.  
     Press the END key to save these changes.

     DOS users will also have to edit the gmodpac.scr file.  To edit this file, 
     go to the Grateful Med subdirectory in DOS (C:\GM6>).  Type ted gmodpac.scr 
     and edit lines 20-22 (near the bottom of the screen) so that they like 
     this: 


SECTION OPEN CANADA/TYMNET
SETSTR SS "1 3106,nrcnlm;bcn"
SETSTR SP ""

Press F7 to save these changes.

     If you have been dialing to MEDLARS via DATAPAC and enter

        1311020280044 or

        1311030100020, you must now use the address:

        13106,nrcnlm;bcn  (Don't know what the gateway password is.)

     Direct-to-NLM searchers in Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
     Vancouver and  Winnipeg can now access MEDLARS at 14 400 baud via the 
     TYMNET communications system. For instructions, please contact the 
     MEDLARS Desk at 1-800-668-1222.

        NTIS
        Grateful Med Subscriptions
        5285 Port Royal Road
        Springfield, VA 22151-9907


     Under "Preferences" click on "Basic Setup".  Choose the "DATAPAC
     Canada" service option with the DATAPAC number for your city and 
     the appropriate modem speed. 

    Grateful Med for Windows supports MEDLINE searching and
    Loansome Doc ordering only.

    CISTI's New Billing System
    January's statements were produced from CISTI's new billing system.  
    There are two changes for MEDLARS clients: rates are converted to 
    Canadian dollars before charges are calculated, and MEDLARS activity 
    is shown as a daily roll-up against each database.  Please note that 
    because current billing information is not being transferred to the new 
    system, you will receive two statements until the old balance is paid in 
    full.


    MEDLARS Coordinator
    Once the new Coordinator is in place, CISTI intends to resume MEDLARS
    training in May 1997.  Information on MEDLARS training courses will be 
    announced in the next bulletin. Please continue to let us know of your 
    interests in training workshops so that we can plan future programs.
  

9)  TOXNET
    ------

    The separate dial-up procedures for accessing TOXNET were discontinued on
    October 31 1996.  All TOXNET searchers should now log on to TOXNET through 
    MEDLARS.  At the main menu, choose T (TOXNET). To read the TOXNET News 
    bulletin type news at any USER: prompt.
    
10) Develnet 
    --------
    The University has an on-campus network named DEVELNET which must be
entered to gain access to the Library catalogue. There is no charge, or
required password to enter the Network and access the catalogue.

Develnet Telephone Numbers

The most semi-up-to-date information on accessing Develnet
can be obtained from the UserNotes which are found in
the basement of the Math Sciences building.)
In addition to below 104 modems there are now an additional 32
28.8k modems available.  To date, UCS has not released the new rotary
number for these modems to the campus community; however, dialing
220-8799 MAY give you access to them.

Anyone with access to a terminal and a modem (which can connect
to AGT telephone lines) can dial in to connect to The Univerity of
Calgary Develnet Local Area Network.  This is a communications network
which allows access to several different computer systems on campus.
There are currently ten phone numbers to Develnet (this information is
from the Develnet help system):


The settings to use Develnet are:  full duplex, 8 bit word, no parity.


Phone number     # of lines      Speed           Protocols              
220-7376         16              2400            MNP1-5                 
220-8354         16              2400            MNP1-5                 
220-5160         8               300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-5161         8               300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-5162         6               300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-5163         6               300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-5164         10              300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-8709         4               300-14,400      MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-6056         15              14400           MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  
220-8799         15              14400           MNP1-5, V.42, V.42bis  

These rotaries are ``chained'' together, so that a user dialing into a
busy rotary will automatically fall through to the next available
rotary in the sequence. The following diagram indicates the exact
manner in which they are interconnected:

7376 (300-2400) --&gt; 8354 (300-2400) --&gt; 5160 --&gt; .... 
--&gt; 5164 (300-14,400)
                                          ^
                                          |
8799 (14,400) --&gt;   6056 (14,400) --&gt;   8709 (300-14,400)

In addition to these 104 modems there are now an additional 32 28.8k
modems available.  To date, UCS has not released the new rotary
numbers to the campus community; however, dialing 220-8799 MAY give
you access to them.
If you succeed in getting a phone connection, press the RETURN key
until you get the prompt:

                U of C Develnet
                Request:


The user then types the word "Library" at the prompt after the word Request.
Press the ENTER Key.

The system will reply with the word "Connected" followed by a Table or Menu
of 21 different terminal types. Type 0C (zero-C) if VT100  was selected
above, or 3 if VT32 was selected. Press the ENTER key.  (If neither of
these work, or are not included in your software, get the pamphlet called
"Remote Access To Online Catalogues " from the library for a complete list
of alternatives).

If the log-on is complete at this point, the screen will be blank.
If so, type the word "INFO" , press the ENTER key and if the word (WAIT)
appears in the upper right corner of your screen, you will next see the
opening menu which is the U of C Crest and from that point, follow the
menus.

The system is slow compared to using the terminals on campus so be patient.

Also...the key commands are not all identical, or "standard" compared to
BBS operations but the menu keys DO work as indicated.

If your screen is a scrambled mess of characters, you have an incompatible
Terminal Emulation selected; try another after the "enter the word Library
step".

The pamphlet suggests a repeated "Control-Break" command to log-off and if
this doesn't work, disengage with the Alt-H (AT-H) command which your modem
will comply with.

For those who aren't familiar with the catalogue system, the library runs
courses on a regular basis all year long. These are open to all. Also, there
is at least one pamphlet available near the Reference Desk on the Dobis
(catalogue) system.




Setting Up Your Terminal.

Terminal Set-up differs from the standard for Bulletin Boards. The
following settings should be entered prior to dialling:

        Full Duplex,  SEVEN Data Bits, No Parity, One Stop bit.
        Select a Terminal Emulation from those your software supports. This
        can be VT52, VT100 for example.



Logging In.
Once a Develnet connection is made either directly via a Develnet
terminal or indirectly via the phone lines and the prompt is
displayed, if you type help, additional information about Develnet is
available.  Otherwise, you will want to connect to a remote computer.
The names for CPSC machines are:


fsb
fsc (profs)
fsd (grads)
fse
fsf
fsg (vlsi)
fsh
fsj

After you select the machine, a prompt is given similar to the
following:

        SunOS UNIX (fsf)
        Login:
        


File Transfers.
People with microcomputers can download files between their local
computer (micro) and a remote computer (mainframe) using ``kermit''.
Kermit is a file transfer protocol that is used with many computer
systems to transfer information between computer systems.  It is
available on the SUN computer network under /usr/local/bin/kermit.
Various versions of kermit for microcomputers can be obtained from the
ACS Micro Computer Store.  Other file transfer programs such as xmodem
are not supported by the CPSC department.
Further documentation on kermit and Develnet can be obtained from
information racks at the Academic Computing Services (ACS) main office
(MS 768), in the Math Sciences basement, and in the MacKimmie Library


Editing.
Once you are logged in, you can list directories, cat files and edit,
compile and execute programs.  One of the most common problems occurs
when trying to run umacs (Microemacs) and receiving the error message,
``Unknown terminal type XXX!''  where XXX is your terminal type.  This
can be solved by making your terminal emulate another terminal type.
A list of common terminal types are:


ansi             Any ansi terminal                      
appleII          Apple II                               
mac              Apple Macintosh with MacTerminal       
ST               Atari st                               
vt100            DEC type terminal                      
vt102            DEC type terminal                      
vip7400          Honeywell                              
h1552            Hazeltine 1552                         
ibmpc            IBM PC compatible                      
trs100           Radio Shack Model 100                  
sun              Sun Microsystems Workstation           
ti700            Texas Instrument                       
h19              Zenith Heathkit h19                    


For example, to make your terminal emulate a vt100, type set
term=vt100.  For best results, consult the file /etc/termcap for a
complete list of all terminal types.

Noisy Connections.
When communicating verbally over the phone lines, parts of other
conversations or electronic ``background noise'' can sometimes be
heard.  When transferring computer data, this line noise may cause
extra characters to be sent to the remote machine or to your terminal.
Although this is a nuisance, it usually does not hinder communication.
With a relatively noise free line, extra characters will rarely be
seen and should not seriously affect a login session.  With a noisy
line, you may get connencted to the remote computer but it may be
impossible to login or interact effectively.  This problem is
typically reflected be a stream of spurious characters which appear on
your screen.  If this happens, you should break the connection, hang
up and try again.  The seriousness of this problem depends upon the
area of the city the phone call is made and upon the time of day.

Logging out.

When you are ready to logout of a remote machine, simply log out in
the usual manner.  You should then receive the Develnet prompt. If you
are on a Develnet terminal, you can leave.  If you are connected via
the phone lines, just hang up.


UCIC Dialin Service
The UCIC dialin service allows you to connect to your AIX account from
home or elsewhere using a computer, modem, and telephone line. UCS
provides three types of services: Express, Extended, and Fee-Based. A
fee-based service for faculty only is also available (see below).

COM-01 Telephone Access to U of C Computers

Develnet, a campus-wide data communications network, allows
participating users to communicate between terminals, microcomputers, and
computers on campus. Off-campus access to Develnet was discontinued in
June 1996.

Any University of Calgary student, faculty, or staff member with a
microcomputer and a modem (that can connect to a Telus telephone line) can
dialin to the University of Calgary and access the Internet.

To dialin however you first must have a vaild AIX account at
University Computing Services (UCS).

Undergraduate students can obtain an AIX account by
self-registering on URS (User Registration System) in ES 160 or
as part of a course. Faculty of Medicine
members can register at the Medicine Administration Office (HM G 385). 
All others must apply in person at the UCS Main Office (MS 768).

Next, you need to obtain software that will enable you to connect to
the computers at the U of C.  There are two types of software: PPP
(Point to Point Protocol) and TTY (teletypewriter). PPP software is
required for using a graphical browser like Netscape to connect to the
World Wide Web on the Internet. TTY software is used if your computer
cannot run the PPP software such as a non-Windows PC (e.g., XT or AT)
or older Macintosh (e.g., Plus or SE). Both types of software allow
you to connect to your AIX account for email.
                                  
The easiest way to connect to the U of C and your AIX account is to
use the software distributed and supported by University Computing
Services.

Telephone access to the U of C computers and Internet connections is
limited to U of C students, staff, and faculty. The computer and
network accounts are provided for individual use only and may not be
shared. If network accounts are used for simultaneous logins or you
permit someone else to use your account, the sessions may be
terminated and the accounts disabled.

To access the World Wide Web on the Internet, you first must have the
UCS dialin software called U of C Internet Connect (UCIC) PPP
software.  UCS has prepared dialin software for Windows 95, Windows
3.x, and Macintosh microcomputers. You can obtain this software by:
purchasing the Mac or Windows versions on 3.5" high-density floppy
disks for $5 per set from the UCS Main Office (MS 768).

downloading a copy free of charge via Netscape or FTP from the
UCIC home page at: 

href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/ucs/ucic/">http://www.ucalgary.ca/ucs/ucic/

The UCIC PPP software allows you to connect to three services:
Express, a free service which allows 10 minute connections,
Extended, a free service which allows 1 hour connections, and a
Fee-based service. The Fee-based service provides a 10:1 user
to modem ratio and 33,600 bps modems. The service costs $.50/hour and
operate as a debit service (users are required to make a minimum $20
deposit at the UCS Main Office). Also provided is Netscape (a web
browser), EWAN or NCSA Telnet (a TELNET program), WS-FTP or Fetch
(an FTP program), and PC-Pine or MailDrop (a mail client).


Another way to access U of C computers is to use the terminal (TTY)
service.  To use the TTY service you need a valid AIX
account and software that allows you to do terminal emulation.

UCS supports the terminal emulation program called Kermit. It
is available for both DOS (MS-Kermit) and Macintosh (MacKermit).

To obtain a copy, purchase it on disk for $5 from the UCS Main 
Office (MS 768) or download MS-Kermit or MacKermit from the UCIC 
Kermit web page at: http://www.ucalgary.ca/ucs/ucic/kermit.html
                    
When you have obtained Kermit, follow the instructions provided and
install on your computer.

To use Kermit and login to AIX:
Start Kermit.

At the Kermit prompt, type: atdt 2202990 
  (Express:  220-2990, Extended: 220-2880, Fee-Based:  289-7009)

When you get connected, press the Enter key.

Type in your AIX userid and password.

When you get the line,  Annex ts1 portX,  type: telnet hostname where hostname is acs1, fsb.cpsc.ucalgary.ca, etc.  

Except for the UCS computers acs1 to acs7, you need
to enter the entire hostname (e.g., fsf.cpsc.ucalgary.ca). 
You should then get a login prompt from your host computer. Login as usual.

During a normal telephone conversation, you can often hear parts of
another conversation (very faintly) or electronic "background noise."
While this is a nuisance, it usually does not hinder
communication. With the transfer of computer data, this type of
cross-talk or line noise may cause extra characters to be sent to your
terminal or to the host computer. If the line is relatively noise
free, you will rarely see extra characters. If there is a lot of noise
on the line, you may get connected to the host computer or service,
but it will be virtually impossible to login and carry on a regular
session. Typically, this problem is reflected by a steady stream of
spurious characters (such as {{${}}{${}{${}) which appear on
screen. Should this occur, simply break the connection, hang up, and
try the dialup line again. This problem is more serious for some areas
of the city (the quality of the local telephone exchanges vary) and
for different times of the day (telephones are busy in the evening,
but quiet after 11 pm). If the line noise problem persists, contact
your telephone service provider.

On AIX, type:

more /usr/local/info/develnet.info
help

Following is a list of some of the host computers that are attached to
Develnet.  Each computer on the network is associated with a unique
identifier, the host name, that you use when requesting any particular
computer system. Also listed are the terminal speed settings (baud
rates) and the parity (a means of detecting communications errors)
required to access each computer system, and a short description of
the system.

Messages that originate directly from Develnet are transmitted
with space parity. However, transmissions from host
computers have parity determined by the host as indicated in the
table above. To avoid potential parity mismatches, disable parity
checking on your terminal whenever possible.

Turn your terminal on. On the Honeywell VIP7400 terminal, the
most common terminal on campus, the on/off switch is at the rear
of the monitor on the right-hand side. Generally, terminals
should be left on at all times.

Most terminals on campus have the correct settings to work with
the communications network to which they are attached. If your
terminal is not receiving any characters, or the characters are
garbled, check the settings. Appropriate settings for Develnet
are:


compact
baud rate (speed)
300, 1200, 2400, 4800 or 9600 (9600 baud is preferable )
parity<br>  SPACE or NONE
word length<br>     7 BITS
parity checking (if applicable) OFF

Using a VIP7400 terminal, you can view and change these settings
by pressing and holding down the SHIFT key while pressing
the Set Up/No Scroll key. A status line at the bottom of
the screen will appear. You can change the settings in a field
using the up and down arrows to scroll through the available
settings. To change fields, use the right and left arrows. Press
SHIFT-Set Up/No Scroll again to view a second screen of
settings. Press SHIFT-Set Up/No Scroll a third time to
exit the settings mode.

When the screen lights up, obtain the Develnet prompt by pressing
RETURN. The Develnet prompt should appear:

U of C Develnet
Request:

Type: help

in response to the prompt. A help file will be displayed that
lists computer host names and their descriptions.

You can read the same information on AIX by typing:

more /usr/local/info/develnet.info

Respond to the Develnet prompt by typing the host name of the desired
computer system. For example, type:

acs1

to connect to the AIX server acs1.

Normally, when you logout from a Develnet service, your Develnet
connection is broken automatically and you get the Request: prompt.
If you are using a dialup line, it will hang up.

In some situations, such as during infinite program loops, or if
you are accessing the library DOBIS/NOMADS online catalogues, you
may not be able to logout in a straightforward manner. You can
break your Develnet connection by pressing the Break key 7
or more times in succession.

The Develnet dialup service was discontinued in June 1996. This service 
was replaced by the U of C Internet Connect (UCIC) service. Information 
on this service can be found at http://www.ucalgary.ca/~ucic Home Page 
and in the User Note http://www.ucalgary.ca/doc/UN/COM/COM-01.html

How do I log in to AIX from an MS-DOS microcomputer at home?

This User Note explains how to connect to AIX from your
MS-DOS computer over a telephone line using the Kermit program. 

You can get a current version of Kermit for MS-DOS microcomputers from
the following sources:

On disk from the UCS Main Office (MS 768); it costs $5.00.

The UCS FTP server ftp.acs.ucalgary.ca from the path
ftp://acs.ucalgary.ca/pub/micros/ms-dos/comm/kerm314a.exe

The UCS Gopher server gopher.ucalgary.ca from the University Computing 
Services / UCS Software Distribution menu

Download with a previous version of Kermit from the path
/ftp/home/pub/micros/ms-dos/comm/kermxxxx.exe

All files obtained from the above sources are self-extracting binary
archive files where "xxxx" represents the version number (e.g., 314
for the first release of MS-Kermit 3.14, 314a for the second release,
etc.).  

This section describes installation of MS-Kermit version 3.14. All
references to the basic install file in the following instructions are
written as KERM314A.EXE. If you are installing a newer
version of MS-Kermit please substitute the proper file name for that
version wherever you see KERM314A.EXE or KERM314A in
the rest of this section.

If this is a first time install, create a C:\KERMIT directory
to hold the MS-Kermit material by going to the DOS C:&GT;
prompt and typing:

If upgrading MS-Kermit from a previous version, first move any
MS-Kermit files you want to keep (e.g., a personalized
MSCUSTOM.INI) from your existing C:\KERMIT directory
to a safe place.  Then erase the contents of C:\ MS-Kermit by
typing:

If you have the MS-Kermit distribution floppy, replicate
KERM314A.EXE in your C:\KERMIT directory by
inserting the distribution floppy into your A: drive
and typing:

If you have downloaded KERM314A.EXE from AIX, use the DOS
copy command to replicate KERM314A.EXE in the
C:\KERMIT directory similarly to the preceeding example.

Extract MS-Kermit and associated files/directories from the
KERM314A.EXE file by typing:

Invoke a text editor (e.g., MS-DOS edit, IBM DOS e,
or MS-Windows notepad) to add the C:\KERMIT
directory to the DOS path statement in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Assuming DOS edit is your editor,
type:

and either add the line path=c:\kermit if you don't see any
lines that start with path=, or append ;c:\kermit to
the end of an existing path= line. Then save your changes and
quit.

Check the README.UCS file for additional installation
instructions not covered in this User Note by browsing it with your
text editor. Assuming MS-DOS edit is being used, type:

After following any supplemental install instructions found in
README.UCS, erase KERM314A.EXE by typing:

Complete the MS-Kermit installation by rebooting your PC
(simultaneously press the &LT;Ctrl&GT;, &LT;Alt&GT; & &LT;Del&GT; keys).

You can enter MS-DOS commands and Kermit
requests using either upper-case or lower-case characters. Lower-case
letters are transformed to upper-case characters for MS-DOS filenames.

When the program is loaded, an opening screen similar to the following
will appear as a guide to what to type next in order to connect to the
U of C.

To connect to a U of C host computer FIRST retype the left half (up to the ;)
of any of the following lines that don't reflect your modem environment.

port   com2    ;Serial port=com1, com2, com3, com4
speed  2400    ;Modem speed=2400, 9600, 19200, 38400, 58600, 115200
modem  hayes   ;Modem type (do "more C:\KERMIT\MODEMS\READ.ME" for help)=
       2400mnp  ati96etc bestdata boca   conn144p dataport dnet9600 dyna1414 
       fastalk2 hayes    intel14  mt1432 penril   ppi      qblazer  qx4232
       rolm     sport    supra    t3000  telepcmc ultra144 viva     zoom
       zyxel
tserv extended ;Terminal server=extended, express, fee, dnet
ttype aixvt100 ;Terminal type=aixvt100, libvt100

THEN type "ucslogin", "ucslogin DialPrefix" or "ucslogin help"
WHERE DialPrefix = T=tone, P=rotary, T9=campus, T*70=turn off call waiting

Kermit then enters a request loop where you type in requests
for the program to execute. After each request is completed, MS-DOS
Kermit will prompt you with:

and waits for another request.

You will need to know the following characteristics of the
communications line between your microcomputer and the remote computer
to which you are connecting:

COM port which serial port on your computer your modem
is connected to.

speed A measure of the rate at which information is
transferred between your PC and modem. Common speeds are 2400, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

modem type The brand name and model of your modem.

terminal server Which dialin server you want (express,
extended, fee-based, or Develnet).

terminal type Which type of terminal you want to
emulate (aixvt100 for UCS servers or libvt100 for
the library DOBIS system).

As MS-Kermit starts up, it prints a message listing its default
settings for these items. If you require different settings, change
them as follows:
 
set the port (e.g. COM1) by typing:
        MS-Kermit&GT;port COM1

set the speed (e.g. 19200) by typing:
        MS-Kermit&GT;speed 19200

(Note: Do not set 14.4 modems to a speed of 14,400 or 28.8
modems to 28,800. Both of these modem types employ data compression to
boost effective speed and COM port speed and must be set higher than
14.4 or 28.8 in order to keep the modem compression/decompression
engine busy.)

set the modem type (e.g. a USRobotics Sportster) by
typing: 
MS-Kermit&GT;modem sport

(if you do not know the make and model of your modem, type:
modem hayes)

set the terminal server (e.g. Express) by typing:
        MS-Kermit&GT;tserv express


Once the communication modes have been set, connect to a remote
computer with the Kermit ucslogin request and indicate
the DialPrefix if necessary.

ucslogin
or
ucslogin DialPrefix

where DialPrefix indicates your type of telephone line
and any special dialing instructions:
T = touch tone
P = pulse dial
T9 = campus touch tone
T*70 = turn off AGT call-waiting feature before dialing number.

You do not need to enter a dialup
telephone number; ucslogin knows what the U of C phone numbers are.

If the connection is successful, the following Annex prompts will
appear asking you for your userid, password, and which AIX server
you want to log in to.

When you have finished your work on the AIX server, type:

logout

to log out from AIX and wait until you see a

Disconnected


message. Then press:


Alt-x

to end the Kermit session and return to the MS-DOS prompt.

Enter all MS-Kermit requests in response to the same prompt.
However, the requests may be divided into two categories:
communications and status.

These requests conduct basic file transfers:

CONNECT     switches between the local computer (your micro) and
                the remote computer (a mainframe)
RECEIVE     retrieves files from the remote Kermit
SEND        sends files to the remote Kermit
EXIT        exits from Kermit-MS. Synonymous with QUIT
QUIT        quits Kermit-MS. Synonymous with EXIT.

Further communications requests concern the use of a file server at
the remote system:

SERVER      sets the server mode of remote operation
GET         retrieves files from the server
SEND        sends files to the remote server
FINISH      shuts down remote server
LOGOUT      logs out from the remote server
BYE         quits and logs out the remote server. Combines FINISH and LOGOUT requests.

These requests let you display and modify the parameters of MS-Kermit
and monitor the progress of file transfers:

HELP        prints a list of Kermit commands

COMMAND-?-ENTER Get more info on the next item needed to
complete the given command. Once the item has been typed in, press the
Space bar-?-Enter keys again to advance along the
line. Keep doing this until the line is completed and then press just
Enter instead of Space bar-?-Enter.

SET         sets local Kermit parameters
STATUS      shows the values of parameters which may be SET
SPACE       performs MS-DOS CHKDSK function
DIRECTORY   lists MS-DOS files
DELETE      deletes an MS-DOS file
LOG         records the terminal session to an MS-DOS disk file
CLOSE       closes the log file and stops logging remote session
DEFINE      defines macros of Kermit-MS requests
SHOW        shows macro definitions and key redefinitions
CLEAR       clears the key definitions
DO          executes a macro
REMOTE      prefixes remote file management commands
PUSH        escapes to MS-DOS command level
RUN         runs an MS-DOS program
TAKE        gets Kermit requests from an MS-DOS file
HANGUP      drops the DTR line, hangs up the phone

11) Arpanet
    -------
     INTRODUCTION
     ------------

ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork) was funded by the 
Department
of Defense (DOD) in 1969 as an experiment in sharing the resources of many
different types of computers.  Earlier DOD systems (AUTODIN,for example), 
relied
on linking computers that were the same make, using the same operating systems.
Work on ARPANET was performed under contract by many organizations, including
educational institutions, and today it is universities who are the primary
network users.

     Once logged onto ARPANET a user may conference with, or use the program
resources and available data files of any other computer that is on the system.
Hundreds of computers are available over ARPANET including computers at non-
university research centers like Rand Corporation, SRI and other military-
industrial think tanks.

     Until late 1983 and early 1984, military computers were also a major
ARPANET resource.  With the threat from young computer "hackers", however, the
military computers have moved to their own ARPANET-like network called MILNET.
The two networks are now part of what is known as the "DDN" or Defense Data
Network.  ARPANET nodes may be used to dial-up MILNET nodes as long as the
caller can enter the proper authorization code and password once connected to
the MILNET node.  MILNET users can, likewise, use ARPANET resources.

     ARPANET is also used as a resource for students as well as computer
scientists and engineering specialists.  Because of the variety of users, the
system tends to be very talkative about itself and vary helpful.  Periodically,
however, certain ARPANET nodes decrease the amount of help that they provide
online.

     Despite the fact that dozens of different types of computers are 
interfaced
in ARPANET, it is a simple system to use because all nodes (called TIP's), use
fundamentally the same operating systems on either DEC (Digital Equipment
Corporation) models 20 or 10 mainframes.  The operating system is called the
"EXEC" and is called the TOPS-20 Monitor (on the DEC 20).

     Access numbers for local ARPANET nodes can be found from users of certain
bulletin boards, by calling the system manager, or by asking someone who 
attends a major university.

GETTING ON
----------

     Once connected to the system, hit <CR> once for 300 baud or twice if you
are using 1200 baud.  The EXEC then recognizes you and displays a welcome
message as below:

WELCOME TO ARPANET
**FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY**
Call the NIC at 1-800-235-3155 for TAC user problems.
Type @n for news.
SU TAC 110 #:13

     At this point there are only two commands that the Exec will recognize:
@N for news, and @O for onto the host sysem.  Start by checking out the news.
The node you have reached may be willing to be very helpful and informative.

of available sets and documents.  Documents are marked in the menu with a '*'
in the first column.  To view a doument, or browse through a set, type its menu
number followed by carriage return, <CR>.  If you choose a set, you will then 
be
shown a summary of the most recent issues, and by typing its menu nuiber mayrea` the item.  Type 'TOP<CR>' at any time to get back to the first menu.

GETTING HELP
------------

<Each function is treated as an unique job.  The HELP command is part of the
QUERY prOgram.  A log report is Made when the user QUITs.  The user must thEn
begin all over again with the @N prompt, read the herald again, and then proceed
to other options when the system responds with its own @ prompt.  We skip these
redundancies in this example.>

@HELP  <user enters HELP>
To see a list of your options for commands or arguments, try typing question
mark.  Typing "?" to the "@" prompt gives you a list of the commands the Exec
understands.  Typing "?" after one of these commands tells you what you can type
next.  For example,
        @HELP ?
will show you a list of some of the more important topicc for which Help is
available.  The question mark invokes a help message without affecting what
you've typed so far; you can go on typing the command just as if you hadn't
typed "?".  Also, the question mark is read immediately; you don't have to type
RETURN.

If you make a mistake while typing a command, use BACKSPACE to delete the last
character you typed.  Ctrl/W will repeat your last Word, and Ctrl/U will delete
your entire command line, allowing you to start again.  If you feel hopelessly
lost, typing Ctrl/C twice will return you to the Exec "@".

     @HELP ? RETURN for general help
        or * to see all topics
        or the name of an EXEC command
        or one of the following:

<above is a list of the help files available at this particular session.  At
other times either more or fewer files are available.


LEARNING WHO's WHO
------------------

     As mentioned earlier, ARPANET can be made to disclose a great deal of
information before you have logged on or even hacked a password.  Among the most
useful commands are those that tell you who else is on the system and what the
status of the system is.  These files give you information that will help your
future hacking activities.  In this section we discuss commands that disclose
data about users that are available from the EXEC level.

@HELP WHOIS  <user entry>

NICNAME (alias WHOIS) is a utility for cross-net access of the NIC user
registration database.  NICNAME has been chosen as the global name for the
program, although many sipes will choose to use the more familiar WHOIS name for
the program.

For the convenience of sites without user programs to interact with the NICNAME
server, WHOIS may be run on the SRI-NIC machine via Telnet service without
logging in.  The documentation below is slightly inaccurate in this case,
since there is no need to reach further through the net to access the database,
as the user program and the database are both on SRI-NIC.

The initial procedure is a one-reach, one-response query, which allows users at
any Internet site to obtain information about an organization or individual by
providing either a name or an IDENT.  The protocol used is a TCP protocol.  A
server program running at SRI-NIC takes the user's request, accesses the NIC
database and sends back the reply.

The reply can be in one Of threE fOrMs:
     1)  Record for individual or organization found, information (including
         name, ident, organization, mailing address and network address) is
         returned to user.
     2)  Given name matches more than one record.  A short entry is returned for
         each matching record and the ueer is told to re-query the system using
         the ident to match any one iddividual or organization shown.
     3)  No record matched.  If an ident was given, this response means that the
         ident is free for use by an individual or organization, and can be
         obtained for such by contacting NIC.

     Examples of use follow.  For clarity, the user's typeing appears in
uppercase:

I.  Request for help information.

@WHOIS
Ident: ?
; Accessing NICNAME server at SRI-NIC...
    Please enter a name or a handle ("ident"), such as "Smith" or "SRI-NIC".

point forces handle-only.  Examples:
      Smith           [looks for name or handle SMITH]
      !SRI-NIC        [looks for handle SRI-NIC only]
      .Smith, John    [looks for name JOHN SMITH only]
    Adding "..." to the argument will match anything from that point, e.g.
"ZU..." will match ZUL, ZUM, etc.
    To search for all the authorized users of a host, use:
      %HOST
    To search for mailboxes, use one of these forms:
      Smith@          [looks for mailboxes with username SMITH]
      @Host           [looks for mailboxes on HOST]
      Smith@Host      [Looks for mailboxes with username SMITH on HOST]
    To have the ENTIRE membership list of a group or organization, if you are
asking about a group or org, shown with the record, use an asterisk character
"*" directly preceding the given argument.  [CAUTION: If there are a lot of
members this will take a long time!]
    You may of course use exclamation point and asterisk, or a period and
asterisk together.

II.  Search by name only.

@HELP SYSTAT
The SYSTAT command lists information about jobs logged into the system in order
of job number, along with the date and time, how long the system has been up,
the number of jobs logged in, and load average information.

If the user is logged in from another host, the name of that host is given under
the Foreign host heading.

For example:
@systat
 Tue 14-Jun-97 15:29:38  Up 45:40:40
 20+13 Jobs   Load av   1.70   1.33   1.43

     ARPANET can't be faulted for the amount of information it is willing to
disclose to anyone who knows the number of a dial-up and knows enough to type in
"@N" and then follow directions.  But the EXEC is, after all, limited to
managing inter-computer phone calls. Even more interesting material is
available once you get onto what is known as one of the network's "server"
computers.

OPENING THE DOOR
----------------

     Once you have reached the Exec on a TIP, getting the door to a server
machine to open to you is no problem. At the "@" prompt type "O" for open
followed by a space and then by two numbers separated by a comma.  The
numbers represent the address of a computer system.  The first number may
be from 0 to 3, and the second number may range from 0 to 15:

     @O 0,11
     <the Exec responds:>
     TCP Trying...SU-AI WAITS 9.17/H
Assembled 06/17/84
     .Open

The ".Open" shows that you're in.  There is a great deal you can do at this
level, and you don't evel have a password yet -- as far as the system
knows, you're still "anonymous guest"! Most server systems operate under the
UNIX operating system, so any good manual on UNIX should tell you more than
you need to know.  But now that we've reached Stanford University's Artificial
Intelligence Lab (having been switched there by SRI, formerly Stanford Research
Institute), let's take a look at what's available.  First, list the HELP files:

MORE HELP
---------

     If you'd like, try "HELP HELPER" for yourself.  Meanwhile more detailed
listings of some help files follow. .....
 .HELP GUEST
There is no general guest account on this system.  There are some commands
that can be given without an account, as listed below.  If you need to know 
more about any of these, type "HELP <topic><carriage return>".  For
information on special control characters and commands, type "HELP
TTY". WHO, FINGER, WHERE, WHEN provide information about people and jobs
currently running. MAIL, SEND, GRIPE permit you to send messages and 
converse with people on the system.  (You can use SEND to ask someone 
who is logged in to fobm a two-way link with you.) DIR lists the files 
in specified directories. TYPE lets you type out the contents of text files.
FIND searches text files and prints those paragraphs that contain specified
keywords. If you need to do more than the above programs permit, say "HELP 
LOGIN".

 .HELP NETDOC
Job 5    SU-AI WAITS 9.17/H  Assembled
(Much network information is available from the Network Information Center at
SRI-NIC.  Please consult the network liaison, for more information about the 
network or the resources available to you at the NIC.)

A large library of source and documentation files about the network,
NOT including the hosp table, live on the [S,NET] directory.  Even more
hardcopy documentation is available in the bookshelf in ME's office for the
general SAIL community (please ask ME before borrowing anything).  The host
table files can be found on [HST,NET]. The NETWRK library of network
subroutines can be found in NETWRK.FAI[S,NET] and NETWRK.MID[S,NET].
     Some interesting files are:
HOSTS.TXT[HST,NET]      The source of the host table
SUAI.TXT[S,NET]         Our write-up in the Arpanet Resource Handbook.
     Most of the network user-level documentation is contained in the
Monitor Command Manual, which can be found online by giving the mOnitor
command READ MONCOM<cr>.  Large online directories of network documetation
exist at SRI-NIC as <NETINFO> and MIT-DMS as NETDOC;.
     Type HELP NETWRK for information on programming for the network.
 ...HELP HOST
Job 5    SU-AI WAITS 9.17/H  Assembled
The HOST command is used to look up information in the host table about a
particular host name or host number. This information includes the official
name of the host if the name is a nickname, all host numbers known for
that host, whether the host is a user or a server, the host machine and the 
host operating system. To use HOST, type HOST followed the host name (or any 
abbreviation) you want to look for, or the host number, and return.  The 
program will print all hosts (and nicknames) which match the input 
specification.  A null specification will type out the entire host table, 
but only if you are logged in.  For example:
        .HOST MIT-MC (describe MIT-MC)
        .HOST CMU (describe all CMU sites)
        .HOST 36.40.0.194 (describe Internet host 36.40.0.194)
        .HOST 50#302 (describe SU Ethernet host 50#302)
        .HOST                   (print out the host table)
Note that even non-unique abbreviations are accepted.  For example "SU" will
print out ALL of the Stanford University hosts.  This is different from 
TELNET, etc., which only accept abbreviations which are unique to a single 
host.

PEEKING AND SPYING
------------------

    This article discusses the commands that "anonymous guest" can use do learn
that other people are doing on the system.
 .HELP PK
The PK program can be used to PeeK at the input and output buffers of any
terminal, and the line editor buffer of a display.  To run PK, give the monitor
command "R PK".  PK will ask for a terminal line number, and will display that
terminal's buffers plus the who line of the job, if any, using that terminal.
PK can also display the contents of some of the internal system variables
associated with the terminal (see + and - commands below3 the default is not 
to display this system data).

If the selected terminal is hidden (by ESC H), PK will so notify you.  You may
choose to override the hiding, but if so, the selected terminal is notified 
that you are spying on it.

If you are using a SAIL display, the selected terminal's buffers will be
displayed on your screen about once per second, like a WHO display.
If you are using a non-display, the PK information will be typed once.
While PK is running on a display, you can give it any of the commands in the
table below to have it display different information (in the table, <cr> means
carriage return).  Whenever PK exits on a DD or III, the last buffer display
will remain on your screen until you reset your display by BREAK P or by 
running another program.

<line number><cr>  Display buffers of the given terminal line.
+<line number><cr> Display given terminal line and enable data display.
-<line number><cr> Display given terminal line and disable data display.
<linefeed>   Display buffers of the next higher numbered terminal.
<altmode>   Display buffers of the next lower numbered terminal.
^B^C<digit>   Update the display NOW and every <digit> seconds (1:9).
^B^C0   Update the display NOW, then only once for each command.
+<cr>   Enable display of system internal data at top of screen.
-<cr>   Disable display of system internal data at top of screen.
<cr>   Stop the displaying and exit to the monitor.
<monitor cmd>   Exit and execute the given monitor command.

 .HELP PPK
PPK allows you to peek at the screen of someone at a display terminal (a
DataDisc, III or Datamedia).  Say "R PPK", and give it the line number of the
terminal you want to observe.  (For DataDiscs, this is NOT the number reported
by FINGEB; it's the number following the PPN in dhe person's wholine, and can 
be found with the WHERE command.)

If you are on a display yourself and have your wholine terned on, PPK changes
your wholine to be that of the job at which you're peeking.  (Your original
wholine selection is restored when you exit.)

Once you have selected a lial "observe page printer" mode. (Do NOT follow the
E or N with a carriage return, or PPK will exit!)  Typing another line number
followed by a carriage return gets you another victim.  A raw carriage return
causes the program to exit.

If the selected terminal is hidden (by ESC H), PPK will so notify you. You may
choose to override the hiding, but if so, the selected terminal is notified
that you are spying on it.

The display is updated about once every two seconds.  You can force an
immediate update by typing ALTMODE.  You can also set the rate by typing
control-meta-digit, where 1 9 = 1-9 secs and 0 causes the display never to be
updated (except when you type ALTMODE).

 .HELP POLL

POLL accepts an audio channel number and lists the terminals which are
listed to it, and the PPN, if someone is logged in at that terminal.  An
argument of * will list all nonzero audio channels.
r poll
CHANNEL=10
TV-46: TTY53 JOB 41 [1,BH]
TV-47: TTY64
TV-51: TTY52 JOB 46 [1,CR]
TV-63: TTY33 JOB 7 [SF,SF]

 .HELP TALK
The command to communicate with another user is called TALK.  It makes
everything that either one of you types appear on both terminals.  (Note: If
you want to know about the TALK program on the Altos, READ DMCHAT, which
describes both Alto DMCHAT and Alto TALK. The writeup below is for the TALK
command on SAIL, which is completely different from Alto TALK.)  The argument
to TALK is either the programmer name of the person you want to talk to, the
device name of the terminal you want to talk to, or an ARPAnet address.  For
example:
 TALK MRC
 TALK TTY34
 TALK RMS@AI  (% is legal as a host name delimiter also),
The command may fail for any of the following reasons:
user not logged in (use MAIL)
user logged in more than once (use a terminal instead of a user spec)
user gagged or (for ARPAnet TALK) refusing links (use MAIL)
the ARPAnet site is unreachable or does not support network linking
When you are in a (local) talk ring, what you type goes only to the terminals
in the ring, not to the monitor or a user program.  To leave the talk ring,
type [CALL] (control-C from non-displays).
TALKing to local users does not run a program; hence the core image is
preserved.
TALKing to network users runs a program.  To leave network talk, type
<CONTROL><META>[LF] (control-Z from monitor. It is considered antisocial to
use the TALK command to establish communication with strangers. A better way is
the SEND command, which will send a message to a user but does not interfere
with his work.  For this reason, the TALK command requires that you be logged
in.  If you don't have an account, you can use SEND to request the user TALK
to you.  Type "HELP SEND" for more info.

 .HELP WHEN     Typing WHEN prints out your most recent logout time, and the 
directory which did the logging out.  The fact that you are currently logged 
in does not affect this information. As with FINGER, system crashes are not 
considered to be "loggig out".  Also, if your directory was deleted when you 
logged out, it will not be included by WHEN.  The WHEN command also takes 
optional arguments.  If only a single argument is given, it may be typed as:
 WHEN FOO
If more than one argument is used, separate them by semicolons, not commas.  
The various argument forms are:
 . Report only on current directory.
 * Give latest logouts for all of your directories.
       PRG Give latest logout from among PRG's directories.
      *,PRG Give logouts for all of PRG's directories.
      PRJ,* Give logouts for all directories with project PRJ.
     PRJ,PRG Give latest logout for the single directory [PRJ,PRG].
       *,* Give logout for every"%I
Q=Ie(not recommended).
Note that brackets are not included in any of the options.  If you are aliased,
the . and * options will use the aliased ppn.  For example:
 WHEN DON;*;S,SYS;ME
would tell you when DON last logged out (and from which of his directories),
list all directories for you (or for whomever you're aliased to) with logout
times, give the latest logout for [S,SYS], and finally tell you when ME last
logged out.
If one or more of the directories being listed happens to be logged in at the
moment, a note will be  printed to that effect.  If you have asked for the
latest from among all of someone's directories (including your own, which is
the default), then you gill be told if that useb is logged in on ANY of his
directories.  (In the other cases, such as "*,PRG" or "PRJ,PRG" or "." options,
you are told  only if the specific directory is logged in.)
Note that, even if you are not interested in the logout information, you can
use WHEN *,FOO to get a list of all of FOO's directories.      The other
command for doing this is DIR [*,FOO]/Q/F.   It turns out that WHEN is
significantly faster and uses fewer disk ops.  WHEN is also much faster than
FINGER for finding out logout times or for finding out whether a specific person
is currently logged in (though WHERE)

     This last part of the Hacking ARPANET series provides some more 
information on the types of things that you can learn from the EXEC, and 
concludes by explaining how to log onto the system and how passwords are 
structured.

     Once you are onto the EXEC, as explained in Part I, you should get into
the QUERY function which is also explained earlier.  QUERY will tell you just
about all you need to know about anyone, including their business phone numbers
and the locations of certain military employees.

VI. Billing
~~~~~~~~~~
There are two main components to the billing of Datapac services;

   1.   ACCESS RATES
   2.   USAGE RATES

 Both are billed to a customer's account on a monthly basis.

  ACCESS charges are billed either;
    o   by the MONTH, for dedicated access lines, or;
    o   by the MINUTE, for Public Dial or International calls

  USAGE charges are billed for the volume of data a customer sends;
    o   measured in segments
        - one packet equals one segment (segment is a billing term)
        - one packet contains from 1 to 256 characters (bytes)

ACCESS RATES   (per month)

Summary Usage Statement                             
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This monthly statement is free of charge.  It is a summary of all calls that
have been billed to the addresses or NUIs that are part of an account for that
billing period

Note:
Because this is a summary, it is not possible to accurately reconcile the
details of any totals on this statement. This is due to the standard accounting
practises of rounding rules, minimum charging and taxing procedures that have
been applied.  If your organization needs this capability, it must be done from
a Detailed Usage Statement.  There are other options that can be considered to
meet these needs such as; reverse charging, NUI, separate accounts or division
codes (where available).  Please discuss this with the Sales Representative of
your local telephone company.

In addition to the customers account number, dates of the billing period
involved, tax totals and grand total, the following information is supplied;

- Billed Address (or NUI and city)
- Other Address (or City Code if Public Dial call)
   - # of calls
   - # of resets
   - billable units (kilosegments)
   - indication of surcharges (if applicable)
   - duration of calls
   - hold charges (if applicable)
   - usage charges
- A sub total of all above information for each billed
  address.
- Service type of each address
  
This information is sorted in descending numerical/ alphabetical order.
  
This same information is given for the U.S. and Overseas Summary Usage
Statements and is grouped by Packet Switching Network name.

Note:
A new format for the Datapac Summary Usage Statement have been introduced in
1991.  Improved methods of grouping, sorting and reporting usage have been
introduced as well as some additional details;

 - Title page to display previous 12 months billing history
 - Page break by service type
 - sub-totals by service type
 - final page with sub-totals of domestic, overseas and
   International usage with taxes and a grand total.

The information you need from a summary statement will be easier to find and
handle.

Detailed Usage Statement                        
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is chargeable option.  It is a monthly statement that details each and
every call that has been billed to the addresses or NUIs that are part of an
account for that billing period.

In addition to the customers account number, the dates of the billing period
involved, tax totals and the grand total, the following information is supplied
for each call;

- Billed Address or NUI and city
   - service type
   - logical channel (virtual circuit #)
   - throughput class
- Other Address and city (only City if Public Dial call)
   - service type
   - logical channel (virtual circuit #)
   - throughput class
   - Date
   - local start time
   - local stop time
- Number of resets (if any)
- Clear Cause Code
- Billable Units (segments)
   - received
   - transmitted
- Call Set-up Class
- Hold charges (if applicable)
- Usage charges
- Taxing province

This same information is given for the U.S. and overseas calls and grouped by
Packet Switching Network name.

The calls on this statement are grouped by billed address and other address
then sorted in descending numerical order.  The calls between the Billed and
Other Address are sorted in descending chronological order.

Each call record on this statement can represent either a portion of or a
complete call.  Under normal circumstances, an accounting record for a call is
generated when a call is cleared, or every 12 hours.  If required, accounting
records can be generated on a call still in session (for variety of network
maintenance reasons).  Therefore, a complete accounting record for a particular
call may appear on more than one line.  Such instances are identified by the
Class and Clear Codes.  If call total is required, it must be calculated
manually.

           abnormally cleared calls.
  
  NP       Priority no call set-up.  A call set-up charge
           does not apply. These codes are used when the

CLEAR CODES (CLR CDE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

On the Detailed Usage Statement, a code is used to describe the reason a
particular call cleared.
  
At the present time a 3 number code is being used.  This will be replaced 
by a 2 character alpha-numeric code in mid-1991.
  
A call set-up charge applies to those clear codes denoted by an applies. 
These codes are used when a call was cleared in a normal, customer controlled 
fashion.

Note:
Clear code 176 (B0) can also indicate a record was generated by the network
for accounting purposes.  This is most often associated with PVCs or long calls
with a greater than 12 hour duration.  The class for this type of record would
be N or NP.
