   A large portion of this was taken from an acronym list created by 
Mercenary and the IIRG. I re-edited and added to their Ninth version, 
origionally created on 12/03/1993. Although it may have been good for 
a few local bbses, I found when calling to other places in North America, 
that it was not worthwhile for many acronym questionnaires, and didn't
offer as mcuh as it could for a reference guide. It was practically 
worthless if you wanted to reference acronyms found at your local CO,
for instance, so I changed it.

The IIRG had included mostly well known groups, and a wide variety of 
technical acronyms, but it lacked in a few areas. I've added TRW terminology, 
previous acronyms from the third blackzine, some from other bbses, and 
manuals, etc.. so it should be rather well rounded for various applications. 
I do not know if there has been a more recent version, of the IIRG manual 
since 1993. There may be, but I haven't seen it yet, and I haven't looked 
either..

   This should be the most complete acronym list available, although it 
is probably far from being complete.. If you want to add to it, mail me,
or catch me on irc. Look around for ck_  Some shoutouts for this file, 
would go to the people down at tacd, the IIRG, Incognyto (403) for help and
additions to this list, as well as Shamen for the ascii. Contributions are 
welcome, I'll give you perm greets. To find me, take a look at the blackzine 
file on either the bbses or on my voice mail.
