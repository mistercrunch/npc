HI, welcome to issue 4 of f41th magazine. I heard the guys over at A-S mag,
(Anti-Social magazine) are going to do a 'review' of our zine. As we've
always said before, go for it, we welcome any input/crititism. In this issue
we've made a few updates and changes to the usuall blabber we stick in the
zine. For starters, we have cut down on codes, and increased the amount of
technical information available in the zine. We are also going to start a new
column, run by bodie called SUIDside, and also new sections dedicated to the
exploration of UK and US switching/signaling mechanisms and structures.
Please take the time to read f41th, as it takes a long time to put together.
I would like to apologise to anyone that has visited the darkcyde.8m.com site
and noticed the fucked up html (my fault) I just finished making the new
site, with frames etc, uploaded it, but guess what-- freeservers lame ass
java scripts and banners messed all the &lt;body> up, and now the site is even
worse. If there is anyone out there that could kick us down a nice subnet
server, that would be cool. We also need distro sites/servers for f41th mag,
any offers? (webmaster@darkcyde.8m.com) I'd like to say word to all the
darkcyde members that have helped out in keeping the grewp alive, and word to
all writters in this zine. Hopefully f41th will keep on going, even though we
are a bunch of lazy pimps, we'll always keep the info flowing :] Word to 9x,
b4b0, and all the peeps in #darkcyde #telkore #legions #2600-uk #9x EFNET.
OK, lets f1re 1t up....

--> Here is a quick introduction/list ]---------------------[ lowtek ]-------
--> of USwest Tandems and CLLI codes  ]---------------------[ aka upl1nk ]---


I wrote this text in like 2.9 seconds so dont expect anything real
sophisticated. I thought i would just write up something kind unusual but
powerful if you keep studing it. This is just a gateway to learning switch.

Tandems:

Switches that consolidate traffic, reduce trunk group requirements, and
switch interoffice traffic. They allow U S WEST to manage the network more
economically. Also referred to as "local" and "access" tandems.

CLLI codes:

Stand for Competetive Local Exchange Carrier and are 11 digit codes that
RBOC's assign to the C.O's location.

Reading CLLI codes: PHNXAZMA01T

Yes these 11 digit codez actually mean something.  The Letters 5and6
represent the state, 7and8 are the C.O's name and 9 thru 11 is the specific
equiptment name.

This text is just for showing to younger phreaks that there still are tons of
old old creaky ass mother fuckin switches out there to play with, so kids I
suggest you read some texts on these.  This will double your knowedge of
phreaking, and help you be an all around better person =) I know this is
kinda off my regular GEOS/LEOS subject but I thought that some people just
dont now the power of switches these days...

I would suggest visiting some of these websites if you are interested in this
field of phreaking:

*****************************************************************************

We will jump right in.  The first satellite to ever orbit the earth on 
october 4, 1957 was the Russians Sputnik.  Next was "SCORE" which was the 
first communications satellite in 1958, able to broadcast only a single
voice taped messege from President Eisenhower "Peace On Earth, Good Will To
Men". Thus begun an everlasting race to see who could build the most
sophisticated satellite.  

Sometime In the 60's Americans jumped in to the race with Telstar which was 
far more sophisticated than Sputnik.

Today there are more than 3,000 satellites in orbit.  Each and everyone of 
those sends signals down to earth and recieves signals from earth to the 
satellite.  These are called an Uplink and a Downlink.  

The Uplink is when the base reciever uploads information to the satellite 
such as its coordinates ans programing for the satallites viewers. Just think
how many signals that is if every satellite can produce over 25,000 signals.

These signals are in groups of frequencys I have made a list of what bands 
control what frequencys (The ones with * next to them are based around just 
satellite signaling):

VHF 30 to 300 mhz

UHF 300 to 3000 mhz 

L-Band 0.5 to 1.5 ghz
       
*C band 4 to 8 ghz

*Ku band 10.9 to 17 ghz

*Ka band 18 to 31 ghz


Satellites are used for many different things such as:

Satellite TV
Radio                         
GPS
Weather
Telephone Calls over Seas

In this text I will try to cover most of these.

There are 3 different kinds of Satellites that I am formilliar with: 
GEOS LEOS and MEOS:  

GEOS (Geosynchronous earth orbiting satellites) are the most common of all
satellites.  These satellites orbit the earth in Geosynchronous Orbit which
is 22,300 miles above earth.

GEOS are slowly becoming obsolite because of there distance from earth.  
This effects the speed of data that the satellite is transfering to earth.
This is why most companys now a days are purchasing LEOS (Low Earth Orbiting
Satellites) these satellites cruise around 2,000-4,000 feet these satellites
are alot closer to earth hence making the data flow faster than GEOS do. Many
pager and cellphone companys are starting to use LEOS as there main satellite
just because the reception is alot better and can provide world wide
connections (check out www.iridium.com).

A good thing about GEOS is that basically they can cover more geographical 
area than LEOS cause they are higher and can cover more land. Now MEOS
(Medium Earth Orbiting Satellites) are basically just a weather satellite
they orbit around 10,000 feet.

TVRO/Television Signals
     
Satellite TV is a system such as "Direct TV" or the "Dish Network" These are
what are called TVRO (Tele Vision Recieve Only) and are becoming very popular
among people these days. There are about 5.1 million installations of TVRO's
today in North America and are becomeing popular in forign contries as we
speak.

The Satellite TV bands are:

S)Band          1700)3000 MHz
C)Band          3700)4200 MHz 
Ku1)Band        10.9)11.75 GHz
Ku2)Band        11.75)12.5 GHz (DBS)
Ku3)Band        12.5)12.75 GHz
Ka)Band         18.0)20.0 GHz

Now to Reach these Signals you will need a C/Ku Band Reciever and a C/Ku band
Dish these can be ordered on the interenet I have included some sites where
you can purchase these.

Here is a list of the Downlink Freq's for C/Ku band:

        Channel  1 = 3720/11730 MHz     Channel 13 = 3960/12096 MHz
        Channel  2 = 3740/11743         Channel 14 = 3980/12109 
        Channel  3 = 3760/11791         Channel 15 = 4000/12157
        Channel  4 = 3780/11804         Channel 16 = 4020/12170
        Channel  5 = 3800/11852         Channel 17 = 4040 
        Channel  6 = 3820/11865         Channel 18 = 4060 
        Channel  7 = 3840/11913         Channel 19 = 4080 
        Channel  8 = 3860/11926         Channel 20 = 4100 
        Channel  9 = 3880/11974         Channel 21 = 4120 
        Channel 10 = 3900/11987         Channel 22 = 4140 
        Channel 11 = 3920/12035         Channel 23 = 4160 
        Channel 12 = 3940/12048         Channel 24 = 4180 

Many of these channels are Scrambled then again you can find many open 
channels that have sporting events or public broadcasting channels.  

For the Scrambled Channels there are usually decoders in the newer Recievers,
most likely you will be able to watch some of the scrambed frequency's.  

The most popular of the channels are usually scrambled with VC II and VIII 
systems, now sometimes you will get lucky and actually be able to find a 
V II and V III decoder and then you can watch it without having to pay or 
subsribe to the channels.

Audio Channels/Radio Signals:

Audio channels are usually a higher frequency than TV channels, also there
are more than 70 audio only channels avalible from each North American
Satellites. The audio frequency's are usually in the 6.2 to 6.8 mhz but audio
can go through 5 to 8 mhz.

There are Radio Shows daily for other satellite hobbiests to listen to
including "Lets talk Radio" is a computer/radio/shortwave listening/
satellite navagationing show/ which used to be daily at 6p.m. that anyone
could listen to who had a C/Ku band dish and reciever.

GPS Satellites:

GPS stands for Global Positioning System, these satellites are fairly new
they provide navegation for ships, tanks, Hummers, airplanes, space stations,
satellites,and many other devices.  They provide navagation, position and
velocity by the second.  They were first introduced to the world from the US
Department of Defence (what a supprise), and are widely used today in many
aspects of communication and traveling.  This system of satellites are
controled by a main base all the GPS satellites are operated at what is
called "GPS Master Control and Monitor Network" which is located in Colorado
at the Schriever Air Force Base.

Today you can walk out to your local Radio Shack and pick up a GPS reciever
for traveling and it will tell you where you are most anywhere on earth. Now
tell me that is not amazing.  Today I was doing some Research on GPS and this
was amazing to me I found a company that provides GPS recievers that you
strap on to your kid and it tells you where they are anywhere in the world.
That made me kind of sick but it is a good example of how GPS is growing and
how accessible it is to the public (also how weird are society is with
technology of this kind).

Satellite Internet Connections:

Many Networks Today reside on Satellite's, and the amount is growing every
day.  More and More people decide they need more bandwidth for there
networks or for personal use alone.  Satellites have been offering personal
interenet services for about 3 years now and the users are expanding as we 
speak.  The reason for such wide expansion is satellite's high bandwidth.  
Today you can subscrube to a satellite ISP which data transfers 5 times the 
speed of DUAL ISDN Channels, of course this has its downfalls which include 
a $490 dollar a month bill and also the weather somtimes effects satellite 
reception, so in other words during a /rain/thunder/hail/snow storm you 
would ether have a terrible connection to the internet or no connection at 
all.  I have hered of some companys fixing the problem but have no other 
information about it. Also have found an Example of what one of these systems
may cost:

*********The Satellite Internet System includes the following hardware 
************specifications as well as unlimited access for 10-150 Users. 
**************Intel Pentium PII 266MMX 
****************16 bay server case 
******************4.0 gig IDE drive

**********************************************Activation prior to delivery

36 months free on site next day warranty. 
Price $4,900 (Includes Server, Dish, and Installation) 
Monthly Price $490 per month (36 Month lease) 

This means that after you pay your $4,900 dollar bill you have to continue 
paying your monthly bill which is $490 dollars.  For a large company this 
is no bill at all but you can see how one person who wants fast internet 
access might struggle financially. 

Many huge Companys are starting to connect there networks to ATM networks via
Satellites one of the many of those companys is COMSAT which is ahead of the
other competitors with there ATM Link Enhancer (ALE).  COMSAT wins first ATM
via satellite contract which makes them elegable to start building massive
ATM networks. The reson for this being so great is that companys can start
connecting all forms of communication devices, such as, video confrencing,
real-time logistics, and medical expertise to deployed field units
(Telemedicine) all in real time, Anywhere in the world.

-==Weather Satellites:==-

Weather satellites have helped the human race tons. Without these satellites
there would be no hurican warnings or storm warnings or how about you wouldnt
even be able to tell when it is supposed to snow.  With your C/Ku band
reciever and dish you can somtimes find an occasional public weather station
when scanning thru the C/Ku band it probelly wont be local but you get to
see what kind of weather france is getting.  Here i have included a list of 
weather satellites that are Operational and some of there frequency's:

This is just a small list I am sorry I couldnt provide more frequencys. You
can download programs off the internet that connect to satellite's and you
can view stunning images of live weather around the globe. There are even
sometimes live camera's via the internet that broadcast live weather to some
satellites.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Satellite and Telephone Intergration:=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Satellites have greatly helped our communication in various ways but the 
telephone has by far been the greatest.  I will give an example of how 
satellites are used with a common telephone call from the U.S. to Australia. 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is one of the most important parts of this text because it kind of puts
everything together into one big example. So please read this part carefully.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Fist the call would be releyed to Roaring Creek, Pennsyvania International
Earth Station via microwave signals, then from Roaring Creek up into the main
Anteanna on a 6ghz uplink.  Then processed to an Earth Station in Australia
via the downlink then shipped into the local switch and ran to the
subscribers house.  From there it would do exactly the revearse of what it
did in the U.S. So this time it will be ran thru the local switch up to the
earth station in australia and then uplinked at 6ghz and then downlinked to
Roaring Creek, Pennsylvania once again.  So every time one person talks it
has to ush to the earth station and be uplinked and downlinked then run
through the local switch (wow what a fast ride). Now you know why these calls
cost so much.

Please Examine the Ascii at the first part of this text.  You will see that 
the signal could represent a telephone call across the world which is
uplinked by Earth Station B and traveled on signal D and then Processed in
satellite A and then downlinked on signal E to Earth Station C.

This completes my text on satellite communications Introduction, 
although expect many more texts from me about satellites this is just an 
opening of understanding for my other texts which will take this knowledge 
and combine it into othermore technical aspects of satellites.

-----------> Addition to the above article: More on satelite systems & phones
-----------> by hybrid (th0rn@coldmail.com - PGP only)


This is just a very quick file to acomany lowtek's article on satelite
communications. Just did a little research, and found a little more out about
sateleites and the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). The majour
players in the satelite industry are INTELSAT (International
Telecommunications Satelite Organisation), and EUTELSAT (European
Telecommunications Satelite service)- part of the European Space Agency (ESA)
and PASAT (Pan American Satelite Inc) These organisations lease space on
there satelites for other companys such as telcos, private sector operations,
etc, etc. These systems are often interconnected to the PSTN and ISDN nets
on the ground, and implement dishes with diameters ranging from 3.5 to 13m.
An interesting development I discovered is called 'Briefcase satelite
newsgathering (SNG) terminal'.. It is a small, lightweight system developed
by a co-operation between Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Teleglobe
Canada, and Skywave Electronics Ltd. The system weighs only 14.5 kg, and is
capable of providing good quality speech, still pictures, plus data packets.
Again, this system is readily being intergrated into our PSTN. The system
operates over INMARSAT-C links of 1.5 to 1.6 GHz to a hub earth station
which operates in the 4 and 6 GHz band. Basically, I would imagine that
satelite systems are connected to the PSTN in the following way:

                                                                  ___

    Australia)                                           y= downlink


I will be honest here and say that I don't really know exactly how Earth to
Satelite PSTN networking actually works, but if I was to guess it would be
similar to my above diagram, and involve the following routing proccess over
the PSTN... Say I was customer (A) and I wanted to call customer (B) over in
Austrailia, here is what I believe would happen: I pick up the phone and
begin to dial the international country code for Austrailia.. My local
exchange recognises that conventional routing over the network will not
terminate the call, so then forwards my number query over to a DMS
international exchange unit, where the best route for my call is decided by
call allocation software. Beacuse the distance of the call is not conviniant
for land lines, or sub mersive transmission, I am then forwarded to a special
telco satelite base station, where a channel is selected and researved for my
call. An uplink and downlink channel is then setup betwwen Base station A and
Base station B in Australia. Conventional Signaling protocols in Australia
then setup the call acrross the many switches over there until an incoming
call trunk transmission is detected by customer B's local office, which then
routes a call translation and set's up a channel via it's PSTN back to the
PSTN in the UK... B then picks up the phone and the data link is complete.
Because Australia is the opposite side of the world to the UK, a base
station in the middle would have to rebound the signal, and data transmission
back upto the geo-stationary satelite over Australia. When the call is
terminated, all channels, circuits, switches, contacts, are reset and are
ready for another call. I would imagine there are litteraly 1OO's of geo-
stationary satelites that are used by the telcos for international calling,
note: for those of you who have not been paying attention! - geo-stationary
means the satelite is in syncronous orbit with the earth, and would appear to
be still if seen from the earths surface. The orbit at which these satelites
reside is called 'the clarke belt' named after Authur C Clarkes vision of a
place orbiting the earth that remains syncronous with the earths rotation.
Anyways, this could go on forever, so I'm gonna conclude this short file. For
more info on this subject, just do a web portal search for things like
intelsat, eutelsat, pstn routing, geo-syncronous.. blah blah blah. Hope you
enjoyed...



--> British Telecom WB9OO ]---------------------------------[ hybrid ]-------
--> A guide to the digital ]--------------------[ th0rn@coldmail.com ]-------
--> exchange unit. ]---------------------------------------------------------



WB9OO is a system designed by BT to split a line into two carriers. This way
two seperate BT customers can use the same line with privacy, in other words
two seperate incoming/outgoing calls can be made on 1 subscriber loop
similtaniously. Basicaly, the hardware BT have devoloped to allow this kind
of loop is called _WB9OO 1+1 Carrier System, and consists of 1 exchange unit,
1 customer unit and a filter, all of which I will explain later. The exchange
unit is designed to be attached to the Main Distribution Frame (MDF). The
idea is that the standard line pair is attached to the filter at the
Destination Point (DP). The filter and the DP WB9OO equipment is installed on
the customers premisis, usually hidden away somewhere. In order for two
people to use the same line, the two subscribers are split into differnet
catigories, one of them being the _Audio Customer_ the other being the
_Carrier Customer_. The audio customer will use normal speech and carrier
freqencys, wile the carrier customer would use a higher carrier freqency,
operating well above the standard audio freqency range. Lets take a look at
this setup a little closser...

Remember: * The audio customer and carrier customer use the SAME line *
            (SIMILTANIOUSLY with SEPERATE call setups and routes)

******************
The Audio Customer
******************

The audio customers part of the line is basicaly the same as a standard phone
line, implementing DC signals with the normal 25 Hz which makes the phone
ring. The customers voice patterns will use the audio freqency band, hence
the name. Here a filter is implemented which is designed to stop the audio
freqncys interfering with the carrier customers freqencys and equipment. As
said before, this filter is fitted at the Destination Point of the
subscribers line.

********************
The Carrier Customer
********************

Listen up, heres the whole emphasis of this file, the carrier customer.
Basicaly, as I said before, the audio and carrier customers are on the same
line or cable pair, but the carrier customer is on a higher freqency. Here,
simple science is implemented and Amplitude Modulation (AM) is deployed to
provide the line split. Here the signals and speech from the customer to the
exchange (TXD) are modulated on a 40 kHz carrier. From the exchange to the
subsciber, the carrier is modulated at a steady 64 kHz. Lets take another
look at this subsciber line setup...

****************************************
Outgoing calls from the carrier customer
****************************************

When the customer places a call, 40 kHz is transmitted to the line. 40 kHz is
well outside the audio freqency range and will not interfere with the audio
customers telephone equipment. This 40 kHz will be detected by the WB9OO unit
at the exchange, and will then create a DC loop for the call to procede.
Similtaniously a 64 kHz tone is transmitted to the customers line from the
exchange itself (modualted dialtone).

**************************************
Incoming calls to the carrier customer
**************************************

If the carrier customer is called by someone, the WB9OO exchange unit detects
the ringing current, and the 64 kHz carrier is activated and then modualted
to the normal 25 Hz ringing current.

************
Interfernece
************

As on most freqency dependant electrical equipment, the WB9OO exchange units
can be 'interfered with'. The customer, and exchange units are suseptable to
freqnecys in the following bands: 36-44 kHz - 60-68 kHz.

********************************************************
Testing this kind of loop setup at the exchange and line
********************************************************

Any UK phreak worth his/her weight in pbx's should have resonable knowledge
of BT line testing techn1que. In this setup the audio and carrier customers
are tested in differnt ways, these tests are performed from the local
exchange using a technique called test selecting. Also from the Main
Distrobution Frame and remote equipment located away from the exchange itself. The usuall
BT testing facilitys are deployed in this scenario, SALT (for the audio
customer) FRB (ringback for both audio and carrier customers) and howler
tests.

**************
Vulnerablittys
**************

As far as I can tell the only real obvious security issue with this type of
customer loop setup is via physical phreaking, ie- the use of a beige box or
interception of carrier loop from local distrobution points. The customers
equipment comes in many flavours, ranging from drop wires on poles, wall
mountings and underground filters. If a WB9OO distrobution box is located and
riged up, it would be possible to have the use of two lines instead of one.
I'm lazy, so you won't find me climbing any telegraph poles with my beige box
although one of the most common instalations for this type of equipment is in
well built up areas such as apartment buildings, where the WB9OO units would
all be coupled to together (knowing BT thrown together), here it's just a
case of pic'n'mix. Anyway, I'm not encouraging you to participate in such
fraudualant activitys :p Just wait until telephony over the national grid
comes into play, try beige boxing then.... Hope you enjoyed this article,
and play saftly kids.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     --------------[      D4RKCYDE Present (1999)        ]---------------
     --------------[ AT&T 5ESS-2OOO Switching Technology ]---------------
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     

The 5ESS Switch is a most flexible digital exchange for use in the global
switching network. Digital switches replaced earlier electromechanical and
analog switching systems. The 5ESS equipment switches ISDN voice and data,
local voice calls, long distance calls, Internet access, wireless PCS,
Advanced Intelligent Network services, interactive video and multimedia
services...moving any media on the public switched network. This means the
5ESS Switch provides the system, services and software to transform current
networks into multi-functional networks that meet the needs of todays home,
business and community. By 1992, the next generation 2000 Switch was created
at Bell Laboratories and added to networks worldwide. 

A digital switch is a single system with multiple applications such as local,
toll, operator services. The switch architecture is a modular, distributed
architecture with an administrative module, a communications module, and a
varying number of switching modules that provide the major processing power
in the total communication system. This switch design will allow network
providers to offer their customers voice, computer, fax, data, and visual
services.

FCC (Federal Communication Commission) required quality monitoring process
has shown the 5ESS Switch is highly reliable, in fact the 5ESS-2000 switch is
four times more reliable than its nearest competitor. Today the 5ESS switch
is considered the workhorse of the public telecommunications network in the
United States with its lower life cycle costs and its proven record of
reliability.

Modular Design Advantage
************************
An advantage, when deploying the 5ESS Switch, continues to be its modular
design. This modularity allows for ease of implementing ongoing enhancements
and allows service providers the ability to change their communication
network quickly.

The value of the current 5ESS Switch modular architecture and the ease with
which is adapts to new technologies has been repeatedly demonstrated.
Administrations can deploy new 5ESS Switches in their network, only to find
their business requires additional hardware modules and the associated
software releases. The new hardware can easily be added to the network's
standard growth and modernization plans. The result is an easy, effective,
and economical upgrade to a 5ESS-2000 Switch without service disruption. 
                                         
          Telephone administrations are often concerned with: 

               Increasing busy hour call completion capacity 
               Minimizing floor space requirements 
               Enabling growth in small increments 
               Integrating multiple applications in one exchange 
               Reducing power consumption and operational costs 

The 5ESS-2000 Switch architecture and software addresses each of these
concerns. Economical access to advanced services via the 5ESS-2000 Switch can
be provided to all subscribers no matter where they are located; in
metropolitan, suburban or rural areas.

A Distributed Architecture
**************************
The 5ESS-2000 Switch also features a distributed architecture that employs
modular components in all systems and subsystems. This readily accommodates a
broad array of growth and configuration options that allow you to easily and
economically evolve your network as subscriber demand grows. This flexibility
enables you to maintain your competitive edge while saving on sparing,
training and documentation.

Internet Capacity
*****************
Reliability and customer satisfaction are especially important with respect
to internet services, since the extensive growth of the Internet has caused
an increase in network blockages on existing central offices. However, a new
capability, which Lucent refers to as Project Renaissance, helps service
providers avoid this problem in a least costly fashion. Today the 5ESS-2000
Switch is the first switch to handle both wireline and wireless traffic.
Project Renaissance will modernize and consolidate central offices and
networks by using the SM2000 with Digital Network Unit -- SONET-- and the
Access Interface Unit to provide increased trunk and line capacity for the
service providers network. Project Renaissance also reuses some existing
central office equipment. This increased capacity affords opportunities not
only for a lower cost structure and simplified network operations, but also a
better grade of service with less probability of internet and voice calls
being blocked as a result of high internet hold times. 

Access Interface Unit (AIU) - A new cost-effective non-blocking line unit for
the 5ESS Switch that was generally available in 1996. This line unit
initially supports enhanced performance and reduced operational costs for
analog connections, but will also support ISDN and ADSL in the future. ISDN
PRI Expansion - The 5ESS Switch SM-2000 was expanded to handle more PRI
terminations in 1996. This capability will lower service provider operational
and first-time costs. Provisioning Solutions - The Switch Element Manager
Operations Systems will shadow a switch's translation/feature database,
making it easier and faster to provision ISDN lines without placing strain on
the embedded switch call processors. In early 1997, additional Applications
Software will be made available to further enhance the ISDN provisioning
process. Provisioning audit services are available to pinpoint trouble spots.

Small Exchanges and Remote Capabilities
***************************************
Remote line units can support basic and supplementary services and ISDN
capabilities. Remote switching systems provide all the duplex switch services
of the host exchange and can sustain complete stand alone functionality if
remote-to-host facilities are out of service.

Small autonomous exchanges, like CDX and VCDX, are configured to support
exchange sites where deployment of remotes may be unsuitable. In addition to
typical host exchange configurations, the 5ESS Switch offers full service
remote switch solutions and interchangeable models to configure the smallest
to the largest exchange sites. This simplifies training, documentation, and
spare parts while increasing flexibility and services. No longer must network
providers procure differing systems for small sites versus large metropolitan
exchanges.

Over the past seven years the switch has increased busy hour call capacity
more than fivefold. The architecture lets the switch add processing power as
needed to add extra call capacity. A network service provider need buy only
as much capacity as needed to start, then expand later to meet business
demands or to bring more features to customers in their market. Thus as
business expands, the service provider need only upgrade the modules directly
involved, rather than add whole new switches.

Alarm Management Module
***********************
Alarm Management lets you prioritize and sort system events. You can set your
own event thresholds for system alarms, modify standard severity defaults and
define alarm escalation parameters to meet your individual needs. With Alarm
Management, it is easy to obtain on-screen descriptions of all system events
and quickly sort them as action or non-action items, according to degree of
severity. Event severity thresholds can than be changed when necessary. The
Alarm Management System Event Monitor provides an on-going log of all
Meridian 1 events. An integrated on-screen Alarm Banner provides an
additional convenient summary window of new "critical"," major" and "minor"
alarms. Each time a new event triggers an alarm, the appropriate alert box in
the Alarm Banner window will flash to alert you.

*********************************
A Brief History of the Meridian 1
*********************************

Historical Overview
*******************
In the early seventies, Northern Telecom recognized the need for a versatile
state-of-the-art product that could adapt readily and quickly to changing
conditions, a product that would give it an edge in a very competitive
marketplace. The SL-1 PABX (Private Automatic Branch Exchange) emerged,
featuring a digital switching matrix under computer control. The foresight of
the original development team continues to pay dividends. The challenge was
to design a system that would meet current needs while retaining the ability
to evolve without obsolescence. The key aspect of the system design is a
modular, highly flexible architecture in which the primary system elements
can be independently changed in whole or in part to address changing market
requirements. The system met an immediate demand for a full range of voice
and data processing features in a cost-effective package. Besides functioning
as a Private Branch Exchange (PBX), it also included key telephone and custom
calling features. These advances were achieved by incorporating several
notable industry firsts. A high-level software language provided significant
advantages over assembler language in terms of simplicity and implementation.
It also permitted improved, simpler ways for users to communicate with the
system. To complement the advanced PBX features, a custom LSI chip was
incorporated into a proprietary electronic telephone and its associated
peripheral interface. From a human factors point of view, replacing the
conventional telephone with a new electronic set was a prerequisite for more
effective business communications services. The SL-1 electronic telephone
provided simple, direct selection of features, and unambiguous system
responses to indicate the progress of calls. The main objective to reduce the
size of interconnectiong cable, as compared to those used for existing key
telephone sets, was achieved by using a form of distributed control in the
SL-1 set. The six conductor line cord in the SL-1 sets permitted systems to
be pre-cabled irrespective of the eventual use of either SL-1 or conventional
500/2500-type single line telephones at a terminal location. Another industry
first was the utilization of the codec on a per port basis to take full
advantage of digital technology. Ongoing silicon enhancements could be
introduced without affecting more centralized equipment in the system.
Peripheral equipment was packaged in increments of four line circuits an two
trunk circuits on associated individual cards. The first system shipment was
in 1975, and the product has continued to evolve, incorporating new
technologies as they become available. As a result, a continuous stream of
enhancements has introduced a series of system models, each building on its
predecessor with improvements in performance and capabilities.

The Digital World
*****************
In 1976, Northern Telecom became the first corporation to commit publicly,
with the Digital World announcement, to producing a complete line of digital
switching, business communications, and transmission systems. Every major
telecommunications manufacturer has since followed this lead. Today, Nortel
is the principal supplier of fully digital systems in the world. Its family
of digital business communications systems is among the world's most advanced
multi-function integrated voice and data switching systems.

The Intelligent Universe
************************
In 1979, Northern Telecom unfolded the Intelligent Universe to announce the
threshold of a new era for its product capabilities. Envisioned were new
applications of digital technology to create efficient, harmonious global
networks of simultaneous voice and data transmission that allow major office
communication functions to be undertaken in a single integrated system. In
addition, the formation of sophisticated networks would evolve to provide
comprehensive communications through intelligent terminals in which
information can be organized, stored, accessed, and received from any source
in the world.

OPEN World
**********
In 1982, Northern Telecom announced the OPEN World for information management
systems. The OPEN (Open Protocol Enhanced Networks) World was an extension of
Northern Telecom's proven expertise in the key areas of digital technology,
semiconductors, software, and integrated communications capability. It
presented a commitment to providing a planning framework, new products,
features, and services for the OPEN World. Northern Telecom's announcement of
OPEN World promised to create integrated communication networks that open the
technological barriers to user-controlled systems. The SL-1 would act as the
hub for such systems, giving the user the opportunity to install whatever
equipment is most cost-effective for the application. The OPEN World concept
encompasses the following five key criteria: continuity, compatibility,
congeniality, control, and cost-effectiveness.

Meridian
********
On February 14, 1985, Northern Telecom, in keeping with the OPEN World
promise, announced major enhancement capabilities to its SL family of digital
switching systems. Under the banner of Meridian SL-1 Integrated Services N
etwork, a new range of sophisticated information management services would
evolve including:

 Unique, high speed 2.56 Mbps pipeline to the desktop using conventional
 twisted pair wiring distribution 

 Range of fully digital telephones to increase the existing terminal
 portfolio using a new 512 Kbps digital distribution scheme 

The foregoing enhancements were accomplished through architectural extensions
that built on the existing system foundation. As such, they reemphasized
Northern Telecom's commitment to a continuity program that guards against
product obsolescence.

Meridian 1
**********
On January 30, 1990, Northern Telecom unveiled Meridian 1, a modular
communication system encompassing the industry's first truly global private
branch exchange (PBX) product line. Meridian 1 represents a merger of the
functionality of Meridian SL-1 and Meridian SL-100, Meridian SuperNode, and
Northern Telecom's remaining PBX products, into a single, modular
communications product portfolio. Meridian 1 capabilities extend from voice
and data features for very small organizations to high-capacity advanced
tandem networking, very large Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) centers (up
to 4,000 agents), multi-function military agency support, campus
communication systems, intelligent network node capabilities, and the bridge
to the FiberWorld of the future. Meridian 1 provides common hardware and
adaptive software for existing systems. This means that customers can upgrade
to the latest voice features, data connectivity, and sophisticated
information services for PBX applications ranging in size from 30 to 60,000
ports, the widest range in the industry, while retaining 80 to 90 percent of
their equipment. Noteworthy for multi-national corporations, Meridian 1 uses
globally adaptive technology that enables it to be sold and used in virtually
any country without major hardware modifications. Meridian 1 software is
compatible with recognized international communications transmission
standards. Additionally, Meridian 1 Digital Telephone Sets can be programmed
to give instructions in multiple languages. Meridian 1 provides a platform
for future growth and is compatible with communications networks of the next
century. Underscoring Northern Telecom's leadership in ISDN, Meridian 1
delivers ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI) and ISDN Basic Rate Interface
(BRI). In the future, the system will use fiber optic technology to provide
broadband capability, bandwidth on demand, and services such as high-speed
data and full motion video. The Meridian 1 introduced a product design
consisting of stackable modules that contain the various system elements.
Peripheral Equipment Modules contain line and trunk cards that connect a wide
variety of telephone and central office interface circuits. The modular
design offers the ability to grow from a single module through a column of up
to four modules into an array of columns that connect with existing equipment
to extend and serve application with up to 60,000 ports. The modular
packaging takes up to 50 percent less floor space than SL-1 systems and
allows customers to add lines and features in a simpler, more cost-effective
manner than ever before. The core of the product line is an Intelligent
Peripheral Equipment Module that works with both the Meridian 1 and SL-100
and has distributed processing, high-density line cards, universal trunks,
improved self-diagnostics, and an enhanced network architecture. System
Options provide the ability to select the configuration best suited to meet
the required business communication application within the 30- to 60,000-
port range. For applications up to 10,000 ports, Option 11C, 51C, 61C, and
81C, are available.

Meridian 1 in Cyberspace
************************
By 1996, the Meridian 1 once again led the enterprise communications industry
into the future with the introduction of Release 22. With the introduction of
this software release, all Meridian 1 products including the Option 11C, 51C,
61C, 81, and 81C were standardized on commercial based Motorola 680X0
processors and were equipped with ethernet connectivity as a standard option.
With the power and connectivity now in place, the Meridian 1 opened its
Ethernet doors to the world of system management with the introduction of
Meridian Administration Tools (MAT Release 5) and SNMP Alarm Agent. MAT
Release 5 supports communication to the Meridian 1 through the use of TCP/IP
over Ethernet or the use of PPP for serial connections. Graphical user
interfaces (GUI) are offered for maintenance activities in conjunction with
application protocol interfaces (API) instead of overlays. Context sensitive
help screens bring detailed technical information to users through number of
application modules such as: Station Administration, Traffic Analysis, Call
Accounting, Call Tracking, Alarm Management, Maintenance Windows, ESN
Analysis and Reporting, and on-line NTPs. Additionally, Release 22 also
brought Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to the Meridian 1 to
integrate system management functions across enterprise networks. Joint
development efforts between Nortel and Cabletron, a leading provider of
computer networking hardware and software, provide SNMP compatibility to
Cabletron's SPECTRUM product line. Meridian 1 systems now appear as icons on
the SPECTRUM display along with those of other network elements. This enables
the surveillance of a user's network from a single display from which
individual alarms can be presented and then acted upon by management systems
such as MAT 5. In 1996, workplace mobility once again entered the forefront
of attention with the introduction of Companion Microcellular service for the
Meridian 1. This expansion of the Companion product line enabled users of
public digital cellular service to utilize the same portable handset whether
roaming in-building campus environments or out on the public macrocellular
environment.

*******************************
Call Accounting & Call Tracking
*******************************

Call Accounting Module
**********************
Call Accounting enables comprehensive call costing reports based on CDR
output. It can be used to provide details on the actual usage of the Meridian
1 helping you to assess the effectiveness of your telephone services or to
itemize calls to specific groups (or departments) for cost allocation, or for
individual billing purposes and other types of cost allocation. Call
Accounting is integrated with Station Administration, removing the need to
re-enter data that already exists within Station Administration. Station
Administration, however, is not a prerequisite for Call Accounting.

Cost Allocation Reports
***********************
Many predefined reports exist for your convenience. Cost allocation can be
looked at based on the time the call was made, the extention that made the
call, the department or division it came from, the account code used, and
more. In addition, many of the reports have report summaries that can be
generated.

Trunk Analysis Reports
**********************
Several trunk reports are also available, providing a call usage summary by
service facility and by trunk type.

Frequency Reports 
*****************
Frequency reports are another area of interest providing reports based on
customers, frequently called numbers, calling line identification (CLID),
call duration, hold time, and more.

Report Filters and Graphs 
*************************
All reports can be customized via filters to include or exclude records based
on criteria such as the date and time of the call, type of extension, trunk,
cost, department, division, authorization code, account code, duration, etc.
There are also a number of graphing options via a built-in graph generator.

Other Billable Items 
********************
This feature is used to assign any additional calls that are not being
recorded by the Meridian 1 to an extension, such as those from a calling card
or cellular phone.

*************
Call Tracking
*************

"Detect and Alarm Toll Fraud"

Day by day, your Meridian 1 operates, routing calls to and from your company.
Ever wonder what your traffic calling patterns look like on a realtime basis?
Using MAT Call Tracking, you can now visually monitor traffic patterns. How
long are station users on the phone? What percentage of calls are incoming,
outgoing, or via tandem tie lines? These are a few of the available features.
Better yet, you can set up your own meter to visually cue on the criteria
that you want to monitor. Have you ever been a victim of toll fraud? Want to
know who's making long international calls, as they happen? The integrated
alarm filter can detect these scenarios and alarm you when the event occurs.
With multiple alarming notification methods, the system is sure to reach you,
where ever you may be.

Features
********
Call Tracking is an on-line call monitor and alarm application for the
examination of call usage patterns leading to toll fraud detection. Graphs
are used to indicate trends and provide displays of unusual calls, enabling
you to adjust equipment and services to maximize resources. Multiple
filtering templates allow for your customization of *** toll fraud ***
criteria. The Call Tracking Module provides a number of alarm notification
options to alert you when the filter criteria have been met. Call Tracking
is designed to be used with Call Accounting but can also exist on a stand-
alone basis.

On-line Visual Monitors 
***********************
Call Tracking provides visual graphs to monitor call usage patterns. Multiple
graphs are available to look at such things as recent call history, percent
of calls by duration, incoming verses outgoing call origin, and more.

Filtering Templates/Alarm Definitions
*************************************
Using the CDR output from the Meridian 1, Call Tracking can screen the
information through filtering templates and alarm on any of the screening
variables. Examples of available fields are originating ID, terminating ID,
date, time, call duration, digits dialed, authorization code, and ring time.

Alarm Options 
*************
Alarm notification to you can be accomplished via a variety of methods. There
is always the standard screen, audible alarm on the PC, and printer. However,
Call Tracking also offers alarms via a network message, pager, modem and fax.

***************
Common Services
***************

At the heart of the MAT system is Common Services: a versatile set of core
elements. Common Services is used to create and organize Meridian 1 equipment
into individual sites and systems, launch MAT applications, define user
security privileges and maintain a log of PC events. Security is improved
with Common Services' single platform user login procedures. System
administrators can retain complete control of access levels throughout an
entire multi-site location and assign them on a per-site or per application
basis. At every level, shared resources and database information help to make
MAT the most productive and secure way to manage your Meridian 1 system.
Common Services also provides easy access to Meridian 1 system and
application Overlays via its built-in enhanced terminal emulator. This MAT
terminal emulator provides all the current Input/Output guides on-line in an
easy context-sensitive feature. Particular information on an Overlay is only
a mouse click away. Within an Overlay, help is available at particular
prompts for valid entries as well as information about error codes. MAT's
Overlay Enhancer allows you, or your staff to have the same level of
expertise at your finger tips as a Meridian 1 expert with years of
experience. MAT Common Services navigation and system configuration tools
form a solid foundation that all system applications can use to optimize
Meridian 1 performance.

**************************************
Meridian 1 Electronic Switched Network
(ESN)
**************************************

Networking is the interconnection of multiple systems for the purpose of
communications. ESN allows you to tie separate corporate communications
systems into one and share common network features and functionality's within
a unified private communications network. ESN helps optimize the cost and
performance objectives of your organization's telecommunications systems.
Many private networks have grown in a rather disjointed fashion, with each
office being responsible for the installation of local trunks and special
service trunks to handle local and long distance calls for their own users.
This results in an inefficient network with too many trunks, some of which
are not being fully utilized. An effective network can cut cost by
centralization of trunks, least-cost routing and control of calls.
Centralization of facilities can benefit your company greatly since cost
savings can be gained by allowing users at several locations to share in the
use of these facilities.

*************************************
ESN Analysis and Reporting Tool (ART)
*************************************

Electronic Switched Network (ESN) data can be displayed and sorted in
numerous ways with a single click on a column header. ESN data can be used to
define Coordinated Dialing Plans, Digit Manipulation, Free Calling Areas,
Network Service Class, Special Number Screening and much more. Limits, Time
of Day Schedules, Network Control and other data that is only defined once
for each customer is readily available and easy to modify if necessary.
The MAT ESN Analysis and Reporting Tool has the ability to convert Overlay
data to a form where it can be analyzed off-line in an easy-to-understand
spreadsheet format and then uploaded to the Meridian 1 at your convenience.
The ESN Analysis and Reporting Tool incorporates a full range of reporting
options. Custom reports can be generated for everything from basic data
information to a detailed customer-by-customer analysis. All reports can be
sent to the user's screen, printed using any network printer or saved in file
form. When all analysis and reporting has been completed, the data can be
reconverted to overlay form and transmitted to the Meridian 1.

**************************************
Meridian 1 Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN)
**************************************

The most advance networking technologies are found today within Nortel's
powerful integrated voice and data networks. An integral component of the
Meridian 1 product line, these powerful networks deliver proven solutions for
both simple and complex information and communication needs. ISDN is a global
networking strategy based on international standards. ISDN standards specify
two basic services: Primary Rate Interface (PRI) and Basic Rate Interface
(BRI). Both are made up of two different types of communication channels: "B"
channels, which carry user information such as voice, data, image, or video
at 64 Kbps, and the "D" channel, a separate channel that carries information
relating to the call setup, teardown, and feature activation. With the
implementation of ISDN on the Meridian 1, corporations have even more
powerful tools to substantially improve networking with even more flexibility
to integrate voice and data communications that best fit their organizational
needs. ISDN introduces powerful new features and services to further enhance
network performance to achieve even greater system flexibility.

such as your company's business hours and locations, special promotions,
schedule of events, advertisements, and much more. Each MIRAN card is
equipped with up to 10 recording channels. To accommodate varying traffic
requirements, MIRAN is available in three channel configurations-small,
medium and large-which can support up to 20, 36, or 40 concurrent calls
respectively. As traffic requirements increase, software-based keycodes can
activate additional channels to support the larger channel capacities. For
additional capacity, up to 16 MIRAN cards supporting up to 640 calls can be
linked together and managed from a single terminal. Unlike external third-
party recorded announcement systems, MIRAN eliminates the need and expense of
additional cabling, separate battery backup, and power supply equipment. As
an integrated solution, MIRAN provides simple plug-and-play installation
within a Meridian 1 Intelligent Peripheral Equipment (IPE) shelf, while
offering a variety of options for recording and managing multiple voice
announcements and music-on-hold selections.

requirements or added later to accommodate future growth. A variety of
networking solutions are available. Electronic Switched Network (ESN) allows
your company to create and control a flexible network for communication among
company locations and the public network. Integrated Services Digital Network
(ISDN) provides integrated voice and data capability and advanced network
applications for enhanced digital networks. And Nortel's Meridian 1 Remote
Services Portfolio offer products such as Fiber Remote, Fiber Remote Multi-
IPE, Carrier Remote, Mini Carrier Remote, Line-side T1 Interface, and Off-
Premise Station (OPS) Analog Line Card. Each remote solution is designed to
extend the value and power of the Meridian 1 to your entire organization and
to provide you with the best return on your investment.

**************************
Meridian 1 Remote Services
**************************

Whether your business is spread across a campus or multiple geographic
locations, the Meridian 1 Remote Services portfolio provides the optimal
solution to meet your remote communication needs. Besides using Meridian 1's
powerful ISDN capabilities to link multiple locations, you also have the
option to choose among a flexible range of remote service products. These
products include Fiber Remote, Fiber Remote Multi-IPE, Carrier Remote, Line-
Side T1 Interface, and Off-Premise Station (OPS) Analog Line Card. Each
remote solution is designed to extend the value and power of the Meridian 1
to your entire organization and to provide you with the best return on your
investment.

Single Switch Solutions
***********************
Fiber Remote, Fiber Remote Multi-IPE, Carrier Remote and our most recent
offering, Mini Carrier Remote, each offer a cost-effective, single switch
solution. With centralized operation, administration and maintenance, you can
significantly reduce operating costs. In addition, since a single Meridian 1
system is providing services for both local and remote users, all users take
advantage of the same features and services. Fiber Remote and Fiber Remote
Multi-IPE are the products of choice for a campus or high rise building
equipped with fiber. With either solution, you can extend an Intelligent
Peripheral Equipment (IPE) shelf to your remote facilities using dark fiber
cable pairs. Fiber Remote is ideally suited for smaller remote sites
requiring up to 256 ports while Fiber Remote Multi-IPE is more appropriate
for mid-range to larger remote sites. Both products deliver superior
reliability through optional redundant fiber links. The performance of these
links is constantly monitored, providing your remote locations with improved
survivability from fiber breaks and optical deterioration. If ever required,
switch-over and recovery are fully automatic. Both products are available in
two packaging options, a wall mounted cabinet configuration which offers a
reduced footprint that enables you to overcome space limitations, or floor
standing modules which can be stacked in a column up to four modules in
height. Both options allow you to easily add more lines as your organization
grows. To provide communication services to multiple geographic locations,
you can use Carrier Remote or Mini Carrier Remote to extend an IPE shelf to
remote facilities using standard T-1 circuits (Carrier Remote can also
support E1 circuits). Mini Carrier Remote is the industry's first remote to
provide survivability in the event of a link failure. It can support 1 or 2
T-1 links or fractional T-1 for even the smallest remote offices. Mini
Carrier Remote is the optimized choice for small remote sites (under 112
ports) or sites that require survivability. It is packaged in a wall-mounted
cabinet. Carrier Remote provides you with the flexibility to choose from 1 to
3 T-1 or E-1 circuits. In addition, you can provision one of those circuits
as a redundant link to provide increased reliability with a back-up
connection for your remote sites. Carrier Remote is available in wall-mounted
or floor-standing packaging options and is ideally suited for mid-range
remote sites up to 256 ports.

Off-Premise Extensions
**********************
Another alternative for providing communications to remote locations is the
Line-Side T-1 Interface. This new line card can be used to provide off-
premise extensions to remote locations. Analog telephone functionality is
extended over T-1 facilities and channel bank units, providing the telephone
at the remote site with full access to 2500-type line functionality.
The OPS Analog Line Card is another remote service that provides the ability
to extend features and services to 500/2500-type telephones located remotely
from the Meridian 1. This card interfaces with fax, key systems, Centrex, and
other external equipment requiring a standard analog line interface. It also
provides inherent lightning and power cross protection typically required for
off-premise locations or campus environments. If required, unused ports can
be configured as regular on-premise analog lines. With X11 Release 21 or
later, the Supervised Analog Lines (SAL) feature used with Line-side T-1
Interface and OPS Analog Line Card allows remote telephones to receive call
supervision, battery reversal supervision and disconnect supervision from the
Meridian 1. As you can see, the comprehensive Meridian 1 Remote Services
portfolio offers a variety of solutions to meet all your remote
communications needs.

Station Administration Module
*****************************
MAT Station Administration simplifies day-to-day station adds, moves and
changes to single and multi-line telephones. Station Administration enables
system administrators to configure telephone sets, program features and
assign Directory Numbers (DNs) and Terminal Numbers (TNs) for a single
telephone or groups of telephones. Station programming can be conveniently
accomplished via the PC, then uploaded to the Meridian 1 either immediately,
or at a scheduled date and time. MAT also automatically validates data input
prior to synchronization, providing relevant error code explanations in plain
English.

Telephone Graphics
******************
MAT provides a graphical representation of telephones supported by Meridian 1
so that the telephone can be viewed as it is being programmed. For added
convenience, features are applied directly to the keys on the telephone
graphic. Telephone models supported include:

     M2000 series telephones (M2006, M2008, M2616, M2216ACD, M2016S, M2317,
     M2009, M2112, M2018, M2018S) 
     M3000 Touchphone 
     M8000/9000 and Unity series analog telephones 
     QSU series (SL-1 telephones) 
     Standard 500/2500 telephones 

Telephone Templates
*******************
Creating telephone templates is the most efficient means to specify features
and key assignments to be applied to similar stations. For example, standard
templates for M2006 telephones can be created for lobby use, M2008 for staff
personnel, M2616 for secretarial or manager use, M2317 and M2216ACD for call
center agents.

Automatic DN and TN Assignment
******************************
To simplify the programming of multiple telephones, MAT can incrementally
assign DNs and TNs to each station. In addition, MAT keeps track of unused
DNs and TNs so that users can select from a list for efficient assignment.

Global Update (Universal or Selected)
*************************************
MAT allows users to apply changes to all stations, or to create filters to
allow the change(s) to occur only on selected telephones. 

Reporting Features
******************
MAT allows the user to create custom reports using MAT database information
which may include equipment inventory, hunt chains, etc. Custom reports can
also incorporate bitmap files (i.e., company logo) and special fonts. The
user also has the option of selecting from a list of pre-specified, commonly
used reports including:

     Automatic Call Distribution Stations, Class of Service, Dial Intercom
     Groups, Power Failure Phones, Message Centers, Private Line, Ringing
     Number Pickup Group, Speed Call Groups, System Speed Call Group,
     Telephone Directory by Department, Directory Number, Location, TN, and
     Name

***************************
MAT Traffic Analysis Module
***************************

MAT Traffic Analysis is designed to convert Meridian 1 raw traffic
statistics, either on demand or on a scheduled basis, and present the
statistics to you in an easy-to-read format. Traffic Analysis provides system
administrators with meaningful information related to Meridian 1 Trunk,
Attendant, Network Loop and CPU use. System administrators can use this
information to analyze Meridian 1 system resources, forecast growth and plan
for staffing requirements.

----> Editors note:
        
      As of this issue, we are going to have a special column 
      dedicated to the most interesting telecommunications information
      that we or other people have found whilst on the net. In this
      case, I was mearly browsing the net for network allocation and
      routing information, and stumbled accross this nice AT&T
      newsletter in html format, I've mearly copied and pasted the
      information into text format, and cleaned it up for all to read,
      This information on 4ESS networks is a primer for the next issue
      where I will produce an article explaining the entire ESS network.
      When people think of ESS, the first thing that usually comes to
      mind is 5ESS. Alot of people are fooled by the fact that 5ESS is
      the backbone of the USphone-network, this is not the case. AT&T
      employ 4ESS switches as inteligent international routing mechanisms,
      accross the majour PSTN backbone. If you made a call from NY to
      San-Fran-Sisco, that chances are your call would route via at least
      2 4ESS switches along the way. I hope you enjoy this new f41th
      column, please send any sugestions to me (th0rn@coldmail.com) werd.

The AT&T Worldwide Intelligent Network.
4ESS Switching Networks.
***************************************

Introduction

The AT&T Worldwide Intelligent Network is the largest, most sophisticated
communications network in the world. Using cutting-edge fiber-optic
lightguide technology, state-of-the-art satellite systems, and digital
microwave radio relay, the AT&T network provides long-distance service to
every community in the United States, as well as to virtually every country
and territory worldwide.

Size And Scope

The AT&T network is second to none when it comes to call-handling capacity,
global reach, and network reliability. During 1997, AT&T set an all-time
record by handling nearly 76.3 billion calls, a 12.2 percent increase from
the previous year. On an average business day, more than 250 million voice,
data and video calls travel the network. On peak days, as many as 290 million
calls are handled by AT&T. Traditionally, the busiest day of the year is
Monday after the long Thanksgiving weekend; however, Mondays during June,
July, and August also generate extremely heavy traffic.

The network is 100 percent digital for all switched traffic and currently
includes nearly 3 billion circuit miles of transmission facilities. The
domestic network uses 136 high-capacity 4ESS* switches to automatically route
calls to their destinations. Within the continental United States, the AT&T
network includes nearly 41,000 route miles of fiber-optic cable, and 97
percent of all domestic traffic travels via this lightguide technology. 

Network Management

On an average business day, the AT&T network handles more than 250 million
calls, and 100 percent of these are monitored for call completion. Network
managers know exactly how many calls did not go through the first time they
were dialed, and these managers carefully study computer-generated data to
identify patterns and initiate the appropriate corrective action. 

AT&T has three network management centers that are staffed 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. The Network Operations Center in Bedminster, New Jersey,
has primary responsibility for the bulk movement of calls across the AT&T
network, as well as the flow of calls to and from some 250 countries and
territories worldwide. The Network Management Centers in Conyers, Georgia,
and Denver, Colorado, manage calls AT&T is handing off to the Local Exchange
Companies and calls those companies are delivering to the AT&T network. 

Network managers at all three locations have computer-generated data
displayed on large wall screens in front of them, as well as on their
computer monitors. Most of this information is updated every five minutes;
however, some screens refresh at 30-second intervals. This allows critical
network management decisions to be based on current data, not information
that might be 30 to 60 minutes old. Network managers can initiate controls
directly from their computer consoles to manage the flow of calls and can
also implement special procedures for dealing with disasters such as
earthquakes, floods or hurricanes. 

The AT&T network is designed and engineered to be self-regulating. This
concept allows the network to monitor itself and to handle routine situations
on its own. Network managers step in and apply their skills, knowledge, and
experience to handle problems beyond the scope of the network's automated
systems. Two primary management techniques are employed: 

Management By Exception 

Specific thresholds have been established within the software support systems
that manage and control the network. Icons and colored lines appearing on the
large wall screens automatically alert managers to situations that may
require special handling. 

Proactive Management 

Network and Computing Services uses an aggressive, proactive management style
to ensure the maximum number of calls possible are completed on the first
attempt. Rather than waiting to react after something happens, managers plan
ahead for activities or events that might impact the smooth flow of traffic
across the network. Various tools are used to achieve this objective. 

CNN, the 24-hour-a-day Cable News Network, is monitored by network managers
because breaking news and weather-related events have a direct impact on
long-distance calling. Network traffic patterns and calling levels change
dramatically following reports of an earthquake in California, a hurricane in
Florida, a bomb blast in Oklahoma, or a terrorist attack in the Middle East.
By monitoring the news closely, network managers can initiate the appropriate
procedures to ensure long-distance calls continue to flow smoothly across the
nation and around the world. Mass calling events, such as ticket sales for a
concert tour or a sporting event, or perhaps a national radio or television
call-in program, can focus extremely high traffic on a specific switch or
trunk group for a relatively short period of time. These activities are
closely monitored and appropriate managementprocedures are initiated to
ensure no negative impact on network performance. All major installation or
maintenance projects involving network equipment areclosely monitored to keep
potential problems invisible to callers. 

Network Reliability

For more than 100 years, AT&T has set the industry standard for network
reliability. Providing world-class network service involves five primary
disciplines, architecture planning, technology selection, technology
implementation, documentation and training, and the development and
implementation of cutting-edge operational support systems. Network and
Computing Services has developed each of these disciplines to a science and
an art form, thus business customers and consumers alike depend upon AT&T for
reliable communications, anytime, anywhere. 

The primary objective of Network and Computing Services is to complete the
maximum number of calls possible on the first attempt, and the team's record
is impressive. Perhaps the best way to judge network reliability is Defects
Per Million, a measure that reports how many calls per million did not
complete on the first attempt, due to a network failure. By way of
explanation, a network failure is any time a call does not go through because
of a hardware, software, or procedural error.

Hardware errors are equipment problems, such as a power failure, equipment
damaged by a hurricane or tornado, or perhaps a section of fiber-optic cable
torn from the ground by a contractor's backhoe. [At AT&T, backhoes are often
referred to as unauthorized cable locators. A software error involves
problems with the software that runs the network's complex signaling,
switching and transmission equipment, while a procedural problem generally
involves human error.

The Defects Per Million score recorded by AT&T for 1997 was a remarkable 173,
which means that of every one million calls dialed last year, only 173 failed
to go through the first time due to a network failure. That equals a network
reliability factor of 99.98 percent for the calendar year. 

Network Architecture

Managing the AT&T network involves three primary functions, switching,
transmission, and signaling. Switching utilizes a series of highly
sophisticated computers to automatically route calls from one point to
another, while transmission involves the transport facilities or pipes that
actually carry the calls. Meanwhile, signaling controls the flow of calls
across the network and supports special network services, such as toll-free
calling and customized call routing for large business customers.

Network Switching

Calls traveling the AT&T network are automatically routed to their
destination by 4ESS switching machines. First introduced in 1976, these
switches are constantly being upgraded and enhanced and are still considered
state-of-the-art when it comes to high-capacity call handling. The network
currently has 136 4ESS switches, strategically located across the country. 

The 4ESS switch is a complex computer, and the heart of the unit is its
processor. To ensure network reliability, each 4ESS switch is equipped with
dual processors, the second processor being a mirror image of the first.
This second processor is always in stand-by mode, ready to handle calls if
the first processor fails. Key components of the switch itself and the
processors are also equipped with back-up circuit packs that automatically
take over if the primary circuit packs fail. By way of comparison, this would
be like having a second engine in your car, connected to the transmission and
ready to go, just in case the first engine failed. 

The 4ESS switches are constantly being enhanced and upgraded to ensure
network reliability. In April 1995, the Network and Computing Services team
completed a 13-month project that replaced the 1A processors in all 4ESS
switches with the new 1B processor. This upgrade more than doubled the
switching capacity of each machine, increasing it from 500,000 busy-hour
calls to approximately 1.2 million calls per hour. 

When it comes to judging switching or call-routing efficiency, one of the
primary measures is call set-up time, which is the period between dialing the
last number and the distance telephone ringing. On the AT&T domestic network,
call set-up time for a standard, point-to-point call averages less than two
seconds, while call set-up time for a credit-card, toll-free, or "900" call
is approximately one-half second longer. And that is generally considered
among the best in the industry.

Network Transmission

AT&T has three primary methods of transporting calls, fiber-optic cable,
microwave radio relay, and satellite communications. In the past, microwave
played the dominant role in the industry, and it was not uncommon to see
giant microwave radio relay towers dotting the landscape at 40-mile
intervals.

Today, fiber-optic or lightguide technology is AT&T's primary means of
transmission, and approximately 97 percent of all domestic traffic now
travels via fiber-optic cable. AT&T has nearly 41,000 route miles of
fiber-optic cable buried in the continental United States, representing the
largest fiber-optic network in the industry. This cable is generally buried
several feet underground and thus is not subject to damage from severe
weather conditions on the surface.

In 1995, AT&T first introduced Synchronous Optical Network or SONET
technology to the network. This innovation increases network transmission
capacity and improves service restoration following a fiber-optic cable
failure on the core network. Although SONET is generally installed in an
interconnecting ring configuration, where a single ring might cover several
states, some point-to-point systems are being deployed to provide additional
transmission capacity.

Today the company is engaged in an aggressive SONET build-out program that
does not require the installation of thousands of miles of new fiber-optic
cable. AT&T already has a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network in the ground,
thus only a limited amount of additional fiber is needed to complete
nationwide SONET deployment. AT&T had 30 SONET rings operational by the end
of 1997, and 22 more are being added this year. Coast-to-coast SONET
connectivity was achieved prior to the end of 1997, and by the end of this
year, nationwide deployment will be completed with 50-52 rings in service. 

One of the primary benefits of SONET technology is the increase in
transmission capacity it offers through Dense Wave Division Multiplexing,
more commonly known in the industry as DWDM. A typical fiber-optic cable
contains 32 or 48 fiber strands, which equals 16 or 24 fiber pairs. In the
past, a fiber pair carried up to 48,000 simultaneous calls; however, DWDM
allows multiple wave-lengths or colors of light to travel a fiber pair,
significantly increasing its transmission capacity. AT&T is now deploying
eight-wavelength DWDM systems and plans to have 16-wavelength systems in
service later this year. During the fourth quarter, plans call for AT&T to
begin certification testing of an 80-wavelength system. 

In addition to significantly increasing network transmission capacity, AT&T's
cutting-edge SONET system also provides sub-second restoration following a
fiber-optic cable failure on the core network. By way of example, if traffic
is moving in a counter-clockwise direction on the ring when a fiber-optic
cable failure occurs, SONET technology instantly reverses the flow and the
traffic then moves in a clockwise direction. This reversal takes
approximately 60 milliseconds and calls in progress are not interrupted. 

Although the vast majority of AT&T's domestic traffic travels fiber-optic
cable, approximately 3 percent is transmitted via microwave radio relay.
Satellite circuits are currently used for global communications and special
service applications, but not for domestic traffic. 

Network Signaling

One of AT&T's unique contributions to telecommunications has been the
extensive development and use of out-of-band signaling. In the past,
customers often heard control tones in the back-ground as their call was
routed to its destination. Today, a separate network is used to carry
information about a call, such as its destination and whether or not it needs
special handling by the network.

This out-of-band signaling is the foundation for AT&T's rapid call set-up
time and for enhanced, intelligent services, such as toll-free service,
MULTIQUEST 900 service, or Software Defined Network [SDN] service. The
signaling network can also access data bases of customer instructions and
information to provide special services, such as routing incoming calls to
different locations at different times of the day or week.

Real Time Network Routing

In 1992, AT&T introduced Real Time Network Routing [RTNR], a patented, highly
sophisticated system that ensures nearly every call is completed on the first
attempt. Unlike other long-distance companies that only offer a handful of
routes for completing a call, the AT&T network provides 134 possible routes
for every call.

Every 4ESS switch in the network knows the current status of every other
switch at all times. Under normal circumstances, a call from Boston to Los
Angeles would be routed directly from Massachusetts to Southern California.
However, if the direct path is experiencing high volume or some other unique
condition, RTNR instantly routes that call, via another switch, perhaps in
Atlanta, Dallas, or Seattle. In all, the network has 134 possible routes for
getting that call from Boston to Los Angeles.

First thing Monday morning, circuits along the East Coast are busy, as men
and women from Maine to Florida launch another work week. As network traffic
along the East Coast begins to build, RTNR might route a call from New York
City to Miami through Denver, to spread traffic across the network and to
keep calls flowing smoothly. Even though the call travels west to Colorado,
then back to Florida, the speed of the network is such that the telephone in
Miami still rings in less than two seconds.

Most calls traveling the AT&T network use two 4ESS switches, an originating
and a terminating switch. When necessary, RTNR uses a third switch, a via
switch, to complete a call. An example would be New York City-to-Miami-via-
Denver. To ensure split-second call set-up time and excellent call quality,
the network never uses more than three 4ESS switches to complete a call. 

Emergency Restoration

In addition to RTNR, the AT&T network also uses the FASTAR« system to ensure
network reliability. First introduced six years ago, the FASTAR system
instantly identifies fiber-optic cable failures on the core network and
automatically begins rerouting circuits via spare capacity. Frequently, the
FASTAR system restores 90 to 95 percent of the disrupted circuits within two
to three minutes, before the vast majority of customers even know there is a
problem.

Friday, April 18, 1997, offered an excellent demonstration of FASTAR
technology at work. At 10:40 AM [EDT], a fiber-optic cable cut in Louisiana
interrupted service on approximately 205,000 circuits. The FASTAR system
instantly located the failure, identified spare capacity elsewhere on the
network, and restored 98.3 percent of the circuits in less than ten minutes.
A mere 40 minutes later, a contractor working in Chicago severed a fiber-
optic cable, knocking nearly 95,000 circuits out of service. The FASTAR
system restored 100 percent of those circuits in less than 60 seconds.

Disaster Recovery Service

Following a major disaster, the restoration of communication is a top
priority. The AT&T Network Disaster Recovery program is unique because it is
the only one of its kind in the industry. A team of highly trained
technicians and a fleet of giant tractor-trailer trucks are strategically
located across the country, ready to respond when disaster strikes. 

Team members are on-call 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, and they and
their equipment can be en route to an emergency incident within two hours of
an official call-out. Specially designed tractor-trailer rigs, equipped with
highly sophisticated equipment, are warehoused in several locations across
the country. This equipment generally travels by road, but in an extreme
emergency, the trailers can be shipped by air or rail. 

The primary role of the Network Disaster Recovery Team is to restore access
to the AT&T network following a major emergency. If an AT&T switching center
has been heavily damaged or destroyed, the service provided by that facility
can be restored within a matter of days, rather weeks or months. The team is
also equipped to restore long-distance service by erecting a temporary
microwave tower, installing a temporary satellite earth station, or
establishing temporary calling centers that allow customers direct access to
the AT&T network.

Since its creation in 1991, the AT&T Disaster Recovery Team has responded to
many major incidents. A few examples are Hurricane Andrew in 1992, severe
Midwest flooding in 1993, the Northridge, California, earthquake in 1994, a
major mud slide and tornado in Kentucky in 1994, a tornado in Texas in 1995,
Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, and massive flooding in North Dakota in 1997. 

The Global Network

The AT&T Worldwide Intelligent Network provides long-distance service to
every country and territory in the world. If there is a telephone system on
the other end, AT&T can deliver a call to it. Of the 250 countries and
territories served, direct-dial service is provided to more than 240 of them,
which means the vast majority of overseas calls no longer require an
international operator.

For operational purposes, international network managers divide the world
into five geographic regions, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America,
and the Middle East. All calls to or from these regions flow through one of
AT&T's 16 international gateway switches, strategically located in
California, Georgia, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, or Texas. 

As a member of the North American Numbering Plan, Canada can be accessed by
dialing an area code, plus a seven-digit number. Long-distance calls to and
from Canada are handled by special switching centers in Massachusetts,
Michigan, New York, and Washington. 

In addition to handling standard inbound and outbound calls, the AT&T global
network also carries transit traffic that neither originates nor terminates
in the United States. An example would be a call from Australia to the United
Kingdom that is routed through the AT&T network, because all direct circuits
between the two countries are busy. 

Transit traffic is a common practice on the international scene, as one
country will often route calls through a third nation if all direct circuits
to the destination are busy. In some cases, open reroute agreements exist and
overflow traffic is automatically routed through the third country. In other
cases, there are no automatic agreements and AT&T network managers must
contact their counterparts at the distant end before initiating transit
traffic. And finally, some countries only allow automatic rerouting during
emergency conditions. 

At the international level, as well as on the domestic scene, AT&T's primary
objective is to complete as many calls as possible on the first attempt.
Network managers work closely with their partners around the world to
maintain a smooth flow of traffic on the global network. 

When it comes to global communications, AT&T supports the philosophy of open
standards, which translates into a universally accepted set of technical
standards designed to allow all telecommunications and information-management
systems to interconnect. 

In Conclusion

For more than 100 years, AT&T has set the industry standard for innovation
and network reliability, and that status will remain unchanged for many, many
years to come. The AT&T network provides world-class switching and
transmission service, using state-of-the-art technology. On an average
business day, more than 250 million voice, data and video calls travel the
AT&T network, and 99.98 percent of those calls are delivered on the first
attempt. That is what network reliability is all about fast, efficient
communications, anytime, anywhere.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------


After much research I have concluded that the international phone network
WILL erode at the time of the new millenium. It is of up-most importance that
every global title translation database is upgraded to y2k compatable
software. Although the millenium 'bug' paradox is somewhat un-reliable in
terms of hardcore fact, the risk in leaving switches in their present
condition would be SHEER STUPIDITY. Because each international and local
gateway communicate with each other via the means of checksum and data, if
even one 4ESS or similar gate deteriated, the entire network would be
affected. This is not a time-bomb scenario, this is happening NOW. Although
the telco's will not admit it, I garantee that local switches all over the
world are failing, if not from the y2k scenariio, but from over routing, and
busy circuits. I have conducted many experiments concerning incoming trunks,
and found that MANY switches serving local areas are incapable of handeling
the amplitude of network traffic which will occur on y2k. For example, 6
remote modems where set to dial to and from each other sucesivly through a
local area switch, ie: 3 dialed, 3 picked up. The experiment lasted for 12
hours, during that time, the DMS switch involved dramticly deteriated after
only 5 hours.. trunks where held open for more than 2 minutes a time, causing
busy and fault network announcments, and after 10 hours only 1 out of every
3 calls made via the same switch routed succesivly. AT&T claim that when the
network becomes busy or saturated such as this experiment, additional
switches are deployed for the remaining wait of network traffic. The modems
where dialing similataniously (3 at a time) making 36 calls a minute. The
backup switch involved was obviously inferior to the switch we where testing,
a dramatic drop in call succesfullness occured when the backup device was
implemented. Now imagine how many calls a minute are going to be made on the
dawn of the millenuim?, not many I imagine you think, wrong: I ABSOLUTLY,
100% gaurantee that the US phone network and surrounding pstn's will be
almost completly busy'd out at the peak calling time, which I estimate as
being a 30 hour period over the time zones. The consecuences of such a
network outage would be colosal, I will not even begin to describe the amount
of financial damage that will occur.


ADVICE:
------

*       Every bgackbone US ESS switch should be backed up with addtional
        or neigbouring mechanisms.

*       All routing software at intralata exchanges should be programed to
        route via the least used switch, rather than the closest. This way
        network traffic will be distrobuted evenly accross the network.

*       International calls should be treated with higher priority than local
        area calls, and routed via designated switches and trunks.

*       Every local/central routing mechanism should be upgraded for capacity
        and then tested.

*       The main problem will be the global title translation unit databases.
        These should be tested with the most exreame conditions until they
        can withhold the massive incoming global translation requests from
        routers.


CONCLUSION:
-----------

This is a very general warning, but believe me, network outage WILL occur if
the above advice is not looked into. I'm not a 'qualified' telecommunications
engineer/developer, I wish I was, but I can see what is going to happen, and
believe me, the telcos will be sorry if they don't act in accordance now.
Thankyou for taking the time to read this advisory.

             This article will not be very informative other than
             explaining how to get Free 3-way calling. The only
             reason I am writing this is because I feel as though
             not many people know this information and I feel like
             more should know about it. So here it is. Enjoy!

---(OOooOO)-------------------------------------------------------------(OOo-

Here is a list of the things you will need:

1. Phone (of course)
2. 3 modular jacks
3. 2-Line Splitter Adapter 
4. 2 Phone Lines (at least)

---(OOooOO)-------------------------------------------------------------(OOo-

To get the 2-Line Splitter simply go to the nearest Radio Shack and look 
on the wall. It should be hanging there. It is simply a little plug with
3 phone cord hookups instead of one. Easy to spot. It should cost about
$7.00, yeah, nothing is free but $7.00 for everlasting 3-way is pretty
cheap. Anyway buy the adapter. Then come home and go the the modular jack.
Plug the adapter in. Then get one of the phone cords and plug it into the
2nd plug (should be labeled L2) then simply hook the phone you want to talk
into into the plug labeled L1+L2. Then can call someone. Here is where the
second phone line comes in, plug the 3rd modular jack into the other line 
then plug it into the plug labeled L1. You will get an additional dialtone.
w00-h00. Then call. Simply when you are done unplug the L1. When ya want to
make a 3-way call plug IN the L1. Pretty simple eh? Where there it is Enjoy!

---(OOooOO)-------------------------------------------------------------(OOo-

Yes it was very short but to the point. Doesn't take much to explain this
little trick so there it is. Enjoy and call as many people as ya want :o)

--> The Nokia 216O ]----------------------------[ by Kryptis ]---------------
--> testmode       ]---------------------------------------------------------


Nokia 2160 test mode and overall cloning for all Nokias. Well I just found
out how to go into to test mode from my local sysop and found how to clone
with a file I found a while back.To clone a Nokia you must know the system ID
also known as a SID which is a 5 digit code mine in Florida is like 00037 for
the ATT wireless South Florida just knowing that and the range they are in
will let you own and number in the circuit even if there is no phone
programmed to it for example I dialed 954-646-2961 and it was out then I
programmed it into my phone and boom I had it and people could call me isn't
this nice. SO to program it just press *#639# then enter the 10 digit number
eg 954-646-2961 and it will work just make sure the cellulars are in the
646-XXXX range and this will only work for the cellular carriers SID and area
for example mine is 00037 which works for 954-646-2965 but say 954-677-2961
belongs to Motorola Cellular Inc it will not work. So after entering the NAM
put in the SID which you can get from your local supplier but you really need
to have one to get it from them they will not tell you if you are not a
customer. Or you can find a SID from #cellular on different IRC servers or
email whatever you choose. I did this on a 2160 but don't know if it works
for any other models you can try not consequences press *3001#12345 and it
should bring you to the test field Sorry for the Bad grammar but hey who
cares this was brought to you by
