Interview with Curador

Well to tell you the truth, I was idleing online and found Curador !!! I
propositioned him for an article, and he said Yes!  Well i had to do these
questions in 4 mins flat, so excuse the not so in depth and generally shit
questions.

I only had like 22 minutes and 17 seconds left of being online before I 
timed out...

Q) So who are you and what do you do?

A) I am an umeployed programmer, I write software,web pages and have designed
   a few e-commerce sites.

Q) What were your motives behind the hacks?

A) I wanted to show that a guy armed with a two year old exploit and a program 
   written in a few hours(designed to find potentially vulnerable sites) could
   get quite a large amount of cc numbers with very little effort.

Q) Did you mean to cause so much damage to credit cards?

A) Definatly not, I only posted some of the cc# online because I needed to
   prove I had got them. If a unknown guy setups a website with links to 8
   sites he claims to have got cc# from people are most likely going to either
   not believe him or think it is just some kind of hoax. I think cc type
   systems are good but need to be far more secure.

Q) What was going through your mind afterwards?

A) Not alot at the time I started the 'campaign' i was working part time for a 
   local company so all that went through my mind was work.

Q) How long did it take to trace you?

A) 6-7 Weeks I think, they were helped extensivly by Chris @ hexedit.com 
   without his help they probably would have not found me at all at least it
   would have taken alot more time.

Q) Is it a still ongoing investigation?

A) Yes.

Q) What were the FBI like?

A) I dont really know, The only thing I saw of the FBI was a unshaven man 
   called "Edd" who was wearing a grey trench coat! and to begin with I was
   told he was with the Welsh police! despite his american ascent!

Q) What are your future projects, if any?

A) nothing illigal.

Q) Do you think there will be copy cats?

A) maybe, who can say.

Q) What did you think of all this media attention?

A) It is quite fun, but mainly a pain, hopefuly the more in-depth articles &
   tv coverage will actually change the way people think about security but I
   doubt it. It takes alot to change people.

Q) Have you had any other interviews?

A) Yes, but mainly before people knew who Curador actually was. i.e. before
   my arrest.

Q) Will you be doing others?

A) Not if I can help it, it depends on who ask's and wether the press in that
   part of the world have flogged it to death already=)

Q) When did u first visit the underground scene?

A) When I was 12 or 13 I think, hard to remember. I am 18 now so that was
   about 5 years ago.

Q) Where do you think the UK scene is going?

A) It is hard to say, the UK has a small population compared to places like
   the USA. but I know we have alot of good hackers/crackers/phreaks. As to
   where it will go I dont think any one could answer that!

Q) what actual exploit was used in your "crack"?

A) IIS RDS

Q) What do you think is the most secure O/S on the market?

A) Slackware Linux when properly configured.

Q) How come no-one has ever heard of you before?

A) I change my nick alot.

Q) Did you really have Bill Gate's CC?

A) No. I said on my site i might and gave it out but it was obviously invalid 
   but the tabloids as I expected decided it was real, so it served to
   advertise my site. the more exposure the better because I was taking a
   great risk for no profit.

Q) Have u still got it?

A) N/A

Q) What do you think the credit/debt ratings are like?

A) N/A

Q) What do you think of web site defacing?

A) LAME! CHILDISH! STUPID!

Q) Is there anything you would like to say?

A) http://www.attrition.org/mirror/curador
   Also I would like to quote this guy from #2600-uk on efnet *chuckle*
   This is what he said when I told him I was english & lived in Wales.

   &lt;Cold-Fire> Those english people, they move in here, buying up our
   cottages, and hacking our e-comerce sites, next thing they're using our
   credit cards!!

Q) Any hellos?

A) Greets to [MRX] , Cold-Fire , push , Webby , HeXeDit =)

Q) Any plugs?

A) http://www.slashdot.org

Q) Was this a good interview that i put together in 4 mins flat?

A) Quite good for 4 mins. but some questions were vague.
