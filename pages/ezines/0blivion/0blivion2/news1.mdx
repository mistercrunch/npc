&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-017.asp>  - When

single DOS device name in the path. If one is found, the path is correctly

98 check for multiple DOS device names. This is the source of the
vulnerability. If a read or write operation is attempted to a path whose
name contains multiple DOS device names, it will cause Windows 95 and 98 to
attempt to access invalid resources. In some cases, the effect of this
invalid access would be to cause the application that supplied the path to
hang, but the more likely effect is that the machine would present a blue
debug screen and crash
