Virtual Private Networks (VPN) Overview


The Internet has become a popular, low-cost backbone infrastructure. Its
universal reach has led many companies to consider constructing a secure
virtual private network (VPN) over the public Internet. The challenge in
designing a VPN for today's global business environment will be to exploit the
public Internet backbone for both intra-company and inter-company
communication while still providing the security of the traditional private,
self-administered corporate network. In this chapter, we begin by defining a
virtual private network (VPN) and explaining the benefits that customers can
achieve from its implementation.

- VPN Introduction and Benefits

With the explosive growth of the Internet, companies are beginning to ask:
"How can we best exploit the Internet for our business?". Initially, companies
were using the Internet to promote their company's image, products, and
services by providing World Wide Web access to corporate Web sites. Today,
however, the Internet potential is limitless, and the focus has shifted to
e-business, using the global reach of the Internet for easy access to key
business applications and data that reside in traditional I/T systems.
Companies can now securely and cost-effectively extend the reach of their
applications and data across the world through the implementation of secure
virtual private network (VPN) solutions.

A virtual private network (VPN) is an extension of an enterprise's private
intranet across a public network such as the Internet, creating a secure
private connection, essentially through a private  tunnel. VPNs securely
convey information across the Internet connecting remote users, branch
offices, and business partners into an extended corporate network. Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) offer cost-effective access to the Internet (via
direct lines or local telephone numbers), enabling companies to eliminate
their current, expensive leased lines, long-distance calls, and toll-free
telephone numbers.

A 1997 VPN Research Report, by Infonetics Research, Inc., estimates savings
from 20% to 47% of wide area network (WAN) costs by replacing leased lines to
remote sites with VPNs. And, for remote access VPNs, savings can be 60% to 80%
of corporate remote access dial-up costs. Additionally, Internet access is
available worldwide where other connectivity alternatives may not be
available.

The technology to implement these virtual private networks, however, is just
becoming standardized. Some networking vendors today are offering
non-standards-based VPN solutions that make it difficult for a company to
incorporate all its employees and/or business partners/suppliers into an
extended corporate network. However, VPN solutions based on Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards will provide support for the full
range of VPN scenarios with more interoperability and expansion capabilities.

The key to maximizing the value of a VPN is the ability for companies to
evolve their VPNs as their business needs change and to easily upgrade to
future TCP/IP technology. Vendors who support a broad range of hardware and
software VPN products provide the flexibility to meet these requirements. VPN
solutions today run mainly in the IPv4 environment, but it is important that
they have the capability of being upgraded to IPv6 to remain interoperable
with your business partner's and/or supplier's VPN solutions. Perhaps equally
critical is the ability to work with a vendor who understands the issues of
deploying a VPN. The implementation of a successful VPN involves more than
technology. The vendor's networking experience plays heavily into this
equation.

This was written in a week, while being absolutly hammered on Stella.
Unfortunatly, this text relied heavily on research so and books.
Im not really into VPN's, But i have once created one, was not amazing... But, it was one.

Slider has just told me that he may be continuing this discussion in next
months Oblivion mag with a continuation of this article!! <- Cyber0ptix
