Re.

We started Oblivion, thinking it will be a one issue spin off, that 
absolutley no-one would read.

How wrong we were...

Over 1/2 year we have been going and even channels such as #japan (Big Shoutz)
have heard of us.  I cant join a channel now without being asked if i help
write Oblivion.  

Also, you may not have seen much of us this month, this is due to both of us
starting new jobs, and having other commitments.  I have only spoken to
Cyber once the whole month! and this was for 10 minutes when i was drunk and
i was just going out clubbing...

Big shoutz to abattis and gossi, who are going to host 0blivion.org while caffeine
is down. Big thanks to vortex who has hosted us previously.  Also you may have noticed
we have made it onto packetstorm.securify.com, big thanks to them... and to kermit who
uploaded it!

Hello to lockdown who has been eye-dal with his cyber cafe. Hopefully when he has it
up and running we will advertise for him and him for us :]  Big up to atomix and
spammy with there bots for the chan, but these have gone down and once again we are
being taken over, but now we are just leaving detached IRC sessions in the chan, if
anyone has a spare bot or a bot net that they wouldnt mind sticking in the channel to
help us keep it then we would be greatful.

As you can see peeps are now sending in articles to us, and we are enternally
thankful to them, because we need all the help we can get.  This is because
we cant do it all ourselves. Please will you continue sending them in, we 
appreciate points of view and of course your articles. This way you can get 
your work published to a wider audience.  Also, if you are thinking of writing 
a article yourself then also contact us, we will help you as much as possible to 
write it.  

We are here to promote learning and sharing of information like the 
Internet community should be, all we ask is that you publish the document or 
text in Oblivion mag first, then distribute it to other mags if you wish.  

This gives us peace of mind knowing that we got something good out of it!

As always i rant on about people sending in points of view and such, this is
because Oblivion is written for you. And without you we would not be here
funnyily enough...!

So come and vist us in #Oblivionmag on EFNet.

Many thanks to you all!

Slider.

Well what a month it has been, working too hard and not had time to do much
with 0blivion.  Well luckily slider came to the rescue and put the issue
together, cheers mate ;o)

Well as you may have noticed the site is currently down, Vortex who hosted
the site on caffeine.org.uk has litterly lost the box and doesn't know where
it is ;o)  Now thats some good admin skills for ya ;o)

Oh well we should be hosted on lab6.com in the very near future, we just need
to get the hosting set up and upload the site again, cheers to slider for
rescusing the site from a cached version, gonna have to keep a backup this
time ;o)

Well news just in this second, just been in touch with Gossi and he has set
up 0blivion.org on lab6, cheers mate ;o)  The site will be uploaded and
available as soon as possible.

Well thats all I got to say this month as this desperately needs uploading
and distributing, then I've got the site to sort out ;o) and I'm at work!!!

Anyways thanks to everyone who has helped 0blivion grow over the last 7
months, I cant believe how big it has got from the time I first thought about
releasing a zine.  Cheers everyone, beers are on me ;o)

Hopefully next month with see a lot more input from myself and we'll try to
make the issue bigger and better.

catch ya'll later - Cyber0ptix

**********************************************
Voice over IP - Omega
**********************************************

Today we already have Voice over IP technology. As this technology matures we
are almost certain to see a sharing of bandwidth between voice and data across
the Internet. This raises some interesting questions for phone companies. The
cost to a user of an Internet connection between New York and Japan is the same
as a connection within New York - not so a phone connection. This, and the fact
that the Internet is deregulated, will raise many interesting questions in the 
years to come.

The possibility of running voice over IP networks is extremely attractive because IP
technology is very low in cost and also that *bandwidth is free* on the Internet.
This can reduce dramatically the costs for long distance phone calls. If the Internet
can be used successfully for voice, then a range of interesting applications become
possible.  The disadvantage of these applications is, that they all
use their own protocols and compression algorithms to transport the voice over IP
networks. Therefore, most of today's Internet telephone programs are incompatible
to each other. Additionally, a PC or a workstation is required to run the voice
software.

To provide Voice over IP, or better yet Voice over Internet, to a larger group of
people, it is necessary to define a standard for the protocols and the voice
compression algorithms. Furthermore, constitutions are required to use a normal
phone for Voice over IP connections instead of a computer.

A standard that realizes this feature is currently being developed by the Voice over
IP Forum which consists of members from different telecommunications companies.
The VoIP forum operates as a working group in the International Multimedia
Teleconferencing Consortium. They have published the  VoIP Forum Service
Interoperability Implementation Agreement (the VoIP IA), which seeks to complete,
and extend existing standards into a specification to provide a complete Internet
telephony interoperability protocol. The VoIP forum came into being to define a
framework within which existing standards could be used in a way that enabled
equipment made by different manufacturers to interoperate. The VoIP IA includes
specifications for Internet telephony client software and the gateways to the public
telephone network.

The basic standard recommended by the VoIP Forum is the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard H.323. It is a standard for multimedia
communication over packet networks that references many other standards
including definitions for the transport of voice, data and video as well as
establishing standards for audio and video compression and decompression. The
Forum Interoperability Implementation Agreement is:

1. A clarification (and interpretation) of the H.323 series of recommendations.
2. A specification as to how H.323 should be used.
3. An extension of H.323 to cover areas (such as Directory Services) that are
   absent from the standard.

The key elements of the VoIP IA are:

1. H.323 is used for call establishment and capability negotiation.
2. Call signaling between service elements is performed using ITU-T
   recommendation Q.931 (part of H.323). Each service element provides the
   necessary conversion from its local endpoint signaling to the H.323/Q.931
   backbone protocol.
3. Other telephony specific requirements such as the transfer and reproduction of
   DTMF data have been added to provide a high level of connectivity with the
   traditional telephone infrastructure.
4. Directory services are not covered in the base H.323 recommendation. The
   VoIP IA defines dynamic IP address resolution mechanisms via H.323 RAS.

The main goal of the VoIP IA is to help ensure interoperability between equipment
from different vendors. In order to achieve this, the VoIP Forum has specified strict
conformance requirements. Currently, the VoIP IA includes support for two-party
voice and similar audio communications over IP networks in a manner similar and
compatible (via gateways) with existing  Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
telephone calls. However, it is expected that the IA will be extended to include
multipoint communications in the future. Such multipoint function would be added
in such a way that conforming networks were backward-compatible with the existing
VoIP IA. Compatibility with existing (non-IP) multipoint circuit mode conferencing
standards is also considered highly desirable.

Whenever possible the VoIP IA uses existing IETF and ITU-T protocols and
services. Interworking between the VoIP connections and the PSTN is provided
through the use of H.323 gateways.

- ITU-T Recommendation H.323

H.323 is an ITU-T standard for multimedia videoconferencing on packet-switched
networks. Its formal title is  Visual Telephone Systems and Equipment for Local
Area Networks Which Provide a Non-Guaranteed Quality of Service. Since voice is
one part of multimedia the standard covers most of the things you have to do to
handle voice in:

  * LANs
  * Corporate intranets
  * The Internet

H.323 has been developed very rapidly, much more rapidly than has been
customary in the past. Work commenced in the ITU-T in May 1995 and was
completed by June of 1996. In January 1998, Version 2 of H.323 with added
function will be under development.

The components of an H.323 network are:

  * Terminals
  * Gateways
  * Gatekeepers
  * Multipoint Control Units (MCUs). An MCU consists of a Multipoint Controller
    (MC) and a Multipoint Processor (MP)

The diagram below shows a possible VoIP configuration realized using the
H.323 standard. The IP network is connected to public telephone networks through
an H.323 to PSTN gateway. Therefore, users of the IP network that have an H.323
terminal (PC with LAN or modem access) can communicate with standard phones
in a PSTN. Also two users of standard telephones can use the IP network for
communications.

		   H.323 TERMINAL		 H.323 TERMINAL
		       |			          |
	               |			          |
	               |----------------------------------|
					 |
					 |
   TELEPHONE --- PSTN --- H.323 --- IP NETWORK --- H.323 --- PSTN --- TELEPHONE
			  TO             |         TO
			  PSTN	         |         PSTN
			  GATEWAY	 |	   GATEWAY
                                         |
					 |
                       ------------------------------------
                       |			          |
	               |			          |
		H.323 GATEKEEPER                      DNS SERVER

This example configuration shows that is is not necessary to use H.323 native
mode terminals to use H.323. It is perfectly possible to use regular telephones and
similar devices connected through gateways. The H.323 terminal specification is
not a specification for a particular terminal type. Instead it specifies the protocols
necessary to support multimedia terminal function. That is, it doesn't prescribe the
design or functions of any particular device. It specifies protocols needed to
support certain kinds of functions and leaves the physical realization and structure
of these to the equipment designer.

There are two versions of the H.323 terminal specification which are intended for
use in two different environments:

* Corporate network terminal
  This is envisaged as a high-quality, high-function device which may perform
  multiway videoconferencing or just point-to-point voice connection.

* Internet terminal
  In this the specification is optimized to use the minimum bandwidth.

H.323 terminals have built-in multipoint capability for ad-hoc conferences and a
multicast feature which allows 3-4 people in a call without centralized mixing or
switching.

H.323 gateways provide interoperability between IP-connected H.323 terminals and
other audio devices (such as regular telephones), either directly connected to the
gateway or connected through a network that is not IP. These could be multimedia
devices such as H.320 videoconference terminals or ordinary telephones connected
through the public telephone network. The functions performed by the gateway
include the mapping of the call signaling protocols, the control protocols and media
mapping (multiplexing, rate matching and audio transcoding).

The H.323 gatekeeper provides the functions of directory server and system
supervisor. The network of H.323 terminals and gateways under the control of a
particular gatekeeper forms an integrated sub-network within the wider TCP/IP
network environment. The gatekeeper's detailed functions are as follows:

* Directory Server (Address Translation) Function

This function translates an H.323 alias address to an IP (transport) address
using information obtained at terminal registration. This allows the user to have
meaningful, unchanging names with which to refer to other users in the system.
These names are arbitrary. You can use addresses similar to those used in
TCP/IP e-mail systems. Alternatively you can use *phone number like* names
or another completely different system.

* Supervisory Functions (for example, Call Admission Control)

The gatekeeper can grant or deny permission to make the call. In doing this it
can apply bandwidth limits to manage the network traffic and so prevent
congestion occurring. This function is particularly relevant in a LAN
environment.

The gatekeeper also manages gateways and provides necessary address
translation between external addresses and IP addresses by which external
resources are known within the H.323 network.

* Call Signaling

The gatekeeper may route calls in order to provide supplementary services or
to provide Multipoint Controller functionality for calls with a large number of
parties.

* Call Management

Because the gatekeeper controls network access it is also the logical place to
perform call accounting and management.

The Multipoint Controller and Multipoint Processor form the Multipoint Control Unit
(MCU). This H.323 component provides conference management, media processing and the 
multipoint conference model. The MCU supports media distribution for unicast and multicast 
data.

- Voice Compression (G.723.1 and G.729)

The ITU recommendations G.723.1, G.729 and G.729A specify the operation of
Codecs in low-quality networking environments similar to that found in the current
public Internet.

* G.723.1 

   Offers a relatively high degree of compression with an output bit rate of
   either 5.3 or 6.4 kbps. Using a data length in the packet of 20 or 24 bytes
   this means that each packet carries 30 ms of the real-time voice signal.

   The coder typically causes a one-way processing delay of 30 ms, a
   lookahead delay (to the next packet) of 7.5 ms and of course the packet
   assembly time of 30 ms (because 30 ms of voice is carried in a single
   packet). This imposes a one-way delay at each end of the connection of
   67.5 ms, that is, 135 ms end-to-end one-way.

* G.729 

   Comes in two flavors: G.729 and G.729A. The key difference is in the
   amount of processing required to implement the algorithm. In both cases
   the compressed bit rate is 8 kbps and the amount of real-time voice
   encoded is 10 ms. This gives a data packet size of 10 bytes.

   The algorithm used is called Conjugate Structured Algebraic Code Excited
   Linear Predictive (CS-ACELP). As input, CS-ACELP takes 80 samples of
   standard or linear PCM (64 kbps Pulse Code Modulation). This algorithm
   was designed for implementation by advanced Fixed Point Digital Signal
   Processors (DSPs) and is noted for delivering an exceptionally high level of
   voice quality with minimal delay.

   In terms of delay both of these protocols are the same, requiring 10 ms for
   packet assembly, 10 ms for processing and 5 ms for lookahead. This
   means a 50 ms end-to-end delay due to the Codecs.

* GSM 

   The Group Special Mobile (GSM) audio compression is an algorithm
   originally defined for use with digital mobile telephones. It is a European
   standard not one of the ITU set. GSM is an allowed alternative for VoIP. A
   frame of 160 samples (each sample consists of 16 bits signed word) is
   used which is then compressed it into a smaller frame of 260 bits. These
   260 bits are made up of different variables, each variable requiring a
   different number of bits. The VoIP forum selected the use of the RTP basic
   packaging type which enables the packaging of even or odd number of
   GSM frames within a single packet of RTP.

G.729 speech frames can be made into packets consuming approximately 9 kbps
on a private leased line and 10.6 kbps on a frame relay link, including overhead. If
silence suppression is used, the bandwidth required is reduced to an average of
approximately 4 kbps.

It seems obvious that it is not very efficient to add a TCP/IP header to a packet that
has a data payload of only 10 bytes. Thus G.723.1 is much more efficient in use of
bandwidth than G.729 but G.729 has a significantly lower delays.

- The VoIP Protocol Stack

The VoIP IA consists of a number of protocols interworking with one another to
perform the overall function. These protocols operate in a hierarchical fashion and
may be represented as a stack in the same way as most other communications
systems are described.

Each protocol is defined according to what its purpose is, and what relevant
standard (or draft) defines it. The VoIP stack is very similar to the H.323 stack.
However, there are several additional functions that are not present in H.323.

CALL ESTAVLISHMENT AND CONTROL The call establishment and control protocols
determine the sequence and timing of:

  1. Call establishment
  2. Call disconnection
  3. Control of the H.323 session after it is established

PRESENTATION The presentation function interprets the syntax of all transferred audio
and *in-band* control information such as dual tone multiple frequency
(DTMF) dialing signals.

ADDRESSING Because IP networks are dynamic addressing environments, it can
happen that the IP address that identified an H.323 terminal in a past
telephone connection is different from the IP address in a later connection.
Even if addresses were stable, it would be a big problem for every end user
to know every IP address that was needed. Therefore, a very dynamic
*telephone book* is needed to allow the end user to look up the IP address
of an H.323 terminal dynamically.

In fact there are two methods available for constructing such a *telephone
book*. The first method is a protocol called RAS which allows H.323
endpoints to locate other H.323 endpoints via an H.323 gatekeeper.
Alternatively an H.323 endpoint can be allowed to initially locate an H.323
gatekeeper via DNS.

RAS Registration, Admission, Status (RAS) is a protocol that specifies how
H.323 entities can access gatekeepers to realize address translation.

AUDIO CODEC Audio Coder/Decoder (Codec) are used to convert analog audio
to/from digital signals.

H.245 In general, H.245 defines a control protocol for multimedia communications.
In the VoIP stack H.245 specifies how the channels inside of telephone
calls are established and controlled. It also includes methods for sending
and receiving DTMF dial tones.

H.225.0 H.225.0 is entitled  Media Stream Packetisation and Synchronization on
Non-Guaranteed Quality of Service LANs. It defines the method of how audio packets, 
control packets and DTMF dial information are transmitted over IP networks.

Q.931 Q.931 is a signaling protocol that is used to set up, tear down, and control
H.323 communication sessions. The protocol originated as the signaling
specification for ISDN. The way in which it is used in VoIP is defined in
H.225.0.

RTP/RTCP RTP/RTCP and the G.723.1 RTP audio packetisation was originally
standardized by the IETF.

RTP is a real-time protocol that is used in VoIP control and monitors the
packet delivery. The G.723.1 RTP audio packetisation defines how the
G.723.1 audio frames are transmitted in the RTP payload.

On the transport layer, VoIP uses UDP for RAS, DNS and RTP/RTCP and TCP for
H.245, Q.931 and sometimes for DNS.

An Introduction to IPSec - Kermit23
**********************************************

* Slider does not suggest taking women's medicine *

It has been said many times by many people (including the ever influential 
voice of some guests on the bbc2 program "Hack the Planet") that IP is an 
insecure protocol. To have secure communication a protocol must satisfy 
three basic requirements:

1. Authentication: You know that the person you believe you are communicating 
with really is that person. 
2. Confidentiality: You know that no one is listening in on your communications. 
3. Integrity: You know your communications have not been tampered with between 
leaving the sender, and being received by you. 

IP fails in several of these area, not that this is a criticism of IP, it was 
never designed for security. For one, it is trivial to spoof an IP address, 
simply by changing the value of the "source ip address" header field. This 
allows for session hi-jacking if the return communications of the target 
host can be predicted. For a good example of this in action see the hack 
that got Kevin Mitnick busted. 

On Ethernet is simple to breach the confidentiality of IP by sniffing the 
network through most Ethernet cards, and in a larger network it may be 
possible to intercept the data by having access to one of the points it 
must travel through between sender and recipient. 

IPSec combats these problems with a three part system.

Part 1: Authentication Header or AH "signs" the packet, in the same way 
        you may sign a message with PGP.
Part 2: Encapsulation Payload or ESP encrypts the information in the packet, 
        theoretically with any symmetric encryption method, but most commonly 
        with 56 bit DES.
Part 3: Internet Key Exchange or IKE is a complex negotiation protocol for the 
        safe exchange of keys across an insecure environment. 

-----

The ESP Packet

The IPsec ESP packet is encapsulated within an IP packet which allows compatibility 
with most networks, and is tightly integrated with IPv6 ( see Oblivion 4 for more 
information on IPv6).

                          Value (ICV). This is computed by taking a hash of the encrypted 
                          packet, and attached at the end, varying in length depending on 
                          the algorithm, The standard specify that SHA-1 and MD5 are supported.


Parts 1-6 are authenticated.
Parts 3-6 are encrypted. 

Multiple cipher algorithms can be used to encrypt the data carried by the packet, 
but the standard defines 56 bit DES to ensure there is a minimum level of interoperability 
between various implementations. 

As you can see by this, it is possible to encapsulate IP in an ESP packet, and hence set 
up a VPN, tunnelling IP though IPSec.

-----

The AH Packet. 

The Authentication Header is used to provide, fairly obviously, authentication, but does 
not provide any confidentiality (read encryption) so sniffed data is usable by an attacker. 
However, it can be combined with ESP.

If combined in this way, the AH goes before ESP (or TCP if used on its own), and after IP.

                         of 32 or 64 bits (for ipv4 or v6)

-----

Key Points (I bet someone at a management course would find that funny). 

It is safe to assume that no matter how strong the algorithm is, it's not a whole lot of use 
if the attacker has the key. To ensure this doesn't happen it's generally considered that 
exchanging keys personally is the only option. However, a network is to be built which 
incorporates a reasonable number of people, all of whom wanting to changing their keys 
monthly, you would need an awful lot of one to one meetings. This is fairly impractical 
and highlights the need to find a good way to exchange keys without being physically together. 

IPSec addresses the three major problems:

1: That you have to negotiate which protocols, algorithms and keys to use. 
2: You have to exchange keys (potentially a lot).
3: You have to keep track of it all. 

--
Keeping track of this information is done by a big bundle of chewy data called the Security 
Association, cunning abbreviated to SA. A SA includes:

- The authentication algorithm being used for AH, and the keys for it.
- The encryption algorithm being used by ESP, and the keys.
- How communications are authenticated (protocol, algorithm, key). 
- How communications are kept private (protocol, algorithm, key).
- When the keys expire. 
- Lifetime of the SA
- The SA source address.
- Sensitivity Level Descriptor - a indication of levels of security. 

The SA itself is identified by the SPI field in the packets earlier. 

--
Key Exchange is dealt with by IKE, Industrial Strength Key Exchange. There is also provision 
to exchange keys via face to face meetings, if you feel the need.


IKE goes through two phases, and eventually returns a complete SA. 
Phase 1 establishes secure connections between the two peers which is used in
Phase 2 to negotiate the SA. 

It can be used in three modes:
Main - Secures a channel for phase 1.
Aggressive - As main, but passes identity information before the secure link has been 
established, which is quicker but could allow an attacker to determine the members of 
the SA.
Quick - Used after main or aggressive, and assume that the tunnel already established is secure. . 

To establish a temporary SA for the negotiation of the general SA, (the temp. one being known 
as an IKE SA), the first peer proposes:

- Encryption algorithms
- Hash algorithms
- Authentication method
- Information to base a Diffie-Hellman exchange on. 
- The Pseudo Random Function to be used for certain hash operations (can use hash established 
earlier instead, so this is optional).
- Type of protection, ESP or AH.

For those that haven't heard of it Difffie-Hellman is a pretty cool bit of crypto that takes 
a public key from another source, and your own public key and combines them, (using your own 
private key), to make a symmetric (non public key style) encryption code that both parties 
can use from only public keys, while being incredibly difficult for an attacker with both 
public keys to duplicate. 

Once the secure channel has been established SA's are generated and SPI values are assigned, 
then communicated to the other party. From then on a SPI with IP address and protocol 
uniquely identifies a particular SA, and can be used for secure communication and tunnelling. 

----

Who's who.

There still at this point needs to be an authentication that the person you are talking to is 
the person you think you are talking to. With what I have mentioned so far you can be sure 
that you will always be talking to the same person, and that your communications with them 
are secure, but not that they are who they say they are. 

This is covered by a common idea, and one used is IPsec, the Certification Authority, or CA. 

A CA is a third part trusted by the parties wishing to communicate, one who will vouch for the 
identity of the person who the communication is intended for or to. 

In general a CA will have give you three things to validate someone
- A unique identity. 
- The persons public key (linking it to that identity).
- The CA's public key (used to verify these communications). 

The key to this is that the CA has a very well known public key, so it is easily verified, 
and hard to spoof. IPsec used X.509, like just about everyone else, where the web of trust 
style has proved extremely effective. 

-----

Who's got it?

IPsec is available in Windows 2000, Linux, most BSD's and probably the other major flavours 
of Unix and NT 4. Hopefully as more and more vendors incorporate it into their OS's it will 
become a universally *used* standard, providing low level security across the internet. 
However until then, try getting hold of a implementation and have a go.

Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) - Slider
**********************************************

This was written after BT failed last month setting up their SurfTime 
network which was down for 17 hours last month when a fibre cable split.  

And to quote Cyber :

"Oh well its a routing network you would of thought, no need to worry.  Well BT
didn't think about building backup routes into the network and decided to
leave it with a single point of failure, which resulted in no one being able
to connect."

So, Oblivion decided that BT needed to be sk00led in how to use Virtual Router 
Redundancy Protocol...

VRRP was issued to the IETF by IBM, Ascend Communications, Microsoft and
Digital Equipment Corp. in April 1998 and is documented in RFC number 2338.

- Introduction

The use of a statically configured default route is quite popular for host IP
configurations. It minimizes configuration and processing overhead on the end host
and is supported by virtually every IP implementation. This mode of operation is
likely where dynamic host configuration protocols such as DHCP are deployed, which
typically provide configuration for an end-host IP address and default gateway.

However, this creates a single point of failure. Loss of the default router results in
a catastrophic event, isolating all end hosts that are unable to detect any alternate
path that may be available.

VRRP is designed to eliminate the single point of failure inherent in the static
default routed environment. VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically
assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.
The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual router is
called the master, and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses. The election
process provides dynamic fail-over in the forwarding responsibility should the
master become unavailable. Any of the virtual router's IP addresses on a LAN can
then be used as the default first hop router by end hosts. The advantage gained
from using VRRP is a higher availability default path without requiring configuration
of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end host.

- VRRP Definitions

Before giving an overview of VRRP, some terms used in VRRP need to be defined.

* VRRP Router

A router running the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol. It may participate
in one or more virtual routers.

* Virtual Router

An abstract object managed by VRRP that acts as a default router for hosts
on a shared LAN. It consists of a virtual router identifier and a set of
associated IP address(es) across a common LAN. A VRRP Router may back
up one or more virtual routers.

* IP Address Owner

The VRRP router that has the virtual router's IP address(es) as real interface
address(es). This is the router that, when up, will respond to packets
addressed to one of these IP addresses for ICMP pings, TCP connections,
etc.

* Primary IP Address

An IP address selected from the set of real interface addresses. One
possible selection algorithm is to always select the first address. VRRP
advertisements are always sent using the primary IP address as the source of
the IP packet.

* Virtual Router Master

The VRRP router that is assuming the responsibility of forwarding packets
sent to the IP address(es) associated with the virtual router, and answering
ARP requests for these IP addresses. Note that if the IP address owner is
available, then it will always become the master.

* Virtual Router Backup

The set of VRRP routers available to assume forwarding responsibility for a
virtual router should the current master fail.

- VRRP Overview

VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual router function described
earlier. All protocol messaging is performed using IP multicast datagrams, thus the 
protocol can operate over a variety of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting IP 
multicast. Each VRRP virtual router has a single well-known MAC address allocated 
to it. The virtual router MAC address is used as the source in all periodic VRRP 
messages sent by the master router to enable bridge learning in an extended LAN.

A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier (VRID) and a set of IP
addresses. A VRRP router can associate a virtual router with its real addresses on
an interface, and can also be configured with additional virtual router mappings and
priority for virtual routers it is willing to back up. The mapping between VRID and
addresses must be coordinated among all VRRP routers on a LAN. However,
there is no restriction against reusing a VRID with a different address mapping on
different LANs.

The scope of each virtual router is restricted to a single LAN. To minimize network
traffic, only the master for each virtual router sends periodic VRRP advertisement
messages. A backup router will not attempt to pre-empt the master unless it has
higher priority. This eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path
becomes available. It's also possible to administratively prohibit all pre-emption
attempts. The only exception is that a VRRP router will always become master of
any virtual router associated with addresses it owns. If the master becomes
unavailable then the highest priority backup will transition to master after a short
delay, providing a controlled transition of the virtual router responsibility with
minimal service interruption.

The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from master to backup to
minimize service interruption, and incorporates optimizations that reduce protocol
complexity while guaranteeing controlled master transition for typical operational
scenarios. The optimizations result in an election protocol with minimal runtime
state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single message type and
sender. The typical operational scenarios are defined to be two redundant routers
and/or distinct path preferences among each router. A side effect when these
assumptions are violated (for example, more than two redundant paths all with
equal preference) is that duplicate packets can be forwarded for a brief period
during master election. However, the typical scenario assumptions are likely to
cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the master router is infrequent, and
the expected duration in master election convergence is quite small ( << 1 second). 

Thus the VRRP optimizations represent significant simplifications in the protocol
design while incurring an insignificant probability of brief network degradation.

-Sample Configuration

The following figure shows a simple example network with two VRRP routers
implementing one virtual router.

		RTR-1				RTR-2
		VRID=1 (master)			VRID=1
		9.180.20.3			9.180.20.4
		  |				   |
		  |				   |
		  |				   |
	      ---------------------------------------------------
                       |           |          |           |
                       |           |          |           |
                       |           |          |           |
		     HOST1       HOST2      HOST3       HOST4

The above configuration shows a very simple VRRP scenario. In this configuration,
the end hosts install a default route to the IP address of virtual router #1 (IP
address 9.180.20.3) and both routers run VRRP. The router on the left becomes
the master for virtual router #1 (VRID=1) and the router on the right is the backup
for virtual router #1. If the router on the left should fail, the other router will take
over virtual router #1 and its IP addresses, and provide uninterrupted service for
the hosts. Note that in this example, IP address 9.180.20.4 is not backed up by the
router on the left. IP address 9.180.20.4 is only used by the router on the right as
its interface address. In order to back up IP address 9.180.20.4, a second virtual
router would have to be configured. This is shown in following example.

		RTR-1				RTR-2
		VRID=1 (master)			VRID=1
		VRID=2				VRID=2 (master)
		9.180.20.3			9.180.20.4
		  |				   |
		  |				   |
		  |				   |
	      ---------------------------------------------------
                       |           |          |           |
                       |           |          |           |
                       |           |          |           |
		     HOST1       HOST2      HOST3       HOST4

The following figure shows a configuration with two virtual routers with the hosts
splitting their traffic between them. This example is expected to be very common in
actual practice. In the above configuration, half of the hosts install a default route
to virtual router #1's (IP address 9.180.20.3), and the other half of the hosts install
a default route to virtual router #2's (IP address 9.180.20.4). This has the effect of
load balancing the traffic from the hosts through the routers, while also providing
full redundancy.

- VRRP Packet Format

The purpose of the VRRP packet is to communicate to all VRRP routers the priority
and the state of the master router associated with the virtual router ID. VRRP
packets are sent encapsulated in IP packets. They are sent to the IPv4 multicast
address assigned to VRRP. 

The IP address as assigned by the IANA for VRRP is 224.0.0.18. This is a link local
scope multicast address. Routers must not forward a datagram with this destination
address regardless of its TTL.

The TTL must be set to 255. A VRRP router receiving a packet with the TTL not
equal to 255 must discard the packet.

The fields of the VRRP header are defined as follows:

Version
	The version field specifies the VRRP protocol version of this packet. (In RFC
	2338 the version is 2.)

Type
	The type field specifies the type of this VRRP packet. The only packet type
	defined in this version of the protocol is 1.

Virtual Router ID (VRID)
	The virtual router identifier (VRID) field identifies the virtual router this packet
	is reporting status for.

Priority
	The priority field specifies the sending VRRP router's priority for the virtual
	router. Higher values equal higher priority. The priority value for the VRRP
	router that owns the IP address(es) associated with the virtual router must be
	255. VRRP routers backing up a virtual router must use priority values
	between 1-254. The default priority value for VRRP routers backing up a
	virtual router is 100. The priority value zero (0) has special meaning
	indicating that the current master has stopped participating in VRRP. This is
	used to trigger backup routers to quickly transition to master without having to
	wait for the current master to time out.

Count IP Addrs
	The number of IP addresses contained in this VRRP advertisement.

Auth Type
	The authentication type field identifies the authentication method being
	utilized. Authentication type is unique on a per interface basis. The
	authentication type field is an 8-bit unsigned integer. A packet with unknown
	authentication type or that does not match the locally configured
	authentication method must be discarded. The authentication methods
	currently defined are:

	* 0 - No Authentication
	* 1 - Simple text password
	* 2 - IP Authentication Header

Advertisement Interval (Adver Int)
	The default is 1 second. This field may be used for troubleshooting
	misconfigured routers.

Checksum
	It is used to detect data corruption in the VRRP message.

IP Address(es)
	One or more IP addresses that are associated with the virtual router.

Authentication Data
	The authentication string is currently only utilized for simple text
	authentication.

**********************************************
ADSL - Kermit23
**********************************************

Several people reading this may at this very moment be waiting 
for ADSL to be installed for their personal use, or may be using 
ADSL right now. It is a significant jump for BT, and an improvement 
on the 56k that many people will have been using previously. 
However, there is often some confusion on how exactly ADSL works, 
which I will attempt to cover at least a little in this quick text. 
I am assuming that you have at least basic knowledge of what ADSL is. 

Asymmetric, as in you can't send the same amount of data up and down it. 
Digital, as in 1's and 0's.
Subscriber, as in you. 
Line, as in the twisted pair copper lines which you have been using for years. 
Unless your local teleco has a lot of spare fibre that is. 

As you can see from this brief breakdown, or possibly from talking with your adsl 
provider, there is no separate ADSL line in the same way there would be if you 
had a T1 installed. What turns the copper lines into ADSL is just a modem, 
albeit a slightly different one from the standard v.90 jobs. 

Normal modems use the same range of frequencies as normal voice is allocated on 
the telephone, from 600Hz to 4KHz. This is a fairly narrow band that has been 
pushed pretty hard to get you 56k of raw speed, not bad considering the bandpass 
is just 3.4KHz. Anything out of this range is considered "out of band" (such as 
signalling, which is one of the reasons why you can't blue box any more). ADSL 
sends information out in an analogue form in this out of band area, which gives 
it a much bigger bandpass to play with than conventional modems. 

This 4KHz limit is mainly imposed by filters at the local exchange, but just from 
your house to the exchange there is a problem with loss of signal quality over 
fairly short distances. Though digital signal processing (DSP) is a fairly mature 
area, there is still a natural distance limit, as cross talk between different 
wires and resistance degrade the signal to an unusable level. The cross talk comes 
from the fact that while 1 wire goes out of your house, it will be bundled with 
the wires of the other houses around, and those with other houses and so on, so 
the teleco does not have to dig up a huge amount of land to run direct wires to 
each house (in fact each pair of wires are twisted to reduce this, hence twisted 
pair). 

As you may guess the line could still be fairly noisy while being usable for 
ADSL, so ADSL modems incorporate CRC error checking, which is a common method 
for checking data integrity. They also ignore extremely noisy sections of the band,
until they become quieter, handy in the case of short term interference. 

A transmission from an ADSL modem goes thus. Digital data (from the computer) 
is encoded and sent on after being combined with any analogue data (from the 
phone line, via the POTS splitter). This is run though a D/A converter 
(digital to analogue) and mixed in with the native digital streams. The 
POTS splitter is just a filter, but one that can also add two streams together. 
However, no one wants to go around saying POTS splitter/combiner.

Once it arrives at the ATM pipe, it is multiplexed (mixed with) with a number 
of other ADSL streams, and sent on up the network. When the response arrives 
it is demultiplexed, sent to the appropriate line. The ADSL modem splits the 
native digital streams from the non-native ones. The native digital is sent 
to the computer, the analogue stuff to the phone line, via the D/A converter 
then POTS splitter. Easy. 
  
As ATM over ADSL (the common method of data transfer over ADSL), the actual 
data the ADSL modem sends are in, as could be expected frames. The modem syncs 
at the 4KHz frequency. It then sends a service information frame, explaining 
what is going to be travelling over this channel of frequency, then a lot of 
data frames containing what you actually want to send. This is known as a super 
frame. Finally it sends a sync frame. 

The super frame contains 68 data frames, an 8-bit CRC frame, and a 24 bit OAM frame, 
each data frame having having a 250 microseconds period. The sync frame esuring both 
ends are ticking to the same beat, so that frames appear when expected and are 
processed properly.

Firewall-1 'n General Firewall Rants...
A two part series - Lock-down
**********************************************

Quick Over view of this firewall + some general firewall rants about
why allowing tcp session to untrusted hosts is a real bad idea..
this is no means a firewall cookbook, just some observation made over a
couple of days...I'm sure slider will have plenty to say about this...
(it' run on AIX too slider.. ;-) )

Okay, I've been playing with firewall-1 this week, if your new to firewall's
this is probably not the txt for you. I'm not a security expert, I always look
at designing a firewall in such a way that I would not be able to hack in
myself.

Read lot's of hacker txt's, become a hacker, that's the only way to know if
your secure.... tee hee

This txt was going to purly about firewall-1 but it's turning more into
a firewall manual, I'll try not to get to distacted and Rant on about
general security too much ;-).

I've found out the following things about this product.

- What is it?

A Packet Level Filtering Firewall

Has Extra Application proxies for web and smtp

Has the ablity to do cvp (content vectoring Protcol), so you can
direct content to third party scanning tools, e.g. virus protection for
downloaded files over http or ftp.

Compliant with Opsec Standards (standard api for writing cvp's)


-- Down Side

* It's let down by *extermely* poor documentation

* It's let down by very poor 'commercial' Books

* It's not an application level firewall :-(

* It's come from a Unix background, so is more suited to unix enviroments, but
  will handle trust and netbios + other NT/windoze traffic patterns.

* Rather confusing NAT/Rule base system, probably because NAT was added in
  a later version, rather than from the ground up.

* Does not handle DNS it self, either pass through dns, or traditonal dns server
  on internal/dmz network.

* You have to manualy fidle with config files on the firewall for it to respond
  to more the one public IP address, example if your using your DMZ to host
  a web server for example.

* Cannot transaprently redirect based destination port :-(.

* Has major exploits :-(

-- Up side

* It has floodgate-1 built in, which is a rather snazzy bandwidth and qos add
   on!

* It's Pretty Easy to get up and running

* It run on Unix and NT

* It's Even Run's on LINUX (nice one checkpoint!)

* It's can managed security policy and configs on other devices, such a routers
  and switches!

* It can manage multiple firewalls, either on the same site, or across the
  internet via a vpn

* Extensive open VPN support, can even link to cisco routers for vpn
  connections.

* Interesting reporting log module, and is able to consolidate logs from
  mutliple firewalls.

* Well tested, most 'easy' exploits have been,,ahem, exploited.

* Very friendly mailing list, with 'real' experts who are willing to help (for a
  change!)

* Syn Flood protection

* Ip Spoofing Protection

* Can be fault tollerant, requires two machines (and licenses) for fail over,
  new version can even fail over encrypted vpn tunnels, but I've not tested this,
  and I doubt' this works ;-) .hehe.

Using secure remote client software, you can have your mobile user ras in' via
the
firewall over a encrypted tunnel. YUM! BARK!

------------------------

So I came with it a fresh pair of eye's, I'm no stranger to firewall's, as
raptor is one of my favourites (application level firewall). Obviously I printed 
the firewall-1 manual, many many reames of waste paper there. I've never read so 
much twaddle in my life, some chapter's go on for pages , where a few pages of 
concise information could of covered the whole concept's. I did find some 
excellent faq on the web by hackers/users, you'll see them at the end in the 
resources section.

So I did want any self respecting 'security' guy would do, go and buy a book,
the only book I could find was check point firewall-1 administration guide (marcus
goncalves and steven brown) and it's a bag of shit, if I had a quid for every time 
it said 'This is beyone the scope of this book, or please check out this, check out
that', I'd have...err err, a lot of bloody money anyway ;-).

To NAT or not NAT, that is the question... (let's jump straigt in)

Let's take an 'old' firewall design method. (no NAT!)



Internal
LAN

192.168.0.0<---------->FW-1<------------------->Internet
                         |
                         |
                         |
                         |
                        DMZ
                 (Public Address Range)
           MAIL   DNS   WEB/SOCKS  FTP    WEB
                          PROXY   SERVER SERVER



so, here we have a three pronged network, a private address for
the internal subnet, a DMZ with a public range, and a Internet
connection with a public range (of course!).

Machine on the internal network, can only access the DMZ,
server's in the DMZ can access both the internal LAN, and
the Internet. People from the internet can only access the DMZ.

The fw-1 is acting as a fancy router, by applying 'rules' to the fw-1
the dmz can be protected in the following ways.

--------------------

Connection from the internet to the DMZ can be controlled, thus if
the dmz only has a smtp server, the only traffic allowed into the
dmz is smtp traffic.

fw-1 can control how connection are made to the dmz, thus preventing
syn flood or other IP DOS attacks.

fw-1 has a hardend IP stack, and will also reject malformed packets,
that would normally would arrive uncheck to a dmz machine and other
weird do traffic. If you have time to kill, attach a packet sniffer
to your public interface, you'll be amaze of the shit flying
around out there...makes space junk look like a walk in the park!

---------------------

The internal LAN is protected from the internet , as the firewall 'know's'
what subnets are connected to which physical interfaces, if it see's for
an example a packet with destination 192.168.0.x  or source of 192.168.0.x
come's into the internet interface, it will drop it, as there is no reason
why a private internal address space is being received on this external
interface.

Same goes for the DMZ public address and the other interface, as long as you
tell the firewall what subnet's are connected to what interfaces, you will be 
spoofed protected (nice!)

---------------------------
So, how the hell do internal machine communicate to the internet,
obviously, there no way the internal machine can send packet straight out to
the internet, they would probably reach thier destination, but when the came back 
(to the 192.168.0.x) the would (hopefully) get dropped , misrouted by the internet 
a dissapear for ever (bemuda triangle style).

There are two way two get around the problem.

Application level Proxies
or
Network Address Translation. (NAT) (we'll talk about this later).


the above example uses Application level Proxies, so just think that a proxy
makes connection on behalf of the internal machines, it a bit like using a 
'man in the middle', if third party to say finish a drug deal, you yourself 
have no contact with the dealer, the man in the middle sort's everything out, and 
the dealer talks to the man in the middle. you on the other hand never see the 
dealer dude, thus this offers more protection. ;-).

Is this method safe?, we'll kind of, but we'll discuss that later (no firewall
is safe!). because applcation proxies stand in the middle of the the tcp/udp/icmp/etc
connection, they break the end-to-end nature of the internet (unquote), so proxies 
can acutally make application's incompatible (you have to use NAT then), and also 
add to the complixty of network troubleshooting.

Proxies have improved to a high degree, and you'll find even the most simple 
proxies 'rfc' compliant these days.

We add rules to the firewall so that the internal lan can make connection to
the dmz proxies, the dmz proxies can make connection's to the internet. the dmz
proxies cannot make connection to the internal, the internet cannot make a connection
to the dmz. connection from/to the internet from/to the internal lan are impossible,
as there is no way they can be routed (without some special hacker action!) from
one to the other. (this assume no NAT is being used!).


Each machine on the DMZ, should be lockeddown ( ;-) ), as much as possible,
only offering basic services to the whole of the unauthenticated internet
community.

This minises the risk of for example a hacker exploiting an rpc buffer
overflow to install trojan code, thus initate attacks from the dmz (which is bad!).

Remember, if this does happen, that the firewall should be watching (logging)
every connection attempt, so as long as you check your traffic for suspious traffic
every now and then you'll be okay. (unless somebody compromises your firewall, if
that's the case, you might as well shut up shop and go home ;-) ).

You Must 'harden' the machine's on the DMZ, minimal set of user accounts,
mininal set of services, minimal o/s configuration, Latest operating system +
patches, latest application software + patches + add extra security tools such a trip
wire to battle harden hosts. You want to know if a pin drop's (including if
any services crash or coredump! very suspious in a non NT enviroment ;-) )
in the dmz, the rest of the internal lan can carry on in organised chaos, the
dmz need's to be tightly controlled (please!).

If you really must have a public available resource such as an ftp site for
customers, make sure they authenticate with the firewall first, then use authentication
on the ftp servers. This is a layered security approach, and at the momement  you
using the first layer of authentication at the firewall, and a second level of
authentication at the ftp application level ;-). yum yum.

If you wan't to run a public service such as a web server, or public ftp, make
sure you position it on the dmz. Ask question's , like, if my ftp server is
compromised, what other machines are at risk from attack via the compromised machine. take
for example this dmz



Internlan---------------->FW-1------------------> Internet
                           |
                           |
                       Shared 10mb
                          HUB
Public                     |
FTP SERVER---------------------------------Unix Web Server


okay, so the FTP server on the dmz has been buffer overflowed, the firewall
missed it (it was sleeping perhaps ;-) ), and the attackers now control the ftp server
via a root/admistrator shell. the fw-1 is configured to not accept connections
from the dmz ftp server to the internal lan, but is configured to accecpt telnet from
the dmz web server to the internal lan (this is silly, but I have seen this configuration
in the 'field' ;-) ). and telnet from the internal lan to the webserver. So, 
the attacker's, run's a packet sniffer on the compromised ftp server, and they 
wait......wait..waits some more, until some bright spark log's on via telnet as 
root to the unix web server....bingo... we have now compromised the unix web server. 
we're getting there. From the unix web server, we examine the logs , and find the a 
number of telnet sessions from the dmz to the internal network occurs. We install 
monitoring software onto the unix web server, thus gaining passwords for internal machines.
Bingo, we have now compromised internal network, bad news for the admin of
this firewall, the firewall sit's there quite happly accecpting connection, loggin them, but
how does it know who doing what., it does'nt, firewall are thick....really they
are, you probably need some IDS system, but more on that in our next installment (i.e.
I can't be bother to write about that now!).

How do we fix particular this situation.

We could install a Switched hub instead of shared 10mb hub, this would prevent
snooping of packets from the FTP server (Beware some elite skillz hackers can overload
a switch causing it to flood frames to all port's..............nasty).

Use Strong Encryption/Authentication to gain access to the unix web server
(perhaps ssh), this would increase dmz security greatly (prevents snooping!).

Avoid the paractise of allowing telnet session to be initated from the dmz web
server.  (best method, always ask why firewall rules are installed, ask ask ask , and
demand to know, if know one can tell you why it exist's , it should not be there'.

as you can see, every machine on dmz has a role to play in security of the
network, and compromised dmz machine can be very hazardous to network health.


Surley NAT can save us all??
----------------------------

Network address translation is being used heavly on securit/firewall devices
at the moment. what is nat?

NAT is a way of connection private addresses (e.g. 192.168.0.x) subnets to
the public internet.

look..

Internlan---------------->FW-1------------------> Internet
192.168.0.x             <-NAT->|                Public Address
                               |                  212.3.4.2
                           f1-1 Public Interface
                           212.3.4.1

any packet being sent from the internal lan , to the internet is
translated. The translation takes place as you can't send 192.168.0.x address
out onto the internet, the will get to thier destination, but there is now
way the internet can route, or is in fact designed to route these private
address. So NAT replaces the source address with the public interface address
of the firewall. An internal connection table make sure the machines on the
internal network, receives the right connection at the right time, funky
stuff. no proxies, no dmz, no nothing, just raw nat, wow we're secure now
arn't we, because any incomming connection attempts are dropped.......nope..
we are not secure at all
in fact....

Any incomming traffic 212.3.4.1 from the internet that has not already been
established is discarded (i.e. hackers can't create connections to internal
machine, as they are 'hiding' behing the firewall's public address').
(that's secure????).

So, I said we are not secure with nat, most nat configuration I've seen have
the following config's.

Internal Lan------------------------fw-1-------------------Internet
                                    &lt;NAT>
Source          Destination     Action
Internallan     Internet        Allow
Internet        Internallan     Drop

ok, only out going tcp connection are allowed, cool! This method is extermley
bad, as connections initated from within the internal lan can be as dangerous
as allowing incomming connections to the lan. Tcp connections are full duplex,
that is they are two way pipes, there nothing stopping somebody rewriting
back orrofice, and instead of waiting for incomming connections, which NAT
usually renders useless, the backoffice trojan's 'dial' out of the network to
a remote (usually another compromised system) trojan control program.


Compromised---- tcp
connecton>>>>--firewall---------Internet-----------Hacker's
Machine on                           NAT                               Machine
Internal Lan                                                          |
                                                                      |
backorrice <<<-------TCP Reverse Control Channel Established-----------
revesed server

so, as you can see, we're using the full duplex properties of tcp connection
to tunnel into the internal network, from a connection initated by a
comprosmied internal machine, now if this does'nt scare you, then your a 
braver man than me, now where did I leave my assembler??? ;-). The NAT box 
will quite happly allow this to happen, hmmm.....I could be wrong on this, 
and winsock programmers out there wanna contact me help me write a proof of 
concept code??? ;-).


Can Application Proxies stop this?
----------------------------------
Yes, and no, proxies can give you another level of logging and authentication,
and if the application proxy understand's the protcol it is trying to proxy
very well, then it may dectect than the data flowing between client and server is
not within limits (i.e., why is http traffic encrypted, when it is not https
for example!) , but none that I know of can prevent this kind of attack if
the server/client is well written (look's like normal http traffic for
example).

The only way to prevent this is to secure the internal network from trojan
attack, most firewall solution can help with this, using email filtering, ftp/http
filtering etc etc, which can cut down the risk of trojan programs entering the network
via the internet. (does'nt stop someone bringing in on a floppy disk with it
on though ;-) ).  Else you must only allow NAT/proxy firewall's to connect to 
untrusted sites!!!

hmmm, hope this one got you thinking, anyway enough ranting, back to firewall-1.

So what is the best design? NAT or Fully Routable DMZ with application
proxies, that depends (ooh I'm sitting on the fence with this). Most ISP are really
mean with thier IP allocation, most ISP with give you 6 or less! IP addresses!, thus 
you have to use NAT to host server's and proxies, as you just don't get enough to play 
with, NAT can be useful here. NAT can also add to security, as when the packet get's
translated the IP header is effectivly rewriten, this can eliminate weird options in the
header fields for instance (this is true on cisco routers that support NAT,
firewall-1 one uses it's own inspect 'secret' engine). A DMZ network will
effectivly slow down an attacker, perhaps enough to allow detection. A DMZ network also
allow extra security and IDS tool's to be delployed along side the firewall,
another layer of security can be added via this method. Again, this layed method is
something I'm really into, you build up security not by adding all singing all dancing
firewall, but add layers of security, like an onion..wtf??? (wow, I gotta stay off the
booze!) cool.

The design mention above, with full dmz and application level proxies,
requires extensive hardware and software (+licenese), so it's the more expensive 
route, raptor firewall for instance acutally contains all the proxies and dns services 
it self, so although the product is slightly more expensive, you do get value for money 
;-). (raptor is also slower, but for the UK speed is acdemic, as not many site's can 
afford faster than an E-1 at the moment (that will change, just as soon as BT are 
crushed!)) heh heh.


Should I allow ICMP into my DMZ?.
------------------------------------
Depends how paranoid you are, but most of the time you can safely drop this
traffic at the firewall, there lots of nasty tricks you can play with ICMP
(espcially icmp redirect!), so best to avoid block, I don't know of any 
essential internet services (smtp, ftp, http), that require icmp traffic to operate 
correctly. ICMP initated from you network should also be dropped. Why? we all know 
how easy it is to embedded 'real' data into icmp packets, icmp has already been used 
as a control channel for various trojans, if your *really* need icmp stuff, limit it 
to a number of secure internal hosts or setup a server in the DMZ, which users can use 
to ping other server's via a remote session, this should keep everyone happy.


rememeber , inspect all the rules on a firewall, ask questions, cause
trouble... that's the only way to verify it's rule base. If you firewall has more than
twenty rules defined...worry......


How do I handle DNS??
-------------------------------------------
next....installment.


Is there anything that can be done at the Internet router level to make
my network more secure-
------------------------------------------------------------------------
check out phracks article on creating bastion router configurations @
http://www.attrition.org/~modify/texts/phrack/Phrack55/P55-10

nice stuff, I recommend you *READ* this.


What should I do if my firewall is portscanned (bite back!). (phun!)
-----------------------------------------------
That's easy, you need to hire 15 E-1 Links, connected to 15 different
networks.

If you recieve keep receive port scans from the same subnet, just hit a few
c00l shell script's and fire up the 15 E-1 links to the source of the port
scan. The script kiddie will suddnley have to deal with 30mb/s of internet
traffic, and most probably if he's on an modem connection, his access device
will die, or he will be rendered harmless a bandwidth ddos ;-).
he he he. I don't recommomed this type action, but sometimes it's the only
way, fight fire with fire! (why does napster come to mind).

Portscan's are a fact of life, your going to get them, I get about 6 or 7 a
day, which is incredible, you can ignore them in most instances, you should know
what port's you have open, and closed, so what if a remote attacker guesses your
running firewall-1, you've got all the latest patches install, have'nt you.....you
haven't, disconnect from the internet until you do.

Honeypots, who call winnie the poo. the fly to the spider...
-----------------------------------------------
If your really paranoid, why not set a trap for a intruders? yep, set up a
default installation of NT/unix what ever, make it as insecure as possibe (that's
right, just use the out of the box config ;-). Install either loggin tools on the
hosts, or make the firewall alert if connection is made to this machine. Any hacker
can resist to compromise this system first, once the alarm bell's start
ringing, you can watch them, and see where there from, what they are up to, and what
they are try to achive, it's a good way of picking up tools/technique too ;-),
and it's a whole lot of phun too. ;-). But remember, if you play with fire.....


Resources for firewall 1 that are worth checking.
-----------------------------------
Checkpoint firewall 1 list, via www.checkpoint.com
http://www.phoneboy.com/ - firewall 1 faq
http://www.deathstar.ch/security/fw1/  - obiwan's Death Star site, this guy is
quite mad, but cool ;-)
S T A R W A R S.....safe.


if you feel I've missed anything, feedback and I'll make the next one
better..yeah sure! I'll be covering the things I missed next issue. (if I don't get drunk and
forget!), I wish I'd had more time to get this finished, I must sign back on the dole
soon and get more time to myself ;-). I'll try and cover some floodgate-1, and how to
protect video streams, against say ftp traffic, juicy stuff.

There are many common configuration problems with firewalls, ranging in severity

One in three supposedly secure ebusiness servers are using software with known
security weaknesses, and European sites are the worst offenders, according to
a survey. Eric Murray, a consulting security architect based in the US, found
that
in a random sample of more than 8000 web servers running the SSL protocol, 32
per cent were "dangerously weak".

SPAM SPREADS TO PAPER
If "traditional" electronic spam isn't enough for you, there's a new service
from
Zairmail that lets you spread your electronic word even to those unfortunates
not connected to the Internet. Zairmail Express Direct provides postal
mail-on-demand services.

NEW SECURITY CHALLENGES - WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY
On July 27, Jeff Schmidt tried out a brand-new wireless LAN card on his laptop
at work. He didn't expect anything to happen, because his organization's
wireless LAN wasn't up and running yet. But to his surprise, he was able to
connect without any trouble to the network of an office down the street.

DECSS T-SHIRTS ILLEGAL?

code on the T-shirt. Designed by Dominic Dellizzi, a programmer at Copyleft, the
back of the shirt bears the source code to DeCSS, a program that decrypts DVD.

WHY BAYTSP WON'T COMPROMISE PRIVACY?
ZDNet News recently ran an article about BayTSP's efforts to work with law
enforcement to track child pornography and copyright infringements on the
Internet and report them to the proper authorities. Based on the enormous
response in the TalkBack section of that article, it is apparent that there is
confusion regarding law enforcement's application of our technology.

SECURE TUNNELING BETWEEN INTRANETS WITH VTUN
"VTun was written by Maxim Krasnyansky and is a fast and flexible package that
allows you to create encrypted tunnels between hosts. It supports a number of
tunnel types, compression, and traffic shaping. According to the site, it can
run
on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and other BSD clones. I will be using Solaris 2.7
for
the examples in this article."

INVESTIGATORS WITH PHONY E-MAIL IDS
False identities may be a time-honored tradition on the Web, but as the case of
the e-mail messages about DFL U.S. Senate candidate Mike Ciresi illustrates,
fake
isn't the same as anonymous. Most Internet users probably don't realize how easy
it is to trace the origin of an e-mail, and how willingly their internet service
provider or e-mail provider will aid in the search.

SITUATION IN INDIA
"Company in India received an e-mail demanding a huge sum to retrieve the
domain and was given an address in Mumbai where the firm has its head office,
for the payment to be made". Standard cybersquatting. Article starts with this,
