     Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty
     when the govenment's purposes are beneficent.  Men born to freedom are
     naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded 
rulers.
     The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men 
of
     zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.

Introduction to Issue 5 - Slider
**********************************************

Re.

Welcome to issue 5, this month we have dealings with information ranging 
from
wireless communication to making your own ISP and the effect of the 
internet,
and even running Linux on a OS/390 system. So what else can you expect,
of course the Oblivion tekniq of producing documents that are worth reading 
and
absorbing.  We may not be covering stuff like 0-day hacking tekniq's, but 
instead
we are covering stuff that should be known and absorbed and then used to 
make the
internet a better place.  We are here to be an instrument for learning and 
producing
the next generation of internet users, and maybe even entertain and maybe 
even teach
the orginal members of the internet, that make it a better place even for 
us.

Big up to Elias Levy, Rhino9 and R.F.P and many others that i look upto and
follow to the greatest degree of my learning.  I have these members and many
others to thank for being where i am today.  Hey! drop us an email or visit
us on EFNet on #oblivionmag one day and tell us what you think of Oblivion
caus im sure as hell interested in what you think... and maybe,if your lucky
we might publish one of your articles!

So what has the oblivion team been up to for the last month.  Well, i have 
only
spoken to cybr about 5 times this month caus he has been unfortunatly 
working,
and pubbing/clubbing and moving house like any normal happy go-lucky 
student.
And i wonder if thats the reasons why i have applied to uni...

So i have been working by myself to both compile this months edition and 
articles.

Also, after some minor hiccup's with Project Omega, for example the host of
http://www.slidersecurity.co.uk decided to kill my RAS connection so i 
couldnt
up load the files.  But, apart from that Project Omega has gone into 
"Active"
status.  If you are interested in being tested then drop us a email, the 
page
should now be up and running and details can be found on there, on how to
contact us.  We have already 4 happy clients which we supplied "free"
solutions to.

Anyways, many thanks to people that helped me out at the start of the month 
with
my little problem.  But, that is between me and them, and not you :]

We have had alot of feed back from readers congratulating us on another 
issue, and
how they have *finally* learned something from a Ezine!  We unfortunatly 
would like
some more feed back from you the readers, and some articles!

Many thanks to the people that already have.

What has been happening in the scene's this month, well apart from a v. 
interesting
article/whitepaper published by http://www.securityfocus.com this was a very
good look of what happens in the underground scene dealing with some 
*average*
script kiddie type crackers, it goes into very good depth on how someone 
cracks into
a Solaris out-of-box install and then sets it up to do things it is not ment 
to do.

I must say i had a laugh at the IRC logs, like i said an average bunch of 
crackers.
But, i may add that the scene is not like this... Most crackers dont just 
crack
machines to setup IRC Bot's and DoS clients, most people crack into them to 
inform
an admin, repair the server, and then bugger off out, or use it to compile 
programs,
or use it as storage space. But, there are some tossers that deface pages, 
and delete
alot of ppl's hard work... unless it's a peodophile site, then good luck to 
them!

Also theres been some interesting news within the development of 
Microdrives.  IBM
claim that they have created a micro-drive capable of holding 1gig of data 
but we
have yet to see if anyone breaks that mark...  Also, it has been reported 
that the
1gigahertz processor mark has been done.

Also we have seen some interesting cracks/hacks using DNS (if u call it 
hacking/cracking)
where Nike.com was re-routed to a site which is against third world 
labour... after reading
that site, and seeing that they might only make 5 quid a week from doing a 
12 hour, day 7
days a week it kinda makes me think about them everytime i put on my 160 
quid Nike Airs...
And grab my Nike Sports bag to go down the gym...  Anyways, to find out how 
it was done check
out http://www.shameonnike.com (thats if its still up, after the legal 
battle...).

Also congrats go out to everyone that have completed there exams.

On a minor note, i will not be around for a while, well for one issue, this 
is due to
starting a new job :]
I wont know how long it will be until i have net access, or have the time to 
come online
or write articles. So dont think WTF is going on when you open next months 
issue and
theres not many texts from me ;]

So on with issue 5.

But actually, that can wait until tomorrow... caus i is off out clubbing...!
back @ 8:00 Am to goto bed and then up @ 2 - 3 to carry on...!!!

Slider.

       You can suck my dick,if you dont like my shit, caus i was high when i
      wrote this,so suck my dick, caus i dont give a fuck if you dont like 
my
     shit, caus i was high when i wrote this, so suck my dick... hah.. 
hehe...
                          suck my mother fucking dick!

Editor Comments/Rant - Cyber0ptix
**********************************************

This month has been a very busy one for me, although not much time to do
anything to do with 0blivion.org unfortunately.  Firstly I finished uni for 
the
year and started to work full time, although this may have been last month 
but I
cant remember ;o).  Also my contract ran out at my house so I am currently
crashing at a mates till the end of the month.  No computer or internet 
access
except at work!  Cant wait to get into my new house and get it all set back 
up
again ;o)

Well unfortunately caffeine appears to have a few corrupted disks ;o( SSI on 
the
site isn;t working and neither are cgi scripts.  I have mail Vortex about 
this
but so far haven't had a reply.  Damn shame cos it was a damn kewl home for 
the
web site and a nice shell for me and Slider.  Apparantly BT are threatening 
to
cut the line to the company that host the box ;o( always the killjoys arn't
they.

Ohh well keep your eyes peeled at 0blivion as I may be able to get a box
hosted with shell account access.

So Sliders been busy this month, I didn't hear from him for ages then out of 
the
blue and email saying he had nearly finsihed issue 5.  Well what can I say,
Slider keep up the great work I dont know what would happen to 0blivion 
without
you.

On that note,  I'd just like to let everyone know that we are currently 
looking
for some permanent staff to join 0blivion and help in the writing, editing
website design and any other projects that we can come up with.  Anyone that 
is
interested should email me or Slider at cyberoptix@0blivion.org or
slider@0blivion.org.  Just let us know what you want to help out with and Im
sure there is something that you could do!  If you don't want to join the 
team
but have a few articles you want publishing then mail them in and we'll get 
them
in an issue as soon as possible.

Also looking for a few projects to set up, so if anyone has any ideas but 
need
some people to help then get the ideas in and well get some sort of project 
team
set up so we can get some projects underway.  I have a great idea for a .com
business that I am currently working on getting a business plan together ;o)
yeah I think I may even go and see the bank manager!  If this goes to plan I
will be looking for people fluent in PHP, CGI, HTML, Security and online
debiting etc.  Anyone think they can help drop me a mail and I'll keep your 
name
on file for future reference if I think the idea could be viable.

Well who heard about the awsome supping power of Ewan Blair....made me proud 
to
be British, the Prime Ministers son laid in the gutter covered in
sick....reminded me of when I was 16 ;o)

[ And me, and the same again please bar tender! - Slider]

Anyways thats my little bit of info out of the way for the 
month....hopefully I
will be back online next month and contributing a lot more to 0blivion and 
get
some things sorted out.

Anyways catch ya'll later....remember #oblivionmag on Efnet

Werd to all I know, Slider, trode, wie, micron, pentium, logistix

later

CRACKED! PART 6: TELKING WITH THE ENEMY
"Soon after rebuilding the system I started talking to someone on IRC that
identified themselves as the person that had cracked our system. He was
connecting from the same places that the cracker had been coming from and
seemed to know things that only the cracker would have known, so I decided
to take him at face value. Over the first couple of weeks we talked about a
variety of subjects. I have selected some of the most interesting bits and
grouped them together to give an idea of the flavor of the conversations. It
was an interesting window into the mind of someone living a very different

**********************************************
Creating An Internet Service
Providers ( ISP's ) - Slider
**********************************************

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that has access to the 
Internet
and sells this ability to connect to the Internet to members of the general 
public.
There are various ways that a provider can be connected to the Internet;
normally a provider will be connected with some type of telecommunication 
line
that provides a much higher throughput than any one individual would need or
could afford. This throughput and cost are then shared by all subscribers.

An Internet Service Provider is not the same as an Information Service. At 
one
time it was easy to distinguish between an Internet Service Provider and an
information service, such as Compuserve or America On-Line (AOL). These
services provided access to their own network, and sometimes even allowed
e-mail to be sent to other networks. However, these types of information
services are becoming more and more entwined with the Internet and also
almost all now provide the ability to directly access the Internet.

They advertise as being Internet Service Providers and provide services
such as News, WWW and even Chat. These information services have seen
the increased opportunities available in being an Internet Service Provider.

The first and most popular service provided by Internet Service Providers is
e-mail. Initially it was considered sufficient to just provide e-mail 
access.
Nowadays, e-mail is considered to be the absolute minimum service that an 
ISP
should provide. The services that are now available range from basic e-mail 
to
a full-fledged company presence on the Internet including a home page, 
product
catalogs and secure online ordering, as well as customer support with 
real-time
audio and video.

As the Internet was beginning to become popular relatively few people had 
the
necessary hardware to access these services. To access the services properly
you need a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network
connection. Initially this type of connection was only available on 
platforms
running UNIX. In the meantime, however, this type of connection is available 
on
almost all major operating systems, from Microsoft Windows to IBMs OS/390.

- Sample Network Design for an ISP

Below is a crude example of a network design for an (ISP).

Basically this design consists of servers running software that provide 
various
services. It also includes routers that provide connectivity to the Internet 
and
dial-in access for remote users.


            SERVER#1		SERVER#N
	         \		/
		  \	       /

                    ISP NETWORK	------------ DIAL UP ------ USER

                   /           \
		  /             \
		ROUTER		 \
	        /                 \
               /                   \
	INTERNET               SERVER ADMIN

Implementing a network such as this for an ISP requires many decisions among
the various platforms, hardware, software and connectivity options. This 
text
attempts to cover some of that. It does not
provide all the information that you need in every instance, but addresses 
all
important topics and provides assistance in obtaining further information.

A decision to establish an ISP is usually a financial decision; either it is 
seen as
an opportunity to make money or to save money that is currently being paid 
to
another ISP. To protect your investment and ensure that an ISP continues to
meet its financial expectations it must be properly managed.

- Connectivity

I am begininng by examining the Internet topology to show the way an ISP is 
located
within this network.

-- Internet Topology

The Internet consists of high-speed circuits connecting routers that 
transmit data
through Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). It doesnt
belong to only one group, company or country. All the different parts belong 
to
several organizations, but the Net itself doesnt belong to anyone.

The circuits are maintained by large telecommunications companies in each
country such as MCI, Sprint, Worldcomm in the USA and Embratel in Brazil. 
The
national ISPs, such as IGN, lease high-speed circuits from the
telecommunications companies to be connected in their Points Of Presence
(POPs - not to be confused with the POP mail protocol) through routers. In 
this
way they have access to the Network Access Points (NAPs) where they can
exchange routes and traffic, shuffling information from one machine to 
another.

The largest NAPs are connected by very high-speed data circuits, often 
between
45 and 144 Mbps.

Regional and local ISPs purchase connections from these national ISPs or, in
some cases, directly from the large telecommunications companies.

Consequently they can offer Internet access and services to their customers.

Therefore, as the Internet backbone is really made up of several complex
backbones that are joined at the various NAPs, you wont be able to be
connected directly to the Internet. This is not the way it works.

You will need a TCP/IP network connection to another Internet provider that 
is
already connected to the Internet. It can be a national ISP or another ISP. 
The
ISPs who offer this type of service are usually called Internet backbone 
providers
or upstream providers.

This upstream connection gives the ISP and its customers access to the 
Internet
backbone. The customers links to the ISP, however, are called downstream
connections.

The terms upstream and downstream are used when discussing connections
from an ISP to other sites, where upstream circuits route data closer to the
Internet core while downstream connections refer to those that route 
information
further away from it. Another way of looking at it is that an ISP pays for
upstream links and charges for downstream links.

--- Internet Backbone Connection

Connecting an ISP to the Internet backbone requires several steps, including
identifying the organization that is going to provide the Internet access, 
choosing
the technology and network hardware that will be used in the connection, and
getting the domain and IP address.

* Upstream Provider

Choosing an upstream provider is one of your most critical decisions. You 
have
to choose circuits that are going to connect you and your customers to the
Internet. The capability, performance and reliability of these circuits are
important. However, as they represent a major expense, they must be chosen
carefully.

Buying an Internet connection is a lot like buying a computer. Just as when 
you
are buying a computer, your choice of an Internet service provider should be
driven by your intended use. If you are looking for minimum cost, you might
seek out the lowest-priced system in the back of a magazine or even assemble
something yourself from parts bought at a flea market. There are some 
low-cost
IP service suppliers who claim to be just as good as the others, but may not 
be
in business next year to prove it. Since you are buying something your 
business
will depend on, this is not the wisest choice. If you make the arrangements 
with
a backbone provider whose connections are small or bad, your customer base
will know it. They will feel it when using your service.

It also doesnt mean that buying the most expensive solution is going to be 
the
best choice, supporting the theory that you get what you pay for. You should
analyze the options you have carefully, paying attention to the different 
services,
price structures, peak bandwidth limitations, personal service quality and
geographical constraints.

Some topics you need to think about when evaluating upstream providers are:

╖ Network Topology

This is one of the most important criteria to consider when choosing a
provider. Looking at the network topology can help you understand how
vulnerable the network is to outages, how much capacity is available when
the network is loaded more heavily than usual, and the most important, how
well the provider understands network engineering.

╖ Network Link Speeds

It is important to look closely at the speeds of the backbone links. To be
able to do that, you should consider what kind of link services you are 
going
to provide to your customers in order to size your needs. Do you intend to
be an upstream provider to other ISPs or to just have dial-up customers?

Another point to understand is that your network connection can only be as
fast as the slowest link in the path. It doesnt matter if the node you will 
be
connected to is a T3 if the link between you and it will be only 56 kbps. 
The
limit will be the 56 kbps link, not how much capacity the T3 node has.

On the other hand, if the provider only has 256 kbps to its upstream
connection, there is no sense buying a T1 from it.

Dont forget to ask if the topology you are being shown is operational now.
Some providers like to show links that are not operational as part of their
backbone infrastructure. It is also important not to be confused between the
press release about a new high-speed network link and that link actually
being operational.

╖ External Network Links

Take a look at the external links of each providers backbone. Do they have
a single connection to the rest of the world? This is a potential single 
point
of failure. Look for multiple, direct connections to other network 
providers.

The more of these connections, the better. This shows that the provider is
concerned about external connectivity and does not want to be dependent on
some third party for interconnection. If they have a single connection to 
the
outside world, ask them how often it fails and how long they usually are
isolated. If they cant give you these statistics, are they managing their 
own
network well enough to manage yours?

One extremely important point is how far it is from the high-speed data
circuits. The performance and throughput for your customers will be related
to how close you are to the major NAP circuits.

Upgrades can also be difficult if you are far from the backbone circuits. 
Even
if you start small, youll eventually want to increase your bandwidth. And
changing your provider incurs considerable costs, both in changing IP
addresses (in most cases) and the work time to complete the task.

╖ Location

You must consider if you can connect to high-speed backbones for a
reasonable cost. The POPs locations the upstream provider offers to you are
extremely relevant. The distance from your office location to the nearest
POP can make or break your business, due to the varying level of circuit
availability and bandwidth costs.

In the former, there are some areas where there are very long lead times for
a new specific circuit.

In the latter, the provider requires that you buy the local loop segment 
that is
going to make the connection between your company office to its closest
POP. You will have to buy this directly or indirectly from one of the
telephone companies serving your local area. The local loop charges are
often the highest costs in the communications chain. So pay attention to the
whole solution cost, which must include the local loop and the service
provider fee.

╖ Technology

The technology being used to operate the network is also critically 
important.
Today, there is a great deal of commercial quality router, switch and modem
technology available from companies whose business it is to make that
equipment.

Sometimes a provider can have a bad case of the not invented here
syndrome. This is a sure sign of long-term problems. Any provider still
relying on their own internally developed equipment is doing you a
disservice. You deserve the benefits of leading-edge production technology,
not aging hardware that has been contorted into a use never intended by its
designers.

Remember, you are buying a service. The provider of this service should be
using the best available technology to deliver this service.

╖ Technical Staff

Another aspect to consider when choosing a provider is the quality of its
technical staff. They are the ones who will get your connection running to
begin with and then keep it and the network running in the future. They have
to be experienced in TCP/IP data networking.

Make sure the provider has adequate staffing to cover the usual situations.
If they send people to trade shows for a week, how many people are back at
the office running things and how skilled are they? Find out what their
technical staff turnover is. If people are leaving, find out why and who is 
left
to keep your connection operational. Many suppliers of service have single
points of failure in their staff capacity as well.

╖ Help Desk Infrastructure

Check out their help desk infrastructure. It should be 24x7 (24 hours a day
and 7 days a week) staffed by at least one person, including nights,
weekends and holidays. Make sure that they will have someone capable of
dealing with your problem and not someone who will just answer the phone
all the time.

╖ Organization

Find out how long the company has been in the IP business. Try to
determine if they are going to be in business for the long run. Quality
networks are not built on a small budget. The pricing may look attractive
now, but the passage of time often reveals hidden costs and price increases,
the greatest of which can be having to switch providers.

Another way of getting good information is by talking to other ISPs. You can
try looking up their information in some Internet forums. If you dont find
anything about whose backbone providers to use, at least you will find
whose you should not.

╖ Full Range of Services

Does your provider have a full range of services or is it just filling a 
niche? If
you need to increase or decrease your service level, will you need to switch
providers?

- Access Technologies

There is a wide variety of data circuit technology choices to connect an ISP 
to an
upstream provider. They vary from dial-up to leased lines, ISDN, frame 
relay,
ATM, satellite and cable modem as well many others.

Because there are so many options, we describe the access technologies most
commonly used.

Most ISPs use two types of available circuits: point-to-point and shared 
physical
networks.

In the point-to-point connection we can find two distinct physical 
terminations for
the link, meaning its physically connected through wires. The most often 
used
links are leased lines, from 56 kbps to T3 circuits.

In the shared network, the connection is divided among several customers and
the circuit disappears into a cloud. In this topic we discuss the frame 
relay
technology.

- Leased Lines

Leased lines (also called dedicated lines) are the most common way to 
connect
an ISP environment to the upstream provider. Here you have a private network
between you and your provider, available through twisted-pair copper wires
between the two points.

Dedicated lines are stable and reliable, and in some countries you can get 
very
cheap high-speed channels. However, as the connection is always open and
available for you, you will have to pay the full utilization of the circuit. 
The cost
of the connection depends on the distance between the two linked points as 
well.

Although this may not make much difference when the connection stays in the
same city, large increases can occur if your connection travels through 
other
exchanges. Despite the differences between the providers, the nearer the 
POP,
the better.

The bandwidth rates vary with the type of connection you will need, from
low-speed to high-speed circuits.

Although there are many different kinds of leased connections and they can 
vary
depending on the country, the most popular speed and standards are as 
follows:

╖ 56 kbps

This is an entry point for dedicated circuits and is called Dataphone 
Digital
Service (DDS). It is a digital phone-line connection capable of carrying
56,000 bps.

At this speed, a megabyte will take about three minutes to transfer. This is
3.7 times as fast as a 14,400 bps modem.

╖ 64 kbps

This is also a digital phone-line connection capable of carrying 64,000 bps.
At this basic speed rate a megabyte will take about two minutes to transfer.

This is 4.4 times as fast as a 14,400 bps modem.

It is also called DS0 (that means Data Speed 0, Digital Service 0 or Digital
Signal 0, depending on the reference book).

╖ Fractional T1

A fractional T1 (FT1 or FracT1) is a subchannel of a full T1 channel, which 
is
a percentage use of the available data channel.

A full 1.5 Mbps T1 circuit contains 24 fractional T1 lines, each with a
bandwidth of 56 or 64 kbps. The purchase of the circuit can be one or more
fractional lines. For example, a 256-kbps link can be accomplished with four
of the above channels. For 512 kbps, we will need eight channels, and so
on. Upgrades can also be done just by adding the extra fractional T1 lines
needed to the current leased channel.

Although you dont need to purchase a complete T1 line, you may be
surprised with the cost of the lower-speed connections. This is because
fractional T1 and full T1 services are not functions of the physical 
connection
speed, but have to do with choices programmed into the data
communications equipment. In this way, although FracT1 uses only some of
the available channels, you will need to purchase a full T1 circuit anyway.

For this reason the money you pay for an initial 256-kbps connection is not
equally proportional to an upgrade to a 512 kbps or a full T1.

╖ T1

T1, also called DS1, is a leased-line connection at 1.5 Mbps, that is 
1,544,000
bps. This term is used in the USA, Australia and in some other countries.

A T1 circuit has 24 channels that provide a total bandwidth of 1.536 Mbps or
1.344 Mbps and depending on the line encoding channel, 64 kbps or 56 kbps.

At maximum theoretical capacity, a T1 line could move a megabyte in less
than 10 seconds.

╖ E1

Similar to a T1 link, this standard is used in Europe, South America and in
other parts of the world.

In an E1, each circuit is composed of 32 64-kbps channels that provide a 
total
bandwidth of 2,048,000 bps. It is also called a 2-Mbps link.

╖ E3

In an E3 line there are 480 channels for a total bandwidth of 34,368,000 
bps.
Also used in Europe and other countries.

╖ T3

A T3 circuit, also known as DS3, is a high-speed leased-line connection
capable of providing 44,736,000 bps. It is equivalent to 28 T1 circuits.

As a T1 circuit is constructed from lower bandwidth slices, a T3 link 
carries
672 channels of 64 kbps. It is usually available over high-speed fiber-optic
cable, generally in large Internet backbones.

Fractional T3 lines are also available in the same way as in T1.
The previous circuits are the most often used by ISPs. However, there are 
two
other T-carrier services standards: T2 and T4.

T2 provides up to 4 T1 channels, but is not available commercially. T4 
carries
168 T1 channels for a total bandwidth of 274.176 bps.

- Frame Relay

Frame relay is a data communication interface originating from ISDN, 
designed
to provide high-speed frame or packet transmission with minimum delay and
efficient use of bandwidth. It is a variation on the X.25 interface and a 
form of
fast packet switching.

It derives its name from using the data link or frame OSI layer 2 to route 
or relay
a packet directly to its destination instead of terminating the packet at 
each
switching node. This eliminates processing overheads and increases 
throughput
speed. Its based on the ITU-TS Lap-D standard and uses variable-length
packets.

Like Ethernet or token-ring, frame relay assumes that connections are 
reliable.
It does not have error detection and error control within the network, which
helps to speed up the protocol. When errors occur, frame relay relies on 
higher
level protocols for error control.

We can also think of frame relay as a point-to-point connection, but in this 
case
we are referring to the virtual connection between two sites. They appear to
have a dedicated connection but they are actually sharing networking 
hardware
with many others.

Frame relay is offered by most large telecommunications companies and
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC) with a bandwidth range from 56
kbps to 2 Mbps. Although possible voice transport over frame relay is 
possible,
its considered to be restricted to data transport because of the constant
transmission required.

Using frame relay you will probably get a lower cost connection service. 
This is
because it works with a common cloud, where its total bandwidth is divided
among all the other customers. However, theres a standard - Committed
Information Rate (CIR) - that guarantees some amount of bandwidth. For
example, you can purchase a 512-kbps link from a frame relay provider and 
set
the CIR to 128 kbps. In this way, you can not always have 512 kbps, but you 
will
have at least 128 kbps guaranteed. But when the traffic on the frame relay 
cloud
is low, you can have up to the full 512 kbps. You pay for the CIR you 
choose, of
course.

- ATM

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a relatively new, very high digital data
transmission circuit capable of data transfer rates up to 2.488 Gbps under
experimental circumstances. However, initial implementations are around 155
Mbps or 622 Mbps.

ATM is a cell-based data transfer technique in which channel demand
determines packet allocation. It offers fast packet technology, real time,
demand-led switching for efficient use of network resources. It can deal 
with all
kinds of traffic: data, voice and video.

All information is transported through the network in very short blocks 
called
cells. In contrast to frame relay, which allows variable frame sizes, each 
cell is
always 53 bytes long - 48 bytes of data plus 5 bytes of header. Information 
flow
is along paths (called virtual channels) set up as a series of pointers 
through the
network. The cell header contains an identifier that links the cell to the 
correct
path to take towards its destination.

Cells on a particular virtual channel always flow on the same path through 
the
network and are delivered to the destination in the same order in which they
were received.

ATM is designed so that simple hardware-based logic elements may be
employed at each node to perform the switching. For example, on a link of 1
Gbps, a new cell arrives and a cell is transmitted every .43msec. There is 
not a
lot of time to decide what to do with an arriving packet.

ATM can be used in two distinct environments: carrier, provided as a service 
to
the end user, and private network, where a large organization purchases 
lines
from a carrier (or installs them itself) and builds a private ATM network.

Although ATM will be the high-bandwidth networking standard of the decade, 
it
is a technology that is maturing slowly in wide area networks. One of the 
major
problem is government regulation. In most countries, governments regulate 
the
detailed technical characteristics of everything that connects to a public
communications network. This is often called homologation, and part of its
process requires protocol testing, which is an extremely expensive and very
slow task.

At the moment, ATM is starting to appear only at the NAP level or in 
connections
between the NAPs. Its a very expensive option, but something that could be
considered in cases where T-carrier is not enough anymore.

- Other Technologies

There are some other trends to obtain bandwidth into the Internet network. 
We
discuss three of them.

Optical Cabling: In the most commonly used method of connection, through the
leased lines, the communications infrastructure is almost completely based 
on
copper lines, which increases the local loop charges.

As optical cabling becomes cheaper to install and maintain than traditional
copper wires, the telephone and cable companies are replacing aging
infrastructures with this type of cabling. With this upgraded 
infrastructure, the
ability to transmit data in the local loop will be increased, and bandwidth 
cost
will tend to climb.

Some research results show that this physical link, about the size of a 
human
hair, is able to deliver 1000 billion bps - roughly 2000 times faster than 
the
theoretical maximum of twisted pair.

Cable TV and Satellite: Other growing options for Internet access are the 
use of
cable TV and satellite. Cable Internet access has been tested in some 
countries,
while some satellite companies have been using solutions in the Direct TV
style dishes. Although there are still many restrictions for an ISP upstream
connection, these emerging technologies may be used on a large scale in 
future.

But before explaining the restrictions, you need to understand some 
concepts:
cable technology, one-way and two-way communications methods of cable
system.

The cable system technology has a starting point in each community that is
responsible for the origin of the communitys signals and the reception of 
signals
that come from satellites through the air. From this point, the signals are 
carried
in a coaxial cable throughout the community.

The transmission method called Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) 
allocates
6 MHz of bandwidth on the coaxial cable for each signal, which allows 
multiple
channels to be carried over the same coaxial cable.

In order to cover all the community, the cable is split and the entire 
signal is
reproduced on each cable after each split. This results in a tree topology.

In some ways, the cable architecture is similar to Ethernet LANs, which send 
all
the information to all hosts on the network, but only the correct host gets 
all of
the Ethernet packages addressed to it.

Although the cable system has been used by the cable companies for many
years, it has been modified due to the advances in fiber-optic transmission
technology. They are changing this tree topology to a new hybrid
fiber-and-coaxial (HFC) system. In this system fiber is used in the 
neighborhoods
and coaxial cable is used for the connection to each door. This technology 
can
transmit more information than coaxial cable because it has more frequency
ranges. Also, as it uses light instead of electricity, it can carry the 
signal for
longer distances without amplification.

Despite all these improvements, the cost of optic fiber prevents the 
telephone
companies from installing it. So theres a new configuration called
Fiber-to-Fiber-Neighborhood (FTTN) that takes optic fiber into a group of 
houses.
As a consequence, many coaxial cables are replaced by fiber while small
connections remain coaxial. In addition, the signal quality is improved, the
number of amplifiers is reduced.

This FTTN infrastructure permits the use of two-way communications, but it
depends on the geographical implementation. To bypass this situation, theres 
a
temporary solution called one-way communication.

In the one-way concept, the cable company only provides the path responsible
for receiving data, which is called downstream bandwidth (not to be confused
with a downstream connection related to ISP customers). An example of this
downstream bandwidth usage is the Web page requested information that comes
into a Web browser.

The path that sends data the other way is called upstream bandwidth. It is 
used,
for example, when you request a site page within the Web browser field. This
path has to be provided by other different connections (such as a dial-up 
line)
with an ISP. As a result, the upstream connection is slower than the
downstream one.

In two-way connection, we can have both paths on the same link, but it 
requires
HFC technology. Also it will need some changes.

First of all, adequate spectrum has to be allocated for the upstream data,
followed by the replacement of the amplifiers to divide upstream and
downstream data into the correct frequency. Finally, the cable company must
implement a method to multiplex all the upstream data from multiple users 
onto
the coaxial cable.

The satellite technology for Internet access is very similar to cable 
connectivity.
In one-way satellite communication another link is needed to perform the
upstream transmission (that is zero). This method has only been available
recently.

On the other hand, two-way transmission is well established, but only very 
few
ISPs offer this type of connection.

As you can see, the use of cable or satellite technologies to connect an ISP 
to its
upstream provider has a lot of limitations. In one-way solutions, there is 
no
upstream bandwidth and it is necessary a to have a complementary upstream
link. Two-way cable technology depends on the cable company offerings, and 
in
two-way satellite communication there are very few ISP providers.

You should consider satellite link if you are in a remote area, where 
stretching a
T1 circuit across several hundred miles can be very expensive, or if you 
want to
transmit a very large amount of data.

- Networking Hardware

In this part of the text we explain the networking hardware needed to 
connect an
ISP to its upstream provider in the two most common methods: leased lines 
and
frame relay. We are going to use below the IBM set of products because this 
is
what i am most experienced with in networking architecture.

-- Hardware Components

The basic networking hardware components for an upstream connection are
discussed in the following sections.

Router: This is the crucial equipment required in an Internet upstream
connection. Its responsible for the IP datagrams flow between the ISP and 
the
Internet core in both directions.

As the principal function is to examine the IP headers and decide where they
should be sent, it can be accomplished by a UNIX machine or a stand-alone
router. However, as this simple-seeming function has to be done at extremely
high speeds (or the consequences of errors can be disastrous), the 
stand-alone
router is recommended because it has considerably faster routing than the 
UNIX
machine.

For an initial ISP, the router must have at least two interfaces: one for 
the
backbone provider and the other to the ISP local network. However, depending
on the type of bandwidth coming to the ISP, the router may support other
interfaces, one for each dedicated data circuit.

Some important characteristics that you should observe in a router are:

╖ Performance: A router has performance characteristics measured in packets
  per second. Consequently, the more connections and bandwidth, the more
  pps is required from the router.

╖ Management: The management tools should indicate what is happening and
  allow easy adjustment and restoration of parameters.

╖ Routing protocols: The router protocol must be compatible with the one 
used
  on the other end of the data circuit. The most common routing protocols
  used on the Internet are RIP, OSPF and BGP-4.

╖ Filters: The router should include the basic filters capabilities in order 
to
  permit or not a specific packet flow, if you need basic firewall 
capabilities in
  the future.

CSU/DSU: This equipment provides the interface between the telephone
companys network and the ISP network. Although its often referred to as one
equipment, it has two distinct functions.

The Channel Service Unit (CSU) is a simple device that interfaces with the
telecommunication network. The Data Service Unit (DSU) is the data unit that
speaks to the data terminal equipment (the router) and is responsible for
filtering the digital signal, synchronizing the signal with the network 
clock and
providing networking control codes; it is similar to an analog modem. This
CSU/DSU device depends on the connection speed. In general, its a V.35
interface and is already provided in the routers with DSU functionality.

Hub: This equipment, although not directly related to the upstream 
connection,
will be present in the ISP network. It connects the equipment in the 
network,
such as routers and servers, in a star cabling topology. This helps in
management due to the fact that a defect is isolated in its segment. The 
hubs
can support several LAN types such as Ethernet, 100Base-T, token-ring, FDDI
and ATM. The most commonly used hubs are Ethernet with RJ45 connectors.

-- Upstream Hardware Connections

A DDS or T1 connection will need the following prerequisites:
╖ A communication line
╖ A CSU/DSU
╖ A router

The router will be connected both in the ISP LAN (through a hub) and in the
CSU/DSU (if not already integrated in the router). From the CSU/DSU device, 
the
telephone line will connect to the telephone companys network termination 
unit
(NTU), and then to the upstream provider.

Normally, it is the ISPs responsibility to get the equipment from the NTU up 
to
its network, but depending on the arrangement, the line can also be rented 
from
the upstream provider or from the telephone company.

In a T3 link, the connection will depend on the media purchased. If it is
delivered on two coaxial cables, you will connect them directly onto the 
DSU. (A
CSU is not required.) But if it comes in optic fiber or microwave, you will
connect them in a terminal first. The link between the DSU and the router 
can
be V.35, High-Speed Serial Interface (HSSI) or SCSI.

A typical frame relay connection has similar prerequisites than a T1, but 
the
equipment must be able to use frame relay to send data to the WAN.

Usually the ISP is connected to the nearest frame relay POP through normal
wire. The POP is responsible for the physical connection into the cloud.

- Domain and IP Address

Finally, we see the essential requisites for an ISPs Internet backbone
connection: the domain and IP addresses.

All equipment on the Internet needs an IP address. It has to be a globally
routable IP address that is allocated to you by someone and is routed by 
your
upstream provider to the rest of the Internet. But how do people get IP
addresses and domains? Before answering this question, we have an overview
of Internet domains and IP addresses, and also the organizations responsible 
for
them.

-- Internet Domains

We usually refer to the equipment on the Internet by symbolic names, which 
are
associated with IP addresses. This mapping between IP addresses and host
names is made through a group of servers called Domain Name System (DNS).

The DNS is a distributed database, because no single site on the Internet 
knows
all the information.

The domain allocation in the Internet has the objective to avoid using the 
same
name in more than one system and to decentralize the registration. 
Therefore,
the Internet was divided in distinct administrative domains in which 
equipment or
subdomains cant have duplicate names. Recursively, we guarantee that there
is only one name for each Internet equipment.

This name space is built as a hierarchical tree structure with a root on 
top.

Therefore, the symbolic name of Internet equipment is made up of a local 
name
and its domain hierarchy, called Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). This
name is separated by dots and is read from left to right, from the most 
specific
name to the highest hierarchical level.

The Internet domains can be either institutional or geographical types. In 
the
USA, the institutional domains are most often used.

For example, we could have:

www.microsoft.com
www.nasa.gov

The other countries adopted a geographical domain in the top-level domain
(TLD) by using the two-letter country code taken from the ISO standard 3166.

The second-level structure varies from country to country, but often also 
takes
the form of co or com for commercial companies, re for research groups, etc. 
In
some countries, such as Canada and France, the organizations are even put
directly below the country TLD.

Here are some examples:

www.whitchurch.cardiff.sch.uk
www.dtag.de
www.embratel.net.br

However, it should be noticed that some of the TLDs are international and 
can
be used in other countries without including the country code, for example, 
com,
org, net.

- The Registries

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the 
overall
coordination and management of the Internet Domain Name System. It is the
central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for 
Internet
protocols and especially the delegation of portions of TLDs, most of them 
the
two-letter country codes. The IANA is chartered by the Internet Society 
(ISOC)
and the Federal Network Council (FNC).

Furthermore, a central Internet Registry (IR) has been selected and 
designated
to handle most of the day-to-day administration of the DNS. Applications for 
new
top-level domains are handled by the IR with consultation with the IANA. The
current IR is InterNIC 1 .

However, the Internet activity growth has led to a further delegation of 
authority
for the domain name space to some other regional/national registries. The
InterNIC takes care of registry for the Americas that includes (but is not 
limited
to) North America, South America, South Africa and the Caribbean. Other
registration requests should be directed to the appropriate 
regional/national
registry.

- IP Address

Each computer needs to have an IP address. The routing decisions made by the
routers on the Internet rely on addressing alone.

An ISP needs to allocate a set of addresses accordingly to its dedicated
business customers, dial-in users, remote POPs, ISP-related servers and
networking equipment.

The technique used to allocate addresses is called subnetting. The routers 
on
the Internet deal with the subnetwork part of the address; their tables are
updated to determine in which data circuit the packet should be forward to. 
The
challenge to the Internet is to keep the routing tables as small as possible 
on the
very high-speed backbones and NAPs, and allow the routers in the ISPs to
handle the routing to individual business and dial-in users.

Theoretically, an ISP could get one of the three IP address classes (A, B or 
C)
that fits its needs. However, as there are no class A addresses anymore, and
few class B, most ISP networks are assigned multiple class C address blocks.

A class C network block uses the network mask of 255.255.255.0, meaning that
there are 255 addresses available. An ISP may assign an entire class C block 
of
addresses to a business or may further subnet the block of addresses to 
service
multiple businesses. For example, if the network mask is changed to
255.255.255.248, then eight addresses are available to that particular 
customer.

From the Internet point of view, any class C address that is within the ISPs
range gets routed to the ISP.

- How to Get IP Addresses

You can get your IP address range directly from your upstream provider or
through the regional register. However, the best (and easiest) way of 
getting
your IP address space is by getting it from the upstream provider, who also 
got
its address space from its upstream provider or directly from a registry.

The provider will give you IP addresses that come from the IP address space
allocated to its backbone. It can use subnetting or CIDR techniques.

These globally unique addresses owned by the upstream provider are called
Provider Access (PA) IP addresses. When a customer terminates the contract
with the provider, any assigned PA addresses must be relinquished. The
advantage is that these addresses can minimize the network routing tables,
resulting in better performance. This is the policy the IANA recommends to 
be
adopted.

If you do not want to get the IP range from a service provider you must 
apply
directly to the regional registry responsible for your country.

You will receive Provider Independent (PI) IP addresses. They are also 
globally
unique addresses, but are owned by the customers and can be transferred from
one provider to another. Its use is mandatory you have upstream connections
with different providers.

Unlike PA addresses, the routing of PI addresses through the Internet is not
guaranteed; if the size of the network routing tables gets too large, ISPs 
may
remove PI addresses from their tables. For this reason, the use of PI 
addresses
is not recommended, and the use of PA addresses encouraged.

Finally, as the address allocation is very important for the ISP (from what 
is
actually being used to what is available) the ISP should carefully map out 
the
addressing strategy before getting it. In fact, when an ISP contacts any 
provider
to get an IP subnet, it will require a network topology diagram and 
engineering
plans. And to require more than one you will probably have to prove this 
need
and guarantee that most of the addresses will be used immediately.

- How to Obtain a Domain Name

As discussed before, to use domain names we need to resolve host names into
their corresponding IP addresses. These functions rely on machines called
name servers. In a typical Internet dial-up connection, the name server is
located in the provider. Thats because the customer uses his or her 
providers
domain name, and normally only for e-mail.

However, as you will be the provider, you will probably want to have your 
own
domain name server so you can have more flexibility to provide services to 
your
customers. For example, if you have Web hosting services for a set of
businesses, each one will want a unique home page for their customers. To do
that, you need a primary DNS that also refers to other alternate addresses 
and
aliases.

Finally, for a domain name registration its necessary to contact the 
regional
registry. This task can be accomplished directly (by you) or indirectly (by 
your
provider).

- Downstream Connections

The principal objective of an ISP is to offer services to users so that they 
are
able to access the Internet and its resources. Thats where the ISP earns
money.

Therefore, the downstream connections are the second fundamental item of
Internet connectivity.

- Types of Users

The following are the different types of customers an ISP could have:

╖ Home Users

These are the individual users, commonly called small office/home office
(SOHO) users. They usually get connected to the Internet to access Web
pages and e-mail services. As a rule, this kind of user accesses the 
Internet
during non-working hours and weekends. These are the most typical
customers of an ISP.

╖ Corporate Users

These are business customers who connect their networks to the Internet.
Typically they use the Internet to provide a Web site, to communicate with
their other locations and customers, and to provide Internet access to their
employees. Their heaviest traffic is during business hours.

╖ ISP Customers

These are other ISPs that will also resell Internet access and services to
their customers. This a smaller market, so you will need to have enough
resources to be able to offer these services.

- Access Issues

For customers to be able to access the Internet and its resources, they will 
need
to access their ISP LAN servers first. There are two ways of providing this
remote connection: through dial-up or dedicated circuits, depending on the
customer type and needs. They are available through SLIP or PPP protocols.

- Dial-Up Connection

This is the simplest kind of connection, commonly made available through the
conventional telephone lines and modems in which the connection speed may
vary from 9.600 bps to 33.600 bps. These physical devices are used with 
enlace
protocols that make the users equipment available to run TCP/IP 
applications.

The analog modem is most typical, but digital systems (ISDN) have also been
used. The digital system connection speed carries 128 kbps.

This is the most common access type used by SOHO or even by business
employees whose companies dont have a network connection. Normally, these
users have access to the following ISP services.

╖ TPC/IP tools such as WWW, ftp and telnet
╖ E-mail server
╖ News
╖ Their own Web home pages

- Dedicated Connection

Here theres a permanent link available, usually through private line, where 
both
the ISP and the customers LANs are connected through routers. Switched
packet networks, such as frame relay, can also be used.

The corporate and the ISP customers are the ones who utilize this kind of 
link.
Despite the issues for an ISP customer, the typical services offered in this
category are:

╖ IP and DNS negotiation with the responsible registry
╖ Secondary DNS server
╖ Primary DNS server (optional)
╖ News feed
╖ Web hosting

- Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)

ISDN is an acronym for Integrated Services Digital Network, in which it is
possible to gain the benefits of digital speeds or connectivity without 
using
dedicated lines. From voice and data to complex images, full-color video and
stereo quality sound, all are transmitted with digital speed and accuracy 
through
what is now a totally digital network. ISDN replaces todays slow modem
technology with speeds of up to 128 kbps (kilobits per second) before
compression. With compression, users in many applications today can achieve
throughput speeds from 256 kbps to more than 1,024 kbps, more than a megabit
per second.

Digital lines are almost totally error free, which means that the slowdowns 
and
errors typically encountered in todays modern transmissions are no longer a
problem. A single ISDN line can serve as many as eight devices: digital
telephones, facsimiles, desktop computers, video units and much more.

Each device, in turn, can be assigned its own telephone number, so that
incoming calls can be routed directly to the appropriate device. Any two of
these devices can be in use at the same time for voice for data 
transmissions,
and the lines can also be combined for higher data speeds. In addition, an
almost unlimited number of lower-speed data transmissions (for e-mail, 
credit
card authorization, etc.) can go on at the same time. In most cases, the 
same
copper wires used today for what is typically called plain old telephone 
service
can be used successfully for ISDN. This means most homes and offices are
ISDN-ready today.

That are three types of ISDN services:

╖ Basic Rate ISDN (BRI)

The BRI service has three data channels: two 64-kbps 3 B (bearer) channels
and one 16-kbps D (delta) channel. The B channels carry voice and data,
and the D channel is responsible for the control or signaling information. 
Its
also possible to use both B channels together and get 128 kbps.

The BRI interface uses two twisted pairs of copper wires.

╖ Primary Rate ISDN (PRI)

In the PRI service there are 23 64-kbps B channels and 1 64-kbps D channel,
that provides a total bandwidth of 1.544 Mbps. In some countries the number
of B channel are 30 or 31, which gives a bandwidth of 2.048 Mbps. The B
channels are combined to be used according to the needs: data
transmission, phone lines, etc.

This service is utilized in the ISP side to connect the BRI customers.

╖ Broadband-ISDN (B-ISDN)

This is a the proposed advanced version of ISDN for providing speeds of
155.52 Mbps and higher. However, the standards and switching technology
that will work this fast are under development. The B-ISDN promises
universal coverage based on ATM/SDH technologies and optical fiber.

Although ISDN has been available for many years, it has just beginning to
become popular with users. In some countries it may not even be supported.

- SLIP and PPP

Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) are 
always
associated with dial-up connections protocols. Although they are actually 
widely
used in part-time Internet connections over analog modems, they can be used
for full-time connections as well.

However, these protocols are solutions that have two requirements: the
connection point number must be two and the link must be full-duplex. Then
they are used in dial-up connections over analog modems, in leased-line
connections with routers and even with ISDN. Frame relay and X.25 are also
possible.

The SLIP is just a very simple protocol designed quite a long time ago and 
is
merely a packet framing protocol. It defines a sequence of characters that 
frame
IP packets on a serial line, and nothing more. SLIP has been replaced by PPP
because of the drawbacks:

╖ It cannot support multiple protocols across a single link; all packets 
must be
  IP datagrams.

╖ It does no form of frame error detection which forces retransmission by
  higher level protocols in the case of errors on noisy lines.

╖ It provides no mechanism for compressing frequently used IP header fields.

Many applications over slow serial links tend to be single-user interactive
TCP traffic such as TELNET. This frequently involves small packet sizes and
therefore a relatively large overhead in TCP and IP headers which do not
change much between datagrams, but which can have a noticeably
detrimental effect on interactive response times. However, many SLIP
implementations now use Van Jacobsen Header Compression. This is used
to reduce the size of the combined IP and TCP headers from 40 bytes to 8
bytes by recording the states of a set of TCP connections at each end of the
link and replacing the full headers with encoded updates for the normal case
where many of the fields are unchanged or are incremented by small
amounts between successive IP datagrams for a session. This compression
is described in RFC 1144.

PPP addresses these problems. It has three main components:

1. A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.

2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing 
the
   data link connection.

3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and 
configuring
   different network layer protocols. PPP is designed to allow the 
simultaneous
   use of multiple network layer protocols such as IP, OSI, IPX, etc.

   Before a link is considered to be ready for use by network layer 
protocols, a
   specific sequence of events must happen. The LCP provides a method of
   establishing, configuring, maintaining and terminating the connection. 
LCP goes
   through the following phases:

   1. Link establishment and configuration negotiation: In this phase, link 
control
      packets are exchanged and link configuration options are negotiated. 
Once
      options are agreed upon, the link is open, but not necessarily ready 
for
      network layer protocols to be started.

   2. Link quality determination: This phase is optional. PPP does not 
specify the
      policy for determining quality, but does provide low-level tools, such 
as echo
      request and reply.

   3. Authentication: This phase is optional. Each end of the link 
authenticates
      itself with the remote end using authentication methods agreed to 
during
      phase 1.

   4. Network layer protocol configuration negotiation: Once LCP has 
finished the
      previous phase, network layer protocols may be separately configured 
by the
      appropriate NCP.

   5. Link termination: LCP may terminate the link at any time. This will 
usually
      be done at the request of a human user, but may happen because of a
      physical event.

The IP Control Protocol (IPCP) is the NCP for IP and is responsible for
configuring, enabling and disabling the IP protocol on both ends of the
point-to-point link. The IPCP options negotiation sequence is the same as 
for
LCP, thus allowing the possibility of reusing the code.

One important option used with IPCP is Van Jacobsen Header Compression
which is used to reduce the size of the combined IP and TCP headers from 40
bytes to approximately 4 by recording the states of a set of TCP connections 
at
each end of the link and replacing the full headers with encoded updates for 
the
normal case where many of the fields are unchanged or are incremented by
small amounts between successive IP datagrams for a session.

This compression is described in RFC 1144.

- Other Technologies

There are new technologies that have just been started to be used by SOHO
users. We discuss some of them: wireless, cable and satellite.

Wireless When we talk about wireless access, theres always a confusion
between wireless WANs and wireless LANs. The wireless LANs are local area
networks that allow devices with radios to connect to local servers. These
radios use the direct sequence spread spectrum technology. The wireless link 
is
between a PC and an access point wired to a wired LAN connected to a server.

The user with a PC or terminal with one of these radios must be in the local
vicinity of a wireless access point for his wireless LAN adapter to work.

The WAN radios required to connect to servers that are located far distances
away from where the user machine actually is are very different than the LAN
radios described previously. The WAN radios act the same as wired modems
that you may be familiar with. When you use a WAN radio, you connect to a
service provider (not an ISP but one that provides wireless connectivity to 
its
customers) such as AT&T, RAM Mobitex or ARDIS. These providers offer their
customers the ability to use a radio that wirelessly connects to their 
services
from which they can connect to the existing worldwide telephone service.

For example, a thinkpad with a wireless WAN radio would dial out on a 
special
number and get connected to its ISP via a TCP/IP link, the same as if it 
plugged
in a modem to a phone line. The main difference is that its *phone line* is
actually a wireless connection to a wireless service provider.

The key components in wireless WANs are PCMCIA adapters that represent the
latest in wireless communication.

Cellular Digital Packet Data ( CDPD 4 ) is unique to the Advanced Mobile 
Phone
Service ( AMPS ) cellular network, the largest in the United States.

Advanced Radio Data Information Service ( ARDIS 5 ) provides interactive,
real-time data communications throughout the U.S. and Canada. The IBM
2489-600 with integrated Wireless Modem for ARDIS supports automatic
nationwide roaming, which means users can move seamlessly from one city to
another and still communicate. The use of this radio modem requires the
purchase of ARDIS services from a service provider.

Mobitex runs on the RAM Mobile Data 6 network that serves some European
countries and about 8,000 cities across the United States with fax, e-mail,
two-way messaging and server applications. The IBM 2489-600 with integrated
Wireless Modem for Mobitex consists of an integrated PCMCIA adapter (not yet
available in EMEA) with an integrated antenna.

Due to distinct country differences in communications standards, it is 
currently
impossible to say one network provides wireless WAN services in EMEA. In 
most
cases, analog data is transmitted using a cellular-enabled modem with a
handheld phone. GSM/DCS 1800 data wireless networks are further made up of
GSM, the digital equivalent of AMPS, and DCS 1800, an 1800MHz system with
similar protocols to GSM and a data adapter. CT2 (Cellular Telephone) is a
short-range campus and public network. It requires an integrated
adapter/transceiver connected to a local base station for campus work that 
is
connected to a PSTN for WAN communications.

- ISP Networking Hardware

Downstream Hardware Components
The basic networking hardware used in the connections between the ISP and 
its
customers are:

╖ Remote Access Server

The Remote Access Server (RAS) is the device used to connect the remote
PCs of the users through dial-in connections. It is also called terminal 
server
because historically it was used to connect character-based terminals to
interactive hosts. Usually its contains one LAN interface that is attached 
to
the hub, and many serial ports where the modems are connected.

The first function of an RAS is to capture the authentication information 
from
the client and then ask the authentication server for approval. Once the
authorization is approved, the protocol switches to PPP, and the RAS gives
an IP address to the client. The IP address given is based on a user name,
port or a pool of addresses. In this way, the client is in the ISP LAN and
therefore can have its IP packets forward to the Internet.

The RAS are available in two different kinds of solutions: in a server with
multiserial adapters or in a distinct hardware, that can be integrated or 
not
within a router. The server-based solution has the advantage of being
cheaper. However, the second one has some important features. Its not
connected to the server. As in a LAN theres usually more than one RAS.

In case of failure only one RAS goes down and the other users still have
access to the LAN while in the server everybody looses contact. It is also
highly scalable and manageable. Another point is that it alleviates the
server load.

╖ Modem

This device is used between the RAS and the telephone lines. Its function is
to modulate an outgoing binary bit stream to an analog carrier, and
demodulate an incoming binary bit stream from an analog carrier.
The standards defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
are:

- V.32
Up to 9.600 bps for use over dial-up or leased lines.

- V.32 bis
Up to 14.400 bps for use over dial-up or leased lines.

- V.42
Its not for modem, but for error control procedures.

- V.42 bis
Data compression technique for use with V.42.

- V.34
28.800 bps for use over dial-up line V.42. With the addition of V.42 bis
compression, in theory it can reach up to 115.200 bps.

- V.34-1996
It provides two additional, optional data transmission speeds of 31.2 and
33.6 kbps. Further enhancements to supporting protocols allow devices
implementing V.34-1996 to deliver more robust and more frequent 26.4
and 28.8 kbps connections. With additional, optional speeds of 31.2 and
33.6 kbps, modems implementing the V.34-1996 standard can
communicate at speeds up to 16.6 percent faster than existing V.34
modems.

Although several different names were used to describe this new
revision of the V.34 standard (for example, Rockwell suggested V.34+ or
V.34 Plus and Lucent Technologies ▓extended rate V.34▓), in October
1996, Study Group 14 of the ITU-T standards committee finalized the
naming of the new standard as V.34-1996.

There are four areas of improvement that distinguish devices
implementing V.34-1996 from those using the initial version of the
standard:

	- Higher Data Rates
	The potential for increased communication speed and faster data
	throughput always attracts the most excitement in a new or revised
	standard. In many instances, using modems that support the
	optional connection speeds of 31.2 and 33.6 kbps in the V.34-1996
	standard should provide attractive performance gains in real-world
	operation. Faster file downloads and reduced online connection
	charges are key potential benefits to the end user.

	- More Frequent High-Speed Connections
	Testing by Xircom and its modem ASIC partners indicates that on
	about 60 percent of networks currently supporting 26.4-kbps data
	transmission, the enhancements in V.34-1996 offer 2.4 to 4.8 kbps
	improvement in connection speeds.

	- V.8bis
	The original V.34 standard includes a component protocol known as
	V.8. This protocol specifies the negotiation startup or handshaking
	procedures used between modems before a data exchange. The
	V.34-1996 proposal includes an updated startup protocol, V.8bis,
	providing quicker connection initialization. Additionally, while certain
	types of echo canceling equipment previously caused V.8 to fall back
	to V.32bis automode negotiation (limiting speed to a 14.4 kbps
	maximum), V.8bis delivers a true V.34-protocol connection. V.8bis
	also improves faxing, reduces connection delays and provides more
	reliable support when switching between fax and telephone
	operation.

	- Signaling System 5 Problem Resolved
	Most modern telephone networks in the United States use Signaling
	System 7 (SS7) protocols to manage data transmission between
	central office (CO) switches. However, some older COs still use an
	earlier version known as Signaling System 5 (SS5). Two
	first-generation V.34 modems communicating between COs using
	SS5 occasionally experience connection failures. In V.34-1996, the
	startup algorithms are modified allowing successful operation on
	older networks using SS5.

The ISP must be concerned about the quality of the modems. As some have
more reliable quality calls than others, it can avoid having unanswered 
calls,
downgrade to a lower speed, disconnection in the middle of the call and
unability to reset after disconnection.

At the moment theres a new 56 kbps modem technology that has been
revolutionary in Internet communications. Its an asymmetrical modem
modulation scheme that provides data transmissions speeds up to 56 kbps
downstream over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It takes
advantage of todays Internet access where a customers analog modem
connects to a site that is linked to a digital telephone network.

In a connection between two analog V.34 modems, the telephone network
converts the analog signal transmitted from the first point modem to a 
digital
signal. It is then transmitted to the the second point, where its converted
back to an analog signal.

The analog information must be transformed to binary digits in order to be
sent over the PSTN. The incoming analog waveform is sampled 8,000 times
per second, and each time its amplitude is recorded as a pulse code
modulation (PCM) code. The sampling system uses 256 discrete 8-bit PCM
codes. Because analog waveforms are continuous and binary numbers are
discrete, the digits that are sent across the PSTN and reconstructed at the
other end approximate the original analog waveform. The difference
between the original waveform and the reconstructed quantized waveform in
this analog-to-digital conversion is called quantization noise, that limits 
the
communications channel to about 35 kbps.

However, the quantization noise affects only analog-to-digital conversion, 
not
digital-to-analog. This is the fundamental point of this technology: taking
advantage of having direct access to the digital telephone network at one
side of the connection instead of the analog loop. In this way, in a
communication between a home user and an ISP with a digital link to the
PSTN, theres no analog-to-digital conversions in the server-to-client path
data transmission. This eliminates the quantization noise and makes
possible a higher transmission rate.

The upstream direction data flow remains slower because the
analog-to-digital conversion must still be made at the client side.

This technique is specially indicated for the Internet access. The
requirement of having digital access to the PSTN to one side is satisfied,
since most ISPs have one T1, for example. And the other end connects
through an analog line, that is typically the case of the ISPs customers. 
The
Internet access is also the best application. Nowadays the customer
downloads files, graphics and games (that always require more and more
bandwidth) and send usually only mouse clicks in the upstream
transmission.

To take advantage of this technology, its necessary to have a pair of
equipments: a server modem at the ISP and a modem at the customers
house. No special lines are required, but both modems equipments must be
of the same supplier. This is because the basic concepts are similar, but 
the
protocols are not the same. More importantly, the 56-kbps technology is not
a standard. In October 1996, the ITU-T formed an initial working group to
begin the lengthy standardization process.

It is expected that this process will take at least 18 months and likely 
longer.
Additionally, several companies have received patents on proprietary 
algorithms
that are core to the 56-kbps technologies. For example, we have the 56flex
(from Rockwell and used by Motorola) and the x2 (from 3Com and used by 
USRobotics).

It is likely that an extended period of licensing battles will need to be 
resolved
before the widespread acceptance of 56 kbps is a reality.

- Downstream Hardware Connections

Finally, we have the typical networking environments for the ISP downstream
connections.

In the most often offered connection, analog dial-up with modems, the ISP 
will
need:

╖ RAS
╖ Modems
╖ Telephone Lines

The RAS will be connected in the ISP LAN hub and in the modems through its
serial ports. Depending on the RAS ports number, it will be necessary to 
have
more than one to attend the whole number of users.

The customers will then make a call to the ISPs telephone numbers to get 
their
connections into the LAN. They will need a PC and a modem (integrated or 
not)
and PPP or SLIP to be able to do that.

On the other hand, if the connections will be made by ISDN, the RAS must 
have
PRI support, and the modems will be replaced by CDU/DSUs.

The ISDN service will connect from the telephone company switch to the home
user through a two-wire cable. Then it will connect to a Terminal Adapter 
(TA),
a kind of ISDN modem, that can be either a stand-alone unit or an interface 
card
within the PC. If in North America, a Network Termination 1 (NT1) will be
required between the telephone company and the TA.

If the customer has a LAN, it will be necessary to include an NT 2, which is
usually a router or bridge with a LAN adapter.

For the corporate customers that require dedicated connections, the usual 
way
of establishing these links is through routers in both sides. The RAS is not 
used
in this case.

Im not going into detail about downstream user connections.  If you do want 
details
about it, then email me, and if i have the time i will put something 
together for you!

- Internet Services

There are several services you should consider supporting for your user 
base.

It is important to note that you wont be expected to run a server for every 
single
service discussed here. You should treat this list as food for thought. You 
may
also find that some, or all of these services may be provided either free
(included in the cost of your link), or at an additional cost from your 
upstream
provider.

Throughout this chapter, server refers to the program running on one of your
machines providing the service being discussed. You will be able to run more
than one server on each machine in most cases.

- Domain Name Service

The Domain Name Service (DNS) has become the glue that binds the Internet
together. It provides a mechanism for converting easy-to-remember names such
as www.0blivion.org, into the less easy to remember IP addresses that are 
used in
the underlying protocols. It is also used for other services, for example, 
using a
special record in the DNS. You can make use of your upstream providers mail
backup servers (if they provide that service). DNS issues are discussed in 
the
comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains news group.

- Berkeley Internet Name Daemon

Before you can register any domains you need to have the domains configured 
on a name
server. If you choose to run your own name server, the most commonly used
server is Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND, which is now maintained by
the Internet Software Consortium (ISC). Other DNS implementations have been
made available, but the majority of name servers in the field are either 
running
BIND, or a product that is based on BIND. BIND is released in source code
format for free by the ISC, and a lot of effort has been made to support as 
many
operating systems as possible.

If you are running UNIX as your server platform, the chances are that the
provided DNS daemon is an (albeit out of date) implementation of BIND.

The support Web page for BIND can be found at http://www.isc.org/bind.html 
and
it includes lots of links to other DNS-related sites. BIND has its own 
support
newsgroup: comp.protocols.dns.bind.

- Mail Service

It used to be the case that if you provided an e-mail address for your 
users, then
you were classed as an ISP. Although this perception has changed, e-mail is
still a critical service to provide. Your users will expect at least one 
e-mail
address from you, most ISPs now provide around three e-mail addresses per
account.

You will need two mail servers, one to your users to collect their ow mail 
(POP
server), and one to receive the incoming mail and place it on the POP server
and allow your users to send mail (SMTP server or relay).

- POP Server

Because your dial up users wont be connected to the Internet 24 hours a day,
they wont always be connected when somebody sends them mail, so you will
have to hold their mail for them, until they pick it up.

The most common method of mail retrieval by clients is via the POP3 (Post
Office Protocol Version 3). The users e-mail software connects to the POP
server, logs on with a user ID and password, downloads any waiting mail,
deletes the mail from your server and disconnects.

Most UNIX operating systems come with a POP server supplied, but there are
several alternatives available on the Internet.

- Internet Mail Application Protocol

Internet Mail Application Protocol, currently at Version 4 (IMAP4), is less
common than POP3, but is gaining popularity all the time. The most 
significant
difference between POP and IMAP, is that IMAP clients leave the mail on the
server, rather than downloading the messages and removing them from the
server as POP clients do. IMAP provides folders on the server to provide a
remote mailbox which can be manipulated in the same way as local mailboxes.

- SMTP Server

The way that e-mail is sent from source to destination has changed very 
slightly
since it was first used. It used to be the case that the source machine 
connected
directly to the target machine, transferred the note and disconnected. If 
the
target machine was down, then the source machine would try again later, and
keep trying until either the mail was delivered, or some time-out limit was
reached. However, some machines wanted to receive e-mail, but werent
directly connected to the Internet. This was accomplished by placing mail 
relays
on the Internet that knew how to contact these non-Internet connected 
machines.

These principles still hold, but the mail relays now have an extra role to 
perform,
as some, or all of your customers wont be connected to the Internet 24 hours 
a
day, so if the destination is down, their machines may not be able to retry. 
The
solution to this, is for you to provide a mail relay for them. In this case, 
the
users e-mail software sends the mail to your mail relay, which then attempts 
to
send it on to the destination on behalf of the user.

Every single UNIX implementation comes with a mail server. The most popular
one is Sendmail which is supported by its author, Eric Allman
(http://www.sendmail.org/). Sendmail is not without some very subtle bugs
though. It is highly recommended that if you choose Sendmail, you keep
updated with any fixes or new releases.

- Web Service

In todays Internet, you are nobody without a Web site. Your users will also
expect some space on your Web server to put up some pages of their own. This
could be accomplished by either asking your users to e-mail you their Web
pages and graphics for you to upload onto the Web server, or by giving each
user FTP access to their own area on the Web server.

- FTP Service

FTP or File Transfer Protocol is a simple protocol that is supported by all 
Internet
server and client platforms. An FTP server can be used to distribute updates 
to
client programs to your users, and your users may want to share data with 
other
people via FTP.

* Management

Though the planning and setup of your ISP will initially require all your 
attention,
once your ISP has been established you will be spending most of your time
managing your ISP resources. The manner in which you manage these
resources is a critical factor in the success of your ISP. Success means 
being
able to provide customers with high levels of service and performance. This 
is
essential to ensure your customers satisfaction. Proper management will 
allow
you to react to network outages or increased customer demand. You will need
to manage the users that have access to your system, the amount of time they
spend on your system, the amount of time others spend looking at their
offerings, as well as your own connection to the Internet.

- Authentication

Anytime a modem is added to a network, the network becomes more vulnerable
to security breaches. An ISP, of course, wants to guard against such 
break-ins.

However, valid users must be permitted to access the services that you 
provide.

The security system that an ISP puts in place must not be so cumbersome as 
to
cause valid users difficulty in accessing the system. All popular 
authentication
solutions keep track of users and their authorizations. When a user attempts 
to
access your services a sequence of identification is performed.

The typical identification sequence consists of obtaining a user name and
password from the user and then verifying this through the authorization 
system.
If the user name and password are correct, the user is granted access to
specific resources on the network. If the conditions of the log-in process 
are not
met, the user is denied access to the network.

There are many different varying ways to connect to a network below is a 
few.

- Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol/Password Authentication
  Protocol (CHAP/PAP)

The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of 
encapsulating
Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point links. PPP also 
defines
an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an
Authentication Protocol for authenticating its peer before allowing Network 
Layer
protocols to transmit over the link.

After a PPP link has been established, PPP provides for an optional
Authentication phase before proceeding to the Network Layer Protocol phase.
By default, authentication is not mandatory. If authentication is desired, 
the
Authentication Protocol Configuration Option must be specified during the 
link
establishment phase.

These authentication protocols are intended for use primarily by hosts and
routers that connect to a PPP network server via switched circuits or 
dial-up
lines, but might be applied to dedicated links as well. The server can use 
the
identification of the connecting host or router in the selection of options 
for
network layer negotiations. CHAP and PAP are two authentication protocols 
for
PPP links.

- PAP

The Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) provides a simple method for the
peer to establish its identity using a 2-way handshake. This is done only 
upon
initial link establishment.

After the link establishment phase is complete, an ID/password pair is
repeatedly sent by the peer to the authenticator until authentication is
acknowledged or the connection is terminated.

PAP is not a strong authentication method. Passwords are sent over the 
circuit
*in the clear*, and there is no protection from playback or repeated trial 
and
error attacks. The peer is in control of the frequency and timing of the 
attempts.

Any implementations which include a stronger authentication method (such as
CHAP, described below) must offer to negotiate that method prior to PAP. 
This
authentication method is most appropriately used where a plain text password
must be available to simulate a login at a remote host. In such use, this 
method
provides a similar level of security to the usual user login at the remote 
host.

-- CHAP

CHAP basically uses a random challenge, with a cryptographically hashed
Response which depends upon the challenge and a secret key.

CHAP is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a 
three-way
handshake. This is always done upon initial link establishment and may be
repeated anytime after the link has been established.

A typical protocol sequence is as follows:

1. After the link establishment phase is complete, the authenticator sends a
   challenge message to the peer.

2. The peer responds with a value calculated using a one-way hash function.

3. The authenticator checks the response against its own calculation of the
   expected hash value. If the values match, the authentication is
   acknowledged; otherwise the connection should be terminated.

4. At random intervals, the authenticator sends a new challenge to the peer,
   and repeats steps 1 to 3.

CHAP provides protection against a playback attack by another peer through 
the
use of changing identifiers and variable challenge values. The authenticator 
is
in control of the frequency and timing of challenges.

This authentication method depends upon a secret known only to the
authenticator and that peer. The secret is not sent over the link.

Although the authentication is only one-way, by negotiating CHAP in both
directions the same secret set may easily be used for mutual authentication.

Since CHAP may be used to authenticate many different systems, name fields
may be used as an index to locate the proper secret in a large table of 
secrets.

This also makes it possible to support more than one name/secret pair per
system, and to change the secret in use at any time during the session.

CHAP requires that the secret be available in plaintext form. Irreversibly
encrypted password databases commonly available cannot be used.

It is not as useful for large installations, since every possible secret is
maintained at both ends of the link.


-- Kerberos

The Kerberos Authentication and Authorization System is an encryption-based
security system that provides mutual authentication between the users and 
the
servers in a network environment. Kerberos performs the following functions 
for
a system:

╖ Authentication to prevent fraudulent requests/responses between users and
  servers that must be confidential and on groups of at least one user and 
one
  service.

╖ Authorization can be implemented independently from the authentication by
  each service that wants to provide its own authorization system. The
  authorization system can assume that the authentication of a user/client 
is
  reliable.

╖ Permits the implementation of an accounting system that is integrated,
  secure and reliable, with modular attachment and support for charge backs
  or billing purposes.

The Kerberos system is primarily used for authentication purposes, but it 
also
provides the flexibility to add authorization information.

In the Kerberos system, a client that wants to contact a server for its 
service,
first has to ask for a ticket from a mutually trusted third party, the 
Kerberos
Authentication Server (KAS). This ticket is obtained as a function where one 
of
the components is a private key known only by the service and the Kerberos
Authentication Server, so that the service can be confident that the 
information
on the ticket originates from Kerberos.

The Kerberos Authentication Model permits only the service to verify the 
identity
of the requestor and gives no information on whether the requester can use 
the
service or not. The Kerberos Authorization Model is based on the principal 
that
each service knows the user so that each one can maintain its own 
authorization
information. However, the Kerberos Authorization System could be extended
and used for authorization purposes. Kerberos could then check if a 
user/client
is allowed to use a particular service.

- Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a good example of an
open and easily integrated authentication protocol. The RADIUS server allows
or denies access to the network. It allows all security information to be 
located
in a single, central database, instead of scattered around the network on 
several
different devices. It creates a single, centrally located database of users 
and
services. It also performs extensive tracking and logging of user 
activities.

-- Terminal Access Controller Access System (TACACS)

Originally, TACACS allowed a router that accepted dial-up access to accept a
user name and password and send a query to a TACACS authentication server,
sometimes called a TACACS daemon or simply TACACSD. This server was
normally a program running on a host. The host would determine whether to
accept or deny the request and sent a response back. The router then allowed
access or not, based upon the response.

While routers accepting dial-in access are no longer a major presence on the
Internet, terminal servers are. Cisco Systems terminal servers implement an
extended version of this TACACS protocol. Thus, the access control decision 
is
delegated to a host. In this way, the process of making the decision is 
opened
up and the algorithms and data used to make the decision are under the
complete control of whoever is running the TACACS daemon. For example:

Anyone with a first name of Joe can only log in after 10:00 p.m. 
Monday-Friday,
unless his last name is Smith or there is a Susan already logged in.

The extensions to the protocol provide for more types of authentication 
requests
and more types of response codes than were in the original specification.

The original TACACS protocol specification does exist. However, due to
copyright issues, it is not publicly available. RFC 1492 An Access Protocol
Sometimes Called TACACS was written to alleviate this lack of access. This
version of the specification was developed with the assistance of Cisco 
Systems,
who has an implementation of the TACACS protocol that is believed to be
compatible with the original specification. To be precise, the Cisco Systems
implementation supports both the simple (non-extended) and extended 
versions.

It is the simple version that would be compatible with the original.

In this protocol a request/response pair is the basic unit of interaction. 
In this
pair, the client sends a request and the server replies with a response. All
requests must be acknowledged with a response. This requirement implies that
all requests can be denied, although it is probably futile to attempt to 
deny a
logout request.

- Network Management

If an ISP is to remain competitive, then it will have to effectively manage 
its
network. It will be necessary to determine if the connection to the Internet 
is
operational and what the actual throughput of the network has been.

Network Management consists of all the activities and products that are used 
to
plan, configure, control, monitor, tune and administrate your computer 
network.

This can be extremely complex dependent upon:

╖ The number and variety of network components for example, servers,
  modems, routers and gateways
╖ System mix: for example, operating systems, protocols and versions
╖ Geographic location of components
╖ Number of companies involved
╖ Number of services provided

Unfortunately managing all these different aspects has been characterized by
individual management tools. Each vendor offers its own interfaces for the 
same
management task, requiring knowledge of each management tool. Fortunately,
tools are appearing that help to provide a global view of the system.

Management via a global view of the system is accomplished through 
integrated
network management.

Essential to integrated network management is that the managed components
deliver information in a format that can be interpreted independent of the
product originating the information. This requires standardization of 
interfaces
and protocols.

- Standards

The current network management framework for TCP/IP-based Internets consist
of:

1. SMI (RFC 1155) - Describes how managed objects contained in the
Management Information Base (MIB) are defined.

2. MIB-II (RFC 1213) - Describes the managed objects contained in the MIB.

3. SNMP (RFC 1098) - Defines the protocol used to manage these objects.

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) issued an RFC detailing its
recommendation, which adopted two different approaches:

╖ In the short term SNMP should be used.

The IAB recommends that all IP and TCP implementations be
network-manageable. At the current time, this implies implementation of the
Internet MIB-II (RFC 1213), and at least the recommended management
protocol SNMP (RFC 1157).

Note that the historic protocols Simple Gateway Monitoring Protocol (SGMP),
RFC 1028 and MIB-I (RFC-1156) are not recommended for use.

╖ In the long term, use of the emerging OSI network management protocol
(CMIP) would be investigated. This is known as over TCP/IP (CMOT).

Both SNMP and CMOT use the same basic concepts in describing and
defining management information called Structure and Identification of
Management Information (SMI) described in RFC 1155 and Management
Information Base (MIB) described in RFC 1156.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet standard protocol.
Its status is recommended. Its current specification can be found in RFC 
1157 -Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

MIB-II is an Internet standard protocol. Its status is recommended. Its 
current
specification can be found in RFC 1213 - Management Information Base for
Network Management of TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II.

Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and Common Management
Information Services (CMIS) are defined by the ISO/IEC 9595 and 9596 
standards.
CMIS/CMIP Over TCP/IP (CMOT) is an Internet proposed standard protocol. Its
status is elective. Its current specification can be found in RFC 1189 - 
Common
Management Information Services and Protocols for the Internet (CMOT) and
(CMIP).

OIM-MIB-II is an Internet proposed standard protocol. Its status is 
elective. Its
current specification can be found in RFC 1214 - OSI Internet Management:
Management Information Base.

Other RFCs issued by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on this subject 
are:

╖ RFC 1052 - IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network
             Management Standards

╖ RFC 1085 - ISO Presentation Services on Top of TCP/IP-based Internets

╖ RFC 1155 - Structure and Identification of Management Information for
             TCP/IP-based Internets

╖ RFC 1156 - Management Information Base for Network Management of
             TCP/IP-based Internets

╖ RFC 1215 - Convention for Defining Traps for Use with the SNMP

╖ RFC 1227 - SNMP MUX Protocol and MIB

╖ RFC 1228 - SNMP-DPI: Simple Network Management Protocol Distributed
             Programming Interface

╖ RFC 1230 - IEEE 802.4 Token Bus MIB

╖ RFC 1231 - IEEE 802.5 Token-Ring MIB

╖ RFC 1239 - Reassignment of Experimental MIBs to Standard MIBs

╖ RFC 1351 - SNMP Administrative Model

╖ RFC 1352 - SNMP Security Protocols

- Structure and Identification of Management Information (SMI)

The SMI defines the rules for how managed objects are described and how
management protocols may access these objects. The description of managed
objects is made using a subset of the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1, ISO
standard 8824), a data description language.

- Management Information Base (MIB)

The MIB defines the objects that may be managed for each layer in the TCP/IP
protocol. There are two versions, MIB-I and MIB-II. MIB-I was defined in RFC
1156, and is now classified as an historic protocol with a status of not
recommended.

The list of managed objects defined has been derived from those elements
considered essential. This approach of taking only the essential objects is 
not
restrictive, since the SMI provides extensibility mechanisms such as the
definition of a new version of the MIB and definition of private or 
non-standard
objects.

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

The SNMP added the improvement of many years of experience in SGMP and
allowed it to work with the objects defined in the MIB with the 
representation
defined in the SIM.

RFC 1157 defines the Network Management Station (NMS) as the one that
executes network management applications (NMA) that monitor and control
network elements (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These
network elements use a management agent (MA) to perform the network
management functions requested by the network management stations. The
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate
management information between the network management stations and the
agents in the network elements.

Im not going to go into details on this one due to the fact that i could 
fill an
entire article just on the same subject.  Maybe later in another issue.

- Common Management Information Protocol over TCP/IP (CMOT)

CMOT is the network management architecture that has been developed to
move towards a closer relationship with the Open System Interconnection 
(OSI)
network management standards named Common Management Information
Protocol (CMIP). With these premises CMOT, as in the OSI model, can be
divided into an organizational model, functional model and informational 
model.

In the organizational and informational models the same OSI concept is used 
in
CMOT and in SNMP. The object identification is formed using the subtree
related to the DoD with subdivisions in management, directory, experimental 
and
private. All the management objects are defined in the Management 
Information
Base (MIB) being represented by the Structure and Identification of 
Management
Information (SMI), a subset of the ASN.1 (OSI Abstract Syntax Notation 1).

In the functional model CMOT adopted the OSI model that divides the
management components into managers and agents. The agent collects
information, performs commands and executes tests and the manager receives
data, generates commands and sends instructions to the agents. This manager
and agent are formed by a set of specific management information per
communication layer named the Layer Management Entities (LME).

All the LMEs are coordinated by a System Management Application Process
(SMAP) that can communicate between different systems over the Common
Management Information Protocol (CMIP).

In the OSI approach the management can occur only over fully established
connections between the managers and the agents. CMOT allows management
information exchange over connectionless services (datagram).

And yet again, we can fill anotehr article on this, check it out in the 
future.

Seeing as we have the defaults laid down on a ISP, its now the subject you 
have
been waiting for.  Security !!!

- Internet Security

Many companies are thinking of connecting their internal corporate networks 
to
the Internet, and for good reasons. There are many rewards associated with
both increased visibility and the opportunity to run new types of 
applications.

At the same time, companies are concerned with the security of their 
systems.

The Internet is a collection of connected networks, but nobody really knows 
the
structure of the Internet. The Internet keeps changing all of the time. 
There is
no centralized network management and no single authority is in charge.

All data crossing the Internet is passed *in the clear* such as user names,
passwords, and e-mail messages. The entire company is exposed to the outside
world.

In this text, we take a layered approach to securing your ISP when attaching
it to the Internet. We strongly recommend not connecting your ISP to the
Internet until you are 100% sure that you have thoroughly reviewed security 
and
that the TCP/IP applications you have chosen to use across the Internet are
properly and securely configured.

Network security is a key component of Internet security and in this chapter 
we
provide some elements that will help you to evaluate the need for a firewall 
or
not.

- The Costs of Security Breaches

LetÆs take a quick look at how much poor security costs both business and 
the
U.S. government each year. The size of the figures involved should help you
concentrate on implementing the appropriate security measures at your own
site.

According to information released by the U.S. SenateÆs Permanent 
Investigations
Subcommittee, intruders cost big business more than US $800 million last 
year.
In most cases, the attacks on their systems and the resulting losses were 
not
reported to law-enforcement agencies for fear that an extended investigation
with its attendant publicity would harm the corporation.

The report indicates that the problem is worse in private industry than in
government computer systems, with intruders concentrating on banks (always a
popular target) and hospitals, where cases of record-altering are on the 
rise. Of
the US $800 million losses, about half, or US $400 million, were incurred by 
U.S.
companies and the rest by companies operating in other countries.

According to this same report, there were an estimated 250,000 attacks on 
the
U.S. Department of Defense computers last year, and the rate of attack is
doubling every year. And these are the attacks that were detected. Who knows
how many were either undetected or went unreported for other reasons. Recent
attacks on unclassified U.S. Department of Defense computers are reportedly
successful 65 percent of the time.

Some of these attacks were considered of nuisance value only, but some were 
a
serious threat to national security. One of the best documented took place
during spring 1994 at an Air Force laboratory in Rome, NY. Two intruders 
made
more than 150 trips into the labÆs computer systems, collecting passwords 
from
outside users and then using these passwords to invade more than 100 other
computers attached to the Internet. An investigation led to the arrest of 
one of
the intruders, a 16-year-old boy living in London, England. The other 
intruder
was never identified and never apprehended.

The problem is certainly considered serious because more than 90 percent of
the PentagonÆs daily traffic is carried by unclassified computer systems
connected to the Internet, and anyone tampering with logistical information 
or
shipping information could cause chaos to military operations.

When intruders gain access to your Web site, they may do one of several 
things.
They may deface your Web pages with a message such as "The system has
been Cracked!" or they may erase your Web site pages and replace them with
their own. Sites as diverse as the British government, the American
Psychoanalytic Association, and the Nations of Islam have suffered from such
attacks in the recent past.

- The Internet and Security

A few years ago, security wasnÆt a major concern for most sites connected to 
the
Internet. As far as the universities participating in the Internet were 
concerned,
the basic premise was to provide free access to everything, and if a few 
people
took advantage, that was the price you had to pay. Many universities on the
Internet still follow this philosophy and impose few restrictions of any 
kind. Most
control access with only a user ID and a password, and many still allow
anonymous use of their systems; anyone can log on without a valid user ID 
and
a password.

The huge potential for commerce on the Internet has changed much of this
thinking, and many system and network administrators now feel that any user 
of
their site is a potential for intrusion. This is actually true. Therefore, 
they
usually begin with the premise of *donÆt trust anyone*. Today, this is 
definitely
the best policy.

- Defining Security Threats

The most common security threats range from complete network infiltration to
simple virus contamination. Some threats are accidental, and others are
malicious; some affect hardware, and others affect software.

- Internal Threats

Internal security problems are probably the most common. Users entrusted 
with
certain levels of access to systems and hardware can be a major threat if 
not
controlled and monitored carefully. Put simply, you never know what someone
is going to do. Even the most loyal employees or workers can change their 
tune
and get into a malicious mode, wreaking havoc on your computing environment.

Check your workersÆ backgrounds, references, and previous employers 
carefully,
and routinely change and audit your security methods.

- External Threats

External security threats are the most problematic. You never know when an
outsider will attempt to breach your systems or who the perpetrator may be.

Some people go to great extremes to gain access to your systems and
information. There are many documented cases of outsiders easily gaining
access to systems that were assumed to be protected. Even the Department of
Defense admits that its computer systems were attacked more than 250,000
times in 1995. That statistic alone should stop you in your tracks and make 
you
think a bit. It has been recently theorized that a well-funded group of 
computer
hackers could bring the entire country to a screeching halt within 90 days 
with
almost no trouble at all.

- Intruders Are People

Intruders may use your own policies and routines against you. Any intruder
could pose as a person from one of your departments or come in as a worker
representing another firm that would normally be considered non-intrusive.

Someone posing as part of the cleaning crew; as a utility worker, as a 
building
inspector, as an insurance official, and so on could have only one purpose:
gaining the knowledge needed to infiltrate your network. You can even assume
that people are digging through your trash looking for keys to assist them 
in
breaching your systems. You need to understand that anything is possible and
that people will do anything to get what they want.

Beware of strangers asking questions about how the system works, and never
give anyone your password. The notorious Kevin Mitnik used very subtle
persuasion techniques that came to be known as social engineering to first 
gain
peopleÆs confidence and then their passwords.

- How Intruders Break In To Your System

Intruders break in to your system in any number of ways. With the advent of 
the
Internet, lots of UNIX software is being ported to Windows NT and other
operating systems, and so are a lot of the security holes in that UNIX 
software.
This means that your seemingly harmless and brand new software may in fact
be a new generation of an age-old problem.

- Sendmail

Intruders have traditionally used services that run on computers to gain 
access
to them. One of the most widely used holes is in Sendmail and its many
derivatives. Sendmail can actually assist a potential intruder in creating 
files,
altering files, and even mailing sensitive files to the intruder. Go over 
your mail
server software carefully, and find out its origins. If it turns out to be a 
Sendmail
port from UNIX, use the UNIX hacking techniques against it.

- Checking CGI Scripts

Web servers by themselves pose only moderate security risks, particularly 
when
protected by a firewall or a proxy server. But the one concern is how your
system uses CGI scripts. Your Web server may be configured to create HTML
pages on-the-fly using a script written in Perl or in some other scripting
language.

When considering these external programs, ask these questions:

╖ Can a knowledgeable attacker trick the external program into doing
  something that you donÆt want it to do?

╖ Can a knowledgeable attacker upload an external program and have that
  program execute on your system?

You can minimize the threat from both these sources by using some of the
techniques that will be discussed later in this chapter and by ensuring that 
your
Web server does not contain anything that you donÆt want revealed to the
outside world.

Do not take it for granted that someoneÆs really nifty Web enhancement 
software
is completely safe and harmless. Writing CGI scripts is not particularly 
easy,
and writing secure scripts can be a job for the experts. You cannot 
completely
assume that some programmer is writing a nice little CGI script to 
complement
your Web site, one that you wonÆt be able to resist trying out and that will
invariably put the holes in place that others need to infiltrate your 
systems and
networks.

Lots of programmers hide backdoors, tricks, and traps in their seemingly
harmless software for their own convenience in testing and debugging and 
then
forget to remove these elements when they release the package. You may think
you have just downloaded and installed the worldÆs greatest page counter,
whereas in reality you have just installed an open door on your system. 
Always
test shareware and freeware thoroughly on a stand-alone system, and ask
others for their reviews on the software before you can place it on one of 
your
production servers. Otherwise, you may lose everything.

- FTP Problems

FTP can be a real problem, and you should take great care when configuring
your FTP server. Double- and triple-check your file permissions for every 
FTP
user account. Log on as that user, and ensure that the access is restricted 
in
the way you want it. Additionally, many intruders use anonymous FTP servers 
to
upload and stash pirated software, cracking tools, and other illegal 
material that
you do not want on your FTP server. One easy way to protect your site is not 
to
allow users to upload files to your FTP site; just let them download the 
material
you originally established the FTP server to manage and distribute. If it is
important that you allow uploads, set the directory permissions so that you 
have
to explicitly specify who can upload files.

- Telnet Problems

You need to be aware of the potential exposures you can have when you enable
a Telnet server:

╖ The Telnet server cannot restrict a user from getting a sign-on display if 
the
  Telnet server is already started. There is no anonymous Telnet support.

╖ When you type your user ID and password, both flow *in the clear* across
  your network. Hackers on the Internet or on your intranet can use sniffers
  (line-tracing equipment) to access your logon passwords.

╖ The number of sign-on attempts is equal to the number of system sign-on
  attempts allowed multiplied by the number of virtual devices that can be
  created. This increases the number of attempts a hacker can try to log on 
to
  your system. Because of this, attacks can turn into denial of service.

╖ The Telnet server application does not provide good logging procedures.

- E-Mail Problems

There are a few risks associated with electronic mail; some examples are
forging mail or snooping mail that might contain confidential or private
information. But accepting e-mail opens the door to three major exposures 
that
we cover in more detail in this section:

╖ Denial-of-service attacks:
Incoming mail, if it makes the form of mail bombing, can tie up your
computer resources (disk space and processor) to the point where your
server is put out of commission. Although we worry about this type of
attack, in practice, you can probably have similar effects from an accident
such as a chain letter or a few huge images (MIME attachments) sent to your
users.

╖ Downloading viruses:
Attachments sent in e-mail can be stored in a shared folder or in the
integrated file of the POP3 server and from there they can be downloaded to
other usersÆ PCs or POP3 clients.

╖ Snooping on POP3 user ID or password:
Standard POP clients send the userÆs ID and password in the clear;
therefore, anyone snooping on the connection can see them. On the AS/400
system, for example, each POP user needs a user profile and directory entry
so if someone is able to capture the POP userÆs ID and password, they also
get the user ID and password of an AS/400 user. If the intruder manages to
get hold of a powerful user profile (for example, one with *ALLOBJ special
authority), the intruder can cause much damage to your system.

╖ Snooping on sensitive e-mail:
You need to think about the exposure of sending sensitive or confidential
information over the Internet. Depending on your own environment, you
might need to use alternative methods to exchange sensitive information.

- Spoofing Your System

Some intruders may attempt to use spoofing to gain access to your systems.
Spoofing is the process of replacing parts of the TCP/IP header with bogus
information in an effort to fool your firewall or proxy into thinking that 
the
network traffic came from an allowed and trusted origin. Be sure your 
firewall
can prevent this sort of trickery, and implement its prevention fiercely.

-- What Should You Secure?

When you devise your security measures, you should think of a layer approach
to security. When you connect an ISP to the Internet, there are many points
where security is compromised and, therefore, that you should protect. You
should think of this layer approach as a system with multiple locks; if a 
hacker
manages to break one of them, you have others to protect you.

- Network Security

Network security control access to your ISP. Who is allowed to enter your
corporationÆs network to access your Internet server? Probably you do not 
want
to generally limit the access but it is a major issue to protect your 
internal
network and the productive systems within your companyÆs internal network.
Network security can be achieved in various ways:

╖ Isolating the Internet servers
╖ Multiprotocol router blocking from non-wanted TCP/IP traffic
╖ Securing the network gateway (usually called a firewall) to protect the
  company-internal network

Internet network security also determines how your own users may access the
Internet.

- Application Security

Each application that you can use on your ISP connected to the Internet such 
as
HTTP, FTP, Telnet, and so on offer different alternatives to limit access 
and make
it safe to use.

- Transaction Security

Commercial transactions through the Internet require safe communications. 
The
parties need to be identified and exchanged data has to be protected. In 
this
case:

╖ How can you perform authentication without sending an user ID and
  password in the clear?
╖ How can you protect the privacy of your data to ensure that only 
authorized
  persons may read it?
╖ How can you assure that messages have not been altered between the
  sender and the recipient?

There is a single technology that provides the foundation for solving all of 
these
challenges called cryptography. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an
industry-standard providing cryptography.

- System Security

Depending of the operating system, an OS/400 for example, you can have a
strong set of security tools, but you must take the time to learn about the 
tools
and apply them.

There are various areas of the systemÆs security to be considered before
attaching your system to the Internet:

╖ System-wide security values
╖ User profile and password management
╖ Resource security
╖ General TCP/IP definitions

Im not gonna go into them, cos i havent got anymore time.  I may stick this 
in as
a later text cos i want to get this into oblivion this month.

The Net Effect - Spyderco Psyops
**********************************************

	Ars ipsi secreta magistro, Jean Robert du Carlet, 1644.

THE Internet has dramatically altered the way many people perform numerous 
tasks
communicating with one another, shopping, banking, making travel 
arrangements, keeping
abreast of the news. Now add to the list political and human-rights reform. 
Proponents
in those fields assert that the Internet and the World Wide Web have become 
essential
tools for effecting change. But critics contend that the medium is often 
least
available where it is most needed.

The ongoing struggle for democracy in Indonesia underscores the power of the 
Internet.
Last spring protesters bypassed the state-controlled media there by posting 
a Web site
containing a database that kept track of the corruption of then president 
Suharto.
People across the country were continually adding information about the 
accumulated
wealth of the president and his children, knowledge of which fuelled an 
already
inflammatory situation. Students also relied on the Internet to co-ordinate 
their
demonstrations, which eventually led to Suharto's resignation.

Indeed, political dissenters and human-rights organizations around the world 
have taken
advantage of the Internet's ability. The Zapatista rebels have exploited it 
to garner
support among international journalists and sympathizers against the Mexican 
government.
The Free Burma Coalition uses its Web site to encourage consumers to boycott 
companies doing
business in Myanmar. And the Digital Freedom Network routinely posts on the 
Web the writings
of political dissidents, such as Ra·l Rivero of Cuba, who are censored in 
their homelands.
"To build up on-line communities with such limited resources is amazing,"
notes Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China, a group based in New York City, 
which uses the
Internet to organize letter-writing campaigns. Adds William F. Schulz, New 
York executive
director of Amnesty International USA, "the Web is a critical new took that 
we now have.
It has increased our ability to funnel information."

For their part, governments face a quandary: How do they cobble together 
restrictive
policies that will help them maintain the status quo 'without' stifling the 
Web's many
business benefits? Because of Indonesia's solid economic growth before the 
recent
downturn, the country had a hands-off policy toward the Internet, which many 
companies
had used to communicate with suppliers and customers across the sprawling 
archipelago
nation. But the same medium that enabled firms there to monitor the status 
of their
factories and inventories also allowed dissidents to mobilize.

Meanwhile the Internet's role in political and human-rights reform has been 
evolving
beyond mere information dissemination and calls for action. On Mexican 
Independence Day,
thousands of people staged a "virtual sit-in" to protest the government 
treatment of
Zapatista rebels in Chiapas. The digital demonstrators tried to overwhelm 
targeted Web
sites, including those of Mexican president Ernesto Zedilla, reportedly by 
using an
automated software program to issue repeated phony requests to download 
information.

Other groups have gone further, breaking into systems and defacing 
web-sites. Last
October, soon after the Chinese government had launched a new Web site to 
proclaim
its efforts in human rights, hackers replaced the home page with one 
containing a
diatribe: "China's people have no rights at all, never mind Human Rights." 
Other
"hacktivists" have plied their craft to protest conditions in various 
areas--among
them East Timor, Indonesia; Kashmir, India; and Kosovo, Serbia--knowing all 
too well
that attacking a government is usually much easier electronically than 
physically. And
often the main reason for such electronic rabble-rousing
is not the actual acts themselves but the follow-up media attention that can 
garner
quick, world wide publicity for a cause.

John Vranesevich, considered as a media whore by some people, including 
myself and
founder of AntiOnline, a Web site that tracks hacker activities, predicts 
that the
number of such electronic exploits will escalate in the future as the first 
generation
of young hacker matures. "These hackers are becoming politically minded," 
Vranesevich
says. "They are starting to vote, and they are starting to take a look at 
the world
around them. Now they are using the skills they've honed to make their 
opinion heard.
" Bronc Buster, a pseudonym for the 26-yar-old who led the attack on the 
Chinese
human-rights server, recalls that when he first saw that Web site he was 
outraged.
"Two years ago, when I was a freshmen, I had to do a huge paper on China for 
one of
my political science classes, so I knew what was happening over there,"
he says. "When I went to that site and read what was on it, I got extremely 
mad. It
reminded me of the Nazis saying the Holocaust never happened."

Yet while some people have proclaimed the dawning of a new age in electronic 
activism,
other caution that the Internet's effect may be grossly exaggerated. Of a 
total world
wide population of about six billion people, only a tiny fraction is wired, 
and most
of that is in North America, Europe and Japan, geographic areas not 
particularly known
for political tyranny or egregious human-rights violations. For this reason, 
critics
say the view of the  Internet as a juglenaut for implementing sweeping 
reforms is an
overblown, North-centric perspective. "How many people in the world have 
never even
made a phone call? Maybe a third to a half. And how much impact do you think 
the Web's
having on them?" asks Patrick Ball, senior program associate for the Science 
and Human
Rights Program of American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The North-South dichotomy could worsen as the experiences of countries such 
as Indonesia
and China make other nations wary of going on-line. In Saudi Arabia, for 
example, Internet
service providers must apply for a license through the government, which 
requires that
Web traffic be filtered through state-controlled proxy servers. And a host 
of governments
have stepped up their efforts to make certain activities illegal, if for no 
other reason
than instill a chilling effect among the general populace. Last spring a 
Shanghai software
engineer was arrested for allegedly sending a list of the e-mail addresses 
of thousands of
Chinese to a U.S.-based dissident publication. Such acts notwithstanding, 
countries have
also been loath to pull the plug on the Internet, fearing that the medium 
will be essential
for their future economic success.

But the greates value of the Internet certainly goes far beyond the actual 
numbers of
people on-line, asserts Jagdish Parikh of Human Rights Watch in New York 
City. "How many
people in China have Internet access? Not many," he notes. "But then why is 
the
government there rushing to make laws restricting access? It's because the 
Internet makes
people realize that they should have the legal, codified right to 
information."

Linux on OS/390 - Slider & 0mega1
**********************************************

&lt;MuFtAk> s/390 sucks
&lt;Slider> Another happy user then?

I wrote this shit caus there is so many retards out there that think their 
cool
when they bitch about S/390 and Linux, Y00 no nothing biatchs :]

	"HerE We G0 AgaIn, He'S gOnnA Say sOmeThiNg BrIGht..."

The strengths of S/390 are well known. Rock solid reliability, the ability 
to
run multiple diverse workloads and highly scaleable technology make S/390 an
ideal choice for hosting key e-business applications. Now Linux has joined 
the
S/390 family of operating systems bringing a wealth of open source
applications, middleware and trained talented developers to help you respond
to your business challenges quicker than ever before.

	       "SouNdS Gr00veY, Can iT HavE My BaBys?"

It doesn't matter if you are dot-com company or a bricky,
the Internet and e-business are now changing everything from the way we
interact and reach customers; how we work with our partners; our suppliers,
their suppliers; our contractors and sub-contractors, in fact the products,
processes and procedures that make our very organizations.

Through these changes, we face an era of business innovation, an era in
which opportunity and complexity may go hand in hand. However, it doesn't
have to be that way. Through the adoption of truly open industry standards 
we
can reduce and eliminate much of the complexity and allow business
innovation to flourish.

Yet, we are witnessing only the emergence of e-business! The initial 
solutions
and approaches resemble the initial steps of a child, random, some what
uncoordinated, many taken very quickly with occasional stumbles. Yet, as it 
is
with a small child, this is also an essential part of the growth and 
maturity of
the e-business, and the Next Generation of e-business solutions.

Some people feel, that like a child, the e-business will take 20-years to
become fully mature, fully useful and to be able to fulfil its destiny. It 
is not
important if you agree with this or not, what is important that you 
recognize
and accept that we are at the crossroads of a number of interdependent
generations of technologies. Web browser and web server technologies,
wireless and mobile devices, web application programming all serve the
Internet/e-business arena.

Yet all face a rapid succession of changes and progression as the new
business requirements of the Internet and new technology force a never
ending succession of revisions, extensions and re-examination of what is
used, how it used and what we can do we it.

In this environment there appear to a number of established and emerging
technologies that will continue to evolve at a rate and in a way that can 
benefit
both users, developers and suppliers and which seem to offer the biggest and
best opportunity to support the rapid progression and evolution of the 
Internet
and e-business towards maturity.

- Native S/390 Installation and operation of Linux

-- In a native LPAR on S/390

Linux can be installed on S/390 hardware via VM, VSE and on a native LPAR.
The intent of this bit is to step you through the process of building an
IPLable Linux for S/390 tape, IPLing from it, customizing a new file system
and IPLing once more but from DASD.

--- Assumptions

* It is assumed that the installer has access or can work with an individual
  who does have access to an OS/390 operating system in order to do the
  following:

	- ftp files from a work station to OS/390
	- a userid capable of submitting JCL to copy code and create 3490 IPL
	  tapes.
	- authorization to vary devices online and offline

* Access to a tape drive such as a 3490 and of course a 3490 (or
  equivalent) tape. Make sure you know the unit address/device number of
  the tape drive.

* Access to a Hardware Management Console (HMC)

* All downloaded code mentioned in this chapter came off of the version
  2.2.15 Marist distribution dated 05/19/00.

--- Skills and resources required

		"SkilLs, WoT ThE fUck aRe SkiLLs BiatCh?"

You may be saying, "IÆm a Linux "GuRu" programmer. Why should I be
worried about where, what and how Linux is installed as far as hardware is
concerned?". He/she is correct, once Linux is activated. But obviously 
before
this is true, some planning and prior knowledge like the following is 
required:

* Either doing it yourself or having a "system programmer"-type carve out a
  partition for Linux out of an OS/390 Central Electronics Complex (CEC). I
  doubt if you will have a whole dedicated machine for this. We have seen
  that a mixture of both Linux/Unix skills and OS/390 skills is required for
  the Linux for S/390 install.

* At least read access to the system IOCDS to see the subchannel path id
  (chpid) layout of the Linux partition

* Direct access storage device (DASD) and its layout that will be used by
  the Linux for S/390. How much DASD is required, Linux will only be able to
  access 64 DASD devices. If you only expect to IPL from tape to satisfy
  your curiosity then DASD will not be needed.

* Limited knowledge of the text editor vi.

* If connectivity through a network is desired then knowledge of the network
  is required. The following information should be obtained before
  attempting a Linux for S/390 networkenabled install.

*- Type of network device (OSA2 token ring or ethernet, CTC, or ESCON)
*- Host name of the Linux for S/390
*- IP address of the Linux for S/390
*- Peer IP address (for CTC or ESCON), or
*- Broadcast IP address (for OSA2, typically x.y.z.255)
*- Gateway IP address (for OSA2)
*- Domain name server IP address
*- Subnet mask
*- Network address (typically x.y.z.0)
*- DNS search domain (i.e. www.slidersecurity.co.uk)

- Hardware preparation

			"nOw whErE tHe FucK dId I pUt It?"

Linux for S/390 runs on a separate partition. It does not run on top of the
OS/390 operating system as you may think like Unix System Services.

* A minimum of 1 cpu is required. It need not be dedicated. However in
  order to better monitor the partition and debug problems, we would
  recommend that you first install and test on one dedicated processor and
  then change that when the system goes into production.

* Linux for S/390 has a maximum RAM size of 2Gb. Therefore it would be
  uncessary to allocate more than 2 Gb of central storage for your Linux
  partition. The absolute minimum amount of storage required for Linux for
  S/390 is appoximately 12MB. But your possibilities are limited with such a
  system. Of course this will vary from installation to installation since 
we do
  not know what the reader of this book intends to do with the Linux for

  S/390 system. We do recommend you have a minimum system of 64MB.

  This should be enough to do daily Linux work for 1-5 users and have a
  webserver running.

* At the time of writng this book, the kernel version 2.2.14 contained a
  maximum number of devices limitation. That is, if more than 1000 devices
  were configured online to the Linux for S/390 partition, the kernel would
  get confused on IPL and hang. No error messages would be displayed, no
  disabled wait state either. This limitation was lifted with the kernel 
version
  2.2.15. This version of the kernel was IPLed by us and run but on an LPAR
  that did not have over 1000 devices online to it. Therefore, that aspect 
of
  2.2.15 has not been tested.

As a minimum we recommend only the required device chpids to be online for
the Linux for S/390 partition during its first installation. They are:

*- DASD (if more than a tape IPL is expected)
*- 3490 tape drive
*- OSA card or communication equivalent

Hardware used
The following are the specifications of the system used to install and
customize Linux for S/390 during the writing of this text. This does not
mean that the system you use must adhere to the same specifications.

	System: 		9672-X77
	Central storage: 	768Mb
	Expanded storage: 	64Mb (not accessible)1
	Cpus: 			2 (shared)
	Chpids: 		3 online (DASD, tape drive and OSA card)
	OSA card: 		OSA-2 Token Ring/Ethernet (10Mbit)

-- Activating Linux for S/390

To install Linux for S/390 on a native LPAR you will:

1. Build an IPLable tape from downloaded code
2. Activate your Linux for S/390 partition via tape
3. Format direct access storage device (DASD) and create file systems if
   DASD IPL is desired
4. Uncompress a file system on the formatted DASD
5. Customize files on the file system
6. Create and activate swap space
7. ReIPL from DASD

And that is the quick way, at the time of writing this text the installation 
part
written by 0mega1 had not been completed :[

So if anyone really, really, really wants it then i might be able to bug him 
until
he gives it to me to send out... But no promises :[  - Slider

- Linux for S/390 bootup and shutdown

At this point we assume you have a Linux for S/390 system up and running
and have seen many messages during initial load of Linux for S/390. Lets
have a closer look at what happens at system startup and shutdown time.

		"ThIs bIt GeTs Fun BiaTch's"

-- Kernel initialization

To boot the system the Linux for S/390 kernel is loaded into memory from
either intrd-Image (ram disk) or from the hard disk (dasd) you created with 
the
silo command.

At initialization time the kernel prints messages to the system console
protocol ling the process. Most of the messages are saved in the system log
files.

Display of the current active kernel parameters from the parameter file,
these parameters are:

root= device corresponding to the root filesystem. The parameter ro
      (read-only) tells that the root filesystem should be mounted
      read-only for filesystem check. Later during the system startup it
      is remounted read-write. Noinitrd has to be specified when the
      kernel is compiled with ramdisk support but there is no ramdisk.

      Here are two examples:

      /dev/ram0 ro points to the ramdisk
      /dev/dasda ro noinitrd points to a disk

mdisk= mini disks that are associated to the system in the order of
       device node assignment.

dasd= DASD devices that are associated to the system in order of
      device node assignment.

-- System init and inittab

The kernel starts the init process (which always has the process id 1) which
first reads /etc/inittab. This file describes which processes are started at
bootup and which processes should be started and or restarted after
termination in a running Linux environment. Inittab syntax is specified in a
fixed format code:runlevel:action:command.

	code 		2-4 character identifier (usually only 2)
	runlevel 	specifies by runlevel number where this command is executed
	action 		determines what to do, possible actions are :
	initdefault 	sets default runlevel
	sysinit 	basic system init that runs only once at boot time
	respawn 	restart the command if terminated
	wait 		wait for completion before doing anything else
	command 	the command to execute

-- Basic system initialization

For basic system initialization init calls rc.sysinit (/sbin/init.d/boot for
SuSE) as specified in the sysinit row of /etc/inittab. This shell script
activates the necessary modules like the lcs device driver, synchronizes the
system clock with the underlying layer (TOD or simulated by VM) and checks
and mounts the filesystems. Our rc.sysinit looked like this:

	[root@0wned init.d]# cat rc.sysinit
	. /etc/sysconfig/network
	# Source functions. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
	insmod /lib/modules/2.2.14/net/lcs.o

-- Linux runlevel

After basic initialization the system switches to a so called runlevel which
means that a certain set of processes are started. Several different 
runlevels
are available:

The runlevels 0 and 6 are reserved for system usage, runlevel 1 should be
kept unchanged for emergency assistence. Runlevels 2-5 have a predefined
behaviour but they are open for modification by the system administrator.

       +----+----------------------------------------------+
	run	level description
       +----+----------------------------------------------+
	0 	Halt the system
	1 	Single user mode
	2 	Multiuser mode without NFS
	3 	Multiuser mode
	4 	Unused
	5 	Multiuser mode with graphical login (X11)
	6 	Reboot the system
       +----+----------------------------------------------+

You can find the scripts executed by the rc script in the directory
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ (/sbin/init.d/ for SuSE). One example is the netsetup
script started at the first Linux boot to create the network parameter files 
like

/etc/HOSTNAME, /sysconfig/network and

/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-&lt;ip-dev>.

These scripts that manage startup and stop of certain services (typically
daemons) have a common structure that define a set of possible actions like
start, stop, status, restart and reload. The syslog script that starts the 
syslog
daemon may serve as an example:

	[root@0wned init.d]# cat syslog
	#!/bin/sh
	#
	# syslog Starts syslogd/klogd.
	#
	#
	# chkconfig: 2345 30 99
	# description: Syslog is the facility by which many daemons use to log \
	# messages to various system log files. It is a good idea to always \
	# run syslog.
	# Source function library.
	. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
	[ -f /sbin/syslogd ] || exit 0
	[ -f /sbin/klogd ] || exit 0
	RETVAL=0
	# See how we were called.
	case "$1" in
	start)
	echo -n "Starting system logger: "
	# we don't want the MARK ticks
	daemon syslogd -m 0
	RETVAL=$?
	echo
	echo -n "Starting kernel logger: "
	daemon klogd
	echo
	[ $RETVAL -eq 0 ] && touch /var/lock/subsys/syslog
	;;
	stop)
	echo -n "Shutting down kernel logger: "
	killproc klogd
	echo
	echo -n "Shutting down system logger: "
	killproc syslogd
	RETVAL=$?
	echo
	[ $RETVAL -eq 0 ] && rm -f /var/lock/subsys/syslog
	;;
	status)
	status syslogd
	status klogd
	RETVAL=$?
	;;
	restart|reload)
	$0 stop
	$0 start
	RETVAL=$?
	;;
	*)
	echo "Usage: syslog {start|stop|status|restart}"
	exit 1
	esac
	exit $RETVAL

			"kAmakAzI bUlL sHiT bIatCh!"

To get the status of the syslog service call the script with entrypoint 
status :

/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog status

The following messages indicate the status :

syslogd (pid 308) is running...
klogd (pid 319) is running...

The entrypoints start, stop and restart can be used similar.

Symbolic links to scripts like this determine which services are started (in
which order) in a certain runlevel. The separate runlevels correspond to the
links in the directories /etc/rc.d/rc&lt;runlevel>.d. The name Snn&lt;script> 
refers
to the script called with the start (S = start) parameter, Knn&lt;script> to 
the
script called with the stop (K = kill) parameter. The sequence in which to 
run
the scripts is determined by the nn number in the name of the link. On our
system the links for runlevel 3 were these:

	[root@0wned rc3.d]# ls -l /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 May 2 10:57 K55routed -> ../init.d/routed
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 May 2 10:57 K80nscd -> ../init.d/nscd
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 May 2 10:57 S00netsetup -> ../init.d/netsetup
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 May 2 10:57 S10network -> ../init.d/network
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 May 2 10:57 S11portmap -> ../init.d/portmap
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 May 2 10:57 S20random -> ../init.d/random
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 May 2 10:57 S25netfs -> ../init.d/netfs
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 May 2 10:57 S30syslog -> ../init.d/syslog
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 May 2 10:57 S50inet -> ../init.d/inet
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 May 2 10:57 S85httpd -> ../init.d/httpd
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 May 2 10:57 S90xfs -> ../init.d/xfs
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 May 2 10:57 S99local -> ../rc.local

The script netsetup is called first (S00*), followed by network (S10*), the 
last
to be executed is rc.local (S99*).

One can add script-calls by adding a symbolic link, e.g. to add a service
(started be myscript) that should be started as the last one in this 
runlevel:

	ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/myscript /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S95myscript

S99local points to a special script where the system administrator can 
specify
all actions that do not belong elsewhere. (Not all distributions use 
S99local.

SuSE, for example, uses script boot.local that is called before the first
runlevel is entered.)

-- shutdown

To bring the system down properly you issue the shutdown command:

shutdown -h &lt;time>

Stops the system (by entering runlevel 0). During shutdown the filesystem
buffers are written to the physical devices (disks), the filesystems are 
marked
as clean and finally unmounted. Improper shutdown (like simply deactivation
via HMC) would leave the filesystems marked as not clean and cause a
filesystem check at the next reboot.

shutdown -r &lt;time> or reboot enters runlevel 6 to halt and restart the 
system.

With the shutdown command one must always specify the time (now , +mm,
time of day) to halt the system:

	shutdown -h now halt the system immediatly
	shutdown -h +10 halt the system in 10 Minutes
	shutdown -h 13:00 halt the system at 1:00 pm

If you want to cancel the shutdown you issue a shutdown -c command.
Shutdown messages are printed on the console:

	[root@0wned /root]# shutdown -h now
	INIT: Switching to runlevel: 0 			(1)
	INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
	INIT: Sending processes the KILL signal 	(2)

	Shutting down system logger: [ OK ]
	Starting killall [ OK ]
	Sending all processes the TERM signal...
	Turning off swap 				(4)
	Unmounting filesystems
	Unmounting proc filesystem

(1)
The init process switches to runlevel 0. The processes receive a TERM
signal and have some time to shutdown gracefully.

(2)
The processes that are still alive are simply killed.

(3)
The network devices and kernel modules are deactivated.

(4)
The swap spaces are deactivated and the filesytems are unmounted.

- Linux for S/390 Administration

The first part of this bit describes tasks to perform for accessing devices
in Linux for S/390. The second part lists tasks to administer the usage of 
the
system, i.e. user administration, shells and the basic security settings.

-- Devices

For unix everything is a file.

The hardware (as disks and printers) attached to the system and many
software mechanisms (e.g. the vitual garbage can, /dev/null)are
represented as so called devices within Linux. The devices correspond to
special files (device files or device nodes) usually found in the directory 
/dev/.

With this layer of abstraction it is possible to operate on *everything* 
using file
operations. As an example, one does not need special commands to fill the
entire disk represented by /dev/dasdf with zeros, a simple

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/dasdf

does it (The device /dev/zero is the Linux source of zero bytes). The above
rather destructive command may seem pretty useless, as it does not leave
anything useful on the whole disk, however, in situations where data has be
physically erased (for security reasons) this is the way (removing a file 
only
unlinks it from its inode, the contents are still somewhere on the disk 
surface).

There are two types of devices, block devices (block oriented operation) and
character devices (character oriented operation). With block devices (most
notably disks) the data transfer happens in multiples of their blocksize.

Character devices transfer data in units of bytes.

To work with anything via its device three conditions must be met:

0) (If a piece of hardware) it must be attached.

1) The Linux kernel must support it. With Linux the kernel device drivers 
can
   be compiled either into the kernel binary itself or compiled as modules 
that
   can be loaded after boot.

2) The appropriate device file must be present. The type of the device is
   determined by its major number. The minor number typically selects one
   particular device of several identical devices or a certain part of one 
device
   (like a partition on a disk). The major and minor numbers are listed in 
the file
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt. The major and minor numbers of
   the device files are listed by simply using the ls -l command:

	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 0 Feb 20 09:14 dasda
	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 1 Feb 20 09:14 dasda1
	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 4 Feb 20 09:14 dasdb
	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 5 Feb 20 09:14 dasdb1
	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 8 Feb 20 09:14 dasdc
	brw-r--r-- 1 root root 94, 9 Feb 20 09:15 dasdc1

   The file /proc/devices can be used to get a list of device types 
supported by
   the kernel; the output is a list of major numbers followed by the base 
name of
   the appropriate device file:

	[root@0wned /proc]# cat /proc/devices
	Character devices:
	1 mem
	2 pty
	3 ttyp
	4 ttyS
	5 ptmx
	10 misc
	128 ptm
	136 pts

	Block devices:
	1 ramdisk
	7 loop
	35 xpram
	94 dasd
	95 mnd

   The last line tells us that the device files for the minidisks are named
   (/dev/)mnda, mndb, mndc and so on. The partitions on mnda will correspond 
to
   mnda1, mnda2, mnda3 etc.

-- Creating a device node: mknod

Device nodes associate a major number which identifies the device type and
a minor number which identifies the unit of a device. They allow programs to
access hardware devices through the kernel device drivers. All device nodes
are located in the directory /dev.

Use the mknod command (as superuser) to create a new device node:

mknod [-m permissions] name type(c=char,b=block) major minor

The permission option -m is optional, but consider what permissions are 
really
needed on the device. Wrongly set permissions may give unwanted access to
a device (through raw reads on the device node) bypassing file security. 
Write
access to the device node even allows formatting or the creation of a 
partition
or filesystem.

To create a device node for the ninth dasd device issue the command :

mknod /dev/dasdi b 94 32

-- Linux for S/390 device node assignment

The kernel parameters influence the association of device nodes. This could
be important as your file systems including root file system are accessed
through a device node mapping, e.g. root=/dev/dasda1.

When no DASD kernel parameters are specified, the system will auto detect
the DASD devices. The order is determined by subchannel; see the extract of
the boot messages:

	Detected device 0190 on subchannel 0004 - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF
	Detected device 0191 on subchannel 0008 - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF
	Detected device 0200 on subchannel 0009 - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF
	Detected device 0300 on subchannel 0009 - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF
	Detected device 0400 on subchannel 0009 - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF
	Detected device 0192 on subchannel 000C - PIM = F0, PAM = F0, POM = FF

	400 	/dev/dasdf (minor 20) 		/dev/dasde (minor 16)
  +------------+--------------------------+----------------------------+

In this example, based on the unit addresses the conclusion can be made
that a device node association will look like in the table above column
*expected*.

As you can see from the boot messages above, the system uses a different
method for assigning device nodes based on the subchannel number when
auto detecting the devices see the table above row *auto detect* for the
result.

The file /proc/dasd/devices reports the dasd device numbers with their
associated major and minor numbers:

	# cat /proc/dasd/devices
	dev# MAJ minor node Format
	0190 94 0 /dev/dasda n/a
	0191 94 4 /dev/dasdb n/a
	0192 94 8 /dev/dasdc 4096
	0200 94 12 /dev/dasdd 4096
	0300 94 16 /dev/dasde 4096
	0400 94 20 /dev/dasdf 4096

Imagine you want to format the device with unit address 192 without first
looking in the /proc/dasd/devices file. You would specify the device node
/dev/dasdc as the device is the third dasd in the device number sequence, 
but
this will format the device 200 instead!

To avoid this and have the DASD ordered as your convenience you can
specify the kernel parameter dasd=. The order of appearance in the dasd=
parameter line(s) determines the assignment of the device nodes.

	dasd=190-192,200,300,400

this parm line example will result in a device node assignment as shown in
column *expected device node depending on the device ADR sequence* in the
Table above.

-- Filesystem types

Linux supports various kinds of filesystems, among them are:

   ext2 	second extended filesystem, mainly developed for Linux, the
   de-facto 	standard Linux filesystem.
   reiserfs 	a journaled filesystem
   nfs 		network filesystem used to acces remote filesystems over net
   swap 	swap *filesystem*, used to page out currently unused memory
		pages. Not mounted procfs a virtual filesystem where the
		kernel provides system information accessible with file operations
		smbfs samba filesystem, allows file sharing with windows clients

With Linux for S/390 you will most likely use the ext2 or the reiser 
filesystem.

- Users and Groups

While a human unix user enters his username (or login) and password to log
on to the system his identity is represented by a (unique, positive) integer 
for
the unix operating system. This number is called the user identifier (UID). 
By
convention a lower UID range (e.g. 0..499) is reserved for acounts that 
exist
for system level services.

The user id zero is reserved for the so called super user or *root*. The 
super
user can do anything (that can be done in user space) on the system. One
should log on as root solely for administrative tasks, because any error 
while
having root permissions can have disastrous results.

Daemon users (with UIDs typically in the range 1..99) are accounts for
programs running in the background which offer certain services. Examples
are named (name service), wwwrun (http server script execution) and
database backends like postfix. Which daemon users are actually present on
a particular system depends on which services have been installed. Some
daemons also run with root priviliges.

The user nobody (usually UID 65534) exists for certain tasks where no
special rights are required (or wanted) like for the automatic update of the 
file
database.

Every user belongs to an (initial or login) group. Groups, similar to users,
consist of a cleartext name and an integer identifier, the GID. One group 
can
contain more than one user and one user can belong to more than one (i.e.
his login) group.

Groups are a means of granting certain rights to users. As an example, some
users of might be added to a group which grants the right to access a
common working directory. Similarly, a user might make some files readable
for the members of his login group.

The command su allows to run a shell with another UID (and GID).
Authentication (entering the password of the account that one switches to) 
is
required except for root.

-- Creating a user account: useradd

Use the useradd command to create a new user. The options you should at
least specify are in bold letters.

	useradd [-d &lt;home>][-g &lt;group>] [-G additional groups>] [-m]
	[-s &lt;shell>] [-u &lt;uid>] [-p passwd] &lt;username>

The options are

	c comment (usually full name of the user)
	d the home directory to be created
	g the default group for the user by name or by GID. If you do not specify a
	  group, Linux will create a group with the same name as the user and the
	  next free group id >=500. The user is then the only member in this new
	  group.
	G Additional groups the user should belong to
	m Create the home directory specified by the -d option if it does not exist
	s Basic shell, i.e. program to run at login time.
	u Numeric userid associated with the user name. If this value is not
	  specified, the system will associate the next free user id >=500.
	p Set initial password

To add a user named user1 issue :

useradd -m -d /home/user1 -p dummypw -c ÆSam AdamsÆ user1

This user will have the password dummypw which he can change using the
passwd command, cf. man passwd.

New users are entered in the file /etc/passwd:

	[root@0wned /etc]# tail -1 /etc/passwd

	user1:!tyj61STZId5Iw!:501:501:Sam Adams:/home/user1:/bin/bash

The format of the passwd entries is

	user:password:uid:gid:description:home:login_shell

The defaults used when creating a user are defined by settings in
/etc/default/useradd. To display or change the defaults use useradd with the
-D option.

	useradd -D
	may give
	GROUP=100
	HOME=/home
	INACTIVE=-1
	EXPIRE=
	SHELL=/bin/bash
	SKEL=/etc/skel

To change the default password expiration time frame to 60 days use
useradd -D -e60

For further options valid with the -D option see the useradd man page.

-- Modifying a user account: usermod

To change the characteristics of a user use the usermod command. Its options
are

	c new comment
	g new initial group id or group name for the user
	G comma separated list of supplementary group the user should be in.
	  The user will be removed from groups not listed in here.
	s change login shell
	u specify the user id for which to change any values
	l change the login name of the user

Some attributes can only be changed when the user is not currently logged
in. The usermod changes file ownership of the /home directory of the user 
when
changing any relevant data like the group id.

	usermod -u 500 -l name2

Will assign a new name to the user with uid 500.

-- Deleting a user account: userdel

In order to delete a user account use

	userdel -r user2

The option -r causes the home directory of the user to be deleted. Userdel
does not delete any files owned by the user that are not stored in the 
userÆs
home directory. Files owned by the user can be found ( beforedeleting the
user) with :

	find / -user user2

Automatic deletion of all those file can be achieved with

	find / -user user2 -exec rm -f {} \;

Utmost care with the find/rm command is strongly advised; you might want to
replace *-f* by *-i* in the above command line.

The group(s) the user belongs to will not be deleted even if the user was 
the
last user of that group.

-- Creating a new group: groupadd

To create a group use the groupadd command

	groupadd [-g &lt;groupid>] [-f] &lt;groupname>

	g specifies the group id, group ids 0 - 499 are reserved for system usage
	f abort with an error if the group already exists

  	  groupadd group1

creates a group named group1 with the next free gid >=500.

groupadd -g 610 group2

creates a group named group2 with gid 610. The groups are listed in the file
/etc/group:

	[root@0wned /etc]# cat /etc/group
	root::0:root
	bin::1:root,bin,daemon
	daemon::2:root,bin,daemon
	sys::3:root,bin,adm
	adm::4:root,adm,daemon
	tty::5:
	disk::6:root
	lp::7:daemon,lp
	mem::8:
	kmem::9:
	wheel::10:root
	mail::12:mail
	news::13:news
	uucp::14:uucp
	man::15:
	games::20:
	gopher::30:
	dip::40:
	ftp::50:
	nobody::99:
	users::100:
	utmp:x:22:
	xfs:x:101:
	group1:x:500:
	group2:x:610:

This file has the following format

	name:password_of_group:gid:list_of_users

-- Modifying a group: groupmod

To change a group use the groupmod command

	groupmod [-g &lt;gid>] [-n &lt;newname>] &lt;groupname>

	g change the group id
	n change the name of the group

The following example changes the GID of group1 to 603:

	groupmod -g 603 group1

Beware that if you change the gid of a group, groupmod does not change the
gid of the users and files. This can result in problems accessing files.

-- Deleting a group: groupdel

Delete the group named group2 with

	groupdel group2

The initial or primary group of any user cannot be deleted with groupdel. 
With
the groups command you can determine to which groups a user belongs.

	groups user1

-- File ownership and access permissions

Files created by some user belong to him and his login group. File ownership
can only be changed by the super user. The group can also be changed by
the owner of the file, but only to a group that he is a member of.

	chown jj.math /somewhere/fft.c
	makes jj the new owner of the named file and math its group.
	chown -R fbi/elsewhere/xfiles/

Makes fbi the new owner of the directory /elsewhere/xfiles/ and all the 
files
and directories in it.

The access permissions (write, read, execute) for different domains of users
(owner, initial group of owner, everybody) can be granted by the owner of 
the
file.

	chmod ug+x progfile

Adds the permission to execute the file progfile to the owner (*u*, for user 
)
and members of the fileÆs group (*g*).

chmod a+r message.txt

Allows everybody (*a* for all) to read the file message.txt.

chmod -R go-rwx mysecrets/

Withdraws rights to read, write or execute (or enter directories) for 
mysecrets
and any file or directory within (option *-R*) to everybody except the file
owner.

The calling synytax for chmod is given in the chmod man page.

Listing files with

ls -lF

gives an output like

	drwxr-xr-x 2 jj users 12318 May 8 10:21 somedir/
	-rw------- 1 jj users 12318 May 8 23:21 secret.txt
	-rwxr-x--- 1 jj users 11347 May 3 20:59 myprog*
	-rw-r--r-- 1 jj users 103 May 2 15:47   myprog.c

The left column consists of 10 characters, the leftmost of these indicates 
the
type (*d* for directory, *-* for regular files). The remaining nine 
characters are
three fields each of the form *rwx* (read,write,execute) corresponding to 
user
(the owner of the file), group and others. The file secret.txt has read and
write permissions for the owner but for nobody else. myprog can be executed
by the owner and the members of his group, the owner also has write
permissions. The file myprog.c can be edited by its owner and read by
everybody. The directory somedir allows everybody to cd into it (*x* field 
set)
but only the owner can create or delete files in it.

An often useful option for chmod is the *-c* switch: if actual changes in 
the file
permissions took place, the resulting permissions are printed in the *rwx*
format just described.

The nine bits defining the access permisssions can be and octal format with
the chmod command:

	chmod 750 myprog
	is equivalent to
	chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= myprog

and results in access permissions as shown in the listing above.

An so called umask controls the acces rights of newly created files. The 
umask
contains the permission bits that are unsetfor new files. The typical 
setting is
022, removing write permissions to everybody except the file owner. The
paranoia setting would be 077, removing all access permissions for all but 
the
file owner.

-- Changing passwords

The passwd command allows a user to change his password interactively by
simply entering passwd without arguments. The old password must be entered
first then the new password has to be entered twice (to avoid problems
caused by typos). The superuser can change the passwords of any user
(without having to know the current password) by using the passwd command
followed by the username.

In order to enforce system security a regular (mandatory) change of user
passwords can be obtained with the expire mechanism. The respective
default parameter (PASS_MAX_DAYS, cf. man login.defs) can be set in the file
/etc/login.defs.

For an existing account an expiry date can be set by the usermod command:

	usermod -e 24/12/2001 jj

Will set the expiry date for the user jj to the 24.December 2001.

-- Shells

A shell is an interactive interface that allows the user to interactively 
work with
the operationg system. Several different shells are available within Linux;
some of the more important are

	/bin/sh   Bourne shell (now a link to bash)
	/bin/bash Bourne Again Shell. It is the default shell of almost all 
existing
	          Linux installations.
	/bin/csh  C shell (now a link to tcsh); its syntax is somewhat similar to C
	/bin/tcsh enhanced C shell.
	/bin/ksh  Korn shell; compatible to the bourne shell. It combines the
	          characteristics of bourne and C shell.
	/bin/zsh  Z shell; enhanced version of the Korn shell.

To determine which shell one is currently using enter

	[root@0wned /root]# echo $SHELL
	/bin/bash

During login the system calls the shell that is set in the /etc/passwd file 
for this
user. The login shell can be changed interactively using the chsh command.

Entering the shell the file /etc/profile and files in the users home 
directory
(like .profile , cf. the man page of your shell for details) are executed. 
These
startup files allow system (/etc/profile) and user specific (files in the 
home
directory) settings like customizing the prompt and.

Temporarily changing to an alternative shell can be achieved by simply
starting the binary of wanted shell:

	tcsh

Leaving it with the logout command gets you back into the original shell.
To permanently change the login shell use the chsh (CHange SHell)
command, cf. man chsh.

-- System logs

The syslog daemon syslogd logs various kinds of system activity. It is 
started
during runlevel processing at boot time (/rc&lt;N>.d/S30syslog).

The /etc/syslog.conf file contains the configuration of syslogd. It 
describes
which kind and level of information is logged into which file. The 
configuration
file on our system loooks like this:

	[root@0wned /etc]# cat syslog.conf
	# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
	# Don't log private authentication messages!
	*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none /var/log/messages
	authpriv.* /var/log/secure
	# Log all the mail messages in one place.mail.* /var/log/maillog
	*.emerg *
	# Save mail and news errors of level err and higher in a
	# special file.
	uucp,news.crit /var/log/spooler
	# Save boot messages also to boot.log
	local7.*

The first information in the configuration files contains the kind of 
messages
in the form systemapplication.level . It can be repeated several times
seperated by a semicolon. Possible system applications can be.

   auth - 	used by user authentication (login) programs.
   cron - 	used by the cron daemon.
   daemon - 	used by miscellaneous daemons.
   kern - 	used by the Linux kernel itself.
   lpr - 	used by the printer daemon.
   mail - 	used by the mail daemon.
   news - 	used by the news daemon.
   syslog - 	used by syslog itself.
   uucp - 	used by UUCP daemon.
   local0 - 	local7 - used by miscellaneous daemons and applications, for
	        example the application chat writes its messages to facility 
local2.

The level determines the severity of the message and can contain

  none - 	do not write messages
  debug - 	debugging messages.
  info - 	miscellaneous information messages.
  notice - 	something may be wrong, maybe.
  warning - 	a condition that my cause trouble if not checked.
  err - 	an error condition.
  crit - 	a critical error.
  alert - 	a severe error.
  emerg - 	an irrecoverable error has occurred within the kernel, often
                followed by kernel panic on your screen! :]

The second field contains the location where to store the messages. This can
be any filename or * for the current virtual console or terminal (xterm) 
started
with the -C option.

You can change the syslogd configuration by editing the configuration file. 
To
tell syslogd to reread the file after changes send the HUP signal to it

	kill -HUP Æcat /var/run/syslogpidÆ

The cat /var/log/syslog.pid gives the current process id of the syslog
daemon. You can also determine the process id with the ps -ef or ps auxww
command.

- Linux TCP/IP connectivity

-- Introduction

I will begin with a short explanation of the most common TCP/IP protocols
used in Linux and continue with a discussion of IP addressing. I move on
with short descriptions of the diverse configuration files, scripts, and
daemons. These will be followed by a description of a few of the
troubleshooting tools that will be available to you on your Linux machine.

Finally, we close with how you can connect to your data and applications.

-- Assumptions

We are assuming that you are running the Marist Linux big file system.

Further you should have the following files on you Linux system:

*- /etc/hosts
*- /etc/services
*- /etc/protocols
*- /etc/HOSTNAME
*- /etc/inetd.conf
*- /etc/rc.d/init.d/network

We also assume that your network is up and running with such programs as
ping, netstat, ifconfig, route, telnet, and ftp avialable for your use.

We will be giving you a guided tour through some of the more important
corners of your Linux networking environment.

-- Skills

			"MorE FecKInG skIllS? jeSuS!"

You will need to be able to edit a text file, download from the internet and
have a sense of adventure. We also assume that you have a basic knowledge
of how to navigate through the Linux filesystem.

-- TCP/IP protocols

We will give you a list and brief description of the standard protocols used
within IP networking. These protocols are from the Transport Layer which
rests on top of the Network Layerin which IP operates. IP is a connection 
less
and unreliableprotocol that just sends the datagrams it is given over the 
net.

The following Transport Layer protocols add reliability to the Network Layer
(IP). To give you a reference point as to where we are in the OSI Networking
Model, we added the lower four layers in the form of the OSI Model Table
below. Please note that we give but a few examples of what belongs in which
layer, there are more.

	       +-----+-----------------------------------------+
		OSI 	Model
	       +-----+-----------------------------------------+
		4. 	Transport Layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
		3. 	Network Layer (IP)
		2. 	Datalink Layer (TokenRing, Ethernet)
		1. 	Physical Layer (Twisted Pair, Coax)
	       +-----+-----------------------------------------+

--- TCP

Transmission Control Protocol was developed on top of IP to provide the
reliability mechanism that is missing. It manages the disassembly of a mass
of data into a stream of datagramsand passes them to the Network Layer
that uses IP to send to the receiving machine. On the receiving machine TCP
receives the datagrams from the Network Layer and reassembles the
datagrams into a stream of data. This is a connection orientatedprotocol 
that
uses acknowledgments to ensure that each of the sent datagrams has
arrived. If a datagram would be missing from the delivered stream, TCP will
ensure that it will be resent.

--- UDP

User Datagram Protocoluses a single datagram to send a message from one
machine to another. This protocol is usually used for networking
housekeeping tasks. This is a connectionlessprotocol that sends its
datagrams out onto the net and does not check if they are delivered to the
given address.

--- ICMP

Internet Control Message Protocol is used to carry control messages across
the internet. These messages are how internet hosts communicate with each
other and in most cases applications will not use this protocol.

-- IP address types

There are two ways of getting a machine connected to the network using IP
addresses, either with a static address or by obtaining it dynamically.

--- Static IP addresses

Static IP addressing is done by your network administrator assigning TCP/IP
addresses to identify the clients within your network. These static TCP/IP
addresses were defined as part of the installation of your Linux system. For
the rest you just do nothing, you have a permanent address that only will
change if your network administrator assigns your Linux machine a new one.

This should not happen very often.

--- Dynamic IP addresses

Dynamic IP addressing differs from static IP addressing in that your
addresses are obtained from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol)
server. This server is responsible for answering any DHCP requestsfrom
clients who want an address on the network.

A DHCP client would request (for example, at boot time) an IP address from a
DHCP server, which returns an IP address. If the server name is not known
beforehand, then the client broadcastsits request out onto the net. The
address comes with a leasewhich basically gives the client a time limit that
the address is valid. When a client using DHCP logs on again it will first 
check
its DHCP lease database. If the client is in possession of a valid lease the
client will try to log onto the network with the IP address that is 
associated
with that lease. If it fails then the DHCP server will be asked once again 
to
provide a new IP address, which in turn will have a new lease. If the lease
database no longer contains a lease that is valid then the client will just 
ask
the DHCP server for another IP address and the process starts at the
beginning.

We do not see this form of addressing being used within the mainframe
environment as all network adjustments are planned and the IP addresses
are given statically to the individual machines.

-- Configuration files

The files we will describe here hold information that networking programs 
use
as they run. They can all be found in the /etc/ directory.

--- Hosts

This file holds a text database consisting of the host names and IP 
addresses
of the hosts your Linux system will need before being able to contact its 
DNS
server. It is read to resolve these host names into their IP addresses. The 
lines
have the following syntax, with one line for each host entry:

	numerical.IP.address internet.hostname [nickname]

For example the entry in hosts for the mailhost machine on an example
network could be:

	9.9.9.9 mailhost.example.com mailhost

One thing to note is that it is possible to give one host more than one
nickname. This form of host resolving is not very scalable and will only 
remain
useful for small intranets, after more than four hosts in a network the
administration overhead gets out of hand. The solution to this is moving to
DNS.

--- Services

This file names the networking services that your Linux machine provides to
other hosts on the internet, identifying the port and host-to-host protocol 
that
the service uses. The entries in this file have the following syntax, with 
one
service entry for each service offered:

	service_name IP_port / udp | tcp

For example the entry in services for the telnet service could be:

	telnet 23/tcp
	telnet 23/udp

This shows that telnet uses port 23 and can use either TCP or UDP as the
transport protocol.

--- Protocols

This file names the TCP/IP protocols that your Linux system recognizes and
assigns a number to each of them. You will most likely never need to edit 
this
file. An example of what we found on our version of Marist Linux big file
system:

	# /etc/protocols:
	# $Id: protocols,v 1.1 1995/02/24 01:09:41 imurdock Exp $
	#

	ospf 89 OSPFIGP # Open Shortest Path First IGP
	ipip 94 IPIP # Yet Another IP encapsulation
	encap 98 ENCAP # Yet Another IP encapsulation

--- HOSTNAME

This file holds your Linux machineÆs name. For example, if you named your
machine 0wned.linux.com, then the contents of your HOSTNAME will read:

	0wned

You will have done this during the installation of your Linux machine, and 
if
you would want to rename your Linux machine then you would have to,
among other things, edit this file. This can be done by hand or with the
hostname command, please refer to its manpage for further details.

--- Inetd.conf

This configuration file is read by inetd,the TCP/IP super server.

Each line in this file describes how inetdhandles one service and the syntax
is as follows, with the entry fields separated by a tab or a space:

	service name
	socket type
	protocol
	wait/nowait[.max]
	user[.group]
	server program
	server program arguments

Put very simply, each line gives inetdthe ports to which it should listen 
and
the server that it should activate to handle traffic on a given port.

For example to specify the standard telnet service, the entry could look 
like
the following example line taken from our Linux machine:

	telnet stream tcp nowait root /user/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd

This tells inetdthat when a connection request occurs on the telnet port it
should activate the telnetdby running /user/sbin/tcpd with the argument
listed. For more information see the inetd.conf and tcpd manpage.

- Linux Security issues

In this bit we merely scratch the surface of a few security related issues,
the URLs given in the last section point to more and deeper information. One
should be aware that millions of Linux installations exist which are 
connected
to the internet and among its operators there are inevitably some that have
the knowledge and intention to exploit security holes on remote systems.

			"dO y00 mEaN Me BiaTch?"

Security by obscurity is therefore no longer an option.

Some Linux distributions offer a selection of security profiles for certain
situations like *in trusted environment*, *DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)* or
*paranoia setting*. Starting from the most appropriate of those the required
level of security can be achieved with only a few addtional steps specific 
for
the actual environment.

Note that the Marist distribution offers virtually no security as it is 
intented to
experminenting and exploration of the system as easy as possible.

-- Consider remote logging

Important system messages and warnings are usually logged into the files
/var/log/messages and /var/log/warn, respectively. An attacker who managed
to gain unauthorized access to the system is likely to be able to remove his
traces in these (and other) files. The ability to send the messages to be
logged to another machine helps with this problem. The man page :

	man syslog.conf

gives instructions and examples for the configuration of syslogd for remote
logging.

-- Disable unnecessary services

Flaws in the code of programs that run with root priviliges (like several
daemons for networked services) have repeatedly given attackers the
possibility of gaining unauthorized access to unix systems. Though the
number of such incidents may decrease it is sure that such things will 
happen
as long as computers offer networked services. The system administrator
should therefore follow the online forums that inform about known software
weaknesses and possible fixes.

The more services are running on a system the greater the probability that
some program failure produces a security danger. The simple consequence is
to disable all services that are not necessary for the operation of the 
system.
Many daemons are started by the *super daemon* inetd: commenting out the
respective entries in /etc/inetd.conf by putting an "#" in front of the line 
and
restarting inetd by

	killall -HUP inetd

does it. Other daemons are running all the time (listening on their port);
simply do not start unnecessary ones.

- Disable remote login for root

If remote login for root is not allowed the only way to become the super 
user
is by logging on with the personal account and then switching to root by 
using
the "su" command. Even if the root password should get known to some
attacker he had to get hold of another account on which he login remotely.

The device names of the ttys from which root can log in are listed in the 
file
/etc/securetty.TODO: ??? doesnÆt work for marist at the time of writing
In case an ftp server is running on your system: The file /etc/ftpusers 
lists
users which are not allowed to connect via ftp. Root and some other users
should definitely be in this file, cf. man ftpusers.

If you are running Linux for S/390 in a virtual machine you may decide to 
limit
root logons to the Linux console. In other words, only by logging onto the
Linux virtual machine or by being an authorized secondary user could you
attempt to log on to Linux as root.

-- Use encrypted connections

If an attacker has access to the physical network segment (e.g. by having an
login account on a computer directly attached to the network) he can access
all information(!) that is transmitted on the segment. Using simple scripts 
on
top of a *network sniffer* program (like tcpdump) he can filter out
login/password pairs transferred in cleartext. The only protection against 
this
is not to transfer any unencrypted data:

Disable telnet and rlogin (/etc/inetd.conf); allow remote login only via 
ssh.

Transfer files only with the scp command.

-- Use scp instead of ftp

As data transferred by ftp is no encrypted and implementations of the ftp
service have shown vulnerabilities in the past one might ask for an 
alternative
possibility for file transfer. Luckily there is scp (secure copy). scp 
allows you to
copy files between machines and uses the authentification mechanism of the
secure shell. The data is encrypted during transfer by scp..

scp understands a syntax very similar to that of the usual cp command:

	scp myfile.txt joe@host.mydomain.com:somedir/

copy myfile.txt into joeÆs home directory under the directory somedir/.

-- Use a tcp wrapper (tcpd)

tcpd monitors, logs and controls the startup of daemons normally started
directly by the inetd. It does some checks for apparent attempts of an 
attack
(like a host prentending to have the name of another host) and if nothing
suspicious was detected starts the service.

Linux distributions will likely install the tcpd by default. If your system 
doesnÆt
have tcpd installed: install it.

The configuration of tcpd is nicely explained in man tcpd k. Most likely you
want to make entries in the files /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny where
access for hosts can explicitly be allowed or denied, cf. man 5 
hosts_access.

-- Use shadow passwords

The user (and group) passwords are not stored as clear text anywhere in the
system. Instead the passwords are encrypted and authenfication is done by
encrypting the entered passwords and comparing the encrypted passwords.

The encrypted passwords used to be stored in the file /etc/passwd which is
(and has to be) world readable. In this situation any user can obtain the 
list of
all logins and encryted passwords on the system. By using certain programs
(like cracklib) that use a dictionary of frequently used passwords (and
variations of the login sometimes used as password by users not aware of the
risks) it is feasible to obtain passwords and thereby unauthorized access.

With the shadow password suite installed the passwords are stored in a file
(/etc/shadow) readable only by root, thereby eliminating the possibility 
that
ordinary users could perform the cracklib or other dictinary attacks.

Consult the security related internet sites regularly.

Formerly unknown security problems are first described on the internet.

an appropriate fix is published at the same time. If you have to care about

- Intel architecture, S/390 architecture and VM/ESA

Linux is usually considered a PC operating system. Linux was first developed
for an Intel 80386 and the Intel architecture remains the most common
platform for Linux.

In this bit, we describe the fundamentals of the Intel architecture and
that of S/390. The Intel symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) architecture is
compared with S/390, with particular attention to reliability, availability 
and
serviceability. We also give a brief introduction to S/390 virtual machines 
and
VM/ESA. Using VM/ESA, you can potentially run hundreds or even thousands
of Linux virtual servers on a single S/390 system.

-- Architecture description

This section is intended as a brief introduction to the basic architecture 
of
IBM S/390 and the Intel 32-bit (IA32) processors.

--- IA32

An IA32 processor offers different modes of operation, but some of them are
provided only for compatibility reasons and today are not used very often.
The so-called *protected mode* is the one used by today operating systems in
that it allows to divide the memory in different segments, isolated one from
the others as to obtain higher protection, and supports paging to obtain a
virtual memory larger than the physical one.

The IA32 processors contain different set of registers:

	- General purpose registers: these 8 registers can be used to maintain
	  operands and main memory pointers. Some of them are reserved for
	  particular purposes: for example the ESP register is used as a pointer to
	  the stack.

	- Segment registers: are used to hold the descriptors of segments used
	  while accessing code, data, or the stack.

	- Status registers: are used to encode the processor status and to specify
	  its mode of operation.

Also, a set of floating point registers is provided to support floating 
point
operations. These registers are organized as a stack and are 80 bit each.

The memory on a IA32 processor operating in protected mode is divided into
segments. Each segment has a maximum size of 4GB (which has been
increased to 64 GB on the latest Pentium processors). A segment is
accessed by mean of a segment selector contained in one of the segment
registers. A segment selector is composed of three parts:

	- A segment descriptor index.

	- A table indicator that allows to establish if the index is referred to 
the
	  global descriptor table (GDT) or the local descriptor table (LDT).

	- A requested privilege level, that is used for segment protection reasons.

The LDT is local to each thread and is saved during thread switch. The GDT
is global to the entire system. The GDT and LDT contain the segment
descriptors, that are used to maintain information about:

	- The size of the segment.
	- Its base address in the virtual storage.
	- The type of the segment and its associated privilege level.

The segment type is used to distinguish between segments containing data
or code and segments containing system structures, as tasks related
information, the LDT and so on.

When accessing memory, a segment register and an offset registers are
used: the address of the data in memory is obtained adding the base address
of the segment referenced by the segment register to the offset contained in
the offset register. This linear address can be equal to the physical 
address of
data in memory in case paging is not active. Otherwise another translation
step is required to translate the linear address into the physical one.
The pages most commonly used by IA32 processors have a fixed size of 4KB, 
but
pages as large as 2MB or 4MB are supported.

The information that the processor uses during the page translation process,
is contained in some data structures:

	- Page directory: contains up to 1024 32-bit page-directory entries. Each 
of
	  them contains the base address of a page table and information about the
	  status of the page (for example if it is valid, it is in main memory or 
it is
	  swapped in the secondary storage and so on).

	- Page table: each entry contains the address of a page and some bits used
          to maintain information about the state of the page and the 
privileges
          needed to access it.

-- S/390

An S/390 system is usually composed of one or more central processing
units, a main storage, an expanded storage, and a channel subsystem that is
connected to the I/O devices.

		"CenTrAl pRoCeSsInG? i fAntAzIe aBouT tHaT sHit"

The main storage contains code and data used by the CPUs and is divided
into blocks of 4KB each. On the other hand, expanded storage cannot be
used to maintain data currently used by the CPUs and it is usually reserved
for paging purposes, in that allows to transfer memory blocks faster than
mass storage. It is divided into pages of 4KB, each addressed by a 32-bit
identifier, thus allowing up to 2 32 pages. Only complete pages can be
transferred to or from expanded storage to main memory. The expanded
storage is a unique feature of the S/390 architecture and there is nothing
similar in IA32.

Each CPU contains a set of registers that can be used by programs. They can
be divided into the following:

* Program status word: used to maintain information related to the status of
  the CPU and to instruction sequencing.

* General registers: 16 32-bit registers used for integer arithmetic and for
  addressing.
* Floating-point registers: depending on the configuration, 4 or 16 
registers
  are available and can be used both for hexadecimal and floating point
  computations.

* Control registers: 16 registers are available and are used to control
  various hardware facilities.

* Access registers: contain segment-table designators used to access
  address spaces.

Depending on the mode of operation, the addresses generated by a program
can be interpreted in three different ways:

* Absolute addresses: are addresses given to the main storage locations.

* Real addresses: are translated to absolute addresses by prefixing.

* Virtual addresses: are translated to real addresses by means of dynamic
  address translation.

The S/390 absolute address is like the IA32 real address; both are used to
designate a given location in the main storage. The virtual address can be
compared to the IA32 linear address because both are used to support
paging and to provide a virtual address space larger than the real main
memory.

Prefixing is used to allow different CPUs sharing main storage to work
independently. Prefixing remaps the first 4KB of storage using the value
contained in the prefix register of each CPU: if a memory reference is 
within
the first 4KB, the address is added to the prefix to obtain the new address.

For translating a virtual address to a real one, each CPU uses some
translation tables. The translation table used depends on the address space
used. The control program associates to each address space a unique
number of 16 bits known as address-space number (ASN). The ASN is
maintained by the CPU in one of its registers and is used as a key to 
retrieve
the address space control information, through a process known as address
space number translation (ASNT).

The ASNT consists of a two table lookup process. The first 10 bits of the 
ASN
are used as a key in the first table to obtain the address of the second 
table.

Then the remaining 6 bits of the ASN are used as an index in the second
table, that contains the address space control information, that among other
things, includes the address of the authority table and the address of the
segment table. The authority table is used to establish if the current 
process
can use the address space, thus allowing the use of a given address space
only by authorized processes; 2 16 authorization levels are possible, so 
this
table contains up to 2 16 entries.

-- I/O subsystem

The S/390 I/O subsystem is different from the ones of other architectures. 
In
fact S/390 defines a unified way to access all kind of devices through so
called channels.

All the I/O activity is managed by the channel subsystem, that is 
responsible
to control the flow of information between the I/O devices and the main
storage.

The communication between the channel subsystem and the devices
happens through channel paths. Different kinds of channels paths are
available, and each support different data-transfer speeds. An S/390 box can
support, depending on the configuration, up to 256 channel paths.

Channel paths and devices are connected through control units. Control units
are needed to adapt the standard form of control used by the channel
subsystem to the particular needs of each kind of device.

Each I/O device is associated with a subchannel. Subchannels provide
information about the device they are connected to and are the only mean by
which the channel subsystem can access the device. Each subchannel has a
system wide unique 16 bits ID associated, that is used when requesting an
I/O operation to indicate the device it is directed to. Given the size of a
subchannel ID, a maximum of 65,536 subchannels (and I/O devices) can be
connected to a channel subsystem.

While the subchannel associated with each device is unique, a device can be
reached through different channel paths. In fact a device can be connected 
to
more than a control unit and a control unit can be connected to more than 
one
channel path. While communication happens only through one of them, the
presence of multiple paths allows for better performances and higher
reliability and availability. In fact, when starting an I/O operation, the 
channel
subsystem has the ability to perform a path selection choosing between all
the available paths, and using a different path if one is busy.

Beyond the ability to connect a large number of devices, another advantage
of this I/O architecture is its high efficiency while performing data 
transfers. In
fact, the CPU is busy only during the first phase of the I/O operation, that 
is
passing the needed information and commands to the subchannel. After that
the CPU can continue its activity while the work of moving data is performed
by the channel subsystem. When the I/O operation has ended, the CPU
receives a notification through an asynchronous interrupt. If interrupts 
have
been disabled, the pending interrupt is stored with information about its
source; this way the CPU can interrogate the channel subsystem to know if a
given channel ended its activity without being interrupted asynchronously
during its work.

-- Symmetric multiprocessing

In a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), multiple processors share the same
resources as the main memory, the communication buses, the I/O subsystem
and so on, allowing to better distribute the workload and allowing simple 
and
fast data sharing between processors.

		"oOoOoOoOoOoOo thIs iS rEaLly FunKy sHitE"

--- Intel SMP

With the introduction of the Profusion chip-set, Intel pushed the limit of 
its
multiprocessing technology up to 8-way. In fact, the Profusion chip-set
supports up to 8 Pentium Xeon processors. The Xeon version is used
because of its large on chip second level cache needed to reduce the
memory traffic that is quite high due to the large number of processors.\
The 8 processors are divided into two groups of 4 each; the processors in
each group share a common bus that connects them the Profusion chip-set.

The Profusion chip set creates a *fusion* of three Pentium III processor 
buses
and two main memory subsystems. Two of the three processor buses are
actually used to connect processors, while the other is used to connect I/O
devices.

The Pentium Xeon processors have integrated L1 data and instruction
caches, of 16KB each. The second level cache is integrated in the same
package and works at the same frequency of the core.

The Profusion chip-set coordinates the activity of the buses and connects
them with the main memory and, also, it allows for reduced coherency traffic
thanks to the coherency filters. The chip-set is divided into two chips,
the Memory Access Controller (MAC) and the Data Interface Buffer (DIB).

The MAC contains the control functions need to control the system. It
manages the memory contained in the coherency filters and controls
coherency notifications, preventing unneeded coherency traffic from reaching
processor buses. This is accomplished using the coherency filters, each
containing information about a superset of the data cached by the processors
in the related bus. Before propagating coherency information in a bus, the
MAC verifies if it is needed checking the information contained in the
coherency filter.

The DIB contains the data paths needed to connect the buses and the main
memory. It is controlled by the MAC and allows to move data between the
processor buses and the system memory. Also, the DIB generates error
correcting codes (ECC) needed to recover from errors.

To better the performances, the memory is divided into two interleaved banks
and each bank is connected to the profusion chip-set through a dedicated
port. This way it is possible to double the maximum data transfer speed, 
that
reaches 1.6 GB/sec.

--- IBM SMP

The last generations of the S/390 multiprocessor (G5 and G6) are based on a
design different from the one used for the previous generations (G3 and G4)
that offers higher performances and supports the load of a larger number of
CPUs. The new design is based on the so called binodal cache the processors
and cache memories are divided into two nodes connected one another and with
the memory cards.

Each node is composed of up to 6 processors (7 in the G6) with integrated L1
cache, an L2 cache, a system controller (SC), the memory cards and, the
buses needed to connect them.

The L1 cache is unified (it contains both instructions and data) and has a 
size
of 256 KB. It is of write-through type: if data are written to locations 
that are
not in cache, those data are not transferred in cache. So the data are
immediately transferred to the L2 cache to be written to memory.

The L2 caches have a size of 4MB each and operate at half the frequency of
the processors, like all the other chips in the node. They contain all the 
data
contained in the L1 caches of the node, thus simplifying the management of
coherency. Also, L2 cache is store-in, meaning that if a store is made to a
memory location that is not cached, the content of this memory location is
first transferred to the cache and then updated. This way the next reference 
to
this location will hit in cache.

The SC maintains information about the L2 cache, manages coherency of
caches, controls the binodal architecture, and provides for communication
with main memory. It is split into two chips to obtain more pins and to 
allow for
larger L2 caches; each chip is part of one node.

The SC is responsible of maintaining cache coherence; this is done using a
modified MESI (modified/exclusive/shared/invalid) protocol. The modification
is needed to account for the possibility of sharing inside the node 
(locally) or
outside between the two nodes (globally). This distinction allows to perform
faster operations when a processor requires exclusive access to some data
and the data are shared only locally.

Also, if an access to a node L2 cache misses, the SC tries to search the 
data
in the L2 cache of the other node. This way it is possible to improve
performances because retrieving data from the other node cache is faster
than retrieving them from memory.

The memory is organized into 4 cards each containing 4 banks. This way 16
banks are available and up to 16 fetch and store operation to main memory
can be served simultaneously.

Also, the design of the G5 and G6 has been optimized to efficiently perform
the rich set of data movement operations. A series of hardware devices have
been added to allow only minimal processors involvement during the
movement of data. For example the hardware-assisted move engine allows to
move block of data from one area of the main memory to another, optimizing
the movement to avoid conflicts with the read and store operations that are
required by the processors.

The design of the S/390 server allows to obtain the high efficiency in 
memory
access and data transfer that is needed to support the large number of
processors and the large amount of data managed by an enterprise server,
that requires a good balancing between computational power and I/O
capabilities.

-- RAS considerations

Important factors in evaluating high-end servers are reliability, 
availability and
serviceability.

--- Intel Profusion chip set RAS considerations

The Intel chip-set implements a number of techniques to obtain an high RAS.
The system, memory and I/O buses are all protected by error correcting
codes (ECC) to allow discovery of transmission errors and eventually their
recovery.

	"So WhaT u ArE TryInG to sAy, iS ThaT iT is lIkE ReLiaBlE?"

Also, the system is able to continue to work even if some hardware failures
occur:

* If a processor or processor bus fails, the system continues to work using
  only the other bus.

* If one of the memory ports fails, the system can work using only one port.

* If any of the coherency filters fails, it is disabled and the system 
remains
  operational, but with lower performances.

* If an I/O device fails, it is possible to isolate and disable it. Also, 
I/O
  devices are hot-pluggable, meaning that you can change them without
  interrupting server activity.

To allow for better serviceability, the chip set is able to perform 
error-logging.
This way it is possible to identify error sources in less time and promptly
correct the system behavior.

-- S/390 RAS considerations

The S/390 system offers a very rich set of RAS capabilities and it was
designed from its first start with RAS in mind.

The processors contain duplicated instruction unit (IU), fixed-point unit 
(FXU)
and floating-point unit (FPU) and on every operation, the results of the two
copies are compared to discover possible errors. The check is performed by
the register unit (RU) before committing the result of each operation. When
the check succeeds, the current state is saved as a checkpoint to allow
restart of the next operation in case of failure.

The RU, like the L1 cache is not duplicated, but is protected using ECC in
general and parity checking when the information is replicated elsewhere in
the processor. This way the processor is able do discover and eventually
recover a large series of possible faults.

When a processor fails due to some permanent internal fault, it is isolated
and removed from operation, while system operation continues unaffected for
the other processors, thus maintaining a high degree of availability. Also 
if a
spare processor is configured, it is automatically activated and the state 
of
the failing processor is transferred to it, allowing the resume of the 
normal
activity without user intervention and without any impact on the application 
or
on the operating system. In some case, depending on the type of fault, it is
not necessary to completely stop the processor, but simply disabling the
faulty device operation can continue although with reduced performances.

		"wOh tHaT iS fUnkY!"

The L2 cache and the buses connecting it with main memory and with
processors are protected using ECC. When erroneous data is individuated by
an ECC station, the data propagation is blocked to avoid their propagation
inside the system. Also when an L2 cache line is discovered to be invalid, 
it is
purged to avoid use of the invalid data by any of the processors. The next
time the data will be referenced, they will be reloaded from the main 
memory.

Obviously, because of the low failure rates, the purge of cache lines does 
not
have a bad impact on system performances.

Also the L2 cache contains spare cache lines that are automatically used to
substitute failing lines. This way it is possible to recover from errors in 
a cache
chip without the need to mark the whole chip as faulty.

The main memory is organized as that each DRAM module contributes only
one bit to a given ECC check box. This way, because ECC are able to correct
single bit errors, it is possible to recover from all partial module and all
complete module failures. Also, to avoid the accumulation of errors that can
result in the inability to correct them, memory is continuously analyzed and
errors are eventually recovered as soon as they are discovered.

When the number of errors discovered (and recovered) on a given memory
module becomes greater than a given threshold, the module is substituted
with a spare one. All the content of the failing module is copied into the 
new
one while, all the intervening stores are propagated to both the modules. 
This
way, when the copy is finished the old module is completely replaced by the
new one. The usage of spare DRAM memory modules allows to substitute a
failing module without stopping the machine, increasing the total 
availability of
the S/390.

The S/390 provides a quite large number of mechanisms that are used to
grant very high availability and integrity of data. In a large number of 
cases, f
an error is discovered, the hardware is able to recover from the error
condition, isolating the faulty device and activating spare ones. Also, only 
the
hardware that presents failures is isolated from the system, allowing to
maintain operative the largest possible number of working devices to impact
the lowest possible the performances of the system.

-- Conclusion of the two architectures

		"aRchiTecTurEs Are LikE bUilDinGs, InNiT?"

Both the IA32 and the S/390 are so called Complex Instruction Set Computer
(CISC) architectures, meaning that they offer a very rich set of 
instructions.
Ffrom the micro-architectural point of view, the IA32 and the S/390 CPUs are
very different. The IA32 transforms complex instructions in to simpler ones
that are executed in parallel and out-of-order, using a complex scheduling
mechanism. So the IA32 core is optimized to execute simple instructions in
parallel.

On the other hand the S/390 G5 and G6 CPUs are able to execute only one
operation per cycle but are optimized to reduce the time needed to complete
the execution of complex, long running instructions that are often used in
programs. Also, only one integer operation is executed per cycle even if, 
for
example, two integer pipelines are available, because both of them execute
the same operation to allow checking the result. This way the reliability of 
the
processor is preferred to the raw speed. In general, the S/390 CPU offers
higher RAS and allows it to discover and recover from a large number of
errors, usually disabling only the faulty devices.

Also, the S/390 instruction set offers a quite rich set of instructions to 
move
memory blocks, that is supported by specialized hardware as to obtain higher
performances. For example, the move engine can be used to quickly obtain
pages from main storage to expanded storage, thus speeding up the
swapping process.

The expanded storage is a unique feature of the S/390. It allows it to 
obtain a
large and fast memory that can be used to swap out unused memory pages
faster than what is allowed using mass storage. Also, the expanded storage
can be used as a cache for minidisks, improving the performances of
applications I/O.

Both the IA/32 and the S/390 support paging, but they offer slightly 
different
mechanisms. The IA32 allows each task to maintain information about its
mapping of virtual address versus real ones; usually, each thread is mapped
on a different task and all the threads of a single process share the same
page mapping.

The S/390 implements a different page mapping for each address space and
allows to access up to 16 address spaces at the same time. Also, the S/390
uses the concept of segment to group pages; during the address translation
process, in fact, the first part of the virtual address is used to index the
segment table that allows to obtain the address of a page table.

Instead, the IA32 uses segments to protect storage areas. There is no direct
relation between pages and segments but a segment is used to define the
access rights on a given virtual memory region. This way, when accessing
virtual memory each process can only read or write what is contained in the
segment defined by the descriptor it is using.

From an SMP architecture point of view, the S/390 supports a higher number
of CPUs while maintaining a quite linear performance increase. While the
Intel multiprocessor allows up to 8 CPUs, the G6 supports 12 processors plus
two other processors configured for I/O or as spare processors.

Also, the availability of spare processors allows the substitution of a 
faulty
processor on-the-fly, without stopping the system and without the 
intervention
by the operating system or application.

Also, the design of the binodal cache allows the disabling of only a single
faulty processor, while, for example, the Intel multiprocessor needs to 
disable
4 processors if its bus fails.

The use of spare devices is not limited to processors only. For example, the
availability of spare memory modules allows to automatically substitute 
faulty
ones while continuing to work, thus obtaining very high availability and
avoiding user intervention.

While the IA32 offers higher computational power with faster processors that
are able to execute more than one simple instruction per clock cycle, the
S/390 offers an higher degree of reliability and a better balance between 
raw
computational power and I/O bandwidth, supporting a large number of
devices and a very optimized I/O mechanism. Also the S/390 offers higher
RAS, which is a very important factor when evaluating high end servers.

An Introduction to Wireless Technology
**********************************************

- Introduction

It may come as a surprise, but the earliest forms of communication were made
by using wireless data technology. Long before the telephone was invented by
Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, people were using wireless data
communications. American Indians used smoke signals to communicate over
long distances and messages could be passed along between a number of
people spread over a considerable distance. Sailors were using semaphore 
with
flags, or Morse code with signalling lanterns, to communicate between ships 
or
to the shore. Long distance communications were accomplished by using
carrier pigeons to deliver written messages. You can probably think of 
several
other examples of wireless data which have been used in the past.

Communication using coded signals rather than voice was still the only 
method
of sending information over long distance telegraph wires prior to the 
invention
of the telephone. Morse code allowed normally written characters and symbols
to be transmitted over copper wires for the first time. The first practical 
radio
communication was demonstrated by Gugielmi Marconi when he made the first
transatlantic wireless communication in 1901 using Morse code to transmit
messages. Voice communication over wires had been around for many years,
but Morse code was the only radio communication method until 1904 when a
demonstration of voice broadcasting was made at the St. Louis Worlds Fair.

Morse code is still used occasionally for long distance communications to 
ships
at sea and by amateur radio enthusiasts.

For the purposes of this text, we can define wireless communication as any
form of communication without using wires (or fiber optic cable). Data
communication means transmitting information that is not in the form of 
speech.
Radio (or radio frequency) is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that 
has a
frequency lower than that of infrared light.

The advent of computer communications has changed our perception of data
communications from thinking of Morse Code operating at one character per
second over relatively short distances to the very high-speed data links of
thousands or millions of bits of information per second over tremendous 
spans
of geography. The data transmitted can represent many different types of
information including multiple voice channels, full-motion video and 
computer
data. The most common use of radio data communication today is the
microwave link, which provides high-speed communications without underground
or overhead cables and is a primary mechanism for carrying long-distance 
voice
traffic.

Voice communications over radio has moved into the public domain with the
rapid spread of cellular telephone technology in many countries of the 
world.
Anyone with a cellular phone can now stay in touch with people while 
traveling,
or even just away from their normal telephone.

Parallel to these developments in wireless technology, the power of personal
computing has brought high-speed data processing ability to the desktop. New
applications have made PC users more productive; new lightweight and
inexpensive portable PCs allow users to take their information and tools 
with
them. The need to share information and resources among personal computer
users has spawned the spread of local area networks (LANs), which in turn 
have
required wire-based connections. The use of copper wires limits user 
flexibility
to move freely within the office environment. Growth in client/server
applications has made unfettered connectivity between workstations and other
network resources very attractive.

The marriage of wireless communications and mobile computing will transform
the way we do business. The convergence of hardware, software,
communications and wireless technologies will ensure that information and
services will be available to computer users at all times, in all places. 
Many
different wireless communication technologies currently support hundreds of
services. Cellular and cordless phones, pagers, portable computers, mobile
radio units, and vehicle tracking units all use a wide range of protocols 
and
transport options. Future portable products such as Personal Digital 
Assistants
(PDAs) or Personal Intelligent Communicators (PICs) will combine separate 
voice
and data functions in compact portable packages. The communications
technologies will provide a choice of communications methods with several
wired and wireless options available in a single device, automatically 
selected
for the most appropriate method according to the kind of information 
transfer
required, the physical location of the device, and the needs of the user.

- Why Is Wireless Technology Important?

Wireless communication is growing at an explosive rate around the world. In 
the
United States alone, the number of cellular telephones grew ten-fold from 
one
million in mid-1987 to 10 million in 1993; 180,000 cellular phones are being 
sold
each month. The number of cellular subscribers worldwide in 1994 was 52
million. In Europe, the highest penetration of cellular phones is in Sweden. 
With
a population of only 8 million people, more than one person in ten has a 
cellular
phone. There are some 50 million cordless telephones in use; satellite 
paging
systems (a small fraction of all paging systems) are projected to grow from 
$90
million in 1992 revenue to $500 million in 1995. Cellular phones have 
changed
from heavy automobile-mounted devices to shirt pocket portables weighing the
same as a pocket diary. The many emerging mobile end-user devices will
become *information appliances*.

Wireless products and services in the 1990s are forecasted to be an even 
bigger
revolution than the personal computer (PC) and local area network (LAN) were
in the 1980s. The mobility offered by wireless technology will be used to 
allow
businesses to optimize their use of employee time, become more competitive,
make better business decisions and provide better customer service. As a
result, many businesses will dramatically restructure their operations to 
more
effectively take advantage of wireless benefits. Therefore, industry will 
truly be
looking to install wireless solutions as a major step towards running 
businesses
profitably.

Cutting-edge companies today are capitalizing on time as a critical 
component of
competitive advantage. The way leading companies manage time in new
product development, product introduction and production, as well as in 
sales,
distribution and service, represent the most powerful new source of 
competitive
advantage. By reducing the consumption of time in every aspect of business,
companies reduce costs, improve quality and stay closer to their customers.

Some driving forces behind the interest in utilizing time as a source of
competitive advantage are as follows:

╖ Quicker response time - through the use of remote input and access of 
data,
  fax or voice information.

╖ Increased customer contact and satisfaction - by contacting customers 
early,
  before they contact someone else.

╖ *Just In Time* manufacturing practices - maintaining leaner inventories.

╖ Accuracy of information - direct input of data without transcribing.

╖ Faster management information systems - information *as it happens*.

We are truly witnessing one of the most dramatic opportunities of our time
Wireless communications will emerge as the major technology of the 21st
century. With wireless communications access any time and any place, you 
will
expect and get the delivery of information and services no matter where you 
are.

Wireless technologies make it possible to be logically present though remote
connections: an increased level of responsiveness can be achieved from 
remote
locations.

New wireless technologies offer convenience, providing value to general
business and everyday use. Un-tethered operations are required for immediacy
when moving about (for example, to contact a public safety officer on 
patrol, or a
medical professional in case of a problem), to avoid wiring expenses for
temporary communications or in an environment where wiring is impractical 
(for
example, a national landmark building or a staging area where emergency
response teams are mobilized), when wire lines are down (for example, in a
natural disaster), or where an inadequate, unreliable, or obsolete wired
infrastructure exists (for example, underdeveloped areas). Why now?

Technology has advanced and it is now possible to communicate with small,
reliable, energy-constrained mobile devices that are cheap enough for
widespread use. These radical changes occurred at a surprisingly rapid pace,
creating in a short time, mobile telephony systems used by millions. In the
1990s, other forms of information are being merged into more advanced 
digital
wireless systems, a trend driven by portable computers and digital hand-held
data devices. Metropolitan, national, and even international public and 
private
networks with wireless capability are emerging today. All of these wireless
*enablers* can be the basis of new devices and applications.

The most important issue for wireless communications in the 1990s is usage:
who will use the technology when and how will they use it? Cost of service 
will
also be a critical issue: how much will a user be willing to pay every month 
to
connect a personal communicator to a network? What value will be perceived
from such services? Cellular phone service has only been available for a few
years, and at first it was considered to be too expensive for general use 
and only
a few of the most senior people in large companies were able to justify the 
cost
of ownership. In a few short years cellular phones became an affordable and
sometimes essential device for all kinds of people in their working day. 
Today,
cellular phones are becoming common in the domestic environment and very
soon a mobile phone will be as essential as a TV receiver or VCR to an 
ordinary
family.

New technology drives new uses and applications for the technology, which in
turn creates demand for further technological advances. As more users
purchase equipment and services, so the price becomes more affordable and
the amount and diversity of uses increase.

Governmental regulation of the frequency spectrum is, and will continue to 
be,
another key question; the answer to which will dictate technical strategy 
and
tactical plans. Inconsistent worldwide frequency allocations and licensing 
will
remain an issue and inhibit international roaming. It will take a very long 
time
for all countries in the world to agree and implement a worldwide allocation 
of
radio frequencies. Governments and commercial enterprises have invested very
large sums of money in existing radio communication infrastructures and the
frequencies allocated to these applications will only be freed up once new
technology has been established and the very last user of the old service 
has
agreed to change to the new service.

Wireless communication solutions that provide logical presence through 
physical
roaming, or the ability to stay in touch on ones own terms, will continue to 
be in
great demand. Today, these requirements are requested by mobile
professionals and other workers who want to download E-mail, update their
calendars, send or receive a fax, check inventory, place an order, record 
route
status, call a customer, talk to a peer in short a virtual office - 
anywhere,
anytime. The Electronic Mail Association predicts a tripling of electronic 
mail
users, to 27 million sending more than 14 billion messages annually in 1995
alone.

Advances in semiconductor technologies enable the use of higher frequencies
and will achieve better reliability of wireless connections. This will 
accelerate
wireless product development. Continued miniaturization of circuitry, of
displays, of user interfaces (for example, gallium arsenide, flash memory), 
the
*building blocks* of portable devices, along with advances in low-power
electronics, battery (life, weight) and solar cell technologies, will also 
help the
mobile product user achieve higher levels of efficiency. Affordable 
application
solutions will be the key ingredient in the rapid acceptance of wireless
technologies.

Traditional methods of interaction with computing devices will have to 
change
when they become highly miniaturized and portable. For example, the
technology exists to build a computing device that may be worn on the wrist, 
but
it would be very difficult to interact with such a device using traditional 
methods.

It would be impossible to produce an alphanumeric computer keyboard that
could be used successfully and a screen could only display a few characters 
if it
were to be used by a person with average eyesight.

- Characteristics of the World of Wireless in the 1990s

In this changing world, technological leaders such as IBM will package
mobile/wireless devices and other products in individualized ways, 
implementing
seamless connectivity for vertical industry solutions to common business
problems. IBM will be a wireless vendor and service provider due to a
continued wireless communications focus that will be characterized by an
environment of:

   1. Ubiquity: People will want to be in touch from anywhere, at any time. 
This
      will force standards to emerge between carriers and between vendors 
for
      common devices and seamless roaming.

   2. Spectrum Availability: Current frequency allocations are not 
sufficient for the
      wireless public world of the 1990s. Constrained frequency allocations 
are a
      critical asset for competition, requiring competence on working 
through
      regulatory agencies and licensing bodies.

   3. Mass Customization: Wireless devices must be easily tailored (that is,
      programmable) to individual roles and preferences.

   4. Price discontinuities: A price threshold will be found which ignites 
explosive
      usage of cellular and RF data, fax, and voice usage.

   5. Social/human/usability issues: The social acceptability of wireless 
devices
      will affect demand. For example, wireless technologies could enable 
people
      to have their personal whereabouts recorded, resulting in an 
undesirable
      invasion of privacy. People may not want to be able to be reached in
      circumstances where they are used to unwinding and being out of touch.

      Human-centric solutions will be required.

   6. Key applications, total systems solutions: critical vertical and 
cross-industry
      applications will propel wireless technologies. Simply put, wireless
      applications are crucial and product vendors will have to align with
      application developers.

   7. Merging industries: The computer, communications, networking, consumer
      electronics, and entertainment industries of the next five years will 
be much
      more integrated than they are today.

   8. Wireless communities are emerging, especially in sparsely populated 
areas
      (for example, the telephone connections in the Australian outback are 
mostly
      wireless). The high cost of long cable runs in rural areas makes 
wireless
      communication a more cost-effective solution. Wireless technologies 
will be
      a credible and cost-effective alternative to upgrading some existing 
wired
      infrastructures or creating a spontaneous communication situation, 
such as
      in a disaster area.

   9. Technological advances in batteries (life, weight), solar power, and 
circuit
      miniaturization will increasingly enable attractive, functional, 
affordable, and
      practical devices which will use wireless communications.

  10. Incorporated intelligence will become more pervasive. Appliances,
      automobiles, or remote equipment will use wireless devices to alert 
central
      maintenance facilities when service is required. Intelligent vending
      machines will automatically place just-in-time wireless calls for 
restocking,
      cash removal, and service; allowing vendors to operate at enormously
      improved levels of efficiency.

  11. Wireless networks will provide value added services both directly and 
by
      means of links into other services. Delivery of timely, accurate and 
relevant
      information such as weather warnings, traffic delays and emergency
      messages will become an essential part of any wireless network 
service.

- Wireless Applications

The main driving force behind wireless and remote computing devices is the
applications. The successful introduction of a new technology depends on the
wide acceptance of those applications which use that technology. The
applications must meet a real need.

-- Voice Communication

Early wireless communications used Morse code followed by simple voice
communications. In the 1930s, radio equipment used valves (tubes) which
needed high-wattage power supplies. Radio receivers were either electric 
main
power source operated or needed large batteries for the high voltages 
required.

Police mobile radio allowed one-way communication from central dispatch to
cars who listened in on dedicated frequency bands. The police officer then
called back from a pay phone. Amplitude Modulation (AM) was employed but
was not very efficient in using the available bandwidth. In 1935 Frequency
Modulation (FM) was invented. It was further developed by the military 
during
World War II and in the 1940s all police radio systems were moved to FM. The
need for two-way communications led to the establishment of the first Mobile
Telephone Service in 1946 in St.Louis. This was based on one FM transmitter
with a coverage area of 50 miles (80 km) diameter. Within a year this 
service
was available in 25 US States. The system used a number of base stations,
each with an FM transmitter. Each base station was connected into the wired
telephone network using a controller.

A new and improved wireless system was introduced in the mid 1960s. This
system was known as the Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) and was
the forerunner of the present cellular service. The new features included:

╖ Automatic trunking (all users can access all channels - no dedicated
  channels)
╖ Direct dialing (no operator at the mobile network controller)
╖ Full-duplex (no *push to talk* required)
╖ FM channel of 25-30 kHz
╖ Each phone searches for a free channel (special tone used)

As the number of subscribers increased there were not enough channels
available to allow access for everyone who wanted a connection. This led to 
the
development of cellular radio. By reducing the area covered, the bandwidth
could be reused and hence more users could be supported. Cities and rural
districts were carved up into *cells* or areas, each with their own base
transmitter. The same frequencies were used as before but with much lower
transmitter power. Since the power is low, the signals remain within the 
cell,
which has a diameter of between 1 mile (1.6 Km) and 20 miles (32 km) with 
little
chance of interference in nearby cells. To further reduce the probability of
interference between mobile stations on the same channel in adjacent cells,
channel re-use was not allowed until a cell was skipped. The first cellular
systems were developed by Bell Laboratories in the 1970s and experimental
operation of the Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMPS) began in 1979 in
Chicago. Other countries followed with their own versions of cellular 
telephone
systems, notably the Scandinavian countries in 1981 with the Nordic Mobile
Telephone on 450 MHz (NMT450), and the UK in 1985 with the Total Access
Control System (TACS). Japan has its own unique analog cellular system
developed by NTT, and Germany and France both have unique systems that are
incompatible with other countries.

Hexagon shapes are a convenient way of illustrating the network, but in real 
life,
the cells can be very irregular shapes.The center cell of each group of 
seven cells
has a range of frequencies.

Other cells have different frequencies assigned to them, and so on.
No two adjacent cells have the same set of
frequencies; there are always at least two intervening cells before the
frequencies are re-used.

At first, only the major cities were covered with cellular transmitters. It 
was not
always economical to cover less populated areas as the initial costs were 
high
(prices ranged upwards to tens of millions of dollars).

In the early 1980s the capacity of urban cells reached their limits and were
divided up into smaller and smaller cells with lower power transmitters. 
Since a
mobile cellular telephone (for example, in a car) can receive signals from
different cell transmitters (known as base stations) near cell boundaries, a
mobile switching center (MSC) was created to coordinate the frequencies used
by the different mobile users and cell transmitters. As the mobile user 
moves
out of a cell, the MSC must decide which is the proper cell to take over the 
call.

The MSC can communicate with all mobile phones in the area of the base
stations which it controls by means of a special radio channel called a 
control
channel. This channel is not used for voice communications but allows the 
MSC
to send instructions to the mobile phone. The MSC contacts each adjacent 
cell
and instructs it to measure the signal strength of the mobile unit. The 
results
are transmitted back to the MSC and the strongest signal and cell are
determined. A new channel is allocated in the destination cell and the 
current
cell is instructed to relay this information to the mobile station. This is 
known as
a *handoff*. Cellular handoffs today can take several seconds. This is fine 
if
cells are large and not many cell boundaries are crossed, but mobile 
cellular
units in a car can cross cell boundaries often in urban locations. For this
reason, in 1984 an additional 10 MHz of bandwidth was allocated by the FCC 
in
USA to bring the total to 50 MHz in the 800 MHz band for the Advanced Mobile
Phone Service (AMPS). This allows 832 channels (full duplex) to be used.

Handoffs can also occur even when the mobile station is not moving. The MSC
can balance the load of users between base stations by switching some of the
users from a base station which is heavily loaded to an adjacent base 
station
which has some spare capacity. This is, of course, only possible if some of 
the
users are in an area where they can communicate with both base stations. The
reason for doing this is to ensure that there is always some spare capacity 
for
new callers to access the base station or for callers in vehicles that are 
passing
through the area.

When a cellular phone is first switched on, it will scan a predetermined set 
of
radio channels. These channels are the control channels that have been
allocated to the particular cellular network on which the phone is 
registered as a
valid subscriber. A different network in the same geographical location will 
have
a different set of control channels allocated to it. The phone may have the 
ability
to be registered with more than one network, but the user must decide which
network the phone will register with at any one time. This is normally
accomplished using a menu-driven selection from the keypad of the phone.

Once the phone has scanned all the control channels for the network, it will 
build
a table of the frequencies of the strongest signals. Not all of the control
channels available for a network will be within range and the phone will try 
and
use the channel with the strongest signal first. It will initiate a 
registration with
the base station whose signal is strongest. If it fails to do this, then it 
will try the
next strongest signal and so on. If the phone cannot, for some reason, 
register
with any base station, it will indicate the fact to the user by means of an 
*out of
service* indicator. The most common reasons for not being able to register 
are:

╖ The phone is not in an area of cellular coverage
╖ The phone is in a *blackspot* (radio coverage hole)
╖ The base station is busy with other callers
╖ The phone is not registered as a valid subscriber to the network

Cellular phones have a physical identifier encoded in them as well as their
mobile phone number. The physical identifier is known as the electronic 
serial
number or ESN, and is assigned to the phone at the time of manufacture. The
ESN is used to ensure that there is no fraudulent use of the phone network. 
The
ESN and the subscribers mobile phone number are held by the network
operator, and each time that a phone tries to register with the network, the
subscriber number and the ESN are compared to ensure that the combination of
the two is valid. In the early days of cellular telephones, the ESN was 
sufficient
to prevent fraud, but today, ways have been found to re-write ESNs and
fraudulently register stolen phones. Fraudulent use of cellular phones is a 
major
problem in the US and is reaching other parts of the world very rapidly. The
new digital phone technologies will have more sophisticated methods of fraud
prevention.

Different cellular technologies (AMPS, ETACS, NMT) will have slightly 
different
detailed implementations of the calling process, but the overall sequence is
similar for all technologies. When a subscriber with a cellular phone wishes 
to
make a call, the phone number is entered on the key pad of the phone and the
SEND button is pressed. This causes the phone to send the dialled digits to 
the
network via the control channel assuming that the phone is still registered 
with a
base station. The cellular network will then assign a voice channel for the
connection once the called partys phone starts to ring.

While the call is in progress, the network can detect if a mobile phone is 
moving
out of range of a particular base station. The network can then request that 
the
phone switch channels to a closer base station to continue the call. This is
achieved by the transmission of a short burst of data on the voice channel 
which
is not passed to the audio circuits of the phone, and thus is not heard by 
the
subscriber.

When a call is placed to a mobile phone the call is first routed to the MSC
closest to the origin of the call. If there is more than one MSC in the 
network,
the call will be routed to the MSC that the phone was last registered in. 
The
MSC will then transmit a paging message to all mobile phones in its area. If 
the
mobile phone responds, the MSC will assign a voice channel and route the 
call
to it. If the mobile phone does not respond, the other MSCs will try paging
mobile phones in their areas.

-- The Move to Digital

Analog mobile telephony served well as a first-generation technology; 
however,
analog services are now straining to keep up with user demand. Analog
transmissions are less efficient than digital transmissions when it comes to
spectrum utilization. Most analog standards allow low-speed (up to 4.8 Kbps)
data transmission such as fax or file transfer, but interface equipment is
expensive compared to the cost of mobile phones, and performance can be
unreliable (for example, fax only works well when sent from a stationary
terminal). Roaming across national boundaries is only possible where
neighboring countries implement the same standards.

For these reasons, efforts to develop next-generation mobile telephony 
networks
focus on digital technologies in general and on GSM (Global System for 
Mobile
Communications, formally called Group SpΘcial Mobile), a digital 
transmission
standard accepted by all European countries and many other countries.

Analog cellular phone systems such as AMPS, TACS and NMT use the analog
signal from the microphone to modulate the frequency of the radio carrier 
wave
directly using frequency modulation.

A digital cellular phone will convert the analog signal from the microphone 
into
digital data which will then be used to modulate the carrier. This would 
normally
use phase modulation.The analog signal is converted using a device
called a vocoder which will sample the level of the analog signal many times
during a single cycle of the signal. A single level sample will be encoded 
as a
binary value and strung together with other sample values to form a 
continuous
data stream. At the receiving end, the data stream is broken up into 
individual
samples which are used to reconstruct the original signal. In order to keep 
the
amount of data to a manageable level, the data is compressed at the
transmitting end and decompressed at the receiving end. These compression
techniques take advantage of the characteristics of human speech and the 
silent
periods between words. Most digital cellular systems use this basic 
technology
for transmission of speech, but will vary in the way they modulate the radio
carrier and the structure of the network.

GSM will serve as the basis for forthcoming mobile telephony services.
Compared with analog services, GSM, which operates in the 900 MHz band,
offers greater signal quality and hence fewer transmission errors, better 
security
through encryption and encoding, and more efficient use of the spectrum 
giving
higher network capacity. The GSM networks now in place handle voice traffic
and data services are just starting in a few countries, notably the UK and
Germany. Other countries plan to implement data in the near future. The data
services offer data transmission rates up to 9.6 Kbps for circuit switched
connections and a Short Message Service (SMS) which provides the ability to 
do
two-way paging using a GSM phone. In addition, fax services will be provided
and a later implementation will include packet data services.

Digital mobile telephony services also can be provided via the Digital
Communications System (DCS) 1800 standard, developed by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as an extension of GSM.

DCS1800 services, known as Personal Communications Networks (PCNs),
operate in the 1800 MHz band in Europe. PCN and GSM are functionally similar
in terms of voice quality, data facilities, and call handling. One 
difference
between the two is that PCN is available only on hand-portable terminals, 
while
GSM is available on hand-portable and higher-powered car-mounted terminals.

Because PCNs use a higher radio frequency, they require more base stations
than GSM networks, which means they will be more expensive to install and
operate. For this reason, PCN service providers are expected to focus their
attention on urban areas, which means users looking for wider geographic
coverage probably will tend towards GSM networks. PCN is often referred to 
as
Microcellular, since the cells are smaller than regular cells allowing 
phones to
be smaller using less power.

GSM technology in the form of DCS1900 will be seen in North America as the
first systems using Personal Communications Services (PCS) licenses are
implemented. DCS1900 is the same as DCS1800 except that the operating
frequency is 1900 MHz.

AMPS is based on analog technology and is available in North and South
America as well as some Asian and African countries. D-AMPS is a digital
cellular radio system now being implemented in North America.

An alternative digital cellular phone technology, CDMA, is being implemented 
by
Qualcomm and may result in differing digital cellular services in different 
parts of
North America.

-- Cordless Telephones

In addition to the requirement for telephone equipment to be mobile across 
large
distances, the desire to have mobile telephone access within a limited 
space,
typically within 50 to 100 meters of a base station (such as the home or an 
office)
led to the development of the cordless telephone. This does not offer mobile
access as with the cellular systems. It is really an access technology into 
a
business PBX system or a domestic telephone connection. The cost is low and 
it
offers less function than cellular phones.

Early cordless phones suffered from a number of problems. Not all countries
had standards for cordless phones and interference to essential services was
caused by imported devices that operated in parts of the spectrum allocated 
for
other services. Cordless phones had a very limited number of radio channels
and users could eavesdrop on their neighbors conversations. In addition,
fraudulent use of cordless phones could result in a third party making calls 
from
a cordless handset by accessing a cordless base station that did not belong 
to
them, thus avoiding paying for the call. These problems were overcome when
standards for cordless phones were implemented.

Several cordless communications standards are now in use, including the 
analog
Cordless Telephony 0 (CT-0) and CT-1 standards and the CT-2 digital 
standard.

CT-2 has been adopted by ETSI as an interim European standard for domestic
and business applications. CT-2 is likely to be superseded by Digital 
European
Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), a digital standard which can be used for
wireless LANs. Both CT-2 and DECT can support voice and data, but DECT has a
wider range (up to 200 meters) and greater data capacity (up to 384 Kbps,
compared with CT-2s 32 Kbps). The actual throughput of data using DECT is
closer to 320 Kbps because there are channels which are there for 
supervisory
and control functions which use some of the capacity. Another DECT advantage
is that connections can be handed off between base stations, a feature that 
CT-2
cannot provide, and the ability of the mobile station to receive calls as 
well as to
initiate them.

DECT will use very similar technology to GSM/DCS1800, which should provide
low-cost implementations and the ability to use common designs which could
have the ability to access different networks in the future.

Telepoint is another cordless system that requires users to be within close 
range
(100 to 200 meters) of a base station. Telepoint is being deployed as a
wide-area service, with base stations typically located in public-access 
areas
such as shopping centers, airports, and train stations. As in mobile 
telephony
services, Telepoint users can place calls over the public dial-up network. A 
key
difference, however, is that the CT-2 standard used for Telepoint services 
allows
users only to place calls; CT-2-based systems do not handle incoming calls.

Some service operators work around this limitation by providing pagers to 
notify
users that someone is trying to contact them, while others allow incoming 
calls
to users logged in to their nearest base station. Telepoint services are 
intended
primarily for voice communications. France Telecom is developing an 
interface
between Bi-Bop, its Telepoint service, and Personal Digital Assistants 
(PDAs).

The Telepoint services in both the UK and Germany have both been
discontinued due to the limited functionality available, and the ubiquity 
and low
cost of full cellular and PCN networks. Telepoint may be revived in these
countries once DECT technology is implemented.

-- Private Mobile Radio

Unlike mobile telephony services, which are linked to the public network, 
private
mobile radio (PMR) and private access mobile radio (PAMR) services handle
closed user groups only. In a typical PMR/PAMR application, mobile workers
use the system to communicate both with a central control point and with one
another. Primary users include providers of emergency services, public 
utilities
and taxi companies. PMR networks are generally owned and operated by the
organizations that use them, while PAMR (or trunked) networks are run by
third-party providers that offer services on a subscription basis. One of 
the main
benefits of using a third-party service is geographic coverage: PAMR 
operators
have more resources to build widespread networks than most individual
organizations. PMR services currently are based on a wide variety of
proprietary analog transmission standards, while many PAMR services have
adopted the UK MPT standard. Like mobile telephony services, PMR/PAMR
services are optimized for voice, although some network operators such as
National Band III in the UK are now offering data services. Some examples of
the use of PMR/PAMR are as follows:

   ╖ Most police forces use their own PMR systems to communicate with 
officers
     in vehicles and on foot patrol.

   ╖ Utility companies use PMR systems to direct their engineers for 
maintenance
     or repairs.

   ╖ Ambulance services use PMR to direct vehicles to accident sites.

   ╖ Trucking companies will use PMR to stay in touch with drivers.

   ╖ In the UK, the Automobile Association uses mobile radio networks to 
send
     information about disabled cars to repair personnel.

A number of factors, including differences in frequency allocations, now 
prevent
PMR/PAMR networks from handling communications outside national borders.

Some of the trunked PMR networks make use of the older VHF TV frequencies
which may be different in various countries. This limitation on roaming may 
be
lifted in Europe in the future, thanks to a digital mobile radio standard 
now being
developed by ETSI. That standard, known as TETRA (Trans European Trunked
Radio), will provide improved voice quality, faster data rates, better 
security
(through encryption), and more efficient spectrum use for PMR, PAMR and
mobile data services (see below). However, specific decisions on frequency
allocation and supported data rates have not yet been agreed upon. Although
PMR/PAMR networks tend to be less expensive than mobile telephony services,
the fact that they accommodate only closed user groups limits their use.

However, once an organization has been allocated a frequency to use for PMR
communications, it would be very reluctant to give it up as there would be 
very
little chance of getting another allocation. This situation is limiting the
opportunity to move to Private Access Mobile Radio. Organizations that 
require
mobile communications with third parties are obliged to use mobile telephony
services or mobile data services.

-- Mobile Data Services

The cellular telephone networks of the 1980s could be used to transmit data 
in
much the same way as it is done over the public-switched telephone network
(PSTN). However, this technology was slow, unreliable, and expensive and it
was recognized that a dedicated wireless data network could solve these
problems.

In 1983, IBM developed a private packet radio data network called DCS (Data
Communication System) for the use of its field engineers. This was used for 
call
dispatch and call reporting and some other data applications. The terminal
device consisted of a hand held data terminal about the size and shape of a
house brick, by which name it was consequently known. The radio 
infrastructure
was provided by Motorola and operated at 4.8 Kbps on a carrier frequency of 
800
MHz. The network covered the major cities of the United States but the FCC
licence did not allow the service to be sold to other users. At the same 
time,
Motorola was building a network using the same technology for public access.

In 1990, the IBM and Motorola networks were joined to form a public access
network known as ARDIS (Advanced Radio Data Information System). The
original implementation of ARDIS used a protocol known as MDC4800, but a new
protocol called RD-LAP is being introduced alongside with the advantage of
operating at 19.2 Kbps.

In 1984 a similar technology was being developed in Sweden by Swedish
Telecom (now called Telia Mobitel) and Eritel AB. The technology was known 
as
Mobitex and was supplied by Ericsson Mobile Communications AB. The first
commercial operation started in Sweden in 1986. The first systems operated 
in
Scandinavia were in various parts of the VHF band (dependant on country), 
and
had a data rate of 1200 bps. The Mobitex system spread to other parts of 
Europe
and was developed to operate at 8 Kbps in the 400 - 450 MHz band. In North
America the same system is used but in the 800 MHz band.

Mobitex has now become the defacto standard in Europe with only Germany
having an active RD-LAP network (Modacom). Both Mobitex and the ARDIS
MDC4800/RD-LAP systems are available in North America. Both systems are
used in other parts of the world, notably Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim
where the Motorola technology is known as Datatac.

There are other radio packet data network technologies, but these tend to be
unique to individual environments or countries. For example, in the UK there
are two other radio packet data networks:

   ╖ Paknet - a wireless extension of the X.25 PSS network operated by 
Vodafone
     on VHF frequencies and using some of the Vodafone cellular telephone
     infrastructure.

   ╖ Cognito - a VHF two-way radio messaging system using hand held 
integrated
     data terminals.

At the moment there are no international recognized standards for mobile 
data
networks, and no common frequencies available in all countries. There is 
only
limited roaming capability between countries which have common frequency
allocations.

Mobile data services also use radio-spectrum more efficiently than other 
mobile
services, which means they tend to cost less. One problem with the use of
packet switching in mobile data networks is that there usually is some delay 
in
getting data to the intended receiver. With circuit-switched services like 
mobile
telephony and PMR/PAMR networks, end-to-end circuits guarantee immediate
delivery. Mobile data networks are like conventional X.25 networks in that
packets are sent to a central network point which then forwards those 
packets to
the receiver.

Mobile data services are ideal for organizations that require regular data
transmissions between mobile terminals, such as those located in delivery
vehicles. Where regulations permit, some companies are deploying mobile data
services for stationary terminals, such as point-of-sale terminals in retail 
stores.

Although mobile radio networks can accommodate transmissions of larger 
files,
such as fax documents, the nature of most applications makes such file 
transfers
impractical. Most packet radio applications are built to handle large 
numbers of
very short transactions. A fax document or large file transfer could tie up 
an
entire 9.6 Kbps channel for several minutes, disrupting the networks main
purpose.

The fact that mobile data networks require more customization has limited 
their
appeal to larger organizations. But the arrival of some generic, 
off-the-shelf
applications such as electronic mail transfer could make mobile data 
services
more attractive to small organizations.

-- Satellite Applications

Satellite navigation systems can be used to show the position of a vehicle
anywhere on the Earths surface.

--- Global Positioning System

The Global Positioning System (GPS) was developed for the US Military, but 
can
be used to provide positional information for commercial and even leisure
applications. The GPS system consists of a bracelet of satellites 
transmitting
information about their position relative to the Earth, and very accurate 
timing
information. A small receiver in a vehicle can determine its position on the
surface of the earth by receiving signals from at least three satellites. 
With three
satellites the position can be determined in two dimensions, but with four 
or
more signals received the altitude can be measured as well. In open country, 
a
receiver can normally receive information from five satellites. The 
positional
information can be calculated by the receiver knowing how long the radio 
signal
takes to reach it from each satellite (and thus its distance from it) and 
the
position of each satellite in space. The US Military has built in a random 
error
mechanism so that other users cannot achieve the same accuracy as official
users, who access the GPS information on a separate encrypted radio channel.

GPS equipment has now been developed that is highly miniaturized and
ruggedized, may be carried by people who are walking in remote areas or by
small boat sailors. The cost of these devices has reduced to the point where
they are no more expensive than a good quality VCR.

--- Direct Broadcast Satellites

The satellite systems that are most familiar to us are the Direct Broadcast
Satellite (DBS) systems. These can carry hundreds of TV channels in addition 
to
other services. DBS satellites are normally in geostationary orbit, which 
means
they appear to be in one position in the sky at all times. This is achieved 
by
placing them in an orbit whose period is identical to that of the Earths 
rotation.

The altitude required for a geostationary circular orbit is 35,803 km.

--- Communication Satellites

Communication satellite systems are used to access remote parts of the 
world,
as well as providing intercontinental telephone, TV and data links. The
intercontinental services are provided by fixed groundstations in each 
continent
and form part of the international telecommunications network. Private 
satellite
service operators such as Inmarsat and Eutelsat provide communication 
services
to mobile groundstations. The mobile groundstations tend to be bulky and 
have
to have their antennae accurately positioned to establish communications.
These services include TV and voice reporting from remote locations as well 
as
data services.

Companies such as IBM can offer communication satellite uplink and downlink
services, providing communication satellite access without the need for the
customer to invest in their own groundstations.

--- Satellite Phone Systems

Over the next few years we will expect to see a number of global phone 
satellite
networks which will supplement existing cellular and other wireless 
networks.
Satellite phone networks will provide global coverage to hand portable 
wireless
phones and to fixed stations in remote parts of the world. This will allow
communities is isolated locations to access to the switched network of the 
rest of
the world. At present, there are many locations where it is either 
physically
impossible or too expensive to provide land line communications and 
satellite
phones will be able to bring normal telephone communications to these 
people.

There are four systems proposed at the time of writing as follows:

   ╖ Odyssey
   	- 12 satellites
   	- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
	- Eight Earth Stations
	- Planned for year 2000

   ╖ Globalstar
	- 48 satellites
	- Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
	- 200 Earth Stations
	- Planned for year 1998

   ╖ Iridium
	- 66 satellites
	- Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
	- Planned for year 1998

   ╖ Inmarsat-P
	- 10 satellites
	- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
	- Planned for year 2000

Low Earth Orbiting systems typically orbit at around 750 km altitude and 
require
around 50 satellites to provide global coverage. Medium Earth Orbiting 
systems
have an altitude of 10,000 km and only need about a quarter of the number of
satellites.

The LEO satellite systems discussed above are generally known as *Big LEOs*
to distinguish them from another class of satellite called *Little LEOs*. 
Little
LEOs are primarily for low bandwidth applications such as locator service,
two-way messaging and spot coverage for cellular carriers. They may use UHF
or even VHF for communications.

- Wireless Methodologies

This bit discusses some of the basic physics associated with wireless
transmission techniques and goes on to describe how the technology is
implemented in various applications.

-- Radio Frequency Characteristics

The characteristics of radio waves in any frequency band determine how 
useful
those frequencies are for the service required. The main characteristic of
interest is how signals are changed or distorted, by absorption and 
reflection, by
the air and other physical media before reaching the receiver. Since a radio
signal is a particular form of energy, it is useful to consider the 
different forms of
energy and how they can be converted and transmitted.

--- General Aspects

In order to understand some of the properties of radio and infrared 
propagation
it is important that the underlying principles or the physics of 
electromagnetic
waves be defined. A good starting point is a discussion of energy and the 
ways
it can be transmitted. Energy is defined in physics as the result of 
multiplying
power by time and may take a number of different forms (such as sound,
electrical, kinetic, potential, chemical, heat, and nuclear energy). A 
fundamental
principle of physics is that of the conservation of energy - energy can be 
neither
gained nor lost, only converted from one form to another. When we talk about
generating a particular form of energy, say electricity, what we are really 
doing
is changing one form of energy (heat to electricity) in a power generating 
station.

Some forms of energy are mechanical in nature, for example, kinetic energy. 
An
object is said to have kinetic energy by virtue of its motion. A moving 
vehicle
has kinetic energy and this has been converted from chemical energy in the
gasoline and air used to power the engine. If the vehicle is driven to the 
top of a
hill, it is said to have gained potential energy. The energy is stored in 
the
vehicle and can be released by coasting down the other side of the hill thus
becoming kinetic energy again. If the vehicle is brought to a halt, it will 
lose its
kinetic energy, which will be converted to heat by raising the temperature 
of the
brakes. Whenever one form of energy is converted to another, the process may
not be very efficient in changing the energy into the form desired. The 
internal
combustion engine moving our vehicle will convert some of the chemical 
energy
into kinetic energy, but quite a lot will be converted to heat. This energy 
is not
lost, it is just not in a form which is useful in moving the vehicle. Even 
this
wasted heat is welcome on a cold day!

A special form of potential energy is called elastic potential energy. An 
example
of this is a clock spring which can store the kinetic energy used to wind it 
and
release it again as kinetic energy to drive the clock.

A special form of kinetic energy is heat. The temperature of an object is 
due to
minute vibrations of its molecules. As an object cools, it will transmit its 
heat
energy to its surroundings, air and other objects, by means of infrared 
radiation
and conduction. Eventually the object and its surroundings will all have the
same temperature and no energy will be transferred. This is known as 
entropy,
which is the tendency for all energy to have the same potential, and thus no
useful work can be done.

Sound can also be looked upon as a form of kinetic energy, but in the form 
of
pressure waves or vibrations in a fluid or solid. Because sound requires a
medium, it cannot traverse the vacuum of space.

Chemical energy is energy that is released in a chemical reaction such as
combustion. It is normally converted into light or heat, or even directly 
into
electrical energy as in a battery.

Nuclear energy is released by nuclear fission (splitting an atomic nucleus), 
or
nuclear fusion (joining of subatomic particles).

Electrical energy is transferred either by conduction or radiation. When an
electric current flows in a wire energy is transferred by conduction. 
Electrical
energy is also radiated by a radio transmitter.

An electric current will flow in a conductor such as a copper wire, if there 
is a
potential difference between the two ends. A potential difference can be
considered as an excess of electrons at one end and a shortage of electrons 
at
the other end. As the current flows, an electromagnetic field is generated 
and if
the wire has resistance, some of the energy will be converted to heat, thus
warming the wire.

The relationship between the potential difference (voltage), the electrical
resistance of the wire, and the current flowing through the wire was first
described by Ohm for direct current in his well-known law:

	E = I x R
			where E = Potential Difference in volts
			I = Current in amps
			R = Resistance in ohms

In other words, the greater the resistance (which is proportional to the 
length) of
the wire, the less current will flow through the wire for a given voltage 
level.

This law forms the basis for much of electrical theory and is valid for 
direct
current (an electric current that does not vary in time). An electric 
current that
varies in time is known as an alternating current, which is the normal 
method for
distributing electricity for domestic and commercial use. When dealing with
alternating current, the R (representing resistance) is replaced by a Z
representing impedance:

	E = I x Z
			where E = Potential difference in volts
			I = Current in amps
			Z = Impedance in ohms

			Impedance is made up of two components:
			1. R - the resistance of the wire.
			2. X - the active or frequency dependent
			       part of the impedance, 90░ phase
			       shifted with R.

where the following equation is used to describe the late relationship 
between
them:

	Z = R + iX

The *i* simply means 90░ phase shifted.

This shows how impedance, or the characteristics of a wire or other 
material,
changes with the frequency of the signal passing through it.

A high frequency alternating current will generate a radio frequency signal 
as it
passes through a conducting wire, creating the simplest form of radio
transmitter.

The different forms of electromagnetic radiation are defined by their 
frequencies
and include radio waves, infrared radiation (heat), visible light, ultra 
violet light,
X-rays and gamma rays.

All these different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation form the 
electromagnetic
spectrum.

For the purposes of this theory we will consider radiant energy as an
electromagnetic wave, but it can also be viewed as a series of particles or
quanta, which is sometimes more convenient when explaining certain 
properties.

Electromagnetic radiation can travel through free space and can also travel
through various solids and fluids to varying degrees dependent on the 
frequency
and the kind of solid or fluid. For example, light can travel through air, 
water
and glass, but not other solid material. Radio frequency waves can travel
through some solids, but not through metal, while metal can be transparent 
to
X-rays and gamma rays. You can see that the higher frequency waves have
more ability to penetrate solids than those with lower frequencies.

Although radio frequency waves may be able to penetrate the material of a
building, the construction of modern buildings may prevent radio 
transmissions
from reaching the inside of an office block. Most modern buildings are
constructed using a steel frame to provide the main structural integrity. 
The
external cladding is fixed to the frame to enclose the space and provide an
aesthetically pleasing appearance. Internal subdivisions for offices are
constructed using steel or wooden frames to support partition walls. Radio
waves are able to penetrate the cladding of the building but the steel frame 
acts
as a *Faraday Cage* to effectively screen the interior of the building to 
radio
waves of some wavelengths. This effect was named after Michael Faraday who
was the first to demonstrate and explain it. If the construction of the 
frame or
*cage* is such that the spaces between the steel girders equate to, or are
smaller than the wavelength of a radio signal then the signal is drastically
attenuated. Radio frequencies for use in buildings must be carefully 
selected to
ensure that the best compromise be made between the Faraday Cage effect and
the material penetration capability of radio waves. The Faraday Cage effect 
is
used in electronic devices to provide screening of unwanted radio frequency
signals without the need to used solid metal enclosures.

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation will travel at the same velocity, 
that
is, 186,321 miles/s or 299,790 km/s. This is commonly termed *the speed of
light*. The velocity in fluids and solids will vary according to the type of 
material
and the frequency of the radiation. This can be easily demonstrated when 
white
light is passed through a prism. White light is made up of a number of 
different
frequencies corresponding to the different colors of the visible spectrum. 
The
shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) will travel more slowly through the
glass of the prism and be refracted more than the lower wavelengths. Thus 
the
violet light will be bent by the glass of the prism more than the red light 
and this
will result in the white light being spread into a spectrum of all the 
colors. Some
radio waves have similar properties to light and similar techniques may be 
used
to control them.

Electromagnetic radiation is normally considered to consist of a sine wave 
which
has the properties of wavelength, frequency and amplitude.

The relationship between frequency and wavelength is given by the following
equation:

	l = (300 x 10╖)/f
				where f = frequency in Hz
				and l = wavelength in meters
				(300 x 10╖ is the speed of light)

Electromagnetic radiation can be generated in various ways according to the
frequency of the radiation required. Light and heat can be generated by 
simply
raising the temperature of an object, while radio waves and X-rays need more
sophisticated methods.

Note: Objects which are raised to very high temperatures will radiate energy
over a very wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, the sun
radiates radio frequency, heat, visible light, ultra violet light, X-rays 
and gamma
rays. However, it is not practical to use this method to generate and 
control
anything other than heat or light.

An alternating electric current will generate electromagnetic radiation. 
This is
probably the most common method for producing most kinds of electromagnetic
radiation in use today.

Electrical energy is transmitted in the form of electrical impulses or 
waves,
regardless of whether the energy is conveyed across wires, air or water. The
frequency is expressed in hertz (Hz), which represent impulses or cycles per
second. The electrical energy, or signal, is changed by the medium that it
passes through. It can be attenuated (absorbed) or reflected resulting in a
signal that is distorted in some way. Waves are changed in size or amplitude
(attenuated), direction (reflected), or shape (distorted), depending on the
frequency of the signal and the characteristics of the medium that they pass
through. By choosing the correct medium, a signal can be changed or
controlled. An electrical signal will be attenuated when it passes through a 
wire.

High frequency light signals can travel through air, are reflected by 
mirrored
surfaces, and are absorbed by most solid objects. For example, light signals 
can
pass through the atmosphere but are blocked by solid walls, unless made of
glass or transparent material. Low-frequency signals are not propagated well 
by
air but can travel well through some solid objects depending on 
conductivity.

For example, the electric power generated by public utility systems will 
remain
mostly within the copper transmission wires which are a very suitable medium
for electric current. (Some of the energy will be radiated in the form of 
electrical
and magnetic fields around the wire.) On the other hand, plastic cladding 
for the
wires is a good insulator for low-frequency electric utility power, 
effectively
blocking current flow. Submarine communication is generally made at low
frequencies since water attenuates high-frequency signals. Frequencies below
900 MHz can, in general, propagate well through walls and other barriers.

As radio frequencies increase and approach the frequency of light, they take 
on
more of the propagation characteristics of light. Signals between 900 MHz 
and
18 GHz, typically used by wireless LANs, are not as limited as light but 
still do
not pass through physical barriers as easily as typical radio broadcast band
signals (1600 kHz, 100 MHz). Signals of 300 MHz or higher can be reflected,
focused, and controlled similarly to a beam of light. Parabolic transmitting
antennae use the properties of UHF and higher frequency signals to allow a
relatively low-power signal to be focussed directly towards its destination. 
Still
closer to light signals, infrared signals have properties similar to light.

Experimenting with a remote TV controller at home can help you understand
which surfaces reflect infrared signals and how directional they are. By
choosing the most suitable frequency, you can achieve the best propagation 
or
transmission characteristics.

The fact that only radio signals of certain frequencies are reflected by 
certain
surfaces can be utilized to advantage. For example, the ability of high 
frequency
microwave signals to penetrate the earths atmosphere without being reflected 
is
useful for satellite communications. Lower frequency signals (200 kHz to 30
MHz) are reflected back from the ionosphere (upper layer of the atmosphere),
depending on time of day, season, and sunspot activity. This characteristic
enables radio signals to be bounced off the ionosphere for long-distance
communications beyond the horizon.

When higher frequency carrier waves are used, there is normally more
bandwidth available to transmit information. By increasing the bandwidth of 
a
communications channel, more data may be transmitted in a given period of
time since the information is directly proportional to the bandwidth of the 
signal.
For example, a 100 kHz bandwidth channel can pass 100 times the amount of
information per second that a 1 kHz channel can.

The frequencies of most interest to wireless transmission range from near 
the
200 kHz mark, where long wave radio transmissions are situated, up to 
infrared
light in the Terahertz range.

There are some drawbacks in using higher frequencies. The technology to 
build
radio transmitters and receivers at higher frequencies is more complex.

At higher frequencies, the wavelength of the radio signal approaches the
physical length of the connections in the radio itself. Since a wire 
lambda/4 or
multiples of this length is a good antenna, the actual connections within 
the
radio itself must be kept short and become part of the circuit design 
because of
problems with signal leakage. The individual radio components must also be
capable of very fast switching rates. The path loss between transmitter and
receiver is also a function of the wavelength:

	Path Loss in dB = 20 log10(l/4pR)

				where R = range in meters
				and l = wavelength in meters

Another property of electromagnetic radiation is that it can be polarized. 
The
concept of polarization is most familiar to us in the use of polarized 
sunglasses
to eliminate reflections off shiny surfaces such as water. Polarized 
sunglasses
will only allow light of one polarization to pass through them and will cut 
out
light reflected from the surface. This is because electromagnetic radiation
undergoes a 90░ change in polarization each time it is reflected. Radio 
waves
can be polarized in the same way and selection of polarization of a 
transmitted
signal may be achieved by the position of the transmitting elements in a
horizontal or vertical attitude. This property can be used to reject 
unwanted or
spurious signals which may arrive at the receiving antenna with a different
polarization to that of the wanted signal.

--- Wireless LAN Frequencies

The two most widely used methods for wireless LAN usage are Infrared (IR) 
and
Radio Frequency (RF) channels.

Because most IR receivers detect the power (amplitude) of optical signals 
(not
their frequency or phase), the systems that use them are simple in design, 
have
no frequency conversions or precision components, and are readily available. 
It
is possible to use phase or frequency modulation and there are some existing
products, but they are not in common use. The cost efficiency of an infrared
design can be enhanced if it can share components or subsystems with such
mass-produced devices as television remote controls. Because infrared 
systems
are not regulated (other than with limits on the permissible optical power
densities), there are no regulatory constraints on a design. In comparison 
to
radio systems, this freedom from regulatory constraints can help to keep 
costs
down.

The worldwide demand for applications of RF technology has created extreme
competition for frequency spectrum, causing regulatory agencies to place 
tight
specifications on the use of an allocated band. The signal transmitted must 
be
kept within the permitted frequency band to tight tolerances adding 
significantly
to the cost of the transmitter. For some applications, the receiver must be 
able
to select bands in order to be able to operate with transmitters at 
different
frequencies, also adding to the cost. Selectivity is a measure of the 
ability of a
radio to detect and receive a signal while rejecting signals at adjacent
frequencies. Higher selectivity becomes more important in busy frequency
bands with many transmitters. For a receiver to exhibit high selectivity, 
the
individual components in the tuning section of the radio must be 
manufactured to
very close tolerances.

Complex filters are often used to eliminate unwanted signals. Active filters 
are a
common type of complex filter where the characteristics of active 
components,
such as transistors or integrated circuits, are precisely controlled by 
electrical
signals. These filters can be accurately tuned to accept a predetermined
frequency signal and reject other unwanted signals. Filters using resistors,
capacitors, and inductors without active components are known as passive
filters. Drift is the tendency of transmitter or receiver frequency to 
change with
time. This can be caused by temperature tolerance of radio components or
slight voltage changes in the power supply source.

Digital tuning circuits and phase-locked loops can be used to lock on 
accurately
to a signal in order to eliminate this effect. Higher tolerances and 
complexities
of a receiver also add to cost. Sensitivity determines how well a receiver 
can
detect a weak signal. In order to reduce interference with transmitters at
adjacent frequencies and in adjacent areas the transmitter power is kept as 
low
as possible. This places a burden on the receiver for being able to detect
low-power signals from a noisy frequency band. Noise can come from a variety
of sources. Man-made noise can be spurious signals radiating from electrical
equipment such as electric motors. This is especially critical in industrial
environments. Background noise can come from many natural sources such as
lightning, sun-spot activity or other extra-terrestrial sources. This can 
become
more significant in less populated areas. To prevent the low signal-to-noise 
ratio
from being further degraded by noise at the receiver, the signal level is
increased by a high-gain amplifier. Gain is a measure of amplification, and 
is
expressed in the following form:

	Gain = 10 Log (Power out / Power in)
				and is measured in decibels (dB).

The need for selectivity and high gain leads to complex receiver structures
involving amplification at higher carrier frequencies, frequency conversion
involving precision local oscillators, and precision selective components. 
The
need to coexist in the crowded RF spectrum places a cost burden on radio
systems that does not exist for infrared systems. In the US, radio systems
operating in the license-free ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and 
Medical:
902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz) bear an additional cost
burden because of the need to implement spectrum-spreading techniques to
prevent interference to or from other appliances and systems. These bands
have been set aside for unlicensed operation provided that the transmitter 
and
receiver comply with a set of regulations specified by the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission). Typical applications now operating within these
bands are cordless telephones, door openers, security motion detectors, 
remote
controls and meter reading devices. Parts of these bands were auctioned off 
to
commercial carriers in December 1994.

Low-cost radio systems can still be achieved, however, with volume 
production
of components and systems. An example of this is the widespread use of
cordless telephones. Wireless LAN implementations have benefited from the
component volumes of cellular telephone production; when digital cordless
telephones, wireless PBX, and PCS/PCN telephone systems stimulate
high-volume component production, wireless LAN systems will benefit further.
Advances in the fabrication of components promise higher levels of 
integration,
more accurate passive filters rather than expensive active filters, and 
smaller,
less expensive systems.

--- Analog Cellular Telephony

The development of mobile telephony systems has led to the cellular
telephone systems in existence today.

In this narrow-band FDMA-based system, voice is transmitted using
Frequency Modulation (FM); channel spacing is either 30 kHz for the Advanced
Mobile Telephone System (AMPS) in the USA, 25 kHz in Europe, or 6.25 kHz in
Japan.

In the USA and Canada AMPS is the most widely available cellular system and
is provided by two carriers in each service area to ensure competition. More
than 25 carriers serve more than 734 service areas using base stations with
100 W power in the 800 MHz frequency band. See A.4, Portable units transmit
with 0.6 W, transportable units with 1.6 W and car units with 4 W.

The 50 MHz available band width is split into 25 MHz for base stations and 
25
MHz for mobile stations. Each of these 25 MHz ranges is divided between the
two carriers for that service area.

In Europe, mobile telephony services based on analog transmission standards
operate in the 450 MHz and 900 MHz frequency bands. The primary analog
standards are TACS (Total Access Control System) and NMT (Nordic Mobile
Telephone). France, Germany, and Italy also each use different national
standards:

   ╖ Nordic Mobile Telephone 450 MHz (NMT-450) is used in Austria, Belgium,
     Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
     Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.

   ╖ Nordic Mobile Telephone 900 MHz (NMT-900) is used in Denmark, Finland,
     the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

   ╖ Extended Total Access Communication System 900 MHz (E-TACS) is used in
     Austria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK.

   ╖ Netz-C 450 MHz is used in Germany, Portugal, and South Africa.

   ╖ Radiocomm 2000, 450 and 900 MHz and Ligne SFR/NMT-450 is used in
     France.

   ╖ NTT System 900 MHz and Japanese TACS 900 MHz are used in Japan.

It is possible to transmit digital signals using Public Switched Telephone 
Network
(PSTN) modems and cellular phones. For example, V.32 modems operating at
4800 bps have been used successfully. However, the radio link introduces
conditions which PSTN modems find difficulty in handling. During signal fade
conditions, the modems try to adapt to noisy conditions by changing speed 
and
may even lose their connection by the time the signal returns. Channel
switching by the cellular phone to a less noisy channel may also be 
sufficient for
the modem to drop the connection. Differences in bandwidth between different
analog channels can also lead to problems. Since there are no industry
standards for operation of PSTN modems connected to a cellular telephone
through an interface adapter, proprietary error-control protocols have been
developed by some manufacturers (for example, Microcom Network Protocol 10
or MNP 10). A special adapter is required to connect a PSTN modem to a
cellular phone. Some manufacturers tap into the handset-transceiver 
connection
(for example, CelJack from Telular) and others provide connections for their 
own
cellular phones (Motorola). In the US, Spectrum Cellular offers a range of
equipment for connection to the cellular phone network including fax 
machines
and special modems.

It can sometimes be difficult to get type-approval for these kind of 
solutions in
some countries, as the requirements of a data connection can be different to
those for a voice-only system. There are no standards for data-over-cellular 
and
the national approval authorities may not even allow these solutions in some
countries.

--- Digital Cellular Telephony

Digital cellular telephony is based on the same network concept as analog
cellular telephony with base stations and mobile stations. The move to 
digital,
led to the development of different systems in Europe, Japan, and the US.

It had been recognized for some time that the analog cellular telephone
systems did not make efficient use of the available radio spectrum.

In any voice conversation on an analog network, the whole channel has to be
dedicated to the end-to-end connection.

Most conversations consist of a small amount of time when information is
actually being transmitted, and the rest of the available time is silence - 
between
words, waiting for the other party to respond, pauses for breath, and 
thinking
time. A digital system can use this *dead time* to allow other conversations 
to
use the same radio channel. This is called Time Division Multiple Access
(TDMA).

Using digital technology it is also possible to compress speech by making 
some
assumptions about speech waveforms. In addition to using the *dead time* for
other voice calls, compressing speech allows even more users to share the
same channel. GSM in Europe can have up to eight two-way calls in the same
pair of radio channels. Future developments will be able to double this 
within
the next few years. With the analog cellular network capacity quickly 
becoming
saturated, it is not surprising that a great deal of development effort has 
gone
into digital cellular.

One other major advantage of digital cellular is the quality of the voice 
call.
Because the digital data stream can have error correction built in, 
interference
and other short breaks in transmission do not result in any loss of quality. 
If the
error correction mechanism cannot recover the lost data, then a short period 
of
silence will ensue. Listening to a digital cellular conversation compared to
listening to an analog phone can be likened to the difference between a 
compact
disk recording and a vinyl record. In fact, many of the same techniques are
used in digital cellular as are used in the production of CDs.

The last significant advantage of digital cellular is the inherent security 
against
casual eavesdropping. With analog cellular, a standard FM radio receiver
capable of covering the cellular channels can be tuned to receive an analog
cellular phone conversation. No special equipment is needed and a radio
*scanner* can be readily purchased at an affordable price. The scanner may
only be able to receive the channel being transmitted by the cellular base
station, but both halves of the conversation can usually be heard due to the 
fact
that they both share the same pair of wires in the land-based telephone 
network.
If the cellular phone user is moving, then the conversation may only be 
heard for
a short time until the phone moves into the next cell.

With more sophisticated computer controlled scanning equipment installed in 
a
vehicle, it is possible to follow a moving cellular phone and switch to new
channels in each cell automatically. A digital cellular phone conversation 
is
much harder to decode. Special equipment is needed to select the required
time slot for the particular voice conversation to be followed. Most digital
systems encrypt the data representing the speech information, and may enable
frequency hopping, thus making it even more difficult to eavesdrop. This 
does
not make it impossible to eavesdrop, but it does increase the cost of the
listening equipment to a point where it is unlikely that it would be worth 
doing. It
must be remembered that the cost of breaking into a secure system must be
less than the value of the information obtained if it is to be attempted.

A digital cellular system will ultimately have far greater potential for
miniaturization and cost reduction of both the base station equipment and 
the
mobile equipment. This will be helped by the move towards international
standards using common systems, architectures and components, thus
spreading development costs over a much larger customer base. Already the
GSM architecture is becoming the accepted standard and the service is 
reaping
these benefits.

The introduction of GSM provided a unique opportunity to define and develop 
a
range of significant value added services such as data transmission, fax, 
and
messaging.

--- Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)

The GSM standard was proposed by CEPT in 1982 and completed by ETSI in 1990; 
the
first networks were deployed in 1991. It is similar to the terrestrial ISDN 
network
with its definitions of voice and data channels, and is designed to be 
compatible
with it. However, the data rates are much lower due to the limitations of 
radio
bandwidth.

The main driving force behind the introduction of GSM in Europe was to 
provide
a common standard for European Cellular Communications which allowed
subscribers to roam throughout Europe and access cellular networks in each
country with the same equipment. It also allows the equipment manufacturers 
to
sell identical mobile and fixed equipment in all countries. A digital system 
was
chosen for all the reasons described above.

GSM operates in the 900 MHz band, the same as existing European analog
cellular systems and more channels will be allocated to GSM from analog as 
the
networks grow.

The system uses Time Division Multiple Access to enable multiple voice calls 
to
use a single radio channel. For GSM there are eight time slots on each radio
channel called burst periods (BPs) which together make up a TDMA frame of
duration 4.615 ms. Each burst period has a duration of 0.577 ms.

The radio channel has a bandwidth of 200 kHz compared to 25 kHz of the 
analog
systems. The voice or data information is transmitted in a string of burst 
periods
in consecutive frames, thus creating a logical channel.

In order to provide some immunity to interference, the digital data is 
interleaved.
This means that a single piece of information is spread over time and mixed 
with
other discrete pieces of information. If an interfering signal causes a data 
error,
the error will be spread over a number of separate pieces of information, 
but will
be less significant and the error correction mechanism will be able to 
recover
the lost data.

GSM provides full-duplex operation (to be able to transmit information in 
both
directions at the same time), and makes use of separate transmit and receive
radio channels. The radio channel transmitting information from the mobile
station is called the uplink, and is separated by 45 MHz from the downlink 
radio
channel which sends information from the base station to the mobile. The
mobile station is instructed by the base station to operate on a particular 
radio
frequency and this will always consist of a transmit and receive pair 
separated
by 45 MHz. The GSM specification allows for the use of slow frequency 
hopping,
which occurs at 217 hops per second. This allows a complete TDMA frame to be
sent at one frequency before a hop takes place.

In order to transmit analog speech over a digital network, the analog signal 
first
has to be converted to digital information. The encoder takes a sample of 
the
analog speech signal every 20 ms and encodes it to 260 bits of digital data. 
This
gives a data rate of 13 Kbps. The data is then passed through a 
convolutional
encoder which adds a special code based on the information content to the
original bit stream. This provides an error correction capability built into 
the
original information. This data is delivered to the transmitter in the form 
of
blocks of data consisting of 456 bits every 20 ms. This results in a 22.8 
Kbps
data stream.

As each radio channel is capable of carrying data at a rate of 270 Kbps, 
eight
logical channels can be used in one radio frequency channel with 87.6 Kbps
spare for control signalling and error correction. The data is transmitted 
by
modulating the radio frequency carrier using Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying.

If there is no voice signal (silence), then no data will be transmitted.

Although the network structure of GSM seems very similar to analog cellular
networks like AMPS and TACS at first glance, the underlying structure is 
much
more complex. One of the main reasons for this is that the architecture is
structured to enable international roaming and the customer billing 
processes
that ensure a mobile phone can be used in different GSM networks.

The following is a list of the main GSM network components:
   ╖ Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
	- The BTS transmits and receives to and from all GSM phones in its cell.

   ╖ Base Station Controller (BSC)
	- The BSC controls several base stations and ensures that a mobile phone
	  can move from one cell to another and switch to the new radio channel
	  without a break in communication.

   ╖ Mobile Switching Center (MSC)
	- The MSC is the way that the GSM network is connected to other
	  networks such as PSTN, ISDN or other mobile networks. It also controls
	  call setup and disconnect, call routing, and switching to other MSCs. It
	  generates data for customer billing systems.

   ╖ Home Location Register (HLR)
	- The HLR contains information about the subscriber including level of
	  service allowed and location information.

   ╖ Visitor Location Register (VLR)
	- The VLR obtains subscriber information from the subscribers HLR when
	  the GSM phone is being used on a different network.

   ╖ Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
	- The EIR is a database which contains information about the validity of
	  GSM telephones being used on the network. Each phone has an
	  International Mobile Equipment Identity number (IMEI) which is
	  independent of the subscriber number.

   ╖ Authentication Center (AUC)
	- The AUC provides a security function to ensure that a call is being made
	  by an authorized phone.

   ╖ Operations Management Center (OMC)
	- The OMC manages the network on a regional and day-to-day basis.

   ╖ Network Management Centre (NMC)
	- The NMC manages the entire network on a global basis and is used for
	  long-term planning.

The subscriber service on a GSM network is separate from the GSM phone
itself. This means that the subscribers identity (or phone number) can be
transferred from one physical phone to another, without reprogramming the
phone. This is accomplished by means of a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), 
in
the form of a credit card-sized smart card device as shown below. The SIM 
has
a small microprocessor with read only and read/write memory. It is used as 
the
subscribers *identity* and has security functions, together with the ability 
to
store the subscribers personal information (phone book) and short messages
(SMS). The SIM can be inserted into a GSM phone, which then takes on the
identity of the subscribers GSM phone. Some hand-held phones have only a
very small aperture for the SIM, and for this reason the SIM card has a
thumb-nail sized break-out section containing the electronics.

The SIM allows subscribers to use a different phone (for example, in a 
rental
car) and still retain their normal GSM phone number and be billed as usual 
for
calls.

When a SIM is inserted in a GSM phone and the phone power is switched on,
the GSM phone will listen on a number of predefined common control channels.
These control channels contain information about the network and the current
location. The mobile station can then inform the network of its location and 
its
home location register (HLR) is updated with this information.

When the subscriber wishes to make a call, the number is keyed in and the 
SND
button pressed. The network will check that the phone is authorized to make 
the
call and the MSC will route the call to the appropriate number usually via 
PSTN.

The MSC will also generate billing data and send it to the network billing 
system.

To make a call to a GSM phone from a fixed PSTN phone, the process is more
complex. The PSTN network will route the call to the MSC closest to the 
calling
PSTN phone. This MSC will look at the Home Location Register for the mobile
phone and determine its location. If the mobile phone is in the same region 
as
the MSC, it will send out a paging message on a control channel. Assuming 
that
the mobile is switched on and in range, the mobile will respond and the MSC
will authenticate its response. If it is a valid subscriber and device, the 
MSC will
route the call to the mobile and the phone will ring. If the phone is in the 
region
covered by another MSC, but still in the same network, the first MSC will 
route
the call via the MSC local to the mobile phone.

The most complex process is where the mobile user is roaming in another
network area. (This may be another country.) In order to understand how 
calls
are routed to a roaming subscriber, we must first look at the telephone
numbering schemes involved. With a fixed PSTN number, it is divided into 
three
groups:

	╖ Country number - 1 for USA, 44 for UK and so on
	╖ Area or region number - this defines local areas for billing purposes
	╖ Subscriber number - this may define groups as well as individuals

For calls within a local area it is only necessary to dial the subscriber 
number.

For calls outside a local area but still within the same country, it is only
necessary to dial the area code and subscriber number. With a cellular 
phone,
the area number is replaced by a number which defines the network operator. 
A
particular operator may have more than one number depending on the size of
the network. Cellular phone numbers have the same structure as PSTN
numbers. The PSTN numbering scheme is called the ISDN (Integrated Switched
Digital Network) number and the GSM cellular phone number is called the
Mobile Station International ISDN number (MSISDN). The GSM phone is
identified over the air interface by a different numbering scheme. This is 
the
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or Temporary IMSI (TIMSI). 
This
allows the phone to be identified regardless of its home.

When a call is made to a phone roaming outside its home location, the call 
is
routed to a gateway MSC (GMSC) in its home network. The GMSC interrogates
the Home Location Register (HLR), which contains information about where the
mobile phone is currently located. This information is obtained from the 
Visitor
Location Register (VLR) of the network where the phone is located and 
includes
a Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) that is assigned to the mobile phone.

Using this information, the GMSC routes the call to the new network MSC 
(which
may be via an international link). The host MSC pages the mobile phone and
the call is connected after validation.

A call directed to a phone roaming outside its home network will always be
routed via a gateway MSC in its home network. One problem that arises from
this is that if a call is made from one GSM phone to another, both roaming 
out of
their home networks, then it is possible that they will be charged for a 
double
international call even if they are next to each other in the same room. 
This is
because the phone making the call will be charged for a call back to its 
home
network GMSC and the phone receiving the call will be charged for a call 
from
its home GMSC to its current location. There is no way of avoiding this 
situation
without causing an unacceptable increase in billing complexity for average 
calls.

One of the main reasons for implementing GSM is the new services that can be
offered. One of the first of these is the Short Message Service (SMS). This
allows the GSM phone to send and receive short messages, using the networks
control channel to transfer the information. This means that no 
circuit-switched
connection is established and the message can be stored and forwarded when
the phone is able to accept the message. The GSM Short Message Service
allows the phone to act like a two-way alphanumeric pager. Up to 160
characters can be transmitted in one message. One implementation of the
service provides access via a normal paging bureau, or direct from a 
customers
host system. The mobile phone subscriber can respond by entering a message
using the phones keypad to emulate an alphanumeric keyboard. This can be
quite laborious for longer messages, but useful for short acknowledgements.

One way to simplify this operation is to store a number of predefined 
messages
in the phones memory and modify them as necessary before sending them. An
alternative method is to connect the phone to a notebook computer or PDA and
use that devices keyboard. SMS messages can be sent from host to mobile,
mobile to mobile, or mobile to host. In the latter case it will depend on 
the
network operators implementation of the service. If a standard one-way 
paging
bureau service is used for SMS access, then a direct connection back to a
customers host system may not be possible. SMS messages can be stored in
the phones own memory or in the subscribers SIM memory. This is especially
useful if the subscriber is using a different phone from his own, but with 
his SIM
inserted. SMS messages can also be broadcast to a number of subscribers at
the same time. This is known as *cell broadcast*. All mobiles within a 
defined
area that are equipped with this feature will receive the broadcast, and no
special subscription is needed. This can be used for things such as traffic
information, weather warnings and the like. The cell broadcast is limited to 
93
characters. Apart from private messaging services, SMS can be used by
network operators to communicate with subscribers and even download new
phone configurations to enable other services. Other applications will be
developed as networks grow.

In order to send circuit-switched data over a GSM network, it is important 
to
understand that the air link is digital and that the encoding and 
compression
algorithms are designed to expect speech information. It is therefore 
impossible
to use ordinary PSTN compatible modems to send data over a GSM network.

The GSM specification includes data services for fax, circuit-switched, and
packet-switched data. The first implementation of GSM does not include
packet-switched data. In order to send circuit-switched data, the network
operator must provide a mechanism that allows digital information sent from 
a
host computer to be encoded directly in the GSM air protocol. In addition, 
if the
data is to be transmitted over the PSTN, the network operator must provide
modems to match the end-user requirements. In the mobile phone itself, the
data connection bypasses the analog/digital conversion and also bypasses the
voice compression circuits. There is no need for a modem at the mobile end;
the connections are all digital. At the fixed station (MSC), voice and data 
calls
are separated.

The data path bypasses the compression function and is sent directly to 
banks of
modems which convert to a modem protocol to match the users requirements.
As the GSM air link runs at 9.6 Kbps, the highest speed modem required is 
only
V.32. Separate digital interfaces connect to ISDN or PSPDN (X.25). Not all 
GSM
networks will offer these data services to start with, but all GSM equipment 
is
designed to support them. GSM circuit switched data can operate in two 
modes,
Transparent (T) and Non-Transparent (NT). Transparent mode uses a forward
error correction scheme to ensure error-free transmissions, while
Non-Transparent mode relies on the retransmission of data with errors using 
an
Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ).

Group 3 fax services are handled in a similar way with the network operator
providing fax modems to convert from the digital data stream to analog 
signals
that can be sent over PSTN.

All the above considerations apply equally well to DCS1800 and DCS1900, the
Personal Communications Network Technology (PCN). The key differences with
PCN are in the implementation of the network. PCN networks are designed to
work with hand-held phones. Vehicle installations with higher power
transmitters are not allowed. The network structure is designed around
microcells, to provide good coverage in metropolitan areas, both outside and
within buildings. Coverage of rural areas will be limited.

- Packet Network Methodologies

With the exception of CDPD, the cellular networks discussed so far have been
designed primarily for use with speech information. Radio packet data 
networks
are designed for data only.


-- Mobitex

The description which follows applies to the newer UHF Mobitex systems in
North America and Europe. The original VHF systems which operated in
Scandinavia are being replaced by UHF systems with much higher data rates.
Mobitex in the US transmits from the base station on channels in the range 
of
frequencies 935-940 MHz, and receives in the range of 896-901 MHz. The
transmit and receive frequencies for any channel are always 39 MHz apart.

Mobitex in Europe has different frequency allocations for each country but 
they
are all in the range of 410-459 MHz. Apart from this difference in radio 
carrier
frequency, the European and North American systems are the same.

The radio channels are 12.5 KHz wide and each Base Radio Station (BRS) can
have up to sixteen different channel frequencies. The physical BRS can be 
used
as a number of logical base stations using directional antennae. The radio
channel is modulated using a modified type of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying
(GMSK). The Mobitex network is cellular in structure, but because the system
uses packets of data instead of continuous connection, there is no 
requirement
for dynamic handoff as in a cellular telephone network.

The data rate of the Mobitex network is 9.6 Kbps, which gives a maximum
end-to-end throughput of 8.0 Kbps. One of the key factors when dealing with 
a
packet data network is the network delay. The delay can vary according to 
the
load on the network and may be a few seconds. Network operators are careful
to ensure that no single application will load the network in such a way 
that
other users are affected. Legacy host applications may need to be modified 
to
work properly with packet networks, which may be a key factor in choosing a
suitable network.

Access to the Mobitex network from external host systems is provided by a
number of different gateways. The availability and definition of these 
gateways
will vary from network to network, but will normally include:

	╖ X.25
		- MTP/1 transport layer is optional

	╖ TCP/IP
		- Host connection - X.25 or SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)

	╖ SNA/3270
		- MTP/1 transport layer is required.

Mobile units on the network can take the form of vehicle-based installations 
with
application dependent displays and data entry functions. A simple two-line
display with a number of predefined data entry keys may be used for a taxi
application, while a notebook computer may be attached to a Mobitex
radio/modem for a full-screen data application. A recent development from 
IBM
consists of a PCMCIA card which contains a complete Mobitex radio/modem.
This will allow a notebook computer to communicate over the Mobitex network
without attaching to any external device.

Applications using the Mobitex network can also be fixed-station telemetry
where the difficulty or cost of installing a fixed wire connection would not 
be
economical. A packet radio data network is ideal for sending small amounts 
of
data at irregular intervals.

-- MDC4800 and RD-LAP

The second major radio packet data network type is a Motorola technology
known as ARDIS in the US. The same technology is used in other countries,
notably Germany where it is known as Modacom, and Southeast Asia and the
Pacific Rim where it is known as Datatac. The following description will use
ARDIS as an example of a network implemented using this technology.

The ARDIS network uses two different protocols. The original protocol is 
called
MDC4800 (Mobile Data Communication 4800), and as its name suggests operates
at 4.8 Kbps. The newer services use a protocol called RD-LAP (Radio 
Data-Link
Access Procedure), which provides a data rate over the air link at 19.2 
Kbps.

Whatever air link protocol is used, the underlying network is the same.

In North America, ARDIS uses radio frequency channels in the 806-824 MHz 
band
for base station receiving, and 851-869 MHz for base station transmitting.

ARDIS provides a number of protocols to access the network including:

	╖ SNA LU 6.2
	╖ X.25
	╖ SNA 3270 terminal emulation and bisynchronous 3270
	╖ Bisynchronous point-to-point
	╖ Asynchronous

These protocols are used over a leased line connection with dial backup at
either 9.6 Kbps or 19.2 Kbps.

The topology of the network is similar to that of Mobitex networks. A number 
of
base stations are connected to a switching center known as an RF/NCP. These
in turn are connected to a message switching center.

The connections to customer host systems of Value Added Networks (VANS) are
made at the RF/NCP level, while the message switches control routing between
regions.

- Radio Technology

Electromagnetic spectrum is a limited natural resource, the use of which is
governed by physical laws as well as national legislation. It has been 
estimated
that as much as 75% of usable radio spectrum is reserved for use by various
national governments and military applications. The amount of bandwidth
available for commercial, private and public use is severely constrained and 
use
of particular frequency bands is limited to individual countries or groups 
of
countries. Although there are moves to define internationally recognized
frequency allocations (notably the World Administrative Radio Conference
(WARC)), it will take many years for different countries to free up radio 
spectrum
for international commercial use. This situation not only makes it more 
difficult
and costly to provide radio devices for use in all countries, it provides a 
major
incentive to develop techniques to make the very best use of any available
spectrum. There are two complementary strategies for achieving this:

   ╖ Modulation techniques - maximizing the throughput for a given bandwidth
   ╖ Multiplexing techniques - enabling many users to share the same 
bandwidth

Many current techniques used were originally developed for the land-based
telecommunications market and thus have a firm foundation in the telephony
arena. Some of the technologies in use include:

   ╖ Modulation techniques
   ╖ Access methods
   ╖ Detection methods
   ╖ Synchronization methods
   ╖ Equalization techniques

Both analog and digital modulation techniques are described in this chapter.

Although analog techniques are well suited to voice communications, data
communications are more suited to digital technology. Analog systems can be
used successfully, but can experience more problems. These advantages
include improved performance, lower costs, better security, error detection 
and
error correction.

-- Transmitting Information by Modulating a Carrier

Voice signals can be transmitted over copper wires directly at their 
original
frequency, as was the case for the first telephone systems. This is known as
baseband transmission. In order to send several channels across the same 
wire
simultaneously without interference, the voice signals can be superimposed 
or
modulated onto higher frequency signals. These higher frequency signals can
then be combined with other signals and transmitted across long distances. 
In
many situations information cannot be sent directly but must be carried as
variations in another signal, as is the case with radio broadcasting. Radio
communication is perhaps the most common example of using a modulated
carrier to convey information but the use of modems to carry digital 
information
through the analog telephone network is also very common. This is often 
called
*wideband*, *broadband*, or *passband* modulation (these terms mean roughly
the same thing).

A carrier signal is almost always a sinusoidal wave of a particular 
frequency.
Information is carried by introducing variations in this carrier signal.

There are many variations on how a modulated signal is created and how it is
received.

Notes:
   1. A baseband binary data stream is created representing the bits to be 
sent.

   2. A sinusoidal carrier signal is generated (for RF this is usually a 
crystal
      controlled oscillator).

   3. The digital signal is then used to modulate the carrier signal and the
      resultant signal is sent to the antenna.

   4. In the receiver, the signal is first filtered (to separate it from all 
other radio
      signals around) and then the carrier is removed.

   5. The result is a baseband signal containing distortion and noise which 
then
      has to be processed by a detector in order to recover the original bit 
stream.

---- Amplitude Modulation (AM)

This is the simplest form of modulation and was the first to be put into 
practice.

The strength of the signal (loudness or amplitude) is systematically changed
according to the information to be transmitted, that is the amplitude of the
carrier signal varies with the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted. 
The
bandwidth required by the sidebands using AM is large so that effective use 
of
the frequency spectrum is not made. AM is used by radio broadcast stations 
in
the Long Wave, Medium Wave, and Short Wave radio bands.

---- Frequency Modulation (FM)

In Frequency Modulation, the frequency of the carrier is varied by the 
signal to
be transmitted. The maximum frequency deviation from the carrier frequency 
is
proportional to the modulating signal. An advantage of FM is that the width 
of
the sidebands is limited and more efficient use is made of the frequency 
band.

FM is used extensively by radio broadcast stations in the VHF band.

----- Phase Modulation (PM)

In Phase Modulation, systematic changes in the phase of the carrier are 
used.

The frequency of the carrier remains constant while the phase is shifted in
proportion to the modulating signal. PM requires more sophisticated 
receivers
than FM or AM and is sensitive to multi-path errors.

---- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise along their transmission 
path.

With each link and amplifier along the path, the signal-to-noise ratio 
deteriorates
and there is no easy method of signal regeneration since the shape of the 
signal
cannot be predicted. On the other hand, digital signals can easily be
regenerated by pulse-shaping circuits in the receiver so that distortion and 
noise
is much reduced. PCM is a method of sampling a signal at a higher frequency
to produce a digital signal which can then be multiplexed with many other 
digital
signals and transmitted error-free to the receiver. It is widely used in 
telephone
equipment to ensure quality of service on multi-channel links.

--- Sidebands

When a sinusoidal carrier signal is generated it varies by only a very small
amount. That is, the range of frequencies over which the carrier is spread 
is
very narrow. When such a signal is modulated, it seems reasonable that the
frequency spread (at least for AM and PM techniques) should remain
unchanged. Sadly, it doesnt work quite this way. You get a spread of
frequencies equal to twice the maximum frequency of the modulating signal.

What you get is a carrier signal ( carrying no information) surrounded by 
two
*sidebands* (above and below). Each sideband uses a frequency spread of
exactly the maximum modulating frequency. All of the modulation information 
is
carried in the sidebands - the carrier contains no information (it is 
nevertheless
quite useful to have in some systems).

Some transmission systems suppress transmission of the carrier (it is 
pointless
to waste power sending something that contains no information) and others
suppress both the carrier and one sideband (Single Sideband - SSB
Transmission).

It is important to note that sidebands are generated for all three 
modulation
schemes. They are different in the sense that the precise form of the 
sidebands
is different for each different modulating technique.

--- Bandwidth

The above leads us to the concept of bandwidth. A signal doesnt use just one
frequency. It uses a band of frequencies equal in width (from lowest to 
highest)
to twice the maximum frequency of the modulating signal. (If SSB 
transmission
is used the bandwidth occupied is just the maximum frequency of the 
modulating
signal.)

-- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

CSMA is a contention-based access method. The CSMA access method is to
wireless LANs what Ethernet is to wired LANs. CSMA is also used on PMR
networks where a station listens to the control channel to ensure that it is 
free
before transmitting. With CSMA all stations access the network randomly
without coordination or synchronization. Each station wishing to transmit 
first
listens to see if there is anyone else transmitting on the frequency it 
intends to
transmit on. If the frequency is free, then that station transmits. One 
difference
between CSMA in the wireless environment and Ethernet in the wired
environment is that the wireless CSMA station cannot detect any other 
station
starting to transmit at the same time. The reason is that each station
transmitting cannot *listen* at the same time as transmitting. Its own 
signal
effectively drowns out all other signals on that frequency at that time. As 
for
Ethernet, CSMA works fine at lower utilization rates. When the utilization 
of the
radio link capacity increases, the number of collisions also increases and 
the
effective data throughput can fall dramatically. This can lead to 
ineffective use of
the bandwidth. A CSMA system is also vulnerable to interference.

Implementation can be based on relatively inexpensive Ethernet chip-sets 
which
are based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detect (CSMA/CD). The
CD part of the system is simply replaced by Collision Avoidance (CA) to give 
a
CSMA/CA system. The reliability and robustness of this method are limited 
and
does not lend itself to integrating voice and data since there are only 
limited
prioritizing possibilities. There are limited power-saving possibilities for
battery-operated stations since the receiver is always listening. The CSMA
method lends itself to a peer-to-peer network topology.

-- Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)

TDMA is a deterministic-based access method. The TDMA access method is to
wireless what token-ring is to wired LANs. It is effectively a system of 
polling.

One station asks each of the other stations in turn whether they have any
information to transmit. Each station is allocated a timeslot when it can 
respond.

If a station indicates that it has data to transmit, then it is allocated a 
time
interval in which to send its data. The number of time intervals allocated
depends on the amount of data being sent.

One advantage of the TDMA method is that priorities can be allocated to 
chosen
stations or certain types of data. This could be used to allow voice and 
data to
be carried on the same wireless LAN with higher priority being allocated to 
the
voice traffic. The ability to mix isochronous and asynchronous traffic is 
required
for multimedia applications. The effective data rate can be determined 
fairly
accurately since there are no collisions between stations in the same LAN. 
Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) divides each communication channel into time
segments so that a transceiver or radio can support multiple channels or 
time
slots for reduced power consumption.

The TDMA access method lends itself to a base-to-remote network topology
since communication between stations is synchronized and time slots are
allocated to remote stations by a scheduling function in the wireless base
station. This also leads to more efficient use of the bandwidth. There are 
also
power-saving possibilities for battery-operated stations using TDMA. The
receiver needs only to listen at assigned time intervals.

The TDMA base stations are more complex than CSMA since the
synchronization is carried out by the base station. They may be more 
expensive
since a microprocessor will be required. On the other hand, the remote 
stations
will be less complex. TDMA is relatively new to wireless LANs. Many of the
existing wireless LANs are based on CSMA methods, but these methods are
also used in many other wireless environments. Most high-speed satellite
communications, GSM and the standards being worked on in Europe as well as
the CDPD networks are based on the TDMA method.

- Radio LAN Systems Considerations

There are special considerations to be taken into account when implementing 
a
radio LAN. The main problems are set out below, together with some 
solutions:

-- Collocated but Unrelated Radio LANs

One important requirement for a radio LAN system is the need to allow 
multiple
unrelated LANs (of the same type) to be located in the same area. This 
requires
a system for channel sharing and LAN administration that allows each
independent LAN to be set up and operated without the need to consider other
(similar) LANs in the same space. As radio LANs operate in the ISM bands,
there is no license required and other organizations may install a radio LAN
whose coverage are overlaps with one already installed. The new LAN may or
may not be compatible with the existing LAN. For this reason, radio LAN
systems must be capable of avoiding interfering with or being interfered 
with by
another LAN. The use of spread spectrum technology ensures that radio LANs
may coexist.

-- Countering Multi-Path Effects

As mentioned above, multi-path effects are the most serious problem for the
indoor radio environment. The following are some of the general approaches
used to counter them:

   Antenna Diversity
	Antenna diversity can mitigate both ISI and Rayleigh fading effects.
	There are many different ways of approaching this:

   1.   Multiple Directional Antennas
	An example of this is the Motorola *Altair* radio LAN system which
	uses a six-segment antenna. Antenna segments are arranged in a
	circle at an angle of 60 degrees from each other. Each antenna
	segment is highly directional; thus, signals coming from different
	directions (reflections, etc.) are received on different antenna
	segments. As signals are received the system selects the antenna
	segment receiving the strongest signal and uses that signal alone.

	This severely limits the number of possible paths. Moreover,
	surviving paths will have lengths that are not too different from one
	another. This provides an excellent solution to the ISI problem but
	does not do a lot for fading. Notice, however, that with a narrowband
	microwave system (1.6 cm wavelength) Rayleigh fading is not as
	significant as it is at longer wavelengths.

   2.   Multiple Antennas
	Other systems use multiple dipole antennas separated from one
	another by more than half a wavelength. Signals are added together
	before detection and this does provide a measure of protection
	against fading (but not against ISI).

   3. 	Multiple Coordinated Receivers
	Two antennas are situated exactly 1/4 of a wavelength apart. Each
	antenna services a different receiver circuit. The signals are then
	combined in such a way as to minimize multi-path effects.

   4. 	Polarization Diversity
	Because the signal polarization changes as reflections occur, a good
	counter to fading is to provide both horizontal and vertically polarized
	antennas acting together. The signal is transmitted and received in
	both polarizations.

   Data Rate
	The ISI problem is most severe when the delay spread covers more than
	one data bit time. The easy way to avoid this is to limit the data rate
	to less than the inverse of the delay spread. However, if the objective
	is to operate at LAN speeds (above 1 Mbps) then this will not always be
	practical.

   Spread Spectrum Techniques
	As discussed above, spread spectrum techniques provide a good
	measure of protection against ISI and fading. Spread spectrum is
	mandatory in the ISM bands. Thus in the indoor radio situation spread
	spectrum is a preferred method of controlling the multi-path effects.

   Frequency Diversity
	Fading in a narrowband system can be combatted by transmitting the
	signal on two different frequencies with sufficient separation for the
	channels to have different fading characteristics. When the signals are
	received, the station just picks the strongest.

	You could call this *half-baked spread spectrum* since all it is doing is
	spreading the spectrum through an adhoc method.

   Adaptive Equalization
	Adaptive equalization is a very good way of countering the ISI form of
	multi-path interference. It is, however, relatively expensive to implement
	at high speeds.

	There is some disagreement among specialists as to under which
	circumstances (if any) adaptive equalization is needed. However, to the
	knowledge of the author, no current radio LAN system uses adaptive
	equalization.

-- Summary

We have seen in this bit some of the techniques used to make the best use
of the available electromagnetic spectrum. These techniques include 
improving
the throughput by sophisticated methods of modulation, and enabling several
users to share the same part of the spectrum by means of multiplexing. Many 
of
the technologies are analogous to those used in wireline communications, but
are adapted to meet the different requirements of wireless technology.

- Radio Communication in LANs

The task of a radio LAN is the same as that of any LAN: to provide 
peer-to-peer
or terminal-to-host communication in a local area. Ideally, it should appear 
to
the user to be exactly the same as a wired LAN in all respects (including
performance). The radio medium is different in many ways from wired media
and these differences give rise to unique problems and solutions. This 
section
will concentrate on the aspects unique to the radio medium and will only 
briefly
discuss aspects that are held in common with wired media.

-- Radio LAN Technology
--- Characteristics of the Indoor Radio Medium
---- Multi-Path Effects

At the extremely high frequencies involved, radio waves will reflect off 
solid
objects, which means that there are many possible paths for a signal to take
from transmitter to receiver. In this case both transmitter and receiver are
in the same room. Part of the signal will take the obvious direct path but 
there
are many other paths and some of the signal will follow each of these. 
(Reflection
from the floor is especially significant.)

The signal travels from transmitter to receiver on multiple paths and is 
reflected
from room walls and solid objects.

This has a number of consequences:

   1. 	To some extent the signal will travel around solid objects (and can 
penetrate
	others that are *radio transparent*). This is what gives radio its biggest
	advantage over infrared transmission in the indoor environment.

   2. 	A signal arriving on many paths will spread out in time (because some 
paths
	are shorter than others). More accurately, many copies of the signal will
	arrive at the receiver slightly shifted in time.

Studies have shown that in office and factory environments the delay spread
is typically from 30 ns to 250 ns depending on the geometry of the area in
question. (In an outdoor, suburban environment, delay spread is typically
between .5 ms and 3 ms.) Delay spread has two quite different effects which
must be countered.

---- Rayleigh Fading

After traveling different distances, two signal components are added
together in the receiver. If the difference in the length of the paths they
traveled is an odd multiple of half the wavelength of the carrier signal,
then they will cancel one another out (if it is an even multiple they will
strengthen one another). At 2.4 Gbps the wavelength is 125 mm.

In a room there can be dozens or even hundreds of possible paths and
all the signals will be added in quite complex ways.

The result is that in any room there will be places where little or no
signal is detectable and other places, a few meters away, where the
signal could be very strong. If the receiver is mobile, rapid variations in
signal strength are usually observed.

---- Inter-Symbol Interference

When we are digitally modulating a carrier, another important
consideration is the length of the symbol (the transmission state
representing a bit or group of bits). If we are sending one bit per symbol
and the bit rate is 1 Mbps then the *length* of a bit will be slightly less
than 300 meters. In time, at 1 Mbps a bit will be 1 ms long. If the delay
spread is 250 ns then each bit will be spread out to a length of 1.25 ms
and will overlap with the following bit by a quarter of its length.

This is called Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and has the effect of 
limiting
the maximum data rate possible. ISI is present in most communications
channels and there are good techniques for combating it (such as
Adaptive Equalization). It is most severe in the radio environment.

Most people are familiar with this effect since it is the cause of *ghosts*
in television reception - especially with indoor antennae.

   3. 	When people move about the room, the characteristics of the room (as 
far as
	radio propagation is concerned) change.

Overcoming multi-path effects is the most significant challenge in the 
design of
indoor radio systems.

   ╖ Intermittent Operation
	In an office or factory environment people move about the area and
	occasionally move large objects about. This can cause intermittent
	interruption to the signal, rapid fading, and the like.

   ╖ Security
	Because there are no boundaries for a radio signal, it is possible for
	unauthorized people to receive it. This is not as serious a problem as 
would
	first appear since the signal strength decreases with the fourth power of 
the
	distance from the transmitter (for systems where the antenna is close to 
the
	ground - such as indoor systems). This is known as the inverse square law
	in free space. Nevertheless, spectrum is a problem which must be
	addressed by any radio LAN proposal.

   ╖ Bandwidth
	Radio waves at frequencies above a few GHz do not bend much in the
	atmosphere (they travel in straight lines) and are reflected from most 
solid
	objects. Thus, radio signals at this frequency will not normally penetrate 
a
	building. Inside the building this means there is a wide range of 
frequencies
	available which may be used for local applications with very few 
restrictions.

   ╖ Direction
	In general radio waves will radiate from a transmitting antenna in all
	directions. With a smart antenna design it is possible to direct the signal
	into specific directions or even into beams. In the indoor environment,
	however, this doesnt make a lot of difference due to the signal reflections 
at
	the wavelengths commonly used.

   ╖ Polarization
	Radio signals are naturally polarized and in free space will maintain their
	polarization over long distances. However, polarization changes when a
	signal is reflected. Side-effects that flow from this must be taken into
	consideration in the design of an indoor radio system.

   ╖ Interference
	Depending on which frequency band is in use there are many sources of
	possible interference with the signal. Some of these are from other
	transmitters in the same band (such as radar sets and microwave
	installations nearby). The most likely source of interference within the 
2.4
	GHz frequency band is the microwave oven. Potential leakage can be as
	high as 200 mW, which is twice the IBM Wireless LANs transmit power.

	Electric motors, switches, and stray radiation from electronic devices are
	other sources of interference.

-- Sharing the Bandwidth

With many workstations in the same area wanting to communicate a method is
needed to share the bandwidth. Different LAN designs use quite different
methods of operation and of bandwidth sharing. However, most use a
combination of the methods below:

	Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
	Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
	Polarization Division Multiplexing (PDM)
	Space Division Multiplexing (SDM)
	Code Division Multiplexing (CDMA)

-- Security Aspects

One of the main concerns often expressed when installing wireless LANs is 
the
question of data security. These concerns are valid and may be addressed as
follows:

	There are three types of security risks:
		╖ Attack by casual listener
		╖ Attack by professional hacker
		╖ Attack by insiders

--- Attack by Casual Listener

A casual listener might be someone in a neighboring building using the same
type of equipment. Each WLAN system must be capable of identifying those
workstations authorized to participate in that LAN, and deny unauthorized
workstations to access the WLAN. It should not be possible for unauthorized
workstations to overhear and interpret data traffic on a WLAN.

--- Attack by Professional Hacker

A passive attack could come from someone receiving the WLAN radio signal and
using sophisticated tools to try to interpret the data content of the radio 
signal
heard. An active attack could originate within transmission range of the 
WLAN
but outside the facility. Eavesdropping by attempting to insert an 
unauthorized
wireless workstation into an existing WLAN is one example.

--- Attack by Insiders

Insider attacks are attempts by employees, who are authorized for limited 
data
access, to try to access data to which they are not authorized. One form of 
this
is attempting to log on to a server or a WLAN in a different department.

One method successfully used to combat both casual listener and professional
hacker attacks is data encryption. Data is passed to software or hardware
encryption systems before transmission. Encrypting data online using 
software
algorithms during transmission can significantly reduce the effective data
capacity of a link since processing resources are spent on behalf of the
encryption program. Using a hardware chip to encrypt data on the WLAN
adapter is more efficient since the workstation processor is not being put 
under
any load.

Wireless station registration is a method used to prevent unauthorized
workstations from connecting to a WLAN. Each WLAN workstation is registered
by a unique address or name to the base station. Only registered 
workstations
are permitted to log on to the WLAN base station. This method is used to
combat many different kinds of attacks.

A third method to prevent an unauthorized access to a wireless LAN is that 
of
authentication. Authentication can be a simple coded response from a
workstation to a query from the base station or access point. Other methods
could include sophisticated dynamic profiles of individual users such as
keyboard techniques and response times. Authentication need not be a single
process at registration time but may be a continuous check on both 
workstation
and user.

Both spread spectrum techniques (DSSS and FHSS) make it extremely difficult
for unauthorized stations to determine the content of WLAN traffic. DSSS 
signal
power levels are frequently below the general level of background noise, 
which
makes them very difficult to detect. FHSS signals change frequency so often 
that
it is almost impossible for a receiver to follow the sequence if the hopping
pattern is not known. Spread spectrum is one of the preferred techniques 
used
by military organizations for these reasons. Military versions are credited 
with
key roles in many battlefield successes by providing secure communication
channels.

Additional security is often provided by the Network Operating System (NOS)
used in the LAN. Usually, the LAN server requires user identification and
passwords during the logon procedure. This prevents unauthorized users, who
may have access to an authorized workstation from accessing sensitive data.

-- Scalability

The ability to expand an installed WLAN network to meet business needs is a
vital factor in designing a WLAN system. When the number of workstations
connected to a base-station approaches the maximum for that cell, another 
base
station can be installed to reduce the load on the first base station. Base
stations are typically connected to an Ethernet or token-ring backbone 
network.

When multiple overlapping cells are installed, interference can affect
performance. DSSS cells can be sensitive to interference from adjacent cells
since all frequencies are used simultaneously. FHSS systems tend to be less
sensitive to interference since each cell uses a different hopping sequence 
and a
large number of frequencies are used sequentially.

The integration of a WLAN into an existing network is an important factor in
providing seamless connectivity. Typically a WLAN is connected to a wired
Ethernet or token-ring network by a bridge or router. Many WLANs support
protocols commonly used in the wired LAN environment (typically 802.2,
NetBIOS, TCP/IP and IPX). This allows existing applications to be used 
without
modification in a wireless environment.

Interoperability
The current state of standards for WLANs will make direct interoperability
between WLAN stations from different manufacturers difficult. Connectivity 
is
generally enabled by joining different base stations together through a 
backbone
Ethernet or token ring. Publication of the final 802.11 standard and
implementation in available WLAN products should improve the ability to
interconnect WLAN products. However, adherence to 802.11 standards will only
ensure interoperability when the same PHY and MAC layer models are used by
each product.

-- Health Issues

The power levels used in wireless LANs must be low enough not to affect user
health. There have been conflicting expert reports on the effects of various
levels of frequency spectrum exposure on the human body. Occasionally 
reports
have been misused or quoted out of context, which has led to 
misunderstanding
and public apprehension in some instances. Some high-frequency sources
which have come under scrutiny include high tension power lines, radio
telephones and cellular telephones. While there have been reports of higher
cancer rates among people exposed to high-tension power lines, these reports
have been rebutted by other experts who claim that this has not been
statistically proven.

There was considerable controversy over the safety of cellular telephones 
after a
consumer in Florida claimed that his wife had died of a brain tumor caused 
by a
cellular phone. He brought a legal suit against the manufacturer of the 
phone
but the lawsuit was dismissed. A recent study sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health measured how much radiation a users shoulders, head, 
neck
and upper torso absorbed. The study found that the level of radiation 
absorbed
by the body is four to five times lower than levels generally accepted by
scientists as safe.

The IEEE is also working on health-related aspects of wireless LANs and has
published the IEEE standard C95.1-1991. The findings are that eight hours of
exposure to WLANs is equivalent to three seconds of cordless phone 
operation.
The National Cancer Institute is investigating the results of radiation on 
the
human body. As a result of these different investigations, it is possible 
that the
regulations on transmission power may be tightened in some areas.

In the ISM bands, there is a U.S. limitation of 1 W transmitted power when 
using
spread spectrum techniques. The IBM Wireless LAN transmits at less than 100
mW of power in this band. This compares favorably with the 0.6 W transmitted
by handheld or 3 W by mobile cellular phones which have been agreed on as
safe power levels. Microwave ovens also operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and
are not seen as a health hazard.

setups
and their uses in todays enviroment and we have also seen the problems 
associated
with designing and setting up an radio LAN or telecommunications network.

**********************************************
DoD Classes - Slider
**********************************************

Now everyone has heard about the Rainbow books.  A supposed selection of 
manuals
produced by the US Department Of Defense detailing Security and such like.

Below is a Low-Down on the Orange criteria.

The Orange Book criteria came from a task force of the Defense Science Board
started in 1967. The original report, Security Controls for Computer Systems 
was
published in 1970. The current document is Trusted Computer System 
Evaluation
(DoD85). This material is important for many installations, but it is often
misunderstood and misused.

There are two quite distinct sets of criteria. One set defines a number of
security features. The other set defines the tools, information, and some of 
the
processes required to verify the correctness (design and operation) of the
features. The security features are the Security Policy and the second set 
is the
Assurance criteria.

Seven security levels are defined. These levels are:

	╖ D - Minimal Protection
	╖ C1 - Discretionary Security Protection
	╖ C2 - Controlled Access Protection
	╖ B1 - Labeled Security Protection, Mandatory Access Control
	╖ B2 - Structured Protection
	╖ B3 - Security Domains
	╖ A1 - Verified Design.

and the following terms have specific meanings:

╖ Security Policy. These are the rules that the security features enforce. 
For
  example: every user must have a password, or only a file owner can change
  the access list for the file. The specific rules will vary in different 
security
  levels and in local installation standards. The total set of rules 
enforced by
  the system forms the security policy of the system.

╖ Identification and Authentication (I&A). Subjects must be uniquely 
defined.
  A subject is a user or a process.

╖ Marking or Labeling. Objects (usually a file) must be associated with a
  security label that contains a security level and security category. For
  example, *Secret* is a level and Research might be a category.

╖ Accountability. This refers to complete and secure records of actions that
  affect security. Such actions include user setup, assignment or change of
  security levels, and denied access attempts.

╖ Assurance. This refers to system mechanisms that enforce security; it must
  be possible to measure the effectiveness of these mechanisms.

╖ Continuous Protection. The hardware and software mechanisms that
  implement security must be protected against unauthorized change.

╖ Object Reuse. This refers to memory blocks or disk blocks, for example. A
  program should not find ▓left over▓ data from another process or file when 
it
  acquires a memory or disk block.

╖ Covert Channels. This refers to indirect means of delivering information 
to an
  unauthorized user. For example, a program might make subtle changes to
  unclassified messages to convey classified information, or leave data in a
  shared memory location.

The following table (taken from DoD85) contains the requirements for the 
various
security classes.

An *x* means no requirement. An *R* means this class has additional
requirements over the lower classes. A *-* means this class has the same
requirements as the next lower class.

As can be seen, the requirements listed in this table are very general. Many
systems can claim to cover various levels of these requirements. To have any
real meaning, a system must be certified for a particular level. This means 
that
the system was examined (in great detail) by a U.S. government agency and
certified to operate at a certain security level. This certification is a 
long process
and can be expensive for the system developer. The specific tests and 
criteria
are designed for national security installations and may not be completely
appropriate for commercial users. Level *D* sometimes is applied to a system
that failed tests for a higher level.

Certification does not provide a guarantee or warranty that the security 
system
is perfect. It merely says that it satisfied the agency performing the 
tests.
However, these tests are generally accepted to be rigorous.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) are
very important concepts. DAC allows the owner of a file to set the security
parameters for the file. In AIX this is the owner setting permission bits or 
ACL
controls. MAC means that the system (through control parameters set by the
security officer) automatically controls the security parameters of a file. 
The
owner of the file cannot change these. AIX does not support MAC.

A system can have both MAC and DAC. The security officer (using various
control lists) decides which files (or categories of files) are controlled 
through
MAC and which are allowed for DAC. The DoD standard does not specify any
particular implementation for these facilities, and different systems use 
very
different mechanisms to implements these controls.

Human-readable output labels, specified in the DoD table, means the system
must automatically print security labels on output. This is independent of 
any
particular application program. This can be a difficult requirement because 
the
operating system does not understand what an application program is printing
on any particular page. If the system overprints *TOP SECRET* at some page
location it may overlay important application output. (The MVS/RACF solution
uses only laser page printers, and prints the security label in a 
nondestructive
manner.)

- Levels for Commercial Users

Class C is the most important security level for most commercial 
installations.
(Almost all systems at this level control Object Reuse and provide an Audit
facility, although these are C2 requirements only.) Class C is important for 
two
key reasons, neither of which is directly related to the specific security 
features
of C1 or C2:

1. A reasonable set of security features are included. This set is 
sufficient to
   provide reasonable control for most installations without creating a 
major
   administrative burden.

2. The system has been independently tested and certified to perform these
   functions correctly.

Unless there is a specific need for higher security, C1 or C2 should meet
generally accepted security practice requirements ---- if used 
intelligently.

From the users point of view, there is little difference between C1 and C2. 
72
The assurance and testing requirements for C2 are more rigorous and, in this 
sense,
a C2 system is better than a C1 system.

From a normal commercial viewpoint, class B introduces two major changes:
mandatory security access (MAC) and security labels. Security labels include
both security level (secret,...) and category (research, payroll, ...). A 
user might
have access to secret data in research, but only unclassified data in 
payroll.

The implementation of security labels requires substantial changes to most
systems. Both security labels and MAC may require considerable 
administrative
effort to implement and maintain.

The B2 and B3 classes become very rigorous and are difficult to certify. 
Class A
security would be very unusual for a commercial installation.

- Comments

System owners often assume the following:

	╖ A higher security class is better.
	╖ A higher class will take care of security needs with less effort.
	╖ Certain applications need a higher security class.

These assumptions are all false and lead to misuse and misunderstanding of 
the
security classes.

One key factor is the sharing of systems. For example, consider a
customer-account system in a bank. This appears a good candidate for a very
high security level. However if this system is implemented as a totally 
unshared
system (that is, there are no users other than this application), and there 
are no
*timesharing* terminals attached to the system, and physical security is
sufficient, and so forth, then a formal security class is pointless. 
Likewise a
small departmental system shared by users of the same *security level*
(whatever this may mean in a given organization) is unlikely to need as much
protection as a large system shared by many varied users of different 
security
levels and categories.

More security functions usually require more administrative effort. A higher
class does not automatically provide more security. It is capable of 
providing
more security, with proper administration. Conversely, a higher class system
may work very poorly and eventually become unusable if the security 
functions
are not properly administered. Do not buy or install more security than you 
are
prepared to administer.

The Orange Book specifications skip two especially important areas:

	╖ Networking
	╖ System updates

Most systems are attached to local area networks, and it is sometimes
difficult to clearly separate network security from individual system 
security. An
individual system administrator has little control over general network 
security
and must accept some network functions *on faith.* It is foolish, for 
example, to
demand a B1 system and then connect it (with default, standard facilities) 
to an
*open* TCP/IP network.73

Most commercially available operating systems have updates.74 The DoD
specifications seem to ignore these. It is not practical to re-certify a 
system for
every update or *fix*. Thus, in principle, a system is uncertified after any
update/fix is installed. The same concept applies when third party software
products having *authorized* modules are installed. In practice these 
upgrades
and products are accepted on faith.
