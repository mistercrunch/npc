Introduction to Issue 1

Welcome to the first ever issue of Oblivion Underground Magazine!!  I hope
you find the information contained within this issue helpful and
informative and continue to download the latest issues as they are released.

First off I would like to thank everyone that has helped make this issue
possible and actually be released on the date that I had advertised it
as being released.  Thanks go especially to Slider who has let me include a
lot of texts that he has written, and also for affiliating his site
SliderSecurity.Co.Uk with Oblivions site.

and fill in your email address and then next month you will have Issue 2
delivered direct to you on the 15th of April.  If not then all issues are
going to be available for download from our website on the day of release.

If anyone wants to help contribute to the next issue of Oblivion Magazine
then feel free to mail any Articles/Improvements/Comments whatever in to
me and I will try to make sure I take them all into account when compiling

Hopefully when word gets round about Oblivion Underground Magazine we should
be able to get more articles to release and hopefully carry on growing into
a great resource for all your underground information.

I am currently planning many new features for Oblivion both within the
magazine, on the website and other stuff in general.  Hopefully soon we will
be able to have our own channel on IRC, our own domain and many more great
features.
