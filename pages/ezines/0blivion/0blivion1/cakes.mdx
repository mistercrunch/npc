Space Cakes/Cookies...

This is my favourite way of taking canabis.

1) Cos it gets you really monged out of your head

and

2) Cos it takes care of the munchies while your having the pot!! *LOL*

If your gonna do something then do it right I always say.  Well when it comes
to making space cakes there is only one way to go....

Betty Crockitts Double Choc Chip Muffins!!!
-------------------------------------------
(Serves 4-5)

Ingredients
-----------
1 * Betty Crockitts Double Choc Chip Muffin Mix (Tesco's 1.99)
10 - 15 pounds of Pot (Resin/Skunk/Weed)
1 * Pack of Bun Cases
Any Other cake topping for effect!!!!

Instructions
------------
Take your pot and crumble it all as fine as you can.  If your using Skunk or
weed then get a knife and a board/magazine and chop it real fine.  The finer
you get the pot the better the cakes will taste and the stronger they will be.


Put your pot in a mixing bowl and add the Muffin mix.  Follow the rest of the
instructions for cooking.

Leave to cool, if you can wait that long, and then eat...

Should make about 12 muffins and get you pretty well trollyed!!

Other good cake mixes!

Scooby Doo Cartoon Cookie Kit (Tesco's 0.99)
Any muffin mixes, prefeably chocholate to hide the taste
Any big chocholate cake (but you need cake tins)

Pot Coffees
-----------

You will need...

Resin
Small egg cup (or other container, not metal)
Coffee
Kettle
Sugar/Milk
Microwave

Crumble the desired amount into the egg cup (usually about 2-3 spliffs worth)
add a small drop of water from the tap and microwave for approx 10sec.  Check
it has dissolved.  Stir with a match and re-microwave if needed. (You are
looking for a brown paste type effect)

Put a spoonfull of coffee in a mug and holding the egg cup above the mug pour
boiling water from the kettle into it and let it pour into the mug.  Make sure
you get all the pot mixture in the coffee.

Add milk and sugar and bon voyage....fucked again!!!

Tips for Cakes and Coffees....

I always find that cakes and coffees are best had in a group of about 4-5
people.  If you are capable try to make it to your local pub for the best
paranoia trip going!! See if you can manage to talk to anyone who hasnt had a
cake/coffee...i dont think so!!!

Make sure you smoke plenty of spliffs/bongs/buckets whatever you can get your
hands on while the cakes/coffees are kicking in.  And try to have a few beers.

These are gauranteed by me to get you fucked!! if it doesnt work you 
aint put enough pot in and you should try again....

catch ya'll later!!!!
