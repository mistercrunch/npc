&lt;http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html>
A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script in a
dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from untrustworthy
sources. This can be a problem when a web server does not adequately ensure
that generated pages are properly encoded to prevent unintended execution of
scripts, and when input is not validated to prevent malicious HTML from being
presented to the user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;http://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000201>
The apcd package as shipped in Debian GNULinux 2.1 is vulnerable to a symlink
attack. If the apcd process gets a SIGUSR1 signal it will dump its status to
tmp upsstat.  However this file is not opened safely, which makes it a good
target for a symlink attack.

&lt;http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,2433233,00.html>
It's been said that e-mail is more like a postcard than a registered letter.

package nevertheless.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-004
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-004.asp>
This vulnerability could cause administrative information on a Windows NT 4.0
system to be divulged to unprivileged users. A tool that allows administrators
to recover from catastrophic system errors creates a temporary file containing
the names and values of registry entries, but assigns it permissions that
allow normal users to read it while the tool is creating it.

Microsoft Bulletin: Patch Available for RDISK Registry Enumeration File
Vulnerability &lt;http://securityportal.com/topnews/ms00-004upd.html>
The RDISK utility is used to create an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) in order to
record machine state information as a contingency against system failure.
During execution, RDISK creates a temporary file containing an enumeration
of the registry. The ACLs on the file allow global read permission, and as a
result, a malicious user who knew that the administrator was running RDISK
could open the file and read the registry enumeration information as it was
being created.

&lt;http://www.forbes.com/forbes/00/0221/6504068s1.htm>
It doesn't take a master-cracker to take down your Web site. The technology
changes so quickly, it's challenging for even top-flight e-commerce sites,
with a staff of computer security professionals, to keep up with the latest
exploits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yahoo! - Why denial of service (DOS) attacks work
&lt;http://securityportal.com/direct.cgi?/topnews/yahoo20000208.html>
On Monday, Yahoo! was partially knocked offline when one of their routers at
a California data center was hammered into the ground by a denial of service
attack. We take a look at why the attack was successful and why even the
mighty are vulnerable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAI: W32/WinExt.worm
&lt;http://vil.nai.com/vil/MPI10544.asp>
This is an Internet worm which can autoreply to unread email messages of MAPI
installed email clients. Discovered in France in January, now reported to be
in the wild.

RedHat: Advisory, RHSA-2000:001-03
&lt;http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA2000001-03.html>
A security bug has been discovered and fixed in the userhelper program. The
bug can be exploited to provide local users with root access. The bug has been
fixed in userhelper-1.17, and pam-0.68-10 has been modified to help prevent
similar attacks on other software in the future.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RedHat: Advisory, RHSA-2000:002-01
&lt;http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA2000002-01.html>
New lpr packages are available to fix two security problems in lpd. Two
security vulnerabilities exist in the lpd shipped with the lpr package. First,
authentication was not thorough enough. If a remote user was able to control
their own DNS so that their IP address resolved to the hostname of the print
server, access would be granted, when it should not be. Secondly, it was
possible in the control file of a print job to specify arguments to
sendmail. By careful manipulation of control and data files, this could
cause sendmail to be executed with a user-specified configuration file. This
could lead very easily to a root compromise.

Currents: Privacy for the Masses - Using PGP without tears
&lt;http://www.currents.net/magazine/national/1803/intb1803.html>
Privacy software has never caught on with everyday users. Somehow it seems too
esoteric, too complicated, too ... well ... nerdy. And, to be honest, early
encryption programs did take a rocket scientist to understand.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currents: Yahoo Attack Maybe "Tribal Flood"
&lt;http://www.currents.net/newstoday/00/02/09/news1.html>
Patrick Taylor, vice president of risk assessment business unit of
Atlanta-based Internet Security Systems said he suspects that Monday's outage
was caused by a relatively new version of denial-of-service known as
"tribe flood" or "tribal flood" which has popped onto the scene in just the
last six months.  He said that tribe flood involves someone building a virus
program that automatically goes out and infects many computers at once -
typically computers at a university or government installation that have
broadband Internet access and are constantly powered up. "They call that
turning the machine into a 'zombie'" he said.

The UK Government came under fire on Thursday from the internet community
after it published a Bill to regulate covert surveillance. The critics say the
legislation, if passed, could lead to innocent people being sent to jail
simply because they have lost their data encryption codes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sophos: WM97/Thursday-F
&lt;http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/wm97thursdayf.html>
This virus has been reported in the wild. WM97/Thursday-F is a variant of the

&lt;http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,34229,00.html>
The string of recent attacks on major Web sites is drawing attention to the
fact that few Net companies have financial safeguards to withstand prolonged
service disruptions. Although insurance companies have recently begun offering
policies protecting Web sites against lost traffic, few companies have
signed up.

&lt;http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20000210S0013>
Tool vendors in this sector said Thursday they are seeing increasing interest
in their products.  But while they appreciate the business opportunities, they

FBI: NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION CENTER - TRINOO/Tribal Flood
Net/tfn2k
&lt;http://www.fbi.gov/nipc/trinoo.htm>
During the past few weeks the NIPC has seen multiple reports of intruders
installing distributed denial of service tools on various computer systems,
to create large networks of hosts capable of launching significant coordinated
packet flooding denial of service attacks. Installation has been accomplished
primarily through compromises exploiting known sun rpc vulnerabilities.
These multiple denial of service tools include TRINOO, and Tribe Flood
Network (or TFN & tfn2k), and has been reported on many systems.

&lt;http://www.securemac.com/Cmacscable.cfm>
An issue has surfaced which has been ignored and avoided for a long time. In
the past, people thought of Macintosh computers as being so secure that you
didn't even need to talk about security. Since the early 90's, there have been
a few web sites dedicated to Macintosh security or hacking, all of which have
surfaced, dissolved and expired.

SuSE Security Advisory: make-3.77-44 and earlier
&lt;http://securityportal.com/list-archive/bugtraq/2000/Feb/0169.html>
If GNU make is fed with Makefiles via stdin it creates temporary files in /tmp

Welt reported. In an interview with CNET News.com on Wednesday, Mixter
acknowledged that he had written programs that appear similar to those used
in the "denial of service" attacks but said he was not involved in the
incidents, which brought down Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com and other online
giants.
