Whats to Come in Oblivion Underground Magazine........

With this being the first ever issue of Oblivion Underground Magazine I 
thought i would try to tell the readers what we have planned for future
issues and what we are aiming for in the long run.

Next few issues

In the next few issues we have a number of things to bering you.  First off
Slider is going to start a regular new article called 'Exploit of the Month'
where he will try to tell everyone about the latest exploits out there.  This
will not just brush over the exploit but we are planning to release them with
full documentation and even source code.

I am planning to start a regular programming course, but I am unsure wether
to use Pascal, C or Visual basic.  If you have any preferances then write in
and I will see what I can do.

I might if I get any feed back start to host an Underground BBS for you all 
to exchange files and whatever else you want.  It will not be moderated 
so anything you want can be uploaded/downloaded ;) aslong as we dont run out
of Hard Disk space on the system.  

I know BBS are not being used as much as they used to be but they were the 
best way to trade stuff before the internet so I think we should carry on
the tradition.....It will probably only have one dial in node :( but I am 
gonna try and get another 10 telnet nodes so it can be a multinode system
via PSTN and the Internet :)

Last thing that I have thought of is to have a meet at some time.  Plans for
this have in no way even started to be made but keep reading to find out more.
Hopefully we will try to get as many people together as possible rather than
just locals as in the case of 2600 meets possibly even for a full weekend!!

Keep reading Oblivion to find out more.
