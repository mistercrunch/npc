_____________________________________________________

Well another month has passed and we are still here.  This is the forth issue
that we have released.  Hopefully the new site is online now, and you all
found it through the old URL.

Well first off I would like to thank Vortex at caffeine.org.uk for hosting
our new site on his box.  Thanks a lot Vortex!

Well we have changed the look of the site a lot and are now planning on
releasing articles not just aimed at 'the underground' but more at all
technical computer users.

Well It is now 7.20pm on the 15th and the mag is just about to be uploaded
and set out ;) I have got a real bad hangover still after a great night
out at Bed lastnight. I can barely remeber getting home, but I know I
ended up buying some hash from the taxi driver ;) although I have no idea
where it went as I didn;t have any rizzlas left.

Well thats it for now, I had best get the issue uploaded and emailed out.
Well remember you can always get the latest issue from the website and if
you signup to the mailing list (via the website) you will recieve the
issues as soon as they are released.

_____________________________________________

As you might of noticed we have dumped the use of the exploits section.  This 
is due tosome things beyond my control.

If someone wants to do this instead and get there names into Oblivion then give
me a shout I will be quite pleased to send you the template, or you can
create your own.

Anyways, my life is going to pot at the moment.  Im going to lose my job soon, 
because my contract runs out.  And then last week my G/f dumped me for anther 
bloke... heh!

Anyways...

Oblivion has started to take off quite alot.  We are now read by a large number
of people and alot of constructive and positive critcism has been coming in!  
Thank you.  You the audience make it what it is.

I decided on behalf of the news section i would affiliate with Help Net 
Security, they now supply me every week with a security letter, which i then in
turn compile at the end of the month into a article for Oblivion.

This month has slowed down alot, due the fact that i have not been generating 
articles as much as i should do.  But, instead i have been working more towards 
affiliations and honing my skills to carry on working and living :]

As you may of noticed with have a new site, many thanks Cyber for sorting that 
out.

Our IRC chan is also starting to take off, with two - three ppl in there all the
time and a few regs :]

Heh, were not massive yet!

Slidersecurity.co.uk has also had a make over, and i have now just started up a
free and fee based comapny with a few mates doing from security work through to
web page design :]

At the moment we have racked up a few clients, and we are just doing free work 
until we have a suffcient list of happy clients to start charging. Project
Omega can be checked out on http://www.slidersecurity.co.uk/omega we will
soon have our own domain.

Also, when im here many thanks to all that have supported me in my time of 
problems earlier this month.  We all need friends.

2. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - Slider
                                   [slider@0blivion.org]
_______________________________________________________

A very simple text explaining the basics of SMTP architecture.

Electronic mail (e-mail) is probably the most widely used TCP/IP application.
The basic Internet mail protocols provide mail (note) and message exchange
between TCP/IP hosts; facilities have been added for the transmission of data
that cannot be represented as 7-bit ASCII text.

There are three standard protocols that apply to mail of this kind. Each is
recommended. The term SMTP is frequently used to refer to the combined set of
protocols, since they are so closely inter-related, but strictly speaking SMTP
is just one of the three. Normally, it is evident from the context which of
the three protocols is being referred to. Whenever some doubt might exist, we
refer to the STD or RFC numbers to avoid ambiguity. The three standards are:

* A standard for exchange of mail between two computers (STD 10/RFC 821),
  which specifies the protocol used to send mail between TCP/IP hosts. This
  standard is SMTP itself.

* A standard (STD 11) on the format of the mail messages, contained in two
  RFCs. RFC 822 describes the syntax of mail header fields and defines a set
  of header fields and their interpretation. RFC 1049 describes how a set of
  document types other than plain text ASCII can be used in the mail body (the
  documents themselves are 7-bit ASCII containing imbedded formatting
  information: PostScript, Scribe, SGML, TEX, TROFF and DVI are all listed in
  the standard).

  The official protocol name for this standard is MAIL.

* A standard for the routing of mail using the Domain Name System, described
  in RFC 974. The official protocol name for this standard is DNS-MX.

  The STD 10/RFC 821 dictates that data sent via SMTP is 7-bit ASCII data,
  with the high-order bit cleared to zero. This is adequate in most instances
  for the transmission of English text messages, but is inadequate for
  non-English text or non-textual data. There are two approaches to overcoming
  these limitations:

* Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), defined in RFCs 2045 to 2049,
  which specifies a mechanism for encoding text and binary data as 7-bit ASCII
  within the mail envelope defined by RFC 822. MIME is described in 4.8,

* SMTP Service Extensions, which define a mechanism to extend the capabilities
  of SMTP beyond the limitations imposed by RFC 821. There are three current
  RFCs that describe SMTP Service Extensions:

* A standard for a receiver SMTP to inform a sender SMTP which service
  extensions it supports (RFC 1869).

RFC 1869 modifies RFC 821 to allow a client SMTP agent to request that the
server respond with a list of the service extensions that it supports at the
start of an SMTP session. If the server SMTP does not support RFC 1869, it
will respond with an error and the client can either terminate the session or
attempt to start a session according to the rules of RFC 821.

If the server does support RFC 1869, it can also respond with a list of the
service extensions that it supports. A registry of services is maintained by
IANA. The initial list defined in RFC 1869 contains those commands listed in
RFC 1123.

Other service extensions are defined via RFCs in the usual manner. The next
two RFCs define specific extensions:

* A protocol for 8-bit text transmission (RFC 1652) that allows an SMTP server
  to indicate that it can accept data consisting of 8-bit bytes. A server that
  reports that this extension is available to a client must leave the high
  order bit of bytes received in an SMTP message unchanged if requested to do
  so by the client.

The MIME and SMTP Service Extension approaches are complementary rather than
competing standards. In particular, RFC 1652 is titled SMTP Service Extension
for 8-bit-MIMEtransport, since the MIME standard allows messages to be
declared as consisting of 8-bit data rather than 7-bit data.

Such messages cannot be transmitted by SMTP agents that strictly conform to
RFC 821, but can be transmitted when both the client and the server conform to
RFCs 1869 and 1652. Whenever a client SMTP attempts to send 8-bit data to a
server that does not support this extension, the client SMTP must either
encode the message contents into a 7-bit representation compliant with the
MIME standard or return a permanent error to the user.

This service extension does not permit the sending of arbitrary binary data
because RFC 821 defines the maximum length of a line that an SMTP server is
required to accept as 1000 characters. Non-text data could easily have
sequences of more than 1000 characters without a &lt;CRLF> sequence.

Note:  The service extension specifically limits the use of non-ASCII
characters (those with values above decimal 127) to message bodies. They are
not permitted in RFC 822 message headers.

* A protocol for message size declaration (RFC 1870) that allows a server to
  inform a client of the maximum size message it can accept. Without this
  extension, a client can only be informed that a message has exceeded the
  maximum size acceptable to the server (either a fixed upper limit or a
  temporary limit imposed by a lack of available storage space at the server)
  after transmitting the entire message. When this happens, the server
  discards the failing message. If both client and server support the Message
  Size Declaration extension, the client may declare an estimated size of the
  message to be transferred and the server will return an error if the message
  is too large.

Each of these SMTP Service Extensions is a  draft standard protocol and each
has a status of  elective.

- How SMTP Works

SMTP (that is, STD 11/RFC 821) is based on  end-to-end delivery; an SMTP
client will contact the destination host's SMTP server directly to deliver the
mail. It will keep the mail item being transmitted until it has been
successfully copied to the recipient's SMTP. This is different from the
store-and-forward principle that is common in many mailing systems, where the
mail item may pass through a number of intermediate hosts in the same network
on its way to the destination and where successful transmission from the
sender only indicates that the mail item has reached the first intermediate
hop.

In various implementations, there is a possibility to exchange mail between
the TCP/IP SMTP mailing system and the locally used mailing systems. These
applications are called  mail gateways or  mail bridges. Sending mail through
a mail gateway can alter the end-to-end delivery specification, since SMTP
will only guarantee delivery to the mail-gateway host, not to the real
destination host, which is located beyond the TCP/IP network. When a mail
gateway is used, the SMTP end-to-end transmission is host-to-gateway,
gateway-to-host or gateway-to-gateway; the behavior beyond the gateway is not
defined by SMTP.

CSNET provides an interesting example of mail gateway service. Started as a
low-cost facility to interconnect scientific and corporate research centers,
CSNET operates a mail gateway service that allows subscribers to send and
receive mail across the Internet using only a dial-up modem. The mail gateway
polls the subscribers at regular times, delivers mail that was addressed to
them and picks up the outgoing mail. Although this is not a direct end-to-end
delivery, it has proven to be a very useful system.

Each message has:

* A header, or envelope, the structure of which is strictly defined by RFC 822
  
  The mail header is terminated by a null line (that is, a line with nothing
  preceding the &lt;CRLF> sequence). However, some implementations (for example
  VM, which does not support zero-length records in files) may interpret this
  differently and accept a blank line as a terminator.
 
* Contents

  Everything after the null (or blank) line is the message body which is a
  sequence of lines containing ASCII characters (that is, characters with a
  value less than 128 decimal).

  RFC 821 defines a client/server protocol. As usual, the client SMTP is the
  one that initiates the session (that is, the sending SMTP) and the server is
  the one that responds (the receiving SMTP) to the session request. However,
  since the client SMTP frequently acts as a server for a user mailing
  program, it is often simpler to refer to the client as the sender SMTP and
  to the server as the receiver SMTP.

* Mail Header Format
  
  The user normally doesn't have to worry about the message header, since it
  is taken care of by SMTP itself. A short reference is included below for
  completeness. RFC 822 contains a complete lexical analysis of the mail
  header. The syntax is written in a form known as the augmented Backus-Naur
  Form (BNF). RFC 822 contains a description of augmented BNF, and many RFCs
  that are related to RFC 822 use this format. RFC 822 describes how to parse
  a mail header to a  canonical representation, unfolding continuation lines,
  deleting insignificant spaces, removing comments and so on. The syntax is
  powerful, but relatively difficult to parse. A basic description is given
  here, which should be adequate for the reader to interpret the meaning of
  simple mail headers that he or she encounters. However, this description is
  too great a simplification to understand the details workings of RFC 822
  mailers; for a full description, refer to RFC 822.
 
  Briefly, the header is a list of lines, of the form:
  
     *field-name: field-value

     Fields begin in column 1. Lines beginning with white space characters
     (SPACE or TAB) are continuation lines that are unfolded to create a
     single line for each field in the canonical representation. Strings
     enclosed in ASCII quotation marks indicate single tokens within which
     special characters such as the colon are not significant.
     
     Many important field values (such as those for the To and From fields)
     are mailboxes. The most common forms for these are:

     octopus@garden.under.the.sea, 
     The Octopus &lt;octopus@garden.under.the.sea>, 
     "The Octopus" &lt;octopus@garden.under.the.sea>

     The string The Octopus is intended for human recipients and is the name
     of the mailbox owner. The string octopus@garden.under.the.sea is the
     machine-readable address of the mailbox. (The angle brackets are used to
     delimit the address but are not part of it.) One can see that this form
     of addressing is closely related to the Domain Name System concept. In
     fact, the client SMTP uses the Domain Name System to determine the IP
     address of the destination mailbox.

     Some frequently used fields are:

     Keyword       Value

     to            Primary recipients of the message.
     cc            Secondary (carbon-copy) recipients of the message.
     from          Identity of sender.
     reply-to      The mailbox to which responses are to be sent. This field 
                   is added by the originator.
     return-path   Address and route back to the originator. This field is 
                   added by the final transport system that delivers the mail.
     Subject       Summary of the message. This is usually provided by the
                   user.


- Mail Exchange

The SMTP design is based on the model of communication shown below.

As a result of a user mail request, the sender SMTP establishes a two-way
connection with a receiver SMTP. The receiver SMTP can be either the ultimate
destination or an intermediate (mail gateway). The sender SMTP will generate
commands that are replied to by the receiver SMTP.

USER <-----------> 				       <-----------> USER
                      SENDERS              RECIEVERS 
                       SMTP    <-------->    SMTP
FILE SYSTEM  <--->	          		       <--->  FILE SYSTEM

SMTP Mail Transaction Flow: Although mail commands and replies are rigidly
defined.

All exchanged commands/replies/data are text lines, delimited by a &lt;CRLF>. All
replies have a numeric code at the beginning of the line.

1. The sender SMTP establishes a TCP connection with the destination SMTP and
then waits for the server to send a 220 Service ready message or a 421 Service
not available message when the destination is temporarily unable to proceed.

2. HELO (HELO is an abbreviation for hello) is sent, to which the receiver
will identify himself or herself by sending back its domain name. The
sender-SMTP can use this to verify if it contacted the right destination SMTP.

If the sender SMTP supports SMTP Service Extensions as defined in RFC 1869, it
may substitute an EHLO command in place of the HELO command. A receiver SMTP
that does not support service extensions will respond with a 500 Syntax error,
command unrecognized message. The sender SMTP should then retry with HELO, or
if it cannot transmit the message without one or more service extensions, it
should send a QUIT message.

If a receiver-SMTP supports service extensions, it responds with a multi-line
250 OK message, which includes a list of service extensions that it supports.

3. The sender now initiates the start of a mail transaction by sending a MAIL
command to the receiver. This command contains the reverse-path which can be
used to report errors. Note that a path can be more than just the user
mailbox@host domain name pair. In addition, it can contain a list of routing
hosts. Examples of this are when we pass a mail bridge, or when we provide
explicit routing information in the destination address. If accepted, the
receiver replies with a 250 OK.

4. The second step of the actual mail exchange consists of providing the
server SMTP with the destinations for the message. There can be more than one
recipient.) This is done by sending one or more RCPT TO:&lt;forward-path>
commands.

Each of them will receive a reply 250 OK if the destination is known to the
server, or a 550 No such user here if it isn't.

5. When all RCPT commands are sent, the sender issues a DATA command to notify
the receiver that the message contents are following. The server replies with
354 Start mail input, end with &lt;CRLF>.&lt;CRLF>. Note the ending sequence that
the sender should use to terminate the message data.

6. The client now sends the data line by line, ending with the 5-character
sequence &lt;CRLF>.&lt;CRLF> line upon which the receiver acknowledges with a 250 OK
or an appropriate error message if anything went wrong.

7. We now have several possible actions:

* The sender has no more messages to send. He or she will end the connection
  with a QUIT command, which will be answered with a 221 Service closing
  transmission channel reply.

* The sender has no more messages to send, but is ready to receive messages
  (if any) from the other side. He or she will issue the TURN command. The two
  SMTPs now switch their role of sender/receiver and the sender (previously
  the receiver) can now send messages by starting with step 3 above.

* The sender has another message to send, and simply goes back to step 3 to
  send a new MAIL command.

The SMTP Destination Address (Mailbox Address):  Its general form is
local-part@domain-name and can take several forms:

user@host 		
			For a direct destination on the same TCP/IP network.

user%remote-host@gateway-host

			For a user on a non-SMTP destination remote-host, via 
                        the mail gateway gateway-host.

@host-a,@host-b:user@host-c

			For a relayed message. This contains explicit routing
			information. The message will first be delivered to
                        host-a, who will resend (relay) the message to host-b.
                        Host-b will then forward the message to the real
                        destination host-c.

			Note that the message is stored on each of the
                        intermediate hosts, so we don't have an end-to-end
                        delivery in this case.

In the above description, only the most important commands were mentioned. All
of them are commands that must be recognized in each SMTP implementation.
Other commands exist, but most of those are only optional; that is, the RFC
standard does not require them to be implemented everywhere. However, they
implement very interesting functions such as relaying, forwarding, mailing
lists, etc.

- SMTP and the Domain Name System

If the network is using the domain concept, an SMTP cannot simply deliver mail
sent to TEST.HOTMAIL.COM by opening a TCP connection to TEST.HOTMAIL.COM. It
must first query the name server to find out to which host (again a domain
name) it should deliver the message.

For message delivery, the name server stores resource records (RRs) known as
MX RRs. They map a domain name to two values:

* A preference value. 
  As multiple MX resource records may exist for the same domain name, a
  preference (priority) is assigned to them. The lowest preference value
  corresponds to the most preferred record. This is useful whenever the most
  preferred host is unreachable; the sending SMTP then tries to contact the
  next (less preferred) host.

* A host name.
  It is also possible that the name server responds with an empty list of MX
  RRs. This means that the domain name is in the name server's authority, but
  has no MX assigned to it. In this case, the sending SMTP may try to
  establish the connection with the host name itself.

- Addressing Mailboxes on Server Systems

When a user employs a server system for all mail functions, the mailbox
address seen by other SMTP users refers exclusively to the mail server system.
For example if two NT systems are named:

Slider.ECHO.HOST.COM

and

SLIDER1.ECHO1.HOST.COM

with the first one being used as an UltiMail client and the second as an
UltiMail server, the mailbox address might be:

SLIDER@Slider.ECHO.HOST.COM

This mailbox address would appear in the From: header field of all outgoing
mail and in the SMTP commands to remote servers issued by the UltiMail server
system.

When the user uses a POP server, however, the mailbox address on outbound mail
items contains the workstation's hostname. 

In this case, the sender should include a Reply-To: field in the mail header 
to indicate that replies should  not be sent to the originating mailbox. 

Using the Domain Name System to Direct Mail:  An alternative approach to using
the Reply-To: header field is to use the Domain Name System to direct mail to
the correct mailbox. The administrator for the domain name server with
authority for the domain containing the user's workstation and the name server
can add MX resource records to the Domain Name System to direct mail
appropriately.

3. POP3 Interactive Session - Cyber0ptix
                              [cyberoptix@0blivion.org]
______________________________________________________

This text is a brief outline of some of the commands that you can use when
accessing a POP3 Server via Telnet.

POP3 is the standard for remote email collection that most if not all ISP's
use except for AOL, but hell they arnt even a real ISP are they.

So how do you access the server?

Simple, just run a standard telnet client and connect to the mail server on
port 110.  You will be greeted with a banner something like this.

+OK <9529.958822463@mail.DOMAIN.net>

So now you need to authenticate yourself before you can use issue any commands
to the server.  Well you know YOUR username and password don't you?  Well the
two commands to authenticate yourself with the server are 'USER' and 'PASS'.
So here goes

USER username                 <-- Issued by you
+OK                           <-- Response from server
PASS xxxxxxx                  <-- Issued by you
+OK                           <-- Response from server

So now you want to see if you have any mail dont you? This is where you will
use the 'LIST' command, to show you how many messages are waiting for you on
the server.

LIST                          <-- Issued by you
+OK                           <-- Response from server
.                             <-- Response from server

Well the response here shows that there is no mail in the account.  If there
is mail waiting for collection then you would see something like this

LIST                          <-- Issued by you
+OK                           <-- Response from server
1 13456                       <-- Response from server
2 4324                        <-- Response from server
3 53456                       <-- Response from server
.                             <-- Response from server

So now there are 3 emails waiting to be read. The first number is the number
of the mail and the number following that is the size in kilobytes that the
message is.

So what else can I do?

To read a mail that is stored on the server you can use the 'TOP' command.
Simply type,

TOP 1                         <-- Issued by you

This will display message number 1, if you dont want to see all of it, which
is usually the case as it will just scroll past, and you wont have time to
read it you can specify the number of lines of the message to display with,

TOP 1 10                      <-- Issued by you

This will now display the first 10 lines of the message.

I've read my mail how do I delete it?

Right, you can delete messages using the 'DELE'

DELE 1                        <-- Issued by you

This will delete message 1 from the server, unfortunately you can only delete
mail 1 at a time when you are loged into the server in this fashion.  Although
it is possible to use a script on a shell somewhere to connect and issue the
commands to delete multiple messages.  

So I've finished what im doing, what next?

Well dont just close your telnet client, without issuing the 'QUIT' command as
any mail that you have deleted will suddenly undelete itself. And belive me if
you have just deleted a lot of mail it will be quite annoying having to type
all the commands again to delete them for a second time. Well this is a
feature to make sure you actually want to delete it.  So when you are finished
just type 'QUIT' and the session will end.

Well there isn't really a lot you can do, but at least now you know how to
check your mail when you arn't on your own computer, without setting up a POP3
client to do it for you.

4. A Look Into Wiretapping - Spyderco Psyops 
                             [psyops@scientist.com]
__________________________________________________


Wiretapping is the traditional term for interception of telephone
conversations. This should not be taken too literally. The word is no longer
restricted to communications traveling by wire, and contemporary wiretaps are
more commonly placed on radio links or inside telephone offices. The meaning
has also broadened in that the thing being tapped need no longer be a
telephone call in the classic sense; it may be some oher form of electronic
communication, such as fax or data.

Compared with the more precise but more general phrase "communications
interception," the word "wiretapping" has two connotations. Much the stronger
of these is that a wiretap is aimed at a particular target, in sharp contrast
to the "vacuum cleaner" interception widely practiced by national intelligence
agencies. The weaker connotation is that it is being done by the police.

The history of wiretapping in the United States is in fact two histories
intertwined. It is a history of wiretapping per se--that is, a history of the
installation and use of wiretaps by police, intelligence agencies, hones
citizens, businesses, and criminals. It is also a history of society's legal
response to wiretapping by these various groups.

The origins of wiretapping lie in two quiet different practices: eavesdropping
and letter opening. "Eavesdropping," although once more restricted in meaning,
has come to describe any attempt to overhear conversations without the
knowledge of the participants. "Letter opening" takes in all acquisition,
opening reading, and copying of written messages, also without knowledge of
the sending and receiving parties. Telecommunication has unified and
systematized these practices.

Before the electronic era, a conversation could only be carried on by people
located within earshot of each other, typically a few feet apart. Neither
advanced planning nor great effort on the part of the participans was required
to ensure a high degree of security. Written communications were more
vulnerable, but intercepting one was still a hit-or-miss affair. Messages
traveled by a variety of postal services, couriers, travelers, and merchants.
Politically sensitive messages, in particular, could not be counted on to go
by predictable channels, so special couriers were sometimes employed.

And written messages enjoyed another sort of protection. Regardless of a spy's
skill with flaps and seals, there was no guarantee that, if a letter was
intercepted, opened, and read, the victim would not notice the intrusion.
Since spying typically has to be done covertly in order to succeed, the chance
of detection is a substantial deterrent.

Electronic communication has changed all this in three fundamental ways: it
has made telecommunication too convenient to avoid; it has, despite
appearances, reduced the diversity of channels by which written messages once
traveled; and it has made the act of interception invisible to the target.

Conversation by telephone has achieved an almost equal footing with
face-to-face conversation. It is impossible today to run a successful business
without the telephone, and eccentric even to attempt to do without the
telephone in private life. The telephone provides a means of communication so
effective and convenient that even people who are aware of the danger of being
overheard routinely put aside their caution and use it to convey sensitive
information.

As the number of channels of communication has increased (there are now
hundres of communication companies, with myriad fibers, satellites, and
microwave links), the diversity of communication paths has diminished. In the
days of oxcart and sail, there was no registry of the thousands of people
willing to carry a message in return for a tip from the recipient. Today,
telecommunications carriers must be registered with national and local
regulatory bodies and are well known to trace associations and industry watch
groups. Thus, interception has become more systematic. Spies, no longer faced
with a patchwork of ad hoc couriers, know better where to look for what thet
seek.

Perhaps more important, interception of telecommunications leaves no telltale
"marks on the envelop." It is inherent in telecommunication-- and inseparable
from its virtues--that the sender and the receiver of a message have no way of
telling who else may have recorded a copy.

Any discussion of wiretapping, particularly a legal discussion, is complicated
by the fact that electronics has not only made interception of
telecommunications possible; it has also made it easier to "bug" face-to-face
conversations. Bugging would be nearly irrelevant to the central subject of
this document--Taking A Deeper Trip Into Wiretapping--were it not for the fact
that bugs and wiretaps are inseparably intertwined in law and jurisprudence
and named by one collective term: electronic surveillance.

Wiretaps and bugs are powerful investigative tools. They allow the
eavesdropper to overhear conversations between politicians, criminals,
lawyers, or lovers without the targets' knowing that their words are being
share with unwanted listeners. Electronic surveillance is a tool that can
detect criminal conspiracies and provide prosecutors with strong evidence--the
conspirators' incriminating statements in their own voices --all without
danger to law-enforcement officers. On the other hand, the very invisibility
on which electronic surveillance depends for its effectiveness makes it
evasive of oversight and readily adaptable to malign uses. Electronic
surveillance can be and has been used by those in power to undermine the
democratic process by spying on their political opponents. In light of this,
it is not surprising that Congress and the courts have approached wiretapping
and bugging with suspicion.

Today, communication enjoys a measure of protection under US law, and neither
government agents nor private citizens are permitted to wiretap at will. This
has not always been the case. The current view--that wiretaps are a kind of
search--has evolved by fits and starts over a century and a half. The Supreme
Court ruled in 1967 that the police may not employ wiretaps without court
authorization. Congress has embraced this principle, limiting police use of
wiretaps and setting standards for the granting of warrants. The same laws
prohibit most wiretapping by private citizens.

The rules against unwarranted wiretapping are not absolute, however. For
example, the courts ruled in 1992 (United States vs. David Lee Smith, 978 F.
2nd 171, US App) that conversations over cordless phones were not protected
and that police tapping of cordless phones did not require a search warrant.
A 1994 statute (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994,
Public Law 103-414, º202) extended the warrant requirements of the earlier law
to cover cordless phones. The law also makes some exceptions for businesses
intercepting the communications of their own employees on company property.

5. An Introduction to DNS  - Cyber0ptix
                             [cyberoptix@0blivion.org]
_____________________________________________________

The domain name system is a global network of servers thats primary job is to
translate hostnames such as www.0blivion.org or wargame.0blivion.org into IP
addresses so that a connection to the server can be made.  Without the DNS
Servers in place everyone on the internet would need to remember server
addresses in their IP format and domain names would be redundant.

History of DNS

Paul Mockapetris designed DNS in 1984 to solve escalating problems with the
old name-to-address mapping system. The old system consisted of a single file,
known as the host table, maintained by the Stanford Research Institute's
Network Information Center (SRI-NIC). As new host names trickled in, SRI-NIC
would add them to the table - a couple times a week. Systems administrators
would grab the newest version (via FTP) and update their domain name servers.

But as the Net grew, the host table became unwieldy. Though it worked fine for
name-to-address mapping, it wasn't the most practical or effective way to
update and distribute the information. And since the stability of the rapidly
growing Internet was at stake, Mockapetris and some other folks decided to
find a better way.

Enter DNS. The great thing about the domain name system is that no single
organization is responsible for updating it. It's what's known as a
distributed database; it exists on many different name servers around the
world, with no one server storing all the information. Because of this, DNS
allows for almost unlimited growth.

The domain name space 

In order to understand how a DNS server works, you should be familiar with
what is called the domain name space. It sounds a little ominous, I know, but
really it's quite simple. In fact, you've probably seen it at one time or
another represented by an inverted tree that looks something like this:

			(.root)
	 __________________|_________________
	|     |    |     |      |     |      |
      .com  .org .edu  .net   .gov  .mil   .arpa
         _____|_____________
	|		    |
      oxfam              0blivion
          __________________|_____________________
	 |     |      |      |     |      |       |
	www   mail  relay   irc   ftp   news   wargame


 
Each node on the tree represents a domain. Everything below a node falls into
its domain. One domain can be part of another domain.  Using this inverted
tree it is easy to see how the different levels of domains are named and
ordered.

First off there are the top level domains such as .com, .org, .net.  Under
these come the second level domains which is the main part of the domain name
that you decide to register.  After this there are the third level domains
such as www, mail, ftp and these point to various IPs or hostnames on your
network.

How does it work?

A DNS server is just a computer that's running DNS software. Since most
servers are Unix machines, the most popular program is BIND (Berkeley Internet
Name Domain), but you can find software for the Mac and the PC as well.

DNS software is generally made up of two elements: the actual name server, and
something called a resolver. The name server responds to browser requests by
supplying name-to-address conversions. When it doesn't know the answer, the
resolver will ask another name server for the information.

When you type in a URL, your browser sends a request to the closest name
server. If that server has ever fielded a request for the same host name
(within a time period set by the administrator to prevent passing old
information), it will locate the information in its cache and reply.

If the name server is unfamiliar with the domain name, the resolver will
attempt to "solve" the problem by asking a server farther up the tree. If that
doesn't work, the second server will ask yet another - until it finds one that
knows. (When a server can supply an answer without asking another, it's known
as an authoritative server.)

Once the information is located, it's passed back to your browser, and you're
sent on your merry way. Usually this process occurs quickly, but occasionally
it can take an excruciatingly long time (like 15 seconds). In the worst cases,
you'll get a dialog box that says the domain name doesn't exist - even though
you know damn well it does.

This happens because the authoritative server is slow replying to the first,
and your computer gets tired of waiting so it times-out (drops the
connection). But if you try again, there's a good chance it will work, because
the authoritative server has had enough time to reply, and your name server
has stored the information in its cache.

Different type of Records

Domain name servers carry 3 main types of records for a domain.  They are
known as the following, MX, CNAME and A Type Records.  MX or Mail Exchange
records are used to specify the mail routing for the domain, to make sure your
email gets to the right server.  CNAME records are used to point a host at
another host, for example

ftp.0blivion.org > ftp.hosting.com

A Type records on the other hand point the host straight at a IP Address such
as

wargame.0blivion.org > 196.34.56.24

These are great for when you own the entire network as you know which IP
address is related to which server.  On the other hand if you are wanting to
use a domain you purchased to point at other servers you will be best off
using a CNAME records as the network admin will keep their DNS upto date and
you will have nothing to worry about.

Well that is just a basic intro to how DNS works, hope you all found it
interesting and if you have any ideas for articles that you would like to see
in the next issue, feel free to email your ideas in.

_________________________________

IP Version 6

This text was written jointly by Lockdown and myself.  You will see where
lockdown added his bits.

The Internet is growing extremely rapidly. The latest Internet Domain Survey,
conducted in January 1998, counted over 29.5 million hosts in more than 190
countries. The IPv4 addressing scheme, with a 32-bit address field, provides
for over 4 billion possible addresses, so it might seem more than adequate to
the task of addressing all of the hosts on the Internet, since there appears
to be room for a thousand-fold increase before it is completely filled.
Unfortunately, this is not the case, for a number of reasons, including the
following:

* The IP address is divided into a network number and a local part which is
  administered separately. Although the address space within a network may be
  very sparsely filled, as far as the effective IP address space is concerned,
  if a network number has been allocated, then all addresses within that
  network are unavailable for allocation elsewhere.

* The address space for networks is structured into Class A, B and C networks
  of differing sizes, and the space within each needs to be considered
  separately.

* The IP addressing model requires that unique network numbers be assigned to
  all IP networks whether or not they are actually connected to the Internet.

* It is anticipated that growth of TCP/IP usage into new areas outside the
  traditional connected PC will shortly result in a rapid explosion of demand
  for IP addresses. For example, widespread use of TCP/IP for interconnecting
  hand-held devices, electronic point-of-sale terminals or for Web-enabled
  television receivers, all devices that are now available, will enormously
  increase the number of IP hosts.

****lock edit- routing/CIDR/ **************

To support H-R routing and to conserve routing table space, a number of
subnets can be combine into one routing entry. See CIDR and Super Subnetting,
maybe another .txt. So even though IPV6, solves the immediate problem of a
shortage of unique network numbers, it does'nt solve the problem of very large
routing tables. IPV6 can be used to create better HR on networks, as there is
enough space to encapsulate the whole IPV4 address space into and IPV6
Address. So IPV6 on major backbones may be a distinct advantage when build
fast(small) routing tables.

*******************************************
 

These factors mean that the address space is much more constrained than our
simple analysis would indicate. This problem is called  IP Address Exhaustion.
Methods of relieving this problem are already being employed but eventually,
the present IP address space will be exhausted. The Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) set up a working group on  Address Lifetime Expectations (ALE)
with the express purpose of providing estimates of when exhaustion of the IP
will become an intractable problem. Their final estimates (reported in the ALE
working group minutes for December 1994) were that the IP address space would
be exhausted at some point between 2005 and 2011. Since then the position may
have changed somewhat in that the use of CIDR and the increased use of DHCP
may have relieved pressure on the address space, but on the other hand,
current growth rates are probably exceeding expectation at that time. Apart
from address exhaustion, other restrictions in IPv4 also called for the
definition of a new IP protocol:

1. Even with the use of CIDR, routing tables, primarily in the IP backbone
   routers, are growing too large to be manageable.

****Lock Edit****
At major peering points, where the number of routes are large, this can be a
very serious problem, even to the point where the routing becomes so instable
that no traffic is routed. Hieracle routing is the only way to go. It can't be
done with IPV4 on it's own, as the cat is out of the bag concerning, network
numbering. I.E. Address are allocated independtly to how the physyical network
actually looks. This is problem with flat networks, every network number in
use, needs a routing entry, when this grows large, major routing problems can
occur.  CIDR go someway into sorting the problem, i.e. it's a general rule of
thumb the european internet network get's allocated 194/8 or 195/8 addresses
space. So, any top level router's just need routing entries for those's
network and it can get to europe. 

IPV6 could solve major routing problems, there is enough address space to for
an IP address to start to have meaning, in the hieracle routing scheme.

as you can see, the job a routing becomes more simple, as you traverse down
the tree, you have relived routing pressure from the backbone device. Breaking
down the address space into 'zones' can save lots of headaches. Imagine a
internet peering point that only need a handful of routes to access all other
peering point on the globe, how easy would is be to manage, and how much
cheaper would this be ;-)....no cisco routers with 40mb of routing data to
siff through. Remember, the lookup for routing get's done for all packets
being routed, even one to the same destination.

Hieracle routing only works correctly if IP address are assigned in.

1. Large Blocks (so the can be summrised in routes)
2. Some kind of physical Location  (i.e. a block for each country, city,
   steet??)
3. Break out of IP ownship loop - Break the old fashion method of owning IP
   address, addresses should be able to be reclaimed if not in use. 

NAT etc etc makes renumbering easy (not like the dark days!).

There a lot of talk at the moment, about MPLS/LSR (label switched routers .txt
comming soon). The layer 2 packet has extra information, this allows
networking engineer's (hackers) to create traffic flow's thru certain routers
on a network (traffic engineering!). I don't like it, as this makes it
difficult to create flows between two network out of administrative control
(e.g ntl.net and bt.net). By creating HR without LSR, we keep the traffic flow
information 'public' so routers can make flow deciedions based on destination/
source IP pairs, not on some mysterous traffic flow label hidden in layer 2.
Using a traffic flow identyfier at layer 3 is vital for interprovider traffic
engineering and qos. All providers are connected a IP layer 3, not many IP
providers are connected to each other directly at layer 2, in fact' I don't
know of any providers who do this!!!, it's just too insecure/danerous. You
even tried to connect to layer 2 clouds together...nasty...but layer 3
clouds...easy. All the providers are connected at layer 3, they have to
because they route IP and this is where flow information should be determined,
where it has more fucking meaning. See my point. that's the point of IPV6.

LSR add's another layer of routing on the network, basicly you can transmit
packets, without an IP header, kinda defeats the object of IP addressing, it
makes IP addressing the local form of addressing , not the global....why, the
fuck bother....ah, because large mega telco's can start to reclaim some of
there power...sinister..because it is.

So, who's gonna give me a 15 LSR routers to muck around with? ;-).

2. Traffic priority, or class of service, is vaguely defined, scarcely used
and not at all enforced in IPv4, but highly desirable for modern real-time
applications. In view of these issues, the IETF established an IPng (IP next
generation) working group and published  RFC 1752 *The Recommendation for the
IP Next Generation Protocol. Eventually, the specification for Internet
Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) was produced in RFC 1883.

- IPv6 Overview

IPv6 offers the following significant features:

* A dramatically larger address space, said to be sufficient for the next 30
  years

* Globally unique and hierarchical addressing, based on prefixes rather than
  address classes, to keep routing tables small and backbone routing efficient

* A mechanism for the autoconfiguration of network interfaces

* Support for encapsulation of itself and other protocols

* Class of service to distinguish types of data

* Improved multicast routing support (in preference to broadcasting)

* Built-in authentication and encryption

* Transition methods to migrate from IPv4

* Compatibility methods to coexist and communicate with IPv4

Note:  IPv6 uses the term  packet rather than  datagram. The meaning is the
same, although the formats are different.

IPv6 uses the term 'node' for any system running IPv6, that is, a host or a
router. An IPv6 host is a node that does not forward IPv6 packets that are not
explicitly addressed to it. A router is a node that does forward IP packets
not addressed to it.

- The IPv6 Header Format

The format of the IPv6 packet header has been simplified from its counterpart
in IPv4. The length of the IPv6 header is increased to 40 bytes (from 20
bytes), and contains two 16-byte addresses (source and destination) preceded
by 8 bytes of control information. 

The IPv4 header has two 4-byte addresses preceded by 12 bytes of control
information and possibly followed by option data. The reduction of the control
information and the elimination of options in the header for most IP packets
are intended to optimize the processing time per packet in a router. The
infrequently used fields that have been removed from the header are moved to
optional extension headers when they are required.

- Hop Limit

This is the IPv4 TTL field but now it is measured in hops and not seconds. It
was changed for two reasons:

* IP normally forwards datagrams at faster than one hop per second
  and the TTL field is always decremented on each hop, so in practice
  it is measured in hops and not seconds.

* Many IP implementations do not expire outstanding datagrams on
  the basis of elapsed time.

The packet is discarded once the hop limit is decremented to zero.

- Identification, Fragmentation Flags and Fragment Offset

Fragmented packets have an extension header rather than fragmentation
information in the IPv6 header. This reduces the size of the basic IPv6
header. Since higher level protocols, particularly TCP, tend to avoid
fragmentation of datagrams, this reduces the IPv6 header overhead for the
normal case. As noted below, IPv6 does not fragment packets en route to their
destinations, only at the source.

- Header Checksum

Because transport protocols implement checksums, and because IPv6 includes an
optional authentication header that can also be used to ensure integrity, IPv6
does  not provide checksum monitoring of IP packets.

Both TCP and UDP include a pseudo IP header in the checksums they use, so in
these cases, the IP header in IPv4 is being checked twice. TCP and UDP, and
any other protocols using the same checksum mechanisms running over IPv6 will
continue to use a pseudo IP header although, obviously, the format of the
pseudo IPv6 header will be different from the pseudo IPv4 header. ICMP and
IGMP and any other protocols that do not use a pseudo IP header over IPv4 will
use a pseudo IPv6 header in their checksums.

- Options

All optional values associated with IPv6 packets are contained in extension
headers ensuring that the basic IP header is always the same size.

- Packet Sizes

All IPv6 nodes are expected to dynamically determine the maximum transmission
unit (MTU) supported by all links along a path and source nodes will only send
packets that do not exceed the Path MTU. 

IPv6 routers will therefore not have to fragment packets in the middle of
multihop routes and allow much more efficient use of paths that traverse
diverse physical transmission media. IPv6 requires that every link supports an
MTU of 576 bytes or greater.

- Extension Headers

Every IPv6 packet starts with the basic header. In most cases this will be the
only header necessary to deliver the packet. Sometimes, however, it is
necessary for additional information to be conveyed along with the packet to
the destination or to intermediate systems on route (information that would
previously have been carried in the Options field in an IPv4 datagram).
Extension headers are used for this purpose.

Extension headers are placed immediately after the IPv6 basic packet header
and are counted as part of the payload length. Each extension header (with the
exception of 59) has its own 8-bit  Next Header field as the first byte of the
header that identifies the type of the following header. This structure allows
IPv6 to chain multiple extension headers together.

The length of each header varies, depending on type, but is always a multiple
of 8 bytes. There are a limited number of IPv6 extension headers, any one of
which may be present once only in the IPv6 packet (with the exception of the
Destination Options Header - 60, which may appear more than once). IPv6 nodes
that originate packets are required to place extension headers in a specific
order (numeric order with exception of 60), although IPv6 nodes that receive
packets are not required to verify that this is the case. The order is
important for efficient processing at intermediate routers. Routers will
generally only be interested in the hop-by-hop options and the routing header.
Once the router has read this far, it does not need to read further in the
packet and can forward immediately.

When the Next Header field contains a value other than one for an extension
header, this indicates the end of the IPv6 headers and the start of the higher
level protocol data.

IPv6 allows for encapsulation of IPv6 within IPv6 (*tunneling*). This is done
with a Next Header value of 41 (IPv6). The encapsulated IPv6 packet may have
its own extension headers. Because the size of a packet is calculated by the
originating node to match the path MTU, IPv6 routers should not add extension
headers to a packet but instead should encapsulate the received packet within
an IPv6 packet of their own making (which may be fragmented if necessary).

With the exception of the Hop-by-Hop header (which must immediately follow the
IP header if present) and sometimes the Destination Options header, extension
headers are not processed by any router on the packet's path except the final
one.

- Hop-by-Hop Header

A Hop-by-Hop header contains options that must be examined by every node the
packet traverses as well as the destination node. It must immediately follow
the IPv6 header if present and is identified by the special value 0 in the
Next Header field of the IPv6 basic header. (This value is not actually a
protocol number but a special case to identify this unique type of extension
header).

Hop-by-hop headers contain variable length options of the following format
(commonly known as the  Type-Length-Value (TLV) format).

- Routing Header

The path that a packet takes through the network is normally determined by the
network itself. Sometimes, however, the source may wish to have more control
over the route taken by the packet. It may wish, for example, for certain data
to take a slower, but more secure route than would normally be taken. The
routing header allows a path through the network to be predefined. The routing
header is identified by the value 43 in the preceding Next Header field. It
has its next header field as the first byte and a single byte routing type as
the second. The only type defined initially is type 0 - Strict/Loose Source
Routing, which operates in a similar way to source routing in IPv4.

The first hop on the required path of the packet is indicated by the
destination address in the basic header of the packet. When the packet arrives
at this address, the router swaps the next address from the router extension
header with the destination address in the basic header. The router also
decrements the addresses left field by one, then forwards the packet.

- Authentication Header

The authentication header is used to ensure that a received packet has not
been altered in transit and that it really came from the claimed sender. The
authentication header is identified by the value 51 in the preceding Next
Header field.

- Encapsulating Security Payload

The Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) is a special extension header, in that
it can appear anywhere in a packet between the basic header and the upper
layer protocol. All data following the ESP header is encrypted.

- Destination Options Header

This has the same format as the Hop-by-Hop header, but it is only examined by
the destination node(s). Normally the destination options are only intended
for the final destination only and the destination options header will be
immediately before the upper layer header. However, destination options can
also be intended for intermediate nodes, in which case they must precede a
routing header. A single packet may therefore include two destination options
headers. Currently, only the Pad1 and PadN types of options are specified for
this header.

The value for the preceding Next Header field is 60.

- IPv6 Addressing

The IPv6 address model is specified in  RFC 2373 * IP Version 6 Addressing
Architecture. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address instead of the 32-bit address of
IPv4.

That theoretically allows for as many as
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses. Even when
used with the same efficiency as today's IPv4 address space, that would still
allow for 50,000 addresses per square meter of land on Earth.

IPv6 addresses are represented in the form of eight hexadecimal numbers
divided by colons, for example:

FE8≡:≡≡≡≡:≡≡≡≡:≡≡≡≡:≡≡≡1:≡8≡≡:23e7:f5db

To shorten the notation of addresses, leading zeroes in any of the groups can be
omitted, for example:

FE8≡:≡:≡:≡:1:8≡≡:23e7:f5db

Finally, a group of all zeroes, or consecutive groups of all zeroes, can be
substituted by a double colon, for example:

FE8≡::1:8≡≡:23e7:f5db

Note:  The double colon shortcut can be 0sed only once in the notation of an
IPv6 address. If there are more groups of all zeroes that are not consecutive,
only one may be substituted by the double colon; the others would have to be
noted as 0.

The IPv6 address space is organized using format prefixes, similar to
telephone country and area codes, that logically divide it in the form of a
tree so that a route from one network to another can easily be found.

- Unicast Address

A unicast address is an identifier assigned to a single interface. Packets
sent to that address will only be delivered to that interface. Special purpose
unicast addresses are defined as follows:

Loopback address (::1) This address is assigned to a virtual interface over
which a host can send packets only to itself. It is equivalent to the IPv4
loopback address 127.0.0.1.

Unspecified address (::) This address is used as a source address by hosts
while performing autoconfiguration. It is equivalent to the IPv4 unspecified
address 0.0.0.0.

IPv4-compatible address (::&lt;IPv4_address>) Addresses of this kind are used
when IPv6 traffic needs to be tunneled across existing IPv4 networks. The
endpoint of such tunnels can be either hosts (automatic tunneling) or routers
(configured tunneling).

IPv4-compatible addresses are formed by placing 96 bits of zero in front of a
valid 32-bit IPv4 address. For example, the address 1.2.3.4 (hex 01.02.03.04)
becomes ::0102:0304

IPv4-mapped address (::FFFF:&lt;IPv4_address>) Addresses of this kind are used
when an IPv6 host needs to communicate with an IPv4 host. This requires a dual
stack host or router for header translations. For example, if an IPv6 node
wishes to send data to host with an IPv4 address of 1.2.3.4, it uses a
destination address of ::FFFF:0102:0304.

Link-local address Addresses of this kind can be used only on the physical
network that a host's interface is attached to. Site-local address Addresses
of this kind cannot be routed into the Internet. They are the equivalent of
IPv4 networks for private use (10.0.0.0, 176.16.0.0-176.31.0.0,
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.0).

- Global Unicast Address Format

The Global Unicast address format, as specified in  RFC 2374 * An IPv6
Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format is expected to become the
predominant format used for IPv6 nodes connected to the Internet. The
aggregatable address can be split into three sections that relate to the
three-level hierarchy of the Internet, namely:

Public Topology Providers and exchanges that provide public Internet transit
services.

Site Topology Local to an organization that does not provide public transit
service to nodes outside of the site.  Interface Identifiers Identify
interfaces on links.


- Multicast Address

A multicast address is an identifier assigned to a set of interfaces on
multiple hosts. Packets sent to that address will be delivered to all
interfaces corresponding to that address.

- Anycast Address

An anycast address is a special type of unicast address that is assigned to
interfaces on multiple hosts. Packets sent to such an address will be
delivered to the nearest interface with that address. Routers determine the
nearest interface based upon their definition of distance, for example hops in
case of RIP or link state in case of OSPF.

Anycast addresses use the same format as unicast addresses and are
undistinguishable from them. However, a node that has been assigned an anycast
address must be configured to be aware of this fact.

RFC 2373 currently specifies the following restrictions on anycast addresses:

* An anycast address must not be used as the source address of a packet.
* Any anycast address may only be assigned to a router

A special anycast address, the  subnet-router address, is predefined. This
address consists of the subnet prefix for a particular subnet followed by
trailing zeroes. This address may be used when a node needs to contact a
router on a particular subnet and it does not matter which router is reached
(for example, when a mobile node needs to communicate with one of the
mobile agents on its *home* subnet).

- Priority

The 4-bit priority field allows applications to specify a certain priority for
the traffic they generate thus introducing the concept of  Class of Service.

IPv4-based routers normally treat all traffic equal, whereas IPv6-based routers
now must act on such prioritized packets in the following way:

1. For priorities 0 to 7, start dropping packets when the network becomes
   congested (congestion-controlled).

2. For priorities 8 to 15, try to forward packets even when the network is
   becoming congested by dropping packets with lower priority
   (noncongestion-controlled). Real-time applications would opt for this range
   of priority.

- Flow Labels

IPv6 introduces the concept of a  flow, which is a series of related packets
from a source to a destination that requires a particular type of handling by
the intervening routers, for example real-time service. The nature of that
handling can either be conveyed by options attached to the datagrams (that is,
by using the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options header) or by a separate protocol (such
as resource reservation protocol. 

The handling requirement for a particular flow label is known as the state
information; this is cached at the router. When packets with a known flow
label arrive at the router, the router can efficiently decide how to route and
forward the packets without having to examine the rest of the header for each
packet.

There may be multiple active flows between a source and a destination, as well
as traffic that is not associated with any flow. Each flow is distinctly
labelled by the 24-bit flow label field in the IPv6 packet. 

Now the big question, how is this all going to work?

- Internet Transition - Migrating from IPv4 to IPv6

If the Internet is to realize the benefits of IPv6, then a period of
transition will be necessary when new IPv6 hosts and routers will need to be
deployed alongside existing IPv4 systems. Routing Aspects of IPv6 Transition
define a number of mechanisms to be employed to ensure both compatibility
between old and new systems and a gradual transition that does not impact the
functionality of the Internet. These techniques are sometimes collectively
termed  Simple Internet Transition (SIT). The transition employs the following
techniques:

* Dual-stack IP implementations for hosts and routers that must interoperate
  between IPv4 and IPv6.

* Imbedding of IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses.

  IPv6 hosts will be assigned addresses that are interoperable with IPv4, and
  IPv4 host addresses will be mapped to IPv6.

* IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms for carrying IPv6 packets across IPv4
  router networks.

* IPv4/IPv6 header translation.

  This technique is intended for use when implementation of IPv6 is well
  advanced and only a few IPv4-only systems remain.

  The techniques are also adaptable to other protocols, notably Novell IPX,
  which has similar internetwork layer semantics and an addressing scheme which
  can be mapped easily to a part of the IPv6 address space.

- Dual IP Stack Implementation - The IPv6/IPv4 Node

The simplest way to ensure that a new IPv6 node maintains compatibility with
existing IPv4 systems is to provide a dual IP stack implementation. An
IPv6/IPv4 node can send and receive either IPv6 packets or IPv4 datagrams,
depending on the type of system with which it is communicating. The node will
have both a 128-bit IPv6 address and a 32-bit IPv4 address, which do not
necessarily need to be related.

The IPv6/IPv4 node may use stateless or stateful autoconfiguration to obtain
its IPv6 address. It may also use any method to obtain its IPv4 address, such
as DHCP, BOOTP or manual configuration. However, if the node is to perform
automatic tunneling, then the IPv6 address must be an IPv4-compatible address,
with the low order 32-bits of the address serving as the IPv4 address.

Conceptually, the dual stack model envisages a doubling-up of the protocols in
the internetwork layer only. However, related changes are obviously needed in
all transport-layer protocols to operate using either stack, and possibly in
applications if they are to exploit IPv6 capabilities, such as longer
addresses.

When an IPv6/IPv4 node wishes to communicate with another system, it needs to
know the capabilities of that system and which type of packet it should send.
The DNS plays a key role here.

A new resource record type, AAAA, is defined for mapping hostnames to IPv6
addresses. The results of a name server lookup determine how a node will
attempt to communicate with that system. The records found in the DNS for a
node depend on which protocols it is running.

* IPv4-only nodes have only A records containing IPv4 addresses in the DNS.

* IPv6/IPv4 nodes that can interoperate with IPv4-only nodes have AAAA records
  containing IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses and A records containing the
  equivalent IPv4 addresses.

* IPv6-only nodes that cannot interoperate with IPv4-only nodes have only AAAA
  records containing IPv6 addresses.

Because IPv6/IPv4 nodes make decisions about which protocols to use based on
the information returned by the DNS, the incorporation of AAAA records in the
DNS is a prerequisite to interoperability between IPv6 and IPv4 systems. Note
that name servers do not necessarily need to use an IPv6-capable protocol
stack, but they must support the additional record type.

- Tunneling

When IPv6 or IPv6/IPv4 systems are separated from other similar systems, with
which they wish to communicate, by older IPv4 networks, then IPv6 packets must
be tunneled through the IPv4 network.

IPv6 packets are tunnelled over IPv4 very simply; the IPv6 packet is
encapsulated in an IPv4 datagram, or in other words, a complete IPv4 header is
added to the IPv6 packet. The presence of the IPv6 packet within the IPv4
datagram is indicated by a Protocol value of 41 in the IPv4 header.

There are two kinds of tunneling of IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks:
automatic and configured.

- Automatic Tunneling

Automatic tunneling relies on IPv4-compatible addresses. The decision on when
to tunnel is made by an IPv6/IPv4 host that has a packet to send across an
IPv4-routed network area, and it follows the following rules:

* If the destination is an IPv4 or an IPv4-mapped address, send the packet
  using IPv4 because the recipient is not IPv6-capable.

Otherwise:

* If the destination is on the same subnet, send it using IPv6 because the
  recipient is IPv6-capable.

* If the destination is not on the same subnet but there is at least one
  default router on the subnet that is IPv6-capable, or there is a route
  configured to an IPv6 router for that destination, then send it to that
  router using IPv6.

Otherwise:

* If the address is an IPv4-compatible address, send the packet using
  automatic IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling.

Otherwise:

* The destination is a node with an IPv6-only address that is connected via
  an IPv4-routed area, which is not also IPv6-routed. Therefore, the
  destination is unreachable.

The rules listed above emphasize the use of an IPv6 router in preference to a
tunnel for three reasons:

* There is less overhead because there is no encapsulating IPv4 header.

* IPv6-only features are available.

* The IPv6 routing topology will be used when it is deployed in preference to
  the pre-existing IPv4 topology.

A node does not need to know whether it is attached to an IPv6-routed or an
IPv4-routed area; it will always use an IPv6 router if one is configured on
its subnet and will use tunneling if one is not (in which case it can infer
that it is attached to an IPv4-routed area).

Automatic tunneling may be either host-to-host, or it may be router-to-host. A
source host will send an IPv6 packet to an IPv6 router if possible, but that
router may not be able to do the same, and will have to perform automatic
tunneling to the destination host itself. Because of the preference for the
use of IPv6 routers rather than tunneling, the tunnel will always be as
*short* as possible. However, the tunnel will always extend all of the way to
the destination host; because IPv6 uses the same hop-by-hop routing paradigm,
a host cannot determine if the packet will eventually emerge into an
IPv6-complete area before it reaches the destination host. In order to use a
tunnel that does not extend all of the way to the recipient, configured
tunneling must be used.

The mechanism used for automatic tunneling is very simple.

* The encapsulating IPv4 datagram uses the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6
  source and destination addresses to create the equivalent IPv4 addresses and
  sets the protocol number to 41 (IPv6).

* The receiving node's network interface layer identifies the incoming packets
  (or packets if the IPv4 datagram was fragmented) as belonging to IPv4 and
  passes them upwards to the IPv4 part of the dual IPv6/IPv4 internetwork
  layer.

* The IPv4 layer then receives the datagram in the normal way, re-assembling
  fragments if necessary, notes the protocol number of 41, then removes the
  IPv4 header and passes the original IPv6 packet *sideways* to the IPv6 part
  of the internetwork layer.

* The IPv6 code then processes the original packet as normal. Since the
  destination IPv6 address in the packet is the IPv6 address of the node (an
  IPv4-compatible address matching the IPv4 address used in the encapsulating
  IPv4 datagram) the packet is at its final destination. IPv6 then processes
  any extension headers as normal and then passes the packet's remaining
  payload to the next protocol listed in the last IPv6 header.

A theroy of two IPv6/IPv4 nodes separated by an IPv4 network. Both
workstations have IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses. Workstation A sends a packet
to workstation B, as follows:

1. Workstation A has received router solicitation messages from an
IPv6-capable router (X) on its local link. It forwards the packet to this
router.

2. Router X adds an IPv4 header to the packet, using IPv4 source and
destination addresses derived from the IPv4-compatible addresses. The packet
is then forwarded across the IPv4 network, all the way to workstation B. This
is router-to-host automatic tunneling.

3. The IPv4 datagram is received by the IPv4 stack of workstation B. As the
Protocol field shows that the next header is 41 (IPv6), the IPv4 header is
stripped from the datagram and the remaining IPv6 packet is then handled by
the IPv6 stack.

Workstation B responds as follows:

1. Workstation B has no IPv6-capable router on its local link. It therefore
adds an IPv4 header to its own IPv6 frame and forwards the resulting IPv4
datagram directly to the IPv4 address of workstation A via the IPv4 network.
This is host-to-host automatic tunneling.

2. The IPv4 datagram is received by the IPv4 stack of workstation A. As the
Protocol field shows that the next header is 41 (IPv6), the IPv4 header is
stripped from the datagram and the remaining IPv6 packet is then handled by
the IPv6 stack.

- Configured Tunneling

Configured tunneling is used for host-router or router-router tunneling of
IPv6-over-IPv4. The sending host or the forwarding router is configured so
that the route, as well as having a next hop, also has a  tunnel end address
(which is always an IPv4-compatible address). The process of encapsulation is
the same as for automatic tunneling except that the IPv4 destination address
is not derived from the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 destination address, but
from the low-order 32 bits of the tunnel end. The IPv6 destination and source
addresses  do not need to be IPv4-compatible addresses in this case.

When the router at the end of the tunnel receives the IPv4 datagram, it
processes it in exactly the same way as a node at the end of an automatic
tunnel. When the original IPv6 packet is passed to the IPv6 layer in the
router, it recognizes that it is not the destination, and the router forwards
the packet on to the final destination as it would for any other IPv6 packet.

It is, of course, possible that after emerging from the tunnel, the IPv6
packet is tunnelled again by another router.

Another theory of two IPv6-only nodes separated by an IPv4 network. A
router-to-router tunnel is configured between the two IPv6/IPv4 routers X and
Y.

1. Workstation A constructs an IPv6 packet to send to workstation B. It
forwards the packet to the IPv6 router advertising on its local link (X).

2. Router X receives the packet, but has no direct IPv6 connection to the
destination subnet. However, a tunnel has been configured for this subnet.
The router therefore adds an IPv4 header to the packet, with a destination
address of the tunnel-end (router Y) and forwards the datagram over the IPv4
network.

3. The IPv4 stack of router Y receives the frame. Seeing the Protocol field
value of 41, it removes the IPv4 header, and passes the remaining IPv6 packet
to its IPv6 stack. The IPv6 stack reads the destination IPv6 address, and
forwards the packet.

4. Workstation B receives the IP6 packet.

- Header Translation

Installing IPv6/IPv4 nodes allows for backward compatibility with existing
IPv4 systems. However, when migration of networks to IPv6 reaches an advanced
stage, it is likely that new systems being installed will be IPv6 only. There
will therefore be a requirement for IPv6-only systems to communicate with the
remaining IPv4-only systems. Header translation is required for IPv6-only nodes
to interoperate with IPv4-only nodes. Header translation is performed by
IPv6/IPv4 routers on the boundaries between IPv6 routed areas and IPv4 routed
areas.

The translating router strips the header completely from IPv6 packets and
replaces it with an equivalent IPv4 header (or the reverse). In addition to
correctly mapping between the fields in the two headers, the router must
convert source and destination addresses from IPv4-mapped addresses to real
IPv4 addresses (by taking the low-order 32 bits of the IP address). In the
reverse direction, the router adds the ::FFFF /96 prefix to the IPv4 address
to form the IPv4-mapped address.

If either the source or the destination IPv6 address is IPv6 only, the header
cannot be translated.

Note that for a site with even just one IPv4 host, every IPv6 node with which
it needs to communicate must have an IPv4-mapped address.

- Interoperability Summary

Whether two nodes can interoperate depends upon their capabilities and their
addresses.

An IPv4 node can communicate with:

* Any IPv4 node on the local link
* Any IPv4 node via an IPv4 router
* Any IPv6 node with IPv4-mapped address via a header translator
  
An IPv6 node (IPv6-only address) can communicate with:

* Any IPv6 node on the local link
* Any IPv6 node via an IPv6 router on the local link (may require tunneling
  through IPv4 network from the router)

An IPv6 node (IPv4-mapped address) can communicate with:

* Any IPv6 node on the local link
* Any IPv6 node via an IPv6 router on the local link (may require tunneling
  through IPv4 network from the router)
* Any IPv4 node via a header translator

An IPv6/IPv4 node (IPv4-compatible address) can communicate with:

* Any IPv4 node on the local link
* Any IPv4 node via an IPv4 router on the local link
* Any IPv6 node on the local link
* Any IPv6 node via an IPv6 router on the local link (may require tunneling
  through IPv4 network from the router)
* Any IPv6/IPv4 node (IPv4-compatible address) via host-to-host tunnel

- The Drive Towards IPv6

The drivers for the introduction of IPv6 networks are likely to be
requirements for new facilities that require IPv6, or exhaustion of the IPv4
address space. Which of these is seen as more important will vary between
organizations. For example, commercial organizations with large,
long-established internal IPv4 networks are unlikely to be keen to upgrade
thousands of working IPv4 hosts and routers, unless they have a problem with
the address space within their own networks. They will, however, be likely to
invest in IPv6 deployment if new business-critical applications require
facilities that are only available on IPv6 or if they require connectivity to
other organizations that are using IPv6-only addresses.

Businesses that are implementing IP networks for the first time, however, may
be interested in some of the capabilities of IPv6, such as the address
autoconfiguration. However, anyone thinking of implementing IPv6 today needs
to be aware that the protocol is still, as of today, very much under
development. It may be said that IPv4 is also still under development, as new
RFCs and Internet drafts are constantly being produced, but for IPv6, certain
key protocols, such as DHCP, at time of writing are still at Internet draft
stage only. The Internet backbone today consists of IPv4 routers and, until
such time as the IPv6 protocols have been widely used and tested, the owners
of these production routers are unlikely to put them at risk by upgrading them
to IPv6.

One off-shoot of the IETF IPng (next generation) project was the development
of the 6Bone, which is an Internet-wide IPv6 virtual network, layered on top
of the physical IPv4 Internet. The 6Bone consists of many islands supporting
IPv6 packets, linked by tunnels across the existing IPv4 backbone. The 6Bone
is widely used for testing of IPv6 protocols and products. It is expected
that, as confidence grows in IPv6 and more products with IPv6 capability
become available, the 6Bone will eventually be replaced by a production
backbone of ISP and user network IPv6 capable routers.

Another way that might combat the lack of IP's is the use of IP masquerading,
this is very a very "dirty" way of correcting a problem of this kind.

- IP Masquerading 

**** lock edit aka NAT/PAT

One way to combat an IP address shortage is to avoid assigning addresses in
the first place. Yet without an IP address, no system can communicate on a
TCP/IP network.

IP masquerading allows you to effectively share one IP address among several
different systems while still providing reliable, full function TCP/IP
connections to every host. This technique can be used to provide Internet
service to more than one computer using a single dial-up connection from an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) for example. Or, you may wish to link branch
office systems to your company's network without assigning IP addresses from
your company's main address pool.

In practice, an IP address  is assigned to each host that needs to
communicate on the TCP/IP network, but the addresses are from a private
network pool, such as the Class A network 10. A masquerading gateway accepts
connection requests from these private hosts and translates them into
requests originating from the IP address of the gateway itself. Responses
from the TCP/IP network are then routed by the gateway back to the correct
host on the private network. As a result, a single IP address on a network
can effectively serve several different hosts without requiring additional IP
address assignments on that same network.

There are currently no RFCs or IETF drafts that cover IP masquerading.
However, IP masquerading is implemented in certain routers and is available
for several software platforms.

So, thats generally a run down on IPV6, I might if i have time in the
following months write a few texts on DHCP and DNS using the IPV6 protocol.

7. Token Ring Networks - Slider
                         [slider@0blivion.org]
_____________________________________________

The IBM Token Ring network is a general purpose Local Area Network (LAN) with
a star-wired ring topology, using baseband signalling and token-passing
protocols conforming with IEEE 802.5 standards. Device attachments
conforming with IEEE 802.2 and 802.5 standards may communicate over an IBM
Token Ring network.

The token-passing protocol for ring access control is based on a predefined 24-bit
pattern, called a token, which continuously circulates around the ring.

When a station has data to transmit, it waits until its station adapter receives a
free token (token bit=0). Upon capturing the free token, the station creates a
frame by setting the token bit to 1. It then inserts source and destination
addresses, certain control information and the data to be sent to the destination
station, and starts frame transmission.

During the time the frame is being transmitted, no token is available on the ring
and no other station can initiate a transmission. Thus, collisions on the ring are
avoided. The frame is passed (received, regenerated and retransmitted) from
one station to another on the ring until it is received by a station with a matching
destination address.

The destination station copies the data to its internal buffers, sets control bits to
indicate that it recognized the address and successfully copied the data, and
retransmits the frame.

When the frame returns to the source station following successful transmission
and receipt, it is removed from the ring. The source station creates a new free
token and transmits it on the ring, thereby allowing other stations access. Until
the source station releases a free token, the rest of the stations are unable to
transmit.

To reduce the amount of time a station has to wait for a free token, a function,
known as Early Token Release is available. With Early Token Release, a sending
station releases a free token following frame transmission without waiting for the
transmitted frame to return. This enhances the utilization of the ring by allowing
one token and one or more frames to circulate on the network at the same time.
Token ring has certain important architectural considerations:

-- Token ring frames may contain as many as 17,800 bytes of information, which
  is significantly more than the 1500 bytes of user data in an Ethernet frame. A
  negotiation process is required by token ring stations to determine the
  maximum frame size they can use, but most implementations end up using
  larger frames than Ethernet implementations, which is more efficient when
  transferring large volumes of data.

-- A single token ring may have up to 260 devices connected to it.

-- Timing considerations affect the maximum frame size (only 4472 bytes for a 4
  Mbps ring) and the cable lengths comprising a single ring.

-- Most bridged token ring networks implement source-route bridging. Stations
  that want to communicate with each other across a bridged network first send
  discovery frames through the network to discover the best route. The stations
  then save this routing information and include it in every frame they
  subsequently send. The token ring frame itself contains an indicator bit to
  denote that this source-routing information is present in the frame.

  Source-route bridging is especially useful in SNA networks, because it allows
  multiple paths between two points across the network and also allows
  configuration of duplicate MAC addresses, both of which increase reliability
  and availability of the network. Maybe this has led to the perception that SNA
  and token ring are somehow inextricably linked, but the facts are that:

  	1. Token ring networks can implement transparent bridging; itÆs just less
	   common for them to do so.

        2. Whatever bridging method is used has no direct impact on the layer 3 traffic
           being transported in the frame: SNA, TCP/IP or any other protocol.

-- Hubs which provide active token ring ports can effectively increase the total
  cable length of a single ring because they re-drive and re-synchronize the
  signals on these ports.

-- There are some minor differences between the IEEE 802.5 and the IBM Token
  Ring standards, but for all practical purposes they are identical. IEEE 802.5 is
  the formal standard based on IBMÆs original implementation.

- Token Ring versus Ethernet

There is no simple and objective answer as to which technology is *better*; any
comparisons between token ring and Ethernet end up being emotional and
subjective. The only points which need to be made here are:

1. Shared media token ring copes much better under heavy load than shared
   media Ethernet. As traffic increases, Ethernet performance degrades
   significantly whereas 16 Mbps token ring has been shown to be capable of
   delivering an aggregate data throughput of 15.9 Mbps. The vast majority of
   end users, however, do not themselves require more than 10 Mbps of network
   bandwidth, and a switched Ethernet infrastructure delivering switched 10
   Mbps dedicated bandwidth to each user can meet their needs. What this
   means, though, is that existing 16 Mbps shared token ring users may well be
   able to continue using their existing networks when 10 Mbps shared Ethernet
   users are required to upgrade to switched Ethernet or 100 Mbps Ethernet.

2. Many existing token ring users, most especially those with S/390 mainframes,
   will want to remain with token ring because of its ability to support duplicate
   identical MAC addresses. Duplicate addresses are used on mainframe token
   ring gateways to provide a measure of automatic load-balancing and
   switch-over in the case of failure, which requires the implementation of a
   source-route bridging network which is not normally possible to implement
   with Ethernet LANs.

In its simplest form a single token ring can be viewed as a ring like to
which all network stations attach. The adapters on the network stations
themselves provide the intelligence in the network: an *active monitor* is elected
and then serves to monitor the status of the ring, for example.

-- Unmanaged hubs

The simplest token ring hub does not even have to have a power supply. The
network adapters themselves provide all the intelligence in the network, even to
the extent of determining the ring speed. A complete ring is established by *daisy
chaining* hubs together: a cable connects the *ring out* port of one hub to the
*ring in* port on the next one, with the last hub connecting back to the first one to
complete the ring. A complete ring can be implemented on just one hub since the
ring-in and ring-out ports will be wrapped internally to complete the ring.
Most unmanaged hubs will have a power supply, but this will only serve to
illuminate indicator LEDs in the hub itself.

Even an unmanaged hub such as the 8228 provides some resilience; if a cable
between one hubÆs ring-out port and the next hubÆs ring-in port should break or be
removed, the 8228 will wrap the connection internally and a single ring will be
preserved, although this recovery requires that both ends of the failing cable be
removed from the hubs manually.

-- Managed hubs

Managed hubs differ from unmanaged hubs in two ways:

1. Their configuration can be specified and changed from a management station.
2. They report status and error indications to the management station.

-- Bridges

The original bridge definition for the token ring was for a source routing bridge.
This differs from the transparent bridge operation normally seen on Ethernet
networks; transparent bridge operation requires that the bridges maintain tables
of MAC addresses whereas in source routing each frame carries information
about the route it is to follow through the network. In a source routing
environment, this routing information is acquired through a search process that
originates at the source station, using commands such as TEST or XID
(Exchange ID).

Source-route bridging allows the configuration of parallel bridge paths through
the network, which has to be blocked in a transparent bridging environment. It
allows for multiple (redundant) routes through a network, with automatic
discovery of the quickest path through the network without the necessity of
maintaining a record of network topology (which may change rapidly requiring
extensive updates). There are several ways that this route discovery process can
proceed, and the following paragraphs describe two of these methods.

Consider a set of interconnected (bridged) token rings where node S1 is ready
to transmit a series of messages (or set up a session with) to node S2 (which may be
in another city or another country). The location of the ring that includes S2 as well
as the interconnections of the various rings are initially unknown to S1.

In the first method, S1 will send an ARB (All Routes Broadcast) frame to S2. This
frame or frames will cross all available bridges in the network on the way to S2
(unless the *hop count* expires), thus exploring all possible routes between the
two nodes. It is perfectly acceptable to have two bridges actively forwarding
frames from any source ring to the same destination ring simultaneously because
the bridges will have different bridge numbers assigned (1 and 2 in our example).

While doing this, each frame records its route in the Routing Information Fields
included in the 802.5 frame header. (Each RIF contains a source ring number,
bridge number, and destination ring number). Upon receiving each frame, S2 will
send a specific unicast reply back to S1 with a bit set in the header indicating that
the RIF route is to be inverted (traveled backwards). Now, this is where it gets
interesting! S1 will receive these replies and discard all but the first (which, by
definition, is the one that won the race and which has traversed the quickest and
most optimal path through the network). It can then use the routing information
stored in the RIFs for future messages to that destination (generally for the
duration of the session). It has found the most efficient path through the network
without having to be aware of its topology.

In the second method, S1 can send an SRB (Single Route Broadcast) frame to
S2. This frame crosses only a designated set of bridges (only bridge 1 in our
simple example) resulting in only one copy of the frame appearing on any given
ring in the network. When the SRB frame gets to S2, S2 will reply using ARB,
which will generate multiple frames (with the route inverted) which will explore all
of the possible return paths, with the first frame returning to S1 again being the
fastest. The result is the same - the source node has discovered the most
efficient path between itself and the desired destination node without having to
know where it is or how the network was set up (or changed).

Source-route bridges still require the configuration of a spanning tree, which
represents the network topology, in order to handle single-route broadcast
frames. This will normally be handled by having the bridges communicate with
each other and dynamically maintain a single-route broadcast path through the
network, just as is normally the case with transparent bridges. Many broadcasts
in a token ring environment are all-routes broadcast frames, which will be
forwarded by all bridges without consideration of spanning tree topology. If
appropriate, as an alternative to implementing any kind of spanning tree
configuration, bridges can be configured simply to discard single-route broadcast
frames. Bridges need to be configured with a bridge number which has to be a
unique number for the rings to which it attaches; ring numbers also need to be
defined and are usually configured in one or more of the bridges as well.

-- Priority and class of service

Token ring implements access priority by including three bits of priority
information in every token or LAN frame. A ring station can transmit a frame of a
given priority using an available token with a priority less than or equal to that of
the frame. If no token is available (because another station is transmitting data)
then the ring station may reserve a token of the required priority by setting bits in
a passing frame. The next free token will then be sent at that priority and will not
be used by any other ring station, allowing our station to transmit a frame at the
required priority. Two stations may not make a reservation for the same priority
value, but a station may make a higher-level priority reservation than another
stationÆs existing priority reservation and effectively pre-empt it.

Token ring access priority relates to two emerging and complementary layer 2
standards which can be implemented in a bridged environment:

a. 802.1p, which is a component of the 802.1D standard for LAN bridges. 802.1p
implements a priority queueing mechanism inside a LAN bridge which allows
certain LAN frames to be given higher forwarding and transmission priority
than other LAN frames. The access priority in a received token ring frame may
be mapped to an internal priority value inside the LAN bridge, and could be
used - for example - to allow voice traffic to *overtake* data traffic inside a
bridge.

b. 802.1Q, which provides the ability of all LAN media to include user priority
information as part of the MAC frame. So a translational bridge could map
token ring access priority in received frames into a priority marking for frames
transmitted over Ethernet using 802.1Q.

For more information on these two standards, see Application-Driven Networking:
Class of Service in IP, Ethernet, and ATM Networks, SG24-5384.

On the face of it, this priority value seems to map nicely to the 802.1Q standard
for LAN frames. 802.1Q adds 3 bits of priority information to a LAN frame, and a
related standard (802.3ac) allows the maximum frame size for Ethernet frames to
be increased to allow the addition of this information without the need to reduce
the data payload in the frame. So a growing implementation and use of 802.1Q
(such as in Windows 98 and Windows 2000) even on Ethernet networks might
seem to allow the priority indication in the LAN frame to map directly to this
access priority on token ring.

In reality, things are not quite as simple. The default action of most token ring
bridges and switches is to forward user frames with an access priority value of
xÆ100Æ, and the highest value, xÆ111Æ, is reserved for vital network management
frames such as *Active Monitor Present* frames. Although the two next higher
values of access priority, xÆ101Æ and xÆ110Æ, are described as *reserved* by IBM,
these are in fact the values which need to be used for more important traffic such
as mission-critical data traffic and voice traffic.

What this means, though, is that the token ring access priority can be used to
differentiate between different types of user traffic, which can be placed in
separate transmission queues by token ring devices including bridges which
implement 802.1p along the following lines:

	Prority		bits Traffic type
       +----------+------------------------------------------------------------+
	xÆ000Æ 		Normal data traffic
	xÆ001Æ 		Not used
	xÆ010Æ 		Not used
	xÆ011Æ 		Not used
	xÆ100Æ 		Normal data traffic forwarded by bridges and switches
	xÆ101Æ 		Time-sensitive data traffic (SNA traffic perhaps)
	xÆ110Æ 		Real-time critical traffic (voice traffic, for example)
	xÆ111Æ 		Station management
       +----------+------------------------------------------------------------+

In order to support this sort of quality of service mechanism, LAN bridges and
switches need to support both the following IEEE standards:

- 802.1Q to preserve packet priority values across the entire network
- 802.1p to implement multiple transmission queues to enable higher priority
  packets to be sent ahead of normal priority packets during congestion

Neither of these standards is required to implement *class of service* on a
hop-by-hop basis, and this function is implemented for IP traffic by IBM token ring
adapters.

The use of token ring access priority in this way is just not possible on Ethernet
LANs where all stations contend equally for use of the shared medium. 802.1Q
provides a means of indicating a frameÆs priority across the entire network but
plays no part in prioritizing the transmission of LAN frames over a single LAN
segment; this is something only token ring can do.

-- Switched networks

Switched LAN networks are implemented by LAN switches in which traffic is not
sent to all stations which attach to each port in the switch. LAN switches learn
MAC addresses in much the same way as transparent bridges do, and use this
information to transmit specifically-addressed LAN frames to only those ports
over which it is necessary to transmit them. LAN switches do have to transmit
broadcast frames (those with MAC address *FFFF FFFF FFFF*) over all ports.

LAN switches originated in the Ethernet world, where there was the greatest need
to increase network capacity coupled with the relative simplicity of the Ethernet
design. Now LAN switches also exist for token ring networks.

-- Backbone, workgroup, desktop

On one level, LAN switches are translational bridges, and they can be used in the
same way as bridges to segment a single token ring LAN into multiple LAN
segments. One way in which switches differ from bridges is that they can operate
in *cut through* mode, in which a LAN frame is being transmitted on an outbound
port before it has been received on an inbound port. Bridges need to receive a
frame in its entirety before re-transmitting it, but this does have the advantage
that the frame check sequence (FCS) at the end of the received frame can be
verified. If the FCS is found not to match the frame itself, the bridge will discard
the frame. The switch which doesnÆt check FCS will needlessly transmit a
corrupted frame, wasting network bandwidth; at some point further in the network
the FCS will be checked and the frame will ultimately be discarded anyway.
Because of the reduction of traffic on each port of a LAN switch, the ultimate
design point is to have end stations themselves directly attached to a switch.

Under these circumstances there is little contention for use of the connection: the
only traffic apart from broadcast traffic flowing between the end station and the
switch is real traffic to or from the end station itself.

Because of the extra cost and implementation effort/disruption, a mid-point in a
network designed around LAN switches will be on in which the important servers
in the network are connected directly to the LAN switches but the less demanding
end users will continue to connect to shared LAN hubs.

-- Full-duplex dedicated Token Ring

If an end station is directly connected to a LAN switch in an Ethernet network, it
knows that no other end stations will be attempting to use the connection and it
therefore no longer has to attempt to detect their presence before transmitting
data as it would have to do in a shared hub environment. It also allows the switch
and end station to *break the rules* and implement a full-duplex connection
where both devices can be transmitting data to each other simultaneously. This is
not permitted in a shared Ethernet environment.

Token ring is different, but a similar enhancement is possible by the use of
dedicated token ring (DTR) connections.

In the standard RJ-45 token ring implementation (*Classic Token Ring* or CTR) a
connection between a device and a hub/switch is made with two twisted pairs of
wires. Although one pair is used for the receipt of data and the other used for the
transmission of data, the standard token-passing protocol (TKP) means that
these will never happen simultaneously: a token or frame will first be received by
the station and then a token or frame will be transmitted around the ring.

DTR provides a dedicated connection between end station and switch, but TKP
can still be used over it, in which case tokens and frames flow over a two-port
LAN. Little advantage has been gained here, but this mode of operation is
required in DTR devices for downward compatibility. Of significant advantage,
however, is the TKI (Transmit Immediate Access) protocol, where tokens are no
longer used and both devices can transmit at will.

The use of TKI allows two DTR stations to transmit and receive in *full duplex*
mode, which doubles the bandwidth available to them to 32 Mbps. Of course, this
means that 16 Mbps of bandwidth is simultaneously available in both directions
and not that 32 Mbps is available in any one direction.

Unlike Ethernet adapters, most token ring adapters can be configured for DTR
operation with, at most, a microcode upgrade. It offers a significant upgrade to
network servers.

-- ATM, MSS, MPOA

ATM can be used as a high-speed backbone connection between token ring
switches, typically using a 155 Mbps up-link from the switch and defining an
emulated token ring LAN across the ATM network. IBMÆs Multiprotocol Switched
Services (MSS) Server can be used to define the emulated LAN, and
Multiprotocol Over ATM (MPOA) provides one way of defining and using short-cut
direct connections across complex ATM networks.

- Higher speeds

What technologies exist and are under development for the transport of token ring
traffic at speeds greater than 16 Mbps?

-- 100 Mbps and gigabit Token Ring

IBM continues to chair the IEEE 802.5 committee in the development and
ratification of token ring standards. In particular, the committee developed the
802.5t standard for 100 Mbps token ring, which is now an approved IEEE
standard. The 802.5v standard for gigabit token ring is going through the final
balloting stages (as of March 2000), and should be approved as a standard by
July 2000. The purpose of these standards is to ensure interoperability between
different vendorsÆ high speed token ring implementations. IBM supports 100
Mbps token ring on its 100/16/4 PCI adapter.

IBM does not view high-speed token ring as a requirement for the majority of its
customers, and therefore the decision has been made not to provide 100 Mbps
high-speed token ring uplinks on its products - primarily the 8270 token ring
switch. That is not to say, however, that IBM does not provide high-speed uplinks
at all; the rest of this paper will serve to describe how FasTR, TokenPipe and ATM
can each be used to provide 100 Mbps or faster uplinks from IBMÆs token ring
switch. High-speed server attachment can be made using one or more dedicated
token ring connections between a server and LAN switch, each offering 32 Mbps
of full-duplex network bandwidth.

More information on high-speed token ring can be found at the Web site of the
High-Speed Token Ring Alliance, http://www.hstra.com.

- FasTR

FasTR is a special name for a special implementation; itÆs a form of high-speed
token ring which is actually implemented using ATM adapters on the 2216 router,
the 8270-800 switch, the 3-slot 8272 blade in the 8260 hub and the Multiaccess
Enclosure (MAE) inside the 3746-9x0.

FasTR encapsulates the token ring frames using ATM AAL5; it is intended to be
used without the use of any actual ATM network but simply as a point-to-point link
using singlemode or multimode fiber between two devices. It can be established
using an ATM permanent virtual circuit (PVC) but in all likelihood it would not
make much sense to do so; if thereÆs really an ATM network then the adapters
should be configured as real ATM adapters and not as FasTR adapters.

FasTR can be used to relieve congestion in a token ring backbone connection to
a mainframe server. It is configured as a token ring to the devices which support
it. Tests have shown throughput of greater than 100 Mbps using 4,000-byte
packets.

FasTR is actually supported on two basic adapters only: the MSS Client UFC for
the 8270-800 and the 8272 blade, and the ATM-155 adapter for the 2216 and
MAE.

The devices which support FasTR can simply be used for source-route bridging,
or they can configure themselves as IP routers and use it as a fast router-router
link. In addition, the 2216 and MAE can route APPN traffic over FasTR links.

-- TokenPipe

A TokenPipe is another type of high-speed backbone connection between token
ring switches; it is a collection or bundle of between 2 and 4 connections between
two token ring switches.

Each of the connections in a token-pipe is a 16 Mbps connection and is capable
of operating as full-duplex (DTR, TKI). This gives a theoretical maximum capacity
of a TokenPipe of 128 Mbps (16 x 2 x 4).

The ports in a TokenPipe should be configured in ascending order of the actual
port number on the switch; the lowest-numbered port is known as the primary
port and is used for transmission of all broadcast frames and spanning-tree
frames.

Traffic on any one connection between devices on separate token ring switches
which are connected using TokenPipe will flow on just one of the links which
comprise the TokenPipe. The switch will use its internal table of MAC addresses
to assign each target address to one of the TokenPipe links, but it will assign
many addresses in a round-robin or similar fashion to achieve load balancing
across the set of links.

If a single link configured as part of a TokenPipe should be disconnected or fail
for any reason, the entire TokenPipe is made inoperable.

-- Load balancing

Other solutions for higher speed token ring connectivity include load balancing
between multiple token ring LAN adapters. This approach is one that should not
be undertaken lightly: there are many complications possible using multiple LAN
adapters connecting to the same switch or backbone LAN segment. One possible
approach would be to configure multiple LAN adapters with different IP addresses
and use layer 3 load balancing techniques such as OSPF equal-cost multipath to
spread the load across multiple LAN adapters; this requires some kind of OSPF
*gated* implementation in the machine. Multiple LAN adapters can cause
problems in NetBIOS environments because of the requirement for a computerÆs
name to be unique in a network.

Load balancing approaches are fraught with danger and can often, at best, lead
to a configuration in which only one LAN adapter is used for the significant
majority of network traffic anyway.

- Network management

Network management is essentially concerned with two issues: the remote
configuration and monitoring of network-attached devices. The first network
management implementations were used to control the building blocks of the
network: the hubs, bridges and routers. Specific users could be permitted or
denied access at specified times of day or days of the week, but this was
accomplished by configuring the network devices themselves. Network devices
reported faults and errors back to a management station to improve problem
determination in complex network environments. More recently, distributed
intelligence has been provided in workstations themselves, not just in complex
servers but in more basic PCs, to the extent that a PC can report the removal of
its cover or a basic hardware fault. This increases the controllability and
manageability of the total network environment.

-- Overview

Network management relies on standard protocols and architectures for the
creation and transmission of network management information. In essence,
network devices and network management stations communicate using standard
LAN packets conforming to different specifications.

--- CMOL

CMOL stands for Common Management Information Protocol over LLC (or CMIP
over LLC) and is an OSI standard for the transport of network management
information. It was much favored in the public telecommunications carrier
environment and provides a rich set of management functions; it was originally
used by IBM to provide network management of the 8230 Controlled Access Unit.
The management station for the 8230 was typically an OS/2 workstation running
LAN Network Manager for OS/2, and many customer 8230 installations continue
to run this today.

The 8230 uses one of its internal MAC addresses as the source address for
network management communication to the network management station, and
hence CMOL information flows at the layer 2 level, using MAC addresses across
a bridged LAN environment. The related CMOT (CMIP over TCP/IP) standard
allows this information to be transported using layer 3 IP packets, but this is not
implemented by the 8230.

--- SNMP

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) grew up in much the same
way as the rest of the TCP/IP protocol stack: rather than being designed by
committee and providing a rich set of functions it grew up as a pragmatic
implementation based on what was really required in the network. SNMP has
since grown to be the effective industry standard for management of network
devices, and provides a relatively simple *vocabulary* of commands which
effectively comprises just three - the ability to SET commands on the remote
device, the ability to GET information from the remote device and the ability of the
remote device to send unsolicited TRAPs alerting the network management
station of status changes and problems in the network.

Most hubs, bridges, routers and similar devices in networks today offer the
capability of being managed using SNMP, which requires them to be configured
with an internal IP address (if they donÆt already have one) and requires IP
connectivity between the device and the management station. Even the 8230 now
offers this capability, selected by a switch on the front of the base unit.

--- RMON

Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) is concerned with the implementation of
probes which can be used to troubleshoot and monitor remote LANs. RMON
probes are typically accessed across the network using IP protocols and allow
the retrieval of status information - percentage utilization, for example - rather
than the application of configuration information and retrieval of error information.
So RMON serves a separate purpose to both SNMP and CMOL/CMOT and both
would normally be expected to operate in parallel.

--- DMI

The Desktop Management Interface standard is concerned with the monitoring
and retrieval of status and error information from workstations. It serves much the
same purpose as either SNMP or CMOL/CMOT but usually applies to a different
set of network devices - user workstations themselves rather than the building
blocks of the network.

- TCP/IP and SNA

There has always been a perception that the SNA networking protocol is in some
way linked to the token ring LAN medium. This probably comes about because
SNA and token ring were both developed by IBM. It is also true that most large
SNA networking customers tend to use token ring, in the data center at least, and
there are certain features inherent in token ring which are specifically used in
token ring environments: the efficiencies of transporting large frames and the
resilience of duplicate MAC addresses coupled with source-route bridging.

The problem with this perception is that the assumption is sometimes made that
because token ring is somehow good for SNA traffic that it is also somehow bad
for IP traffic. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Indeed, IBM has made many innovations and enhancements, specifically for
TCP/IP, which apply to the token ring environment just as for any other. Route
switching allows token ring devices to establish shortcuts to increase IP
throughput. Token ring devices are monitored and managed using IP protocols.

Indeed, some of the advantages of token ring can be used to the advantage of IP
traffic: *CoS for IP* allows the marking of important IP traffic with higher
transmission priority than other IP traffic in a way which is just not possible using
Ethernet. Almost nothing described in this paper on token ring applies exclusively
to SNA traffic or, indeed to any other layer 3 protocol. Customers with existing
token ring networks are going to want to continue using it as their layer 2
transport mechanism of choice for all network traffic.

- Conclusion

Token ring is not about to be overtaken and superseded by other technologies
such as high-speed Ethernet and ATM, primarily due to the fact that token ring
has delivered a reliable and stable infrastructure for many years and will continue
to do so in the future. Many customers are not going to replace their token ring
infrastructures simply because it may be fashionable: they realize that their
investment in token ring is capable of catering to their networking needs for years
to come. Token ring offers significant architectural advantages and in many cases
significant improvements to existing token ring infrastructures can be made by
microcode updates and replacement of key network components rather than by
wholesale replacement of the entire network. As an example, key bottlenecks in
token ring networks can be eliminated by replacing a few hubs with switches and
by leaving the rest of the network unchanged.

8. Understanding System Daemons - Spyderco Psyops
                                  [psyops@scientist.com]
_______________________________________________________

Introduction.

The most secretive, yet most productive, application or service on a Unix
system is the daemon process. A daemon, pronounced 'demon,' process is
secretive because it runs in the background, and often does not indicate its
presence in any significant way. Without it, most Unix systems  would cease to
function. Programmers write daemons to carry out a function with little or no
intervention by users or system administrators. In fact, many daemons require
no intervention at all!

The services offered by daemon processes are important to understand, because
the potential security violation may be through a program that masquarades as
a daemon.

What is a daemon?

A daemon process is a process that is not associated with a user, but performs
system-wide functions, such as administration and control, network services,
execution of time-dependent activities, and print services. To qualify as a
daemon process, several criteria must be met: the process must not be
associated with a user's terminal session; and it must continue after the user
logs off.

From the rudimentary process management knowledge you have read about so far,
you know that each process a user starts is terminated by the init program
when the user exits. The init program is the most famous of all system
daemons. This approach allows for proper management of the process table.

Although daemon processes are almost completely invisible, they do provide
some level of service to users. Daemon processes accept user requests and
process them; they also respond to various events and conditions. They are
often inactive, however, and are designed to be called into service only when
required. By using a daemon instead of starting a new process for every
instance, system load is reduced, and large programs that take time to get
started will not slow down the user or the operation.

A daemon can be distinguished from other programs on the system by examining
the process table--the ps command displays this table. The distinguishing
characteristic of a daemon is that the TTY column does not reflect the
controlling terminal name.

The daemon is the process with a questions mark "?" as the controlling
terminal name. The controlling terminal is identified in the "TT" or "TTY"
column of the ps output. Whenever this is found in a process entry, the
process is a daemon.

Daemon processes usually do not accumulate very much CPU in the short run,
unless they have a lot of processing to do when they start. It usually takes a
tremendous amount of time for these daemons processes to equal the CPU
requirements that many other processes accumulate in a minute or two.

The daemon processes shown in the ps output were likely started as part of the
system's boot process.

It is important to consider that the startup procedures of the various Unix
flavors often are very different depending upon the heritage. SunOS 4.1.x, for
example, is derived from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) code and as
such bears little or no resemblence to the startup procedure seen in Solaris
2.x, which is based upon the Unix System Laboriatories Unix Systen V Release
4.

The same is true when comparing Unix System V Release 3.2 and 4.0. These
differences are important to note, because they make it easier to hide
inconspicuous programs for later action.

The HP-UX startup sequence makes use of a large number of files, each of which
are tightly linked to a given subsystem. For example, the file netlinkrc is
used to start network processes. With this type of startup file layout, it is
much harder to locate the daemons and to modify the system startup procedure.

Regardless of the Unix implementation being considered, the use of the
/etc/rc/ file start the system is common. Consider the list of files required
to start the daemons on an SCO OpenServer 5.0 system.

SCO Unix products use a file system structure that is grouped by the desired
run level. Run levels, their meanings, and how to switch between them.

Like the HP-UX implementation, a number of SCO Unix startup scripts are used
to start daemons. Each script essentially is dedicated to starting the daemons
for a specific function group. This is not nessessarily bad design, but it
requires a detailed level of understanding of the underlying system structure.

Examining the System Daemons.

A number of system daemons can exist in a Unix system. Some are only found in
a specific version of Unix, but many daemons are common to all versions of
Unix. This section discussess many of the common daemons and describes their
function on the system.

init

The init daemon is known as the parent process for all the processes on the
system. It performs a broad range of functions that are vital to the operation
of a Unix system.

The most commonly known purpose of the init process is to boot the system. The
method init uses to boot the system differs among Unix versions. The BSD and
XENIX init programs, for example, do not work the same way as the System V
implementation. The System V init program relies on the file /etc/inittab/ to
provide details of how init is to govern the startup and initialization of the
various services on the system. The init process is commonly known as "init"
because of its role in the initialization of various processes during system
operation.

The init program considers the system to be in a run level at any given time.
Run levels are the operating states of the system. For the purposes of this
section, a run level can be viewed as a software configuration; each
configuration allows only a selected group of processes to exit.

swapper

Some Unix system administrators refer to swapper as a daemon, and others do
not. The swapper process is responsible for scheduling the use of memory by
the various processes on the system. The swapper process is actually part of
the kernel, so you could say that it is not a daemon after all.

update and bdflush

Update and bdflush are similar commands that periodically executes the sync
system call to flush disk buffers. These daemons execute every 30 seconds.
Users and system administrators rely on these daemons to update the file
system in case of a crash. Although two commands are listed, your system will
see one or the other, but rarely both.

lpd

The lpd daemon is part of the BSD print services. It listens for and accepts
connections via TCP/IP to submit a print request. The lpd daemon relies on the
LPD protocol to accept the job, and submit it to the requested printer. This
daemon was almost exclusively found on BSD-based systems until the more
popular System V derivatives started adding similar services.

lpsched

The lpsched daemon is the System V version of the print spooler. It performs
the same tasks as the BSD lpd program, but in a much different format. Despite
lpsched's inability to communicate directly via the LPD protocol, it is still
considered stronger than lpd because of its flexibility with printer interface
scripts.

cpd and sco_cpd

The cpd and sco_cpd daemons are the license managers for SCO products. They
are similar to license managers on other implementations of Unix in that they
ensure that all products on the local network have unique serial numbers. With
the release of SCO OpenServer 5.0, the license managers support shrink-wrapped
software and operating system software.

cron

The cron daemon is the automated task scheduler; it runs scheduled jobs at the
requested time. A user may want to execute a number of jobs at regular
intervals, for example. To do this, a crontab file is created resembling the
following:

0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/stats/bin/getstats border1.ottowa
0 3 * * 0 /usr/stats/bin/merge border1.ottawa
0 4 * * 0 /usr/stats/bin/ar border1.ottawa

This specification identifies when the job is to be executed and what the
command to be executed is. The cron daemon builds an internal list of the jobs
to be executed, and runs them at the requested time intervals.

syslog

The syslog daemon is a UDP/IP service that allows information and status
messages for different network services to be logged through a central logging
mechanism. The syslog daemon is controlled through the file /etc/syslog.conf
and can write messages of different types into different log files. A sample
syslog.conf file is shown here:

user.*            /usr/log/user_logs
kern.*            /usr/log/kernel_logs
daemon.*          /usr/log/messages
mail.debug        /usr/log/mail

etc. etc.

The syslog.conf file lists the facility priority level of the messages, and
where that message is to be stored when received. Any message that is received
with a priority level of critical, for example, is written to the file
/usr/log/critical.

sendmail

The sendmail daemon is the common Mail Transport Agent included with current
versions of Unix. Because this program is a daemon, it listens for and accepts
incoming e-mail connections from external systems. This daemon receives and
subsequently delivers messages to local or remote users. Sendmail is not
intended to function as a user interface, but rather as the processing agent
for user mail programs such as elm, pine, mailx, and mush.

The sendmail program functions in two modes: incoming and outgoing. It accepts
mail from internal and external sources and processes it according to the
rules found in the /etc/sendmail.cf configuration file. The format of and
options for the /etc/sendmail.cf configuration file are far too complex to
cover here.

The sendmail program is capable of accepting TCP/IP connections on port 25.
The following output illustrates a connection to sendmail on this port.

nms% telnet nms 25

The system administrator can test his or her configuration from the sendmail
command directly. Unfortunately, this capability can also be used by the way
the wily hacker to create a false mail message that looks like it came from
somewhere else.

getty

The getty daemon is responsible for providing a login prompt on terminals and
on serial devices directly connected to the system; getty is also responsible
for providing a login prompton the console. The getty command is started by
the init process, and is part of the login->shell->logout process. It is
important to note that when you log in through telnet, getty is not involved
in the process. The telnet server, telnetd, displays the login message and
collects the user name from the user.

rlogind

The rlogind daemon is the server side to the client rlogin program. It
provides a remote login facility with authentication based on priviledged port
numbers and hostname-username pairs. rlogind is executed by the Internet
daemon, inetd, when it receives a service request at the port indicated in the
services database for login using the TCP/IP protocol.

deliver

The deliver daemon manges all mail delivery in the MMDF mail system. deliver
does not only deliver mail directly, but instead calls on MMDF channel
programs to handle actual delivery.deliver's actions are guided by the MMDF
configuration file, /usr/mmdf/ mmdftailor, and by command-line options. This
daemon also maintains a cache of host information on a perchannel basis, so
that mail for unavailable hosts can be skipped until the host is available.

inetd

The inetd daemon listens on multiple ports for incoming connection requests.
When it receives a request, inetd spawns the appropriate server. The use of a
"super-server" allows other servers to be spawned only when needed and to
terminate when they have satisfied a particular request. The following servers
are normally started by inetd: fingerd, ftpd, rexecd, rlogind, rshd, talkd,
telnetd, and tftpd. inetd can also start several internal services: these are
described in inetd.conf, which is typically found in the /etc directory. Do
not arrange for inetd to start named, routed, rwhod, sendmail, pppd, or any
NFS server.

routed

The routed daemon is invoked by root at boot time to manage the Internet
Routing Tables (usually during init 2). The routed daemon uses a variant of
the Xerox NS routing Information Protocol to maintain up-to-date kernel
Routing Table entries. If the host is an internetwork router, routed
periodically supplies copies of its Routing Tables to hosts and networks that
are directly connected.

nfsd

The nsfd daemon starts the NFS server daemons that hande client file system
requests the nsfd daemon is a user application entry point into the
kernel-based NFS server.

mountd

The mountd daemon is an RPC server that responds to file system mount
requests. It reads the file /etc/exports to determine which file systems are
available to which machines and users. This daemon also provides information
regarding clients with mounted file systems. This information can be printed
using the showmount command.

pcnfsd

The pcnfs daemon is an RPC server that supports ONC clients on PC (DOS, OS/2,
and MAC) systems. There are two implementations of the PC-NFS protocol:
Version 1 and Version 2. Version 2 supports extended printing features. It
reads the configuration file /etc/pcnfsd.conf if present, and then services
RPC requests directed to program number 150001. Many releases of the pcnfsd
daemon support both version 1 and version 2 of the pcnfsd protocol.

statd, rpc.statd

The statd and rpc.statd daemons are RPC servers that function as the RPC
status monitor. It interacts with the lockd server to provide crash and
recovery functions for the locking services on NFS. It is common to see either
statd or rpc.statd but not both on your system.

lockd, rpc.lockd

The lockd daemon processes lock requests that are either sent locally by the
kernel or remotely by another lock daemon. lockd forwards lock requests for
remote data to the server site's lock daemon. lockd then requests the status
monitor daemon, statd or rpc.statd, for monitor service. The reply to the lock
request will not be sent to the kernel until the status daemon and the server
site's lock daemon have replied.

--------------------------------


HOW TO ELIMINATE SECURITY THREATS
The majority of successful attacks on computer systems via the Internet can
be traced to exploitation of one of a small number of security flaws. Most of
the systems compromised in the Solar Sunrise Pentagon hacking incident were
attacked through a single vulnerability. A related flaw was exploited to break
into many of the computers later used in massive distributed denial of service
attacks.

DNS SECURITY IN AUSTRALIA
Australian Internet security company DeMorgan released a document which is
revealing the state of DNS security within Australia at the present moment.
The reult - "Of the total number of servers tested, 75% were discovered to be
vulnerable to DoS attacks though misconfigurations and/or inappropriate version
of bind being used whilst 52% were discovered to be vulnerable to root
compromise from inappropriate version of bind being used". Thanks to Craig
Wright for sending in the papers.

HACKERS AS A RESOURCE
Earlier this month, Kevin Mitnick told CIO magazine that hiring hackers is the
best way for companies to learn about security threats. The magazine says its
poll of corporate CIOs found nearly one in three willing to hire Mitnick to
advise them on security preparedness.

LINUX 101: BASIC NETWORK SECURITY
"Enterprise-wide security strategies require far more explanation than I can
possibly include in a 101 series (or even a single article), so I'll just run
through a simple method of locking down a machine on a LAN that is not behind
a firewall and that needs quick and cheap protection from unwanted guests. Oh
yes; I'll also keep in mind you'll be doing so with limited Linux knowledge."

Security issues
----------------------

IE 5 Cross-frame security vulnerability
Internet Explorer 5.01 under Windows 98 (suppose all other versions are also
vulnerable) allows circumventing "Cross frame security policy" by accessing
the DOM of documents using JavaScript, IFRAME and WebBrowser control.
This exposes the whole DOM of the target document and opens lots of
security risks. This allows reading local files, reading files from any host,
window spoofing, getting cookies, etc
Link: http://net-security.org/cgi-bin/bugs/fullnews.cgi?newsid960370966,4557,



Kdelibs vulnerability for setuid KDE applications
There is a very serious vulnerability in the way KDE starts applications that
allows local users to take over any file in the system by exploiting setuid
root KDE application. The only vulnerable application shipped with OpenLinux
is kISDN, but third party software might be vulnerable too.

ANOTHER YAHOO GLITCH
For the third time in recent months, Yahoo has acknowledged software glitches
that have compromised the integrity of people's accounts. In the current
instance, "My Yahoo" account holders found themselves shut out of their
accounts, in some cases finding that other people had signed up successfully
with their usernames.

SECURITY FLAW IN PGP 5.0
A flaw has been found in the randomness gathering code of PGP 5.
PGP 5 will, under certain well-defined circumstances, generate public/private
key pairs with no or only a small amount of randomness. Such keys are insecure.

SETTING UP PORTSENTRY
"So what exactly does this Portsentry do and why do you need it? Well,
Portsentry is this very very cool security application.. Not good enough?
Alright, that's fair. What Portsentry does is it listens on the ports you are
not using for port scans. When it detects a scan, depending on how you set it
up, it will then add them to your hosts.deny file and drop them through either
ipchains or the route command. What this does is as soon as the person scanning
you trips Portsentry, your computer stops responding to them..."

IS PKI SECURE ENOUGH?
If e-commerce is a hot subject, then so is public key infrastructure (PKI). But
what value does PKI really have? If you ask some experts, the answer is little
value if any, and the cited reasons are many. Read the whole article on Win NT
Magazine.

"THEORETICAL ISSUE"
Microsoft responded to a security flaw reported by @Stake's L0pht Research Labs.

RUNNING A BSD-BASED FIREWALL
Internet security is currently a hot topic. Because of that, many smaller
networks are turning toward firewalls to give them some protection. Many of
these networks do not have the money to pay for a commercial firewall product,
so they are moving to free Unix-based firewalls such as IP Firewall, IP Filter
or IPChains.

LEESBURG, FL û May 22, 2000 û Network Associates McAfee Virus Scan, a leader in
the anti-virus software industry, recently repealed its unjust ban of NetBus Pro
2.10, a remote administration tool by UltraAccess.net. McAfeeÆs change in
attitude toward NetBus Pro 2.10 was not the result of backroom negotiations, but
rather upon the advice of McAfeeÆs own legal counsel, according to Judd Spence,
CEO of UltraAccess Networks Inc. Mr. Spence sees this as the first step in the
vindication of NetBus Pro 2.10 among the anti-virus companies.

Issue 13 - 20.05.2000

"New Love" is a new Visual Basic Script worm with a very damaging payload. Once
executed, it tries to spam itself to all users in the Microsoft Outlook address
book. When the worm is first run it drops a copy of itself in the Windows folder
as either a name from the Recent Documents folder or a random Name and has a
random extension chosen from Doc, Xls, Mdb, Bmp, Mp3, Txt, Jpg, Gif, Mov, Url,
Htm, Txt and the real extension, ".vbs" The worm will modify that copy by adding
random comments to its body. AV companies say that it is not spread around on
the Internet (at least not yet).
