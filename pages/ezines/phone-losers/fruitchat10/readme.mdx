FruitWare Live Chat version 1.01
by RedBoxChiliPepper, January 1998
----------------------------------

Here's the basic instructions for installation:

1. Unzip all the files in a directory.

2. Open CHAT_INPUT.HTM and change the line that points to the perl
   cgi to suit your needs.

3. Open the FRUIT_CHAT.PL file and modify the list of settings near the 
   top to match your system and make sure the very first line of the
   script points in the right direction.

4. Upload FRUIT_CHAT.PL into your cgi-bin directory. Upload all the
   other chat files into the directory you specified in the script
   settings.

5. CHMOD everything to 777, just to be safe.

6. That should do it. Now run the chat.htm file and you should be set to
   chat. It is VERY important that you don't delete anything out of the
   file called CHATPAGE.HTM - My script looks for 25 lines in that file
   and if there's anything less than 25 lines, you'll get a server
   error. 

7. Also, don't modify the perl script with DOS edit. That editor does
   something weird to any script, making it not work.

8. For updates of this script, visit    http://www.phonelosers.org/fruitchat.htm. If you look at the script
   you'll notice that it's just thrown together and some new features
   are already in the making. Expect an update any decade now.
